I fell in love with style and color. Wanted something I could slip out to store or mailbox without shoes socks and boots thing, quick and convenient. They are well made and useful, but caution they run very short. I got the large 9/10 . If you have a long foot it is going to hang out. I wouldn't go up a size than it will be too wide. Otherwise they are fine. Will not fit 10 1/2 for sure. Not going to return too much trouble. Have found go up a size is too big and these don't even come in xl.
