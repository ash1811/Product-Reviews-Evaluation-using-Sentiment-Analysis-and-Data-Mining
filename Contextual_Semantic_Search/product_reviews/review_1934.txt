I just got these the other day, and they're even more beautiful than I expected! I like smaller hoops, and these were the exact right size for me. Very shiny, lovely yellow gold shade (not brassy), and the closures are nice and secure. If you're looking for a lovely pair of small hoops, these are the ones for you! The price was very reasonable, and shipping was fast.... I'm very happy with this purchase!
