The fabric is very thin, and simple weave.  The fabric thickness might be okay for small sizes, say 32" or smaller, but is disproportionate for anyone bigger.  These are very much NOT work pants.Also, it's very tight in the front for pocket access.  These are more designed to show off your rear than to be comfy.I recommend the 569 "Loose Fit" style, or Wranglers' Relaxed Fit for comfortable daywear with a little fabric heft.
