Maybe it's because I am so bust-heavy. I ordered a bra a size larger than my normal size because of the sizing comments. NO WAY! This thing didn't even come close to fitting correctly. I need this for my job. Genetics was not kind to me in the bust department so I have to resort to trial and error for bras. This is too expensive and a waste of time if you are rather large.
