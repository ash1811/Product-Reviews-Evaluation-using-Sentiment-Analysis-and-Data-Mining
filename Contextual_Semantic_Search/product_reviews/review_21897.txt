I love this swim diaper.  I wish I had known about it sooner.  After realizing that the disposable diapers don't absorb anything and are basically poop catchers, I was amazed to find that this swim diaper really does absorb.  It's the only diaper our local swim club will allow.  We use ours all the time, and it washes great.  I tried the swimways swim diaper before this, and the iplay diaper is definitely the better option.
