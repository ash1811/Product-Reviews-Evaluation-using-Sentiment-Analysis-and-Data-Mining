What a gorgeous nightgown this was.  It fit beautifully and was so feminine and lovely. Unfortunately, it was misadvertised under cotton nightgowns, but it was nylon, and nylon doesn't breathe and is hot to sleep in.  I reluctantly sent it back, knowing I'd roast in it at night. It was sold by an outside merchant who charges a restocking fee, and arm wrestles you a little about it. So from now on, I'm only going to buy straight from Amazon, where they don't hastle you on returns and refund the whole amount, and pay the postage.
