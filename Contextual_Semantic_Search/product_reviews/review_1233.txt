I much prefer the wider leg bands and far smaller leg openings in these Lollipop briefs.  Compared to the regular Vanity Fair undies or several other brands, these are definitely the best fitting (they actually cover your butt!) and most comfortable.  They do not seem to shrink when they are washed and the quality of the cotton seems like it will last quite a while.  I did have a problem with the elastic coming loose at the side seam on one pair purchased a while ago but mended it by hand and it has been OK.Younger women might be comfortable in underpants that only cover part of their rear end and/or tummy but for old ladies like me, this style is perfect.  They cover everything I want to have covered, right up to the waist!  In fact, they come up higher than most of my jeans and other casual wear pants, but that's not a problem.I don't think anyone makes a cotton brief that will last 5 or 6 years like I used to buy from Jockey many years ago, but for what you can get these days at a reasonable price I think these are the best buy.
