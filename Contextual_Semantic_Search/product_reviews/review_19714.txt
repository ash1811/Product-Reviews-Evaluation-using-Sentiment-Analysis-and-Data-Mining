This slipper is attractive, well-made, and serviceable.  I wear a 7.5 narrow shoe and ordered down a size and fine the 6.5/7 slipperfits well.  I like the indoor/outdoor sole particularly practical for summer wear when I step outside to pick up the morning paper, etc.The periwinkle color with embroidery in pink is very delicate and goes well with summer nightwear.
