These socks have just the right amount of padding that they fit in all of my walking shoes and provide a lot more comfort for my everyday use. Shoes that were comfortable became even more so and the ones that were lacking became comfy when the Thorlo hiking socks were worn. I ordered Six different brands of padded socks and found that the Thorlo Unisex Wool/Thorlon Thick Cushion Hiking Sock worked the best for my casual footwear.
