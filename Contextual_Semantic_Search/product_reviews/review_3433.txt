That's all I really need to say to women, isn't it? Otherwise, it's your basic great support, well-fitting bra.  Come to think of it, I haven't had one of these in, well, forever. It does give a little Madonna on tour/cone effect but it's pretty slight.  Would I buy it again?  Oh yeah...good straps and comfort are hard to find!
