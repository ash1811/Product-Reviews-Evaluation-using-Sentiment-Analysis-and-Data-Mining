It feels as if you were sitting on a cloud! These are so lightweight and comfy!! I ordered both, this version, and the low rise version. Overall, I like this model better. The low rise version tends to be a little tighter in my opinion. It is expensive, but it is worth it. Just like what they say: "You get what you paid for." I will definitely order more.EDIT: After a couple hours walking with them, these tend to ride up from the back. I am going to try to go a little smaller to see if they will hold in place, but other than that, they are really comfy!EDIT AGAIN: Okay, after a while, these do not hold place and start to become baggy. I do not know if the product I received is not good, but these do not hold place. I will order another to see if it is a quality issue.
