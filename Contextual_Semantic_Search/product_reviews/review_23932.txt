I am not knocking the seller.  I recently got my first batch of contacts and needed some polorized sunglasses to use.  I purchased this set and the quality is awesome, very sturdy.  The only problem I had were that the top of the glasses was low to let light in.  Even though I would raise them high on my nose.  I need some top coverage on my glasses since I drive a lot.  I returned this pair.I purchased Oakley Straight Jackets and that pair I love.
