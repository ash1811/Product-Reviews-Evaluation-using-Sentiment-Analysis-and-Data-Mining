I'm not the guy who spends this much on 1 pair of sox but these are some pretty sturdy, comfy, well fitting toe wraps right here - little tight at the top to start but after a few miles it felt like I had put a new pair of sole replacements in my bootsWent on YouTube to get their input and these puppies rated very high and well deserved.Tough while making every step comfortable - warm without weight and bulk - &#34; no sweat &#34; technology is really what it says it is - ( no more stinky feet by the campfire attracting bugs ) - glad I did the research and glad I pushed the button on this purchase - high quality, heavy duty, stylish, comfortable, warm, good selection,  good vendorMy dogs are not barkin after puttin on these puppies5 stars and 2 thumbs up
