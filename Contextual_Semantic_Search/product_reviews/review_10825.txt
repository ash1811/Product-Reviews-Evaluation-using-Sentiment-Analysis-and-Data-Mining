These shoes look sharp and wear well after an initial break in period.  One warning, the sizing seems to be on the small size.  And when you get the shoes out of the box they are very stiff, which isn't uncommon for some dress shoes, but these seem extraordinarily stiff.  Add that to the small sizing and you may encounter a fit problem.  My suggestion is to order the shoes about a half size larger than you typically wear.
