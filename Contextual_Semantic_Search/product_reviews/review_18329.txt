I bought these for my husband based on the good reviews here. He has a little bit of a wide foot, so I ordered a 10 wide, thinking he'd be able to wear them with or without socks. Well, when they arrived, my husband could barely get his foot into it. Once he did (without socks) his foot looked like a sausage in a casing inside the slipper! He said the bottoms weren't very well cushioned either, and the soles are not very flexible at all. We had to return them. I paid a bit more and ordered him some Uggs instead. Hopefully they'll be a better fit and quality...
