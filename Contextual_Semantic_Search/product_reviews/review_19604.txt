I bought these for my brother because he wanted Timberlands.  I did not realize when I ordered these that they were the exact same style as he already had in black (THESE ARE BROWN).  However, since he was with me when I ordered them, he should have known.  Anyway, he decided to keep them and just use his old ones for work boots and the new ones for everything else.  They did fit perfect and looked ;pretty good and all of the other styles were alot more money, so I think it's a great buy and a great boot for the money.
