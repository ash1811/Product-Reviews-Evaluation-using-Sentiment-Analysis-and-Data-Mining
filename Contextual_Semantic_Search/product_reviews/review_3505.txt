To date these are my favorite stockings - absolutely beautiful lace top and a lovely hand to the leg. The lace is quite substantial though and with many of the tiny buttons on garter belts this can be a problem. If your thighs not thin, go up a size - I always have.However this is a fabulous stocking that fits, wears well, and feels very nice. THe black is a bit darker than I would prefer.
