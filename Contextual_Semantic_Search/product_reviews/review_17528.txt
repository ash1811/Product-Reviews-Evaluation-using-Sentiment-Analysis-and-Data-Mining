I love these ballet flats. Those of you looking for support wouldn't want these; they offer none -- but if you want a good everyday leather flat that is comfy for bunions, this is it. I am a 9.5 medium to wide (because of the bunions) and sometimes a 10, and the 9.5 was too snug both in length and slightly in width. I wore them anyway, because I love the Egyptian Gold color--it's a very soft metallic, and the color does not look cheap. It almost has a very slight peach underdone to it. They will stretch, of course, but if you have long feet, definitely go a full size up. I plan to order more in a size 10, in other colors.
