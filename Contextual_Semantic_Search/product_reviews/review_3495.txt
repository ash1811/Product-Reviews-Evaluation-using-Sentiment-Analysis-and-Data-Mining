I tried several different types of thigh highs and these are by far my favorite!  The fit my XL body great, but so far I haven't gotten more than two wears out of them.  At this rate I won't be able to afford to keep buying them.Pros:Beautiful lace at the top!Nice fitThe stockings look nice, the knit is a nice look/feelCons:Don't seem very durable.
