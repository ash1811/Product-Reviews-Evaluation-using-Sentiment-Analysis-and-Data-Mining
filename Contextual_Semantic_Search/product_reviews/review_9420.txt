I bought them in a size large after reading some of the reviews regarding them running small, I received the large and they are just a bit to tight and therefore have sent them back and have reordered another pair XL, hopefuly they will fit a little better. The material was thin and almost see through but they did feel good and different then the border shorts that I own.  Well update when I get the new ones.....
