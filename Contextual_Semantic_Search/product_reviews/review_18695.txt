I think this is a nice watch for the money.  Its a little smaller than I thought it would be but not a deal breaker.  I work in retail so I've broken a few watches on the corners of shelves or lifting things so I now know better than to wear anything too nice to work and this fits the bill.  It's replacing a timex expedition watch that is still working but the band it torn, and a new band was half the price of the watch.  As others have indicated it does tick loudly but I don't sleep with it so a non-issue for me.
