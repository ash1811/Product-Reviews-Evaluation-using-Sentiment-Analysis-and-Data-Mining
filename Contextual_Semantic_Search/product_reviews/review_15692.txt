These boots are SO cute, I almost wanted to keep them as a decoration.  My niece is 5 and she has wide feet, she usually wears a 10 or 11 but these in an 11, she couldn't even get her foot into the boot.  They were also a little shorter than they were in my head - but that's entirely my fault for not reading the description well.I do think they are made undersized which is my reason for the 4 stars, and I am not reordering a size up because narrow - is narrow .... but for the right little feet, they are the cutest little boots for sure!!
