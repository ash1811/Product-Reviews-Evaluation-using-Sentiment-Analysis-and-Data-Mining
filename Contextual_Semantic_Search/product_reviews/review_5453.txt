This is a nice little watch band. It's got a cheap price and the material feels decent enough to last a while. The holes are reinforced, and the end of the band is slightly burned to prevent fraying, although there is still some small fraying at the end of the band. It's still a nice backup watch strap. Not something I'd replace a quality watch strap with though, just something I'd use as a backup if need be.
