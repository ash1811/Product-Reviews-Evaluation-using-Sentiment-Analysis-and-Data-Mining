These are by far the best of the low-cost, fast-on, medium duty type cleats for street wear. They don't come off, like many others do, they are comfortable to wear, like many others aren't.As far as replacing the cleats, you can use plain old machine screws (I forget the exact size, take one with you to the hardware store and match them up.)These are great. If you want ice cleats, and not CRAMPONS, these are the best to get.
