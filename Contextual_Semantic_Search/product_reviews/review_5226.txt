I love this wallet.  It is the perfect size to hold bills, coins, and credit cards.  I bought this because I already had it in another color and have used it for years.  I was ready for a new wallet and was glad this same one was still available!  The leather and color are nice, too.  If you want a wallet to hold a lot, yet not be too large, this is the one for you!
