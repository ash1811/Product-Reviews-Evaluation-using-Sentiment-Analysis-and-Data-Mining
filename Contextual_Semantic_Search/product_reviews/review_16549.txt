These are the best work pants I've ever had. I really like that there are no flaps over the back pockets. If I'm carrying a utility knife, or scraper, or screwdriver in the back pocket I don't want to have to lift a flap to get at it. I also carry my wallet in one of the cargo pockets and I can't even tell it's in there. I also like the extended range of sizes available. I need my pants long enough to almost drag the ground so that dirt doesn't get into the top of my work boots (hiker style work boots). The material is just heavy enough to be tough, but not so heavy that they feel hot. I tried some fire-hose work pants from Duluth..... couldn't wait to get out of them when I'd get home. Heed the advice from another review.... buy the next-size-up in the waist or you'll be sending them back.
