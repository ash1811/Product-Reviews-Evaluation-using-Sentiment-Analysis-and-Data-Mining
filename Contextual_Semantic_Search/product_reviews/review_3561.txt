If you must wear support hose of the medical grade, then you know exactly how "lovely" they can look and what a "wonderful" soft hand their materials typically have -- heavy sarcasm intended! ;-)  These socks, though, are ACTUALLY SOFT!  You can rub them against your skin and they feel GOOD!  The support is excellent - graduated from foot through ankle and the calf.  They fit extraordinarily well - no wrinkly ankles or baggy toes with which to fight.  The length is PERFECT for anyone close to average height.What makes these socks truly outstanding is the coolmax - it really works to wick moisture from your feet. The other great feature is the actual knit of the sock, which is cushioned - These are NOT the thin, flat-knit, faintly-ribbed support socks you may be used to wearing.  They actually feel like real athletic socks, and they LOOK like them, too. There is a shorter version for those who don't need support through knee height (or farther...). The knee-high version is definitely worth every cent. I just ordered 3 additional pairs in white and am searching for a colored version of these as well, now.
