Because of this ring's thickness and its open design, I was worried about sizing. Now that I've got it, I can say that the metal is really too strong for easy adjustability, but because it doesn't form a closed, regular circle, it conforms comfortably to multiple fingers. I got my usual size 6, which fits best on my middle finger, and slightly loose but still OK on my index and ring fingers. Therefore my two cents' worth is to buy your usual size (instead of sizing up, which is sometimes necessary for thick rings).The actual colours of the stones are perhaps a little lighter than depicted in the online picture, but otherwise, what you see is what the ring is like. It matches a large range of outfits, dresses up your hand and is pretty without being girly. It makes a definite statement without needing to shout. The band, though thick, doesn't create any major tactile problems because it is smoothly curved and shifts obligingly when you need to clench your hand. The overall quality looks decent and I have hopes that it'll hold up over time. It comes in a simple black box and just needs a ribbon in order to be gift-ready.
