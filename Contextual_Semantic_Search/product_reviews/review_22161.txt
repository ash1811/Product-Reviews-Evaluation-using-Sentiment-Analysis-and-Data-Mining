For a big and tall pant, this is an awful fit.  I wear a 44W x 34L, so I was glad to find that Amazon carried Docker's in this size.  Saves a trip to the mall.  Price seemed good.  When I got these pants I was very disappointed.  While the fit in the waist and length were tight on, the butt and the thights were sized like a skinny jean a teenage boy might wear.  Not at all the fit I was expecting.  Very misleading.  I have bought the "signature" khaki through JC Penney in their stores tons of times so I thought I was getting the same thing with a nice comfortable fit, you know, the things dockers are know for.  I was really disappointed that amazon would not reimburse the shipping saying that incorrect fit is not their problem.  I told them it was a case of incorrect descriptions, but they didn't care.  How the hell did they win for best customer service a couple years ago?  I don't see it.  Don't buy these unless you a tall fat guy who wants a really tight pair of pants.
