This sneaker was exactly as I expected, in terms of appearance, but it was very small and narrow. I ordered the equivalent of a US men's 8D (I thought), but this shoe was more like a 7B. Could not get my foot into it. I think this will be the last time I try to buy a shoe online, because the last two times I tried, the sizing was off. Seems like the shoe makers could hold a meeting and agree on sizing standards, like is done with electric wire, light bulbs, etc.
