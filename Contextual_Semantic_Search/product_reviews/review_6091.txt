(4.5 stars)Van Heusen makes an excellent "Men's Wrinkle Free Poplin Solid Short Sleeve Shirt." The style of the shirt collar makes it perfect for the office, dressy casual occasions and even school uniforms; and this will last guys forever with the proper care. The poplin fabric is made of 65% cotton and 35% polyester and this is essentially permanent press. Therefore, as long as you don't leave it in your clothes dryer too long after drying you'll never need to iron it at all! Although they say the shirt is wrinkle free; it could have a few very slight wrinkles if left in the clothes dryer for a few hours after the drying cycle is finished. In that case you might have to very briefly iron it. On the bright side again, the color of the shirt rarely--if ever--bleeds onto any other items that may be washed or dried along with it. Great!The quality of the stitching is wonderful. The shirt sleeves never fray at the edges and the bottom of the shirt is nicely stitched as well. Of course, the collar is very well made and it gives gents a great look.I also like that these shirts are currently available in your choice of several colors and sizes. The shirts come in sizes between 15 and 18.5; this does help some big and tall men out there and of course this shirt comes in sizes that will fit the majority of guys out there. Van Heusen really should make this shirt in one or two sizes more for big and tall men; for that I will take off one-half of a star to make this a four and one-half star review.Overall, I highly recommend this wrinkle free, poplin solid color short sleeve shirt for guys by Van Heusen. These shirts are remarkably long lasting. They really don't wrinkle thanks to the cotton/polyester fabric which is permanent press; and they give gents a great "look" at a relatively affordable price.
