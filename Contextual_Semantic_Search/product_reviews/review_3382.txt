I happen to be a guy, so some will think buying and wearing these panties is strange. I just love these panties. The fit is great, they are lightweight, dry fast, and pack in a suitcase taking up little space. I never used the "fly" portion of men's underwear and never was thrilled with boring cotton, especially in the summer, so these panties are perfect for me!Vanity Fair Women's 3-pack Perfectly Yours Ravissant Premium Tailored Nylon Brief Panties #15712
