saw great amount of reviews for these hiking/casual boots so i got them. i love them but 4 star i wish other colors were avalible in my size but im fine with noir color. i wore them out for walking but not hiking yet seemed to be comfortable so far. it might get hot tho since there are no vents on the boots but im not going to cry about it. i also checked timberland web site and didnt have any color either so is this discountinued?
