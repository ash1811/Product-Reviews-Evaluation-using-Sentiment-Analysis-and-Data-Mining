When I first put these shoes on they screamed quality and sturdiness. I knew that they were going to last me for quite a long time. The price was also a plus since the adult sizes are a good 30 dollars more expensive. I am a women's 7.5 and got a kids 6 and it fit perfectly with a little bit of wiggle room.Timberland boots are making a comeback in the style trend. Numerous celebrities are pairing them up with skinny jeans or tights and they just add a nice touch to any wardrobe. They are very attractive and you can't go wrong with them for casual wear.Something I must not is that your must wear thick socks with these. I tend to get blisters on my feet if I don't. I must also not that these boots will wear down your feet. After wearing them for 8 hours walking a good bit, my feet felt like they were about to fall off from the rest of my body. If you are doing a lot of walking around you might need to reconsider your desire to buy these.In the end, I am highly satisfied with these shoes. They are just great and durable!
