When I first got the boots I was not sure I was going to like them. I wore them around the house (inside) to get a feel for them. I normally order a wide boot but I took a chance on ordering the Medium width and they fit great. My only complaint is I wish the last two holes both had the speed hook as the second hole does, but not the last. But other than that, the boot feels great and I love the light weight.WM
