I have two pairs-one for work and one for home. I bought the first pair for work and 3-4 months later I ordered my second pair for home because they are so comfortable. I didn't feel like I needed to 'break them in'. I am on my feet for 12hours as a nurse and my work shoes are still comfy 6+ months later. I would buy them again.
