Fabric quality less than expected, lighter weight, but what should have I expect for 65% polyester.. Fits well  with a reasonable 6 in inseam, not those huge baggy inseams that are popular with the teenyboppers. With my short legs, I prefer even a 4 or 5 inch inseam. It is hard to find something in shorts that doe not make me look infantile.
