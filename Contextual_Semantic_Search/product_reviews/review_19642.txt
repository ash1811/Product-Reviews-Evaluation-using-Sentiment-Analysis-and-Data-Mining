I wear my boots for outdoor work.  The boot has been very comfortable right from the start.  The soles have good grip on dry grasses ... a substrate with the slickness of Teflon on the wrong sole.  I suspect that the first thing to give out will be the laces; the bungee kind of loose thread. Otherwise, I find these boots to be of fair value for the price.
