This is my second pair of these. I totally killed my first pair wearing them almost 24/7 for 3 months walking all over SE Asia. They were totally comfortable and finally gave up the &#34;squishy&#34; ghost about 2.5 months in and got a bit flattened. Till then they were the best pair of flip flops I have ever owned. I love that the part between the toes is cloth and soft and doesn't irritate between my toes. No &#34;break in&#34; period needed. The brown's almost exactly as the picture shows.Be careful, they got a slight bit slippery on wet slick ground.
