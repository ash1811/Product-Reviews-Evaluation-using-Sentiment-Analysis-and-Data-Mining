This "was" a great purchase - I thought. But after less than a year, the watch band broke. This IS covered by the warranty, but the customer service person at Seiko was a nightmare. She said that the watch band was obviously twisted, and basically, called me a liar. Nice Seiko! Good way to treat your customers!!
