I purchased this hat to use when riding my TerraTrike and hiking.  The had is top notch.  Very well constructed with no loose ends etc.......  The fabric feels nice and the hat is what I would call a low rider....meaning you do not have a huge top .......I have tried some other outdoor light weight hats and while they were nice they tended to be a little overdone.  A huge brim or a huge cap..... This hat is just right.  I wear a size 8 in official MLB hats..... this is the only truly fitted cap I wear and that size is just a little too big.This XL hat goes down over my big head and when pressed far down the top of my head is actually in contact with it....Which is what I want.  Do not want it blowing away.  You can tighten the leather strap under you chin or you can use it the way I do....as a way to hold the hat on the back of my neck/back when I want to take it off for a short time.Very pleased.  This is my second Henschel hat...the other being the all leather variety.Henschel does not sell direct so I got this one from a company on Amazon called.....Work Wear savings.  In the box they included a fee sample of Allegra and a packet of coupons.....I only saw one thing that interested me.... BUT on the packet there is a coupon code for 10 bucks off on a 99 dollar purchase.  Not bad.....I am off to scope out the sportsman guide web site now.
