My husband wears a 9 - 9.5 so purchased the size 9.5 in these shoes.  The style is great, as is the brown color, but they were too small.  He has narrow feet but had a hard time getting his foot into the shoe.  I guess shoes are something you really have to try on yourself for the proper fit.  Returning them but sad to do so because they were a great price, great brand, and great style.
