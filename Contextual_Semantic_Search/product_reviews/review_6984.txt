I really like these socks.  It's hard to find sweat-absorbent, athletic socks that have no toe seam.  These and the Under Armor socks are the only ones i could find that are &#34;seamless&#34; in this regard. These are slightly heavier in a nice way.  While there is a line where the toe seam is, it's not a bump that can cause blisters like most socks.  These are exactly what I was looking for.
