I've owned many pairs of Minnetonka Moccasins, all of them Size 7 and perfect. I still have some of those and they fit, but, for the first time, these Size 7s run shorter. Still made in same country as my most recent pair, in the Dominican Republic. Maybe a new manufacturer there? I don't know where earlier Minnetonka Moccasins I've owned through the years were made, but Size 7 always fit perfectly before these.My toe will push the tip forward unattractively before the shoe should wear out, and then, maybe, I'll order 7 1/2.My feet haven't changed. All other shoes from years past fit fine.Also, these inner soles aren't as cushioned as older ones were.
