You know, among all the swimwear that is on a smaller/shorter side, this is is the most comfortable and more modest (I picked black color though).Consider the lycra shorts made by Nike and Speedo, they are slightly smaller (and shorter) and also squeeze your belongings a little tight. In this ones you can stay in them longer with the comfort.Just to confirm, they are shorter than on the picture. The guy is probably wearing one size bigger than his.
