After receiving and wearing my first order of these socks for a while, I went back online and just ordered some more. They feel like they are of a very high quality, are very thick, and extremely comfortable.One note, if you are trying to determine size. I normally wear a size 12-13 shoe so I thought that maybe the King size would fit too large (listed as a 13-15), but they fit just right. I think they would fit a size 11 right too, but I'm not sure how a 15 would get in cause they don't stretch that much and fit me perfectly.At about two bucks a pair right now, I doubt you'll find better socks for less. I haven't.
