I bought this for a two week trip, and it has to be the most convenient shower kit I have ever had. It held all my showering needs, plus makeup, toothbrush, toothpaste, etc. I love the plasic lined pocket to prevent any leaks from being spread outside the bag, or into other compartments. The hook is invaluable, as I hung it next to the bathroom mirror. It packs super flat, and that saved me room in my bag. This is as awesome as everyone says it is, and possibly more! As a bonus, the eggplant color is really cute!
