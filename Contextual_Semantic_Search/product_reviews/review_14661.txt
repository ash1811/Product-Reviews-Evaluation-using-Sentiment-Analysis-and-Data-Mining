My grandson wanted a Buzz Lightyear costume so I could wear my witch outfit and he could be Buss and we could fly all over Oklahoma City and scare everybody on Halloween. And we DID. He had all the gear and I had a new broom and we did it up right! He was the envy of all his friends in kindergarten with his gloves and backpack. I couldn't get the gloves locally. This was a godsend and they were less than they would have been at the costume shop in Dallas, shipping and all.
