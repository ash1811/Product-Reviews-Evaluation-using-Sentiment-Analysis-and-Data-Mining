These are my favorite kind of socks from my favorite brand, I've tried Hanes, Smartwool, and Thorlos, and for everyday use, Gold Toe Crew takes it.  That's sneakers, work boots and hiking boots. they aren'y magic though, much more than 8 hours straight, and you'll start having unfaithful thoughts.  But like I said, everyday/light use (if you get to sit for more than half of your day) can't beat them
