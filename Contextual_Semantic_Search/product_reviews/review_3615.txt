My son will only wear the Levi 505 straight leg jeans.  They fit him to a tee.  He has other jeans, but they hang in his closet and he only wears them as &#34;work&#34; jeans.  I got these at a better price throught Amazon than I could find locally.  Thanks Amazon for your quick delivery before Christmas on a late order on my part.
