I bought these for my husband for Christmas-he wears 10's in everything else  FRYE shoes and UGG slippers for reference) but these boots were really quite large-about an inch too long. We are trying half a size down the second time around.Otherwise, really classy, not a lot of support, but that's typical of these types of shoes. One thing to note, it seems like the idea behind the shoe finish is to give them a nice worn look, you bend the toes once and it leaves a lighter mark around the crease.  This is exactly the look my Husband likes, but if you want a clean, crisp boot, just be aware these may not be it!
