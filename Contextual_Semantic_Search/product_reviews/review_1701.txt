The quality of this item is very good, the reason I rated it 3 stars is because it is very hard to size these correctly.  I've just ordered my third pair, hopefully these will be right.  I went to the carhartt website and ordered as they suggested, the first pair was too large, the second too small, I hope the third will be just right.  I would suggest you try these on in a store first to get the right size.  Amazon's return policy and quick shipping has been top notch, the only thing is I have to return and re-order rather than return for an exchange.Edit:  Well the third pair did not fit me like I would have liked, but it will have to do.  Try these on before you buy.
