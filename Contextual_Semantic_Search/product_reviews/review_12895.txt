Call me old-fashioned, but I am not interested in acid-washed, pre-softened, skin-tight or fancy-pocket blue jeans.  Give me American-made, traditional cut, no frills, thick denim blue jeans.  I prefer to wear them in myself.  These are perfect for that.  They are relaxed fit, so there is a little extra room for you, and they are cut to be WORN, not to be "fashionable".  You want comfort and fashion, buy a pair of chinos or dress pants.  I will keep my jeans.
