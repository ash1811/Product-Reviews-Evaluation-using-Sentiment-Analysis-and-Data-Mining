I ordered this before reading all the reviews. When I did read them, i noticed many other women were saying something about the big seam that runs up the middle of this garment. I must say, they did slip on easily and went way up past my bra line. Actually I ordered a size bigger thinking that they would not be as constrictive.  I  wish I would have ordered my usual size or even smaller as they felt way too large and sort of loose fitting. The seam down the middle was kind of noticeable through my tight blouse I was wearing at the time. But it was very comfortable feeling, no binding feeling on my thighs at all and seemed very durable too. It did not make me feel hot, or sweat and did not roll down at all after wearing it all day at work. I also liked the open gusset style. I would recommend this shaper pantie to other women as for comfort and durability but just be aware of the big seam down the middle and advise ordering your regular size or one size smaller maybe.
