I ordered 2 other pairs of slippers with pile linings and had to return both of them.  One was too small due to the lining and one was too big as I overcompensated.  This pair of slippers is just right and so comfy.  I take them to work on the frigid polar weather days in Chicago and feel great. Highly recommend......
