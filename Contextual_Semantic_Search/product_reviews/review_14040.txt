phew... better than going from store to store trying on.  We bought the size we wanted and it is just as expected.  Color was what was shown also.  we bought 33 x 30..  Do have to say for no fat and muscular thin leg, some room at side thigh...but also gives comfortable sitting and using for lots of movement.  The thing is the seat fit nicely and was not draggy.  We are happy.  These darker ones worked and fit well Friday Jeans Day at the office.
