Had the first rain (a tenth of an inch) since I purchased this.  Not sure what water it resists, but it doesn't resist water coming from the sky.  Also the sleeves are not insulated and the thin nylon lining in the sleeves hangs out of the sleeve after putting it on.  Must stuff it back up the sleeve.  For the price it is a reasonable purchase.  I wear it to tend my animals.  No snags in it so far.
