I picked these up for a trip to the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. I wore them on a fairly cold day, when I was walking around quite a bit through the snow. They worked great.They were comfortable, they felt good on my feet, and they kept me warm. They also seemed to let me feet "breathe" - so that I didn't get sweaty when I was indoors.Exactly what I needed.
