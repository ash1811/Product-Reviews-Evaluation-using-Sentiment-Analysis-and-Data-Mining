Lovely to look at but definitely not the same quality shearling-lining on the footbed or comfort as in the past. Each pair gets more expensive and lasts less. My LL Bean shearling slippers are 20 years old and in great shape. UGGS last 1-2  years. Unless the quality improves, this may be my final pair.
