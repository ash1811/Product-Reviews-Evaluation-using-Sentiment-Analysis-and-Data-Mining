If you don't care about the fit, buy it. It's cheap and warm. If you care about quality and the fit, you might want to look for a higher priced columbia fleece. I've tried this on and the fit was just awful. The large on this jacket is way too big....It's like a XXL...I own two other Columbia jackets (more expensive) and the fit is great. This jacket just seems like Columbia made a mistake in the sizes...It seems as if there should be a M and a half...There is a major difference in size between a M and a L...
