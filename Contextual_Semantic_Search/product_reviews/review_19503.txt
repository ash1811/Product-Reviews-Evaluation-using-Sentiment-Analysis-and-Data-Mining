i purchased these boots for my brother a while back because he only wears Timberlands and couldnt find his size in the local store in our country. they arrived well packaged and all but after a few months of wearing them (total of about 12 wearings) he had he strangest complain in all his time as a Tims fan: the body came loose from the sole!!! so that looking down at the boots your could see a crease all the way round-on both boot.he has never before had this problem and we have concluded that these are quite likely fake :(i definitely wouldnt recommend these to anyone- 'cept to say "dont buy these"
