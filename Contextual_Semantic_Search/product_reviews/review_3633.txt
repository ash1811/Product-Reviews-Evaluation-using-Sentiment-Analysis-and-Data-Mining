I don't like the very thin material on these 505 jeans.  I don't think they will be very durable because of it, and I don't recommend for that reason.  Also, the pair I got fits tighter than the Levi's 559 jeans I bought at the same time, and tighter than other 32x32s I now wear.  Color is good, and the cut is what I like, but would not buy again.
