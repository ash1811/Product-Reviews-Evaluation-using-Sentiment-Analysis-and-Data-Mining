I've had Birkenstocks off and on for years and years.  While wearing &#34;sandals&#34; with both feet suffering from Plantar Fasciitis isn't the best option, I've found that Birkenstocks are just about the only sandal I CAN wear when my feet &#34;flare up&#34; --  they still hurt badly at the end of the day, but less so than with my Orthoheel's  and also less than my tennis shoes.  In winter, I just put them on with crazy socks and voila!!  I'm good to go :)  Extremely fast shipping.  Very satisfied with my purchase.
