I wear a 30F or a 32DD, depending on the style and brand. I live in a rural area, so it's next to impossible to find a bra in my size. Finding a bra in my size that fits is very difficult. Finding a bra in my size that both fits and is comfortable is next to impossible!This bra comes close. Oh, how I wish just ONE THING was different: the elastic at the bottom of the band. During the course of the day, it curls a bit and digs into my skin. I've had that happen before, mostly with sports bras, and I find it nearly unbearable after a day's wear. Y'know that feeling at the end of the day when you say, "Oh, I've just GOT to take off my bra!" Well, that's how this is for me. If only the elastic was covered! Why isn't it? Why do most bras have exposed elastic?Well, at this bra's price point I don't mind all that much. This bra fits me perfectly! If I only could wear it for half a day I'd still give it four stars. I love Wacoal's Retro Chic BraWacoal Women's Retro Chic Full Figure Wire. This bra, which has no seaming, fits almost the same. Some people say both bras give one that "pointy look." Yes, they do, but I think it's very flattering.Obviously, I'm not exactly flat chested, but in this bra (and the other) I actually look pretty small, and for some of us, that's a great thing, and something of a relief. This bra has great support in the sides and great uplift. It can be worn over a t-shirt. Now, if Bali would cover that darned elastic, I'd pay twice as much for this bra and buy one in every color! One last thing: the heather pink is more of a pinkish taupe, which is a nice change from boring ol' beige.
