I received this watch from my girlfriend for my birthday and was very impressed with it straight out of the box (before trying it on, more on that later).  It was in my top three G-Shocks that I was considering so I was thrilled that I got it.It is VERY sturdy and well constructed.  The digits are easy to read and the back light is very bright and it allows you to read all functions in low light conditions.  It has some very useful features and multiple alarms with a snooze features.When I put it on this is where things came apart, and I have the same complaints as many others on here.  The textured "nubs" on the back of the watch are AWFUL.  I have thick skin and it is in no way sensitive, but those textured nubs will rub your skin raw.  What an awful idea!  If they were smooth, they would still be bad but the fact that they are textured will grate your skin.  Also, the buttons have far too much resistance.  If you need to navigate through some of the functions, it will leave indentations on your finger because you have to press the buttons so hard.  Not practical.To summarize, the watch was returned within 24 hours for those two cons.  They were so bad that it completely ruined the watch for me.Pros:- Attractive- Relatively lightweight- Sturdy- Legible displayCons:- Horribly uncomfortable- Buttons are too difficult to press
