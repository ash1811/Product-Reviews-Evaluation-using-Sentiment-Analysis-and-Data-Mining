i;v been wearing these for years for work ,they are as expected look great 1st 2months then drop off in comfort and durability 3 and 4th mnth  i get about total of 5 to 6 mnths out b4 they are garbage..but to be expected considering there made in china town where nothing of any quality comes from /so that said if yout spend hundreds on redwings which are made in china now 2 u just get expensive junk work shoes so why bother there all crap..
