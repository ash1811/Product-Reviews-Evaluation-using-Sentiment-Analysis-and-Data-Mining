I bought these for winter so I would have something to trudge through snow while having a bit of fashion. They do the job. They are a little uncomfortable in the way that the seams along the side (where the flaps are) are irritating. The &#34;fur&#34; pulls out a little, but not too bad. This is a pretty durable boot for the price.
