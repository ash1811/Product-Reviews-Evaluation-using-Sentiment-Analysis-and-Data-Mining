I almost did not buy this watch because a reviewer stated it was a "bright glowing purple". But I needed a new watch and decided to go ahead with it.I was very surprised to open the box and find a watch very similar in color to the one shown in the photo. I'm thinking the gentleman who received the purple watch was most likely shipped the wrong item. I'd call the color of a watch a perinwinkle/cornflower blue, at the most. It certainly reads blue from across the room. It's not a "glowing purple" at all. And after a few days in the sun/in chlorine, the color is going to fade a bit. It's impossible to prevent in any watch.In addition to loving the color, I really like the function and design of the watch. Very easy to set (which is a relief compared to the newer watches on the market that require a complex series of button presses that must be executed within a specific time frame), and very comfortable to wear. I love the updated design features of the watchband- I especially love the rounded pewter buckle and the way the wristband "locks" into place under the slider. Most of my Timex watchbands usually wore out before the watch itself did, and I can tell the design improvements are intended to extend the life of the band. Everything is designed to prevent the cracking and friction that causes the band to break, especially for those of us who are going to expose this watch to a lot of chlorine.I swim two miles a day, so I need a watch that's going to hold up well underwater, exposed in chlorine, and used under the sun. The watch is very easy to read, even during quick glances during turns. Easy chrono- starts and stops with the press of a large button on the face.Indiglo is a bonus, too!I sort of strayed away from Timex a few years ago, but I'm really glad I ordered this. I love the design, the really nice color, and the funtionality.
