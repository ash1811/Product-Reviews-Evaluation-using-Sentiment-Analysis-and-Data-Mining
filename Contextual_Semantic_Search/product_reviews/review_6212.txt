I love these things.  I can only give them four stars though.  Occassionally I have slid while wearing them.  I like to walk to work and I live in Wisconsin.  Well getting to work in the winter isn't too bad, there is enough sunlight to see where the ice is.  Walking home on the other hand it is dark.  However, I do not have to give up walking in the winter because I'm afraid of getting hurt.  I strap these bad boys on hold my head up and walk with confidence.  The cleats really are great, they are super easy to replace and they last a long time.  Let's see I walk 2.6 miles a day, 5 days a week and the cleats will last me about 4 months.  Of course that means I change them about once a year.I have taken these hiking as well and I like them for trails that have become compacted ice and trails that are along water and are slippery.
