If you need good support, and are tired of the heavy, unfashionable bras generally available, try Panache. Through some engineering miracle, support meets fashion meets whisks of embroidery and I now have a full collection of Panache's assortment.  I &#34;gravitate&#34; to full coverage (34G) and they are all wonderful.
