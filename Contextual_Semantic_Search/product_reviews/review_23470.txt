This is my second Baggallini of this size.  It holds a lot and is not heavy to carry over the shoulder.  I extend the strap and put over my head and across my body this leaves both hands free and the bag secure.  I don't use all the pockets, but they come in handy for a small tape measure and a pill case.  This is the height of function.
