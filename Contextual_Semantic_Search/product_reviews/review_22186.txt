These are pretty good!  Great for the price, actually.  The fabric is heavier than I expected, but that actually means they look better, so...no problem.  I live where it is HOT in the summer, so I wanted cotton.  I should have gotten tan, but that's my fault.  They are reasonably cool in the heat, and I will be able to wear them throughout our mild winters.I am short and curvy...I carry most of my weight in my hips and bum (5'2&#34; and about 140 lbs, usually wear a size 12 petite); I got the 32R, and they fit well.  They are stretchy enough that you don't feel like you are stuffed into them, but they stay up and move with you well, and so far they have good recovery.
