It's finally time to replace my old Timberland light hiker that I've had for over 20 years.  Yes, about 20 years of solid performance!  I received this new one yesterday with high expectation.  From the initial fitting, it feels just like my old one, no need to break in whatsoever.  Super comfortable and an even better fit that it's available in 2E.  All I can hope for is for this light hiker to last just as long.This is a light trail boot, casual everyday wear that will provide comfort and good looks.  For more serious hike/terrain, I'd recommend something from LOWA.  For hunters, I'd recommend Irish Setters/Red WIngs.This Timberland boot is great value!
