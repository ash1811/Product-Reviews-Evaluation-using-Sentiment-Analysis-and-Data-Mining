Bought a 40DDD. This bra is offensively ugly and clumsy. It has a lot of padding which makes my already large breasts look enormous, The cups are moulded and - of course since it's Playtex - they are pointy. I was stunned at how horrible it looked on. Add to that the fact that the underwire and band are very uncomfortable; they don't lie flat against your body, yet they chafe and rub. I've learned my lesson now. I'll never buy Playtex again.
