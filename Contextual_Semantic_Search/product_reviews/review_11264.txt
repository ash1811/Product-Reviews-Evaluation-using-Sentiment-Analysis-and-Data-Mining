When I was in high school several decades ago, I remember my and my friends' Jansport backpacks being much sturdier-built than this one.  I bought this sight unseen for my nephew just because he specifically asked for this brand backpack for his birthday, otherwise if I were in a store looking for a non-specific-brand backpack I am sure I would not have picked this one.As the previous reviewer noted, the materials and build quality simply do not impress.  I guess Jansport is just living off of its name cachet while outsourcing production to the lowest bidding sweatshops in Asia, like all too many product brands these days.
