It seems to be all that the description says, and construction is perfect.  It is fairly stiff and should be broken in using traditional methods for real leather boots.  It seems to run just a little long and wide in sizing compared to all other brands of boots I have worn. I suppose "2E" really means 2E and not just "E" or Wide, but not so wide as to be a problem with work socks; better a little big than a little tight.  Crawling on concrete, the leather did not scuff noticeably.  For all day on feet, I found the sole lining deficient and arch support weak, so I bought a liner of my own.  Otherwise, I expect a long service life.
