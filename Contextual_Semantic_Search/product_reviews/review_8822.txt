Oh, wait, I have bought these again!I have six pairs of these and wear a pair nearly daily under my work dresses. They are comfortable and do what I need them to do: help with the sheerness of most of my dresses and help with thigh rub. I have found that some of them are tearing where the lace meets the nylon, but those are my older ones (I've had some for nearly a year now).
