I bought these specifically to have something to swing dance comfortable in and they work wonderfully for that. The fit is very true to size and my feet stay nice and cool in the canvas uppers. The sole is thin, but I prefer that - it helps me feel more stable when dancing. Further, they are comfy with or without socks and they're quite cute with casual dresses and capri pants.
