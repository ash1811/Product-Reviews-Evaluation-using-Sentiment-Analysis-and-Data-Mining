I have a lot of Ex-Officio products - they make great travel/outdoor pants and shirts.  I ordered two of these undershirts in medium and they fall short - literally and figuratively.  I am a perfect medium size and 5' 10" tall. While the width around the torso is fine, the length is too short - it barely meets my belt line. I should have studied the catalog photo more closely, you can see for yourself, the proportion indicates a shorter length.
