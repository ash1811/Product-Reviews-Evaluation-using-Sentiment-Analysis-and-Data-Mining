I can see the faint outline of the circles through my bra (or a thin T-shirt).  But these work so well in hiding the nipples.  Must be worn with bra (no adhesive).  They are not completely flat, but have a slight curve to better fit.  The design allows them to mold to whatever shape your breast or bra cup is.  They are slightly thicker than I expected, which is why the outline is visible through the bra, but the thickness hides the nipple well.I'm allergic to latex and have no problems with these disks.I have tried foam inserts but these disks hide the nipple much better.
