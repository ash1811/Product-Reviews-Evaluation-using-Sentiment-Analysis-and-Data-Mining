I have read reviews where people complain about these jeans being too tight and low cut . . . I'm not sure what they are complaining about.  These jeans have a very long rise and are quite baggy.  If Levis reduced the length of the rise I think they should reduce it further.  The fit is roomy though the seat and thigh which is nice for me since I find 501's a bit tight on my legs.
