I bought these shoes for my trip to costa rica for hiking in waterfalls. These shoes  are very comfortable, great support and they manage to look cute as well, highly recommended!  As with any open type sandals you will get sand/rocks in them occasion, but this is no fault of the shoe, hope this helps!
