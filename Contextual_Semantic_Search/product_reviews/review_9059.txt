This review is specific to the black stretch. Normally the standard 511 are my jean of choice, but I decided to try the black stretch. They wear and fit like straight denim, which was nice, but the spandex has broken and &#34;pilled&#34; up across all the fabric. It looks like I'm covered in crumbs that you can't get rid of.The jeans were rendered completely unwearable after only maybe 100 hours of use.
