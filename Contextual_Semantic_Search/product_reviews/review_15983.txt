These are just socks, after all.  I didn't really think they would make a difference, but believe me they do.  I have been running/walking on a treadmill or outside for almost 6 years now.  It started out a couple of miles one or two days a week but now I do about 8 miles daily - sometimes a little more, sometimes less.  Until the last two months I just wore low cut athletic socks from a discount store.  Not super cheap, but not high end either.  Then I started having problems with ankle and heel pain in one foot where I have had injuries before I started running.  I happened to see these socks and bought one pair to try.  They made a tremendous difference in my comfort level.  My socks no longer rubbed in uncomfortable places and my heel pain subsided in time.  They wash well and fit well.  I bought a few more pairs and now I can't imagine running without them.  Two cautions - they do add bulk.  I didn't have to get a different size shoe, but if your shoes are tight already these might not be for you.  Also they are warmer than my other socks.  This isn't a problem in the cold weather (I live in the northeast) but I am not sure how they will be in hot, humid weather.  They seem to absorb moisture now but I might need a lighter version in the summer.  They are definitely worth the price if you run or walk daily and are not really satisfied with your current socks.
