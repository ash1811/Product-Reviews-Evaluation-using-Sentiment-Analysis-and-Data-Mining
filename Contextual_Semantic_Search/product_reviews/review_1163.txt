at first, I was a bit wary about buying them since I have thick thighs & worried that it'd cut into my legs & you'd totally be able to tell I'm wearing them. nope, not with these. I love them. they slim down my legs & love handles enough so I can wear a size lower than what I'd wear without them. easy to manage & they don't really roll down on the top unless I'm hunched over. I just have to make sure that they're pulled down far enough on my legs so they don't make any marks. (size 11/12 jean)
