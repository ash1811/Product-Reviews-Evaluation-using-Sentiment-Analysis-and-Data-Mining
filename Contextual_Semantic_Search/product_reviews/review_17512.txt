My wife discovered Sam Edelman a year ago and found them to be extremely comfortable. She has awkward shaped feet so finding comfortable shoes has always been a challenge. Since discovering this brand, she has bought their flats in multiple styles and colors. She tells me they are well constructed and very stylish too.
