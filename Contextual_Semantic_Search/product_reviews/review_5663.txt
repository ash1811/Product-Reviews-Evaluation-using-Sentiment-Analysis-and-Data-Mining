The jeans are fine but if you are expecting to get the color it shows you (you don't)they are a very dark blue almost purple tige to them like the old 80's ruff skinsso when I bought them and got a color I didn't really think was right I double checkedmy order, my husband doesn't mind so much they are for work, but he does not like the color,going to try and upload a pic (I will put indigo blue) on the pic so you can see for yourself...So they need to update that, I would not have bought them in this color...
