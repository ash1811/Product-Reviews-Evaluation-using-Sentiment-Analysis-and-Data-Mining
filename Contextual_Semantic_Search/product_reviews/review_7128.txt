These are expensive stretch socks.  I am beginning to think that some manufactures have the same size stretch sock and just label them to any size they please.  Just because the sock will stretch to my size foot does not mean the sock is the right size. If the stretch force is pulling the material from the heel then at some point the heel material may very well side off the heel. The socks are going back and I know there are some from Walmart that does not do that.  The ease of buying socks from Amazon Prime is so convenient that it's hard to resist trying some other brand.
