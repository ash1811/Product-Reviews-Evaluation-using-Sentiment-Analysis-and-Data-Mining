This product is great if you want to start corset training.  It's very comfortable compared to other shapers I have tried after my c-sections.  Does not irritate the skin like some other products, easy to forget your wearing it as you go though your normal day.  Do not buy this item one size too small thinking a smaller size will work better.  Buy in your size and it's great!  Offers a bit of back support also.  With those tender stomach muscles cut, it puts extra pressure on the back to compensate, the garment helps with that problem a little.
