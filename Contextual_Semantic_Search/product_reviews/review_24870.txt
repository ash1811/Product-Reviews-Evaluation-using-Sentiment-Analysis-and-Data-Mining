I've been looking to get myself some nice quality items, and one thing I wanted was a nice leather wallet with space for my checkbook and lots of slots for cards.  This wallet gave me everything I was looking for.  I got it in red just to spice things up a bit, and I couldn't be happier with my choice.  This wallet holds all my stuff, and yet is still only half as thick full as my old wallet is empty!  The leather is soft and feels so good!  Great buy!
