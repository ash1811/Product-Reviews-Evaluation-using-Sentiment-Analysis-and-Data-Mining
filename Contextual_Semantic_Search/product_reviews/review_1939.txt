I like rose gold and haven't seen many smaller hoops offered in pink. I have metal allergies and must wear gold, platinum or surgical/implant grade steel.  These hoops do not cause itching or redness.  I can wear them around the clock and bathe in them.  I don't know if the price was a deal, but I'm enjoying the earrings.  Secure clasp keeps them on while sleeping.
