I have lived in 501's since the early 70's. Comfortable!back then, Levis came out with a flared bottom, but was not bell bottoms, but were wider than 501's. they were not todays 517's.They were skinnier or tighter at the knees, and wider at the bottom,but that was the fashion back then.I love 501's. My 'thing' with them was the bottom opening was always so small.ok for tennis shoes, but for wearing boots, they were too small around the ankle, making the entire boot look too long. simply because they were so narrow, the could not go down any lower on the boot.  hahahaI love to wear black biker boots, with a taller 2' heel for easier shifting thru gears. these 517's are wider at the bottom, so the jean bottom rides lower on the boot, only exposing the very top of my round boots, so it looks sexy for a guy. I have had a lot of compliments from mostly women. they seem to like that look for themselves, most people like a smaller foot / shoe profile.The 517's fit the hips, and butt better too. My 501's always make my butt look flat, these give it a little better shape. I work out, and do leg squats, so my butt is not flat! I wear the boots and jeans to work on our 'lax day' Friday.Monday thru Thursday, its business casual, at least for us in the office.This last Friday, I was walking thru the front door, and some guys were kidding me &#34; wheres the guitar?&#34; &#34; you look and dress like a rock star!&#34;  hahahaI love my lighter blue 517's!the combination of the lighter blue jean, with black leather boots looks tough, manly, and sexy.I still love the 501's, for pure comfort, but these 517's are in a league of their own.Thanks to Amazon, the price is great!OH- size is different! !!!!my 501's are 34x34. I had to exchange 517's until I found the correct fit due fitting higher on the hip, and longer at the legs.my 517's are 36x32.sounds weird, but a few guys I ride with, who also have 517's say the same thing. one size UP (waist)and one size DOWN (length) from a 501.
