What I received is cute, fur lined, well sewn. it is true to size.  I wear 9.5, and ordered 9 in these because the first pair really was WAY too long to be an accurate 9.5. These are snug, but think they will stretch. I have narrow feet and they are good. I did not yet contact the company about this error, so I cannot say as to how they would respond. They have a thin but firm man made sole.  These will be good for keeping at work when I need to slip into something more comfortable or when I drive to work in my scrumptious ACORN chinchilla slippers and forget to bring a pair fo shoes to change into (happened once!) .  Minnetonka makes very high quality products - the low score is for sending me the wrong model - not even anything close. The delivery is fast and they have good packing.
