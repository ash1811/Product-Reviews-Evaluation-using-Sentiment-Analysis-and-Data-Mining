This hat provides needed protection when hiking under tree branches laden with recently-fallen snow. This allows you to get where you need to go without unwelcome snow falling down your neck and jacket. It provides warmth in mild winter temperatures above 30 degrees at moderate altitudes of 6,000 - 9,000 feet in fall and early winter, as well as late winter and spring.
