When I was a teen, Levi's 501s were my go-to jeans. It took me 25 years to realize the wisdom of my youth.A lot of niche brands have come and gone, but they are more expensive, lower quality, and fad-based. Skinny jeans? Ornate pocket designs? Bell-bottoms? Have at it. These 501s never go out of style and they last a long time.The waist runs a little big, but fits to size after the first wash.
