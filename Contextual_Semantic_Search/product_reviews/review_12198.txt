Be aware, these take some breaking in! But apparently, according to my son and my husband, they are worth the initial misery. Had to buy these for my son, he lost his so he stole my husband's. The hubby loves them and wanted them back, and the son would only part with them after he got his own. So, there you have it, they are evidently so good that a family's happiness revolves around them!
