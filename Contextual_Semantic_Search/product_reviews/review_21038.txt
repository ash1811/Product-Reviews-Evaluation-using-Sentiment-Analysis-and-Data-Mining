This little box is truly a perfect gift for so many reasons. It is made by Willow Tree which is an amazing company and their product line is in so many ways remarkable. Google them...you'll see. Anyway, this little box was given to me by my adult daughter. It has two females on it, could be mom and daughter, could be friends. Either way it is a perfect gift for many occasions. Mine is on my vanity with my special jewelry that I wear daily. I think of her every day when I use it. This year I gave it to my best friend. It is made of some type of polymer but looks like hand carved wood. It has a little message at the bottom on the inside that says &#34;Forever True, Forever Friends.&#34; A warning though...it will probably get you hooked on the complete Willow Tree Line. The lid is not attached to the box and the inside color is a sage green.
