As other reviews state, buy a size up in the waist for these pants. For whatever reason, the waist sizing on the 511's doesn't appear to match other Levi's. I do buy my regular size in 514 and other Levi's, but I had to get an inch larger in 511's. Fit is what is expected from the 511 cut - slim but not skinny. I'm a slim/smaller guy so 511's fit me well without feeling baggy, without any tailoring. These aren't the super skinny pants that looks like tights that are really popular with the kids nowadays, those would be the 510's. The cut on these is slim and would only be really tight for people with muscular thighs.The material is fairly thick and durable. It's not as soft as some of my chinos but feels a lot thicker. The hidden smartphone pocket is inside the back left pocket. I don't know of people who actually carry their phones in the back pocket - I would end up sitting on my phone if I put it in my back pocket. The hidden pocket is about the size of a really slim wallet and can easily hold some loose ID or credit cards, keeping them seperate from loose bills stuffed in the back pockets. Not the most useful feature in my opinion, especially for carrying phones.
