Bought these to time at my daughters swim meets, constanty getting wet then dry.  The support is great, feet weren't tired at all at the end of the meet.  But the top of them is really uncomfortable after standing for a while.  If you are buying these to run the garbage out to the curb, they would be great.  But as far a touting that these are comfortable to stand for any length of time over an hour or so, I would get something that stretches better as your feet swell.
