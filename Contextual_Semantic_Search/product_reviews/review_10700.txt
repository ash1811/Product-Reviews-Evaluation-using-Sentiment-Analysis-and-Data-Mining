I am tall and need long pants (seam 33&#34;) but these are longer. Ok to wear to work in a hospital as scrubs if you are a very tall lady or a man about 6 feet but I was hoping to wear them everywhere and they are not made for that. Thin cotton which is good for hot summers in Arizona but I will need to alter them before I can wear them as casual pants for running errands like grocery shopping or hanging outside with neighbors.
