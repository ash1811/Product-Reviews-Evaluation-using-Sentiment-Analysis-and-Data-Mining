i admit i was a little worried as to the fit of the stockings when i purchased them, but WOW. super sexy and a good fit. i took some of the other customers' advice and got a size up from what i usually would. i'm 120 pounds, 5' 5'' ish and a tad curvy. i have unfit thighs and was worried that the stockings would cause bulges or muffin top, the C-D was perfect and high up on my thigh (so sexy), and the 'garter belt' portion rest just above the swell of my hips covering my bellybutton. they're so silky and smoke thin, like i said, the fit is great and they're VERY comfortable! can't wait to wear them out! (or show them to the boyfriend for that matter ;) )
