I must preface this review by saying that I don't swim wearing this watch, so water resistance is of little importance to me. I also take it off for contact sports (who wants to be rude enough to smack their partner in the face with a watch?), so I haven't really tested its shock resistance. That being said, the watch is comfortable to wear, easy to use, and has a good selection of features. I have had no trouble with buttons or straps wearing out or fading in color. The only thing that I would add would be another interval timer.
