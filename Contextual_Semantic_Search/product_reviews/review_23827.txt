Great sunglasses! Much cheaper than the mall, but the exact same thing. These were definitely authentic unlike what some reviewers were saying. Mine were a color sold by amazon directly so maybe that has something to do with it. Be sure to check who is actually selling these when buying, but I could not be happier. great fit. Also 55mm is definitely what you want if you are an adult-- others would for sure be too small
