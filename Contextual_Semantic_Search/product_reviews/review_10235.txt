I love this bag, it is so roomy and yet so lightweight.  Easy on/off unlike some others with too long straps trying to figure out what goes where.  There was also a good selection of colors but me being conservative went for navy.  You absolutely can not go wrong with this bag.  It is well made and should last several years.
