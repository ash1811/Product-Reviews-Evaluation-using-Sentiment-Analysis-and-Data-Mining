I followed advice to at least buy the shoe a half size bigger.  Normally and 11M gives me room for socks and shoe pads.  This shoe is really narrow and I could barely get my foot into it.  Didn't trust that it would stretch because I bought it for the reported comfort postings.  Also not as cute as I thought it would be.
