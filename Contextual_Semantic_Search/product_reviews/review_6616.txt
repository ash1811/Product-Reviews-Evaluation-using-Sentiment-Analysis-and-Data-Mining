The material is strong, durable, and they wash well.  I wore flesh tone stockings under them because the fishnet material itches a bit but most dance fishnets itch me so I expected this.  The only problem is that I am 5'3&#34; with 44&#34; hips and though that the XL would accommodate my hips, thighs, and short leg length.  I was wrong as there is room to spare in both the length from crotch to waist and foot to crotch (leg length).  I bought this size based on how my other online purchase of stockings worked but I was wrong in this case.  In the not too distant future, I will purchase a M size hoping that it will fit correctly.  The cost is fair because of the durable fabric and these fishnet tights wear after washing.  I highly recommend them for dancing or with costumes, etc.  But use my height and hip size to gauge how you purchase them. BTW, I am 29&#34; from foot to crotch.
