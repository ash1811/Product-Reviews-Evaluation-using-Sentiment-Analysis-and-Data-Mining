Got this off a reviewer of anti-tarnish strips. She said that she polishes her jewelry with these wipes, then snugs them away with the strips. Well...using these wipes sounded easy but it is not easier than any other decent silver/metal polish. I had to rub with my fingers til they hurt and were black and powdery yucky...and we're not talking heavy tarnish.I have several other polishers, some of which contain anti-tarnish in them. I was looking for something easier and maybe less messy than liquid polishers. But this is certainly not easier, and not better, so I prefer to polish with the ones which contain anti-tarnish.I also use the anti-tarnish strips too, especially for small pieces, but they have to be replaced periodically.Probably would not buy again
