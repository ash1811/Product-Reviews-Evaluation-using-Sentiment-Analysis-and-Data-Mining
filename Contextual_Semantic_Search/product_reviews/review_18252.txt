Like another brand of slippers this one was too small! An ideal size for me in shoes would  13 1/2 but I always order a 14 which is comfortable with thicker socks. Well I ordered a 14m of these slippers and not only was it a bit short(I'd say a real 13) it was also a bit narrow(I wear a regular width and I'd say this was narrow).Luckily it was through Amazon so they paid return shipping(I was not so lucky with my other slipper purchase that was also too small where I had to pay return shipping($6+!!)). Unfortunately the next size larger(15m) is $5 more so I think I'll just call it good and return these slippers. Too bad because they were really decent slippers. For others I'd suggest you order at LEAST 1 size larger and 1 size wider than you normally wear. Note if you truly order a larger size you might be able to fudge with the width but it is a tad bit narrow.Oh one last thing, like many slippers the opening is a bit tight(barely fit my foot through the opening, the slit isn't large enough) but I think it might stretch, that or like my previous Dearfoam slippers(13m BTW) I cut the opening a bit larger and re-sewed it. Kind of a hassle but my Dearfoams lasted 10+ years and the only reason I had to stop using them was because the rubber bottom started falling apart.
