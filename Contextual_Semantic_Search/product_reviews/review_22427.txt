In a growing collection of dress, casual, diving, smart and other watches, I've found it hard to cycle to my next watch as usual... I've worn this one since I received it. It looks great and IMO is one of the best bang-for-buck watches you can get without stepping up to the next bracket in watch budgets. I also bought the black rubber strap band for it and prefer the look of it, but it's always good to have the metal bracelet in case you want to resell in the future... not that I would!
