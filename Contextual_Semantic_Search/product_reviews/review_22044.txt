But I returned them because they were not narrow enough. I could wash and shrink them as I often have to do with sneakers so that they will fit me, but these shoes did not have the foot stability I was looking for. I live in the country and need a stronger shoe ( like my old NB) but I think these would be fine in a more urban or suburban setting.
