I admit it--I got used to wearing white quarter athletic socks all summer long with casual shoes, running shoes, etc. and when I saw these I thought, &#34;I wonder if I could get away with these at the office and nobody would notice?&#34; Well, I do. Or at least nobody's said anything yet. I'm sure I'll cross my legs one day in a meeting when I'm not behind my desk or a conference table and my secret will be out but in the meantime, I'm good with it.
