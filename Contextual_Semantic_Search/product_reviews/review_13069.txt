I have had to give up underwire bras because they have become so uncomfortable.  I started by going to a store to get a &#34;bra fit&#34; to see what size I should be wearing now.  The saleslady said that most women change bra size at least 7 times during her lifetime. I tried on every 18 hour bra style and some others before selecting the Ultimate Lift and Support Wire-Free Bra and one by Bali.  This bra has become my new favorite.  I was thrilled to find them on Amazon for a much better price than the department store.  I recommend getting a &#34;bra fit&#34; and trying on bras to find out what fits best, then ordering from Amazon!
