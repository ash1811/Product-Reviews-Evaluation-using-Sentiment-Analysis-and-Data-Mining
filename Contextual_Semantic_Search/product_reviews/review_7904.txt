My husband works in exploration, and I bought this for one of his trips to wear in a harsh and cold climate.  He said it kept him very warm (was worn underneath other protective clothing), was durable, and comfortable.  It looks nice on him and is easy to launder.  Can also be worn as casual attire as well.
