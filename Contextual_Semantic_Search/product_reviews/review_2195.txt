These Levi's Men's 501 Jeans, are definately Dad jeans and a cheap alternative to the funny denim offerings from the crappy discount stores and the mall's high dollar offering.  These may not be exactly origional 501s once offered, but after all these years since my first pair, button fly jeans will not do for everyone as the do for me, as some just won't appreciate the effort to exercise your fingers each time you turn away from the urinal.  Myself, I like the reminder of my youth, when zippers were not that dependable and young guys liked the security of the four buttons there to sheild your bulge, even if you left one undone occasionally.  Young girls would notice that and you might get a sly look and a smile.  But, I digress, my love of button fly Levis will go on, past when I will need to comb my hair back on the way out of the bathroom, or even tuck in my teeshirt or worry the fade has gone on to some legit wear holes, earned from many wearings and washings. Too much info?  I just can't pay over 60$ for a pair of jeans.  Even young guys could afford a pair in the 60's and 70's, but that just economics talk and inflation regret. Still love my jenos.
