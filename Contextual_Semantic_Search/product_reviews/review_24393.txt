This is one of the better-reviewed flip flops besides Teva Mush (the Original is supposed to be stellar but they've replaced it with Mush II which is supposedly not as good). So I bought them and have been pleasantly surprised.I was skeptical about the wide straps. I don't have huge feet but I thought they would look a bit masculine and sometimes the wide straps make your toes look funny. But it fits great and feels and looks good.I am normally an 8W or 8.5, but had to size up for a 9. It's perfect.
