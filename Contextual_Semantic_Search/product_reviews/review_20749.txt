I bought these for my dad for Christmas and he pretty much hasn't taken them off since! He loves them! Says they are very comfortable to wear inside, but when he goes out to snow plow, take the dog for a walk, do chores, etc. they keep him warm and happy no matter how long he's outside. Especially for the winter we're having with temps no higher than mid 20s since December, this was a great purchase!
