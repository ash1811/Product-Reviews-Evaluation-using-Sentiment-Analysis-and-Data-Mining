This bag is a perfect size for a couple of snorkels and mask and some short snorkeling fins. I took is on a cruise and out snorkeling several times. If you snorkel you do not want a bag any smaller than this. I've read some reviews saying the bag is big, it is the size of a backpack when loaded up full. I don't think thats big. If I had any complaint it would be that the draw strings are a little hard to pull in tight and the zip up pocket could be a little bigger. I had a little trouble getting my glasses case to fit in the zip up pocket but it did fit.
