It's a good watch for everyday wear.  The first thing I noticed is how light it is.  You barely feel it on your wrist.  The band is a bit on the cheap side.  It's not even a full steel band but has rubber in the links.  Otherwise, I have nothing to complain about especially at this price. It's a solid timekeeper from Timex.
