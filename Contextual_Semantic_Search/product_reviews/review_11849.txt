I have an old pair [12+ yo] of these shoes that fit like a glove.  great for the garage.  maybe the hardware store.  So I bought another pair.  Their W width is a bit tite for me.  I had them is a shoe stretcher overnight and I'm wearing them at work [desk job] to break them in.  I'm hoping these will stretch out like the old ones to become my favorite shoes.
