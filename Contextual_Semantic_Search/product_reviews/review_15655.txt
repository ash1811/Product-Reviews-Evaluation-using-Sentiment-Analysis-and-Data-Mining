I never take it off and it lasts through showers, dealing with 27 students a day, teaching gymnastics, washing the car, etc.  It is a lot stronger then I thought it would be.  It also keeps it bright shine.  For the cost it is the best. I have to add that I was tilling my garden and caught the bracelet on the tiller and thought I broke it.....it didn't.  This is an extremely tough bracelet.
