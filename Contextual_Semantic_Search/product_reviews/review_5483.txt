I bought two pairs of 32x30 black, and both waists were a full 1 1/2 inches shy of 32" and no way I could get them to clasp. Sending both back. Also, I imagine you'd have to wash these like 20 times before they're comfortable. Super-coarse fabric. Durability's no good to me if I can't even stand wearing them long enough to beat 'em up a bit. I have a couple other pairs of Dickies (which are also sized a little funny, but not this badly) and suppose I'd try something else of theirs, but who knows...
