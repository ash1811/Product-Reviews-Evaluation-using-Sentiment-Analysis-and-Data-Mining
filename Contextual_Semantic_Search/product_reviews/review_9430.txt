This suit is worth every penny, but I usually just buy whichever color is cheapest in my size and prime. I think most women find you want to go down a size from what you might normally buy in a swimsuit. That is what will make it fit the way you are wanting so there is no drag in either the top or the bottom. I find the top stretches out of shape sooner than the bottom, but even so, with proper handling, these suits last me about 6 months, through a daily mile swim in a salt filtered pool. I rinse the suit in clear running water immediately after the swim (in the shower) then roll it in a towel. I then soak it in a gentle detergent such as woolite, for about 30 minutes, as soon as I get home. Then I rinse it, roll it in a dry towel to remove excess water, and let it air dry in my shower at home. It is always ready by the next morning, for that 3:30 AM wake up call. It would probably be better to have 2 of these suits and rotate them if you can, but you do what you can, right?  If you are good to this suit, it will be good to you. I am 5'10, 180#, and a 36D. I wear a medium in this suit.  Happy swimming!
