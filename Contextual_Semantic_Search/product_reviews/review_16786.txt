We've worked outdoors in all kinds of weather; this is a new favorite winter shirt. Wrangler's Riggs shirts are very well constructed and warm; their soft thick fabric retains heat. The shirt is also quite good looking - even Borgnine-fellows could feel quite dashing. The comfortable design allows for all kinds of motion without constriction, important for hyper types, whether hard at work or reclining in the most comfy chair.
