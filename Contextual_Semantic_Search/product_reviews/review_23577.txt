These are the only shoes that I can fast walk in. I walk 5 miles a day. After a while other shoes tend to rub my feet. The Romy have plenty of room, a thick cushioning and are very well made. I love them. I wore the last pair I had for 1 year and hated to throw them away because they were still comfortable. but I figured that after a year it was time to get a new pair. You can't go wrong with these shoes.
