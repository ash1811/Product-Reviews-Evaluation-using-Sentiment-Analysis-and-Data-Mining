These are very comfortable in the sole.  The thing is that no one has really solved the inner big toe chaffing that will occur if you wear these daily as I did in the jungle for two weeks.  For awhile I tried short socks to help.  For a few days I had to wear boots just to keep my toes from bleeding.  So these are good for short duration only (1-2 days continuous max).
