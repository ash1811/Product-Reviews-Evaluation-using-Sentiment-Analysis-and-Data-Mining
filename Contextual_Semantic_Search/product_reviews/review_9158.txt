These are nice jeans, typical good Levi quality. My son is tall & thin, 6'2" 131 lbs and the 32/34 fit him good. But these are expensive! He has some Old Navy skinny jeans that are just as nice but only cost about $24. So that is what we will be buying from now on. These are not worth the almost $20 more. Only 3 stars because the price is so high.
