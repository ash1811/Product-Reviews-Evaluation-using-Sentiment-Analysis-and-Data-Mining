I bought this chain to wear with my fleur de lis charm.  It worked very well and now I have a necklace that I can wear with my fleur de lis earrings.  GEAUX SAINTS!  The chain seems to be very strong considering its size.  It is a fine chain.....not a heavy one.  I would recommend this chain to someone looking for a good chain at a fair price.
