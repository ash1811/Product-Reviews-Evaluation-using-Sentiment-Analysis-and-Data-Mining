This is handy to have around when people like plumbers come. This can be used instead of having to ask them to remove their shoes. Or, for yourself, for that matter to avoid tracking in dirt and mud from outside. It is a thin paper-like material, but it is pretty strong and lasts all day through repeated on/off. Just toss at the end of the job or when dirty.
