This is one purchase where reading the reviews definitely helped, most reviewers advised to order a size up, which i did and i am so thankful for the advice,i normally wear a medium but for this pants i bought the large and it fits perfectly, good length and it does hold you, this pants conforms to your shape but is not tight, I purchased the black and will be buying the navy..
