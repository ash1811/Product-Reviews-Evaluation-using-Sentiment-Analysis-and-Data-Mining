My daughter is between a size 10-11. She has some shoes both sizes. I ordered up based on some other reviews. The size 11 was quite a bit too bit and much too wide. I've NEVER had a problem with shoes being too wide for this child. I used Prime, and easily returned the shoes. Second time around I went 10.5 Narrow. They fit great, snug with a little room to grow. In a perfect world, the original size would have worked. But, it's hard to buy shoes/clothes online and expect a perfect fit. Overall I'm very happy, Amazon Prime made the return hassle free.
