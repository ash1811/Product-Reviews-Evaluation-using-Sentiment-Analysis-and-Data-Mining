I was a little nervous after reading claims by some reviewers that this is an inferior made-in-China version, but a close visual and tactile comparison to my OEM Seiko band proved otherwise...it's identical in every respect.Briefly considered getting a nylon NATO or Zulu type band, but was uncertain about how it would actually look---no on-wrist photos of them on Amazon!  So I chickened out and stayed with the devil I know instead, which was about the same price or less.  Twenty one bucks for a piece of rubber seems a bit high, but oh well...
