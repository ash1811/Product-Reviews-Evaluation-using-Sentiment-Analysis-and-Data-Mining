I've purchased fingerless gloves exactly like this from a dollar store.  They're quite "handy" for me, when I can find them.  That's why I was willing to pay $2.79.  What I did not know, was that I'd be paying over $5.00 for shipping; otherwise I'd have definitely looked elsewhere! Nevertheless, these cheapy-gloves are useful to wear indoors and keep my poor, cold, little hands warm while I  still get all my stuff done.  I take them off when I bathe, though.
