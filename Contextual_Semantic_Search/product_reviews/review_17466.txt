I have historically worn a 34&#34; waist, and I ordered three pairs of pants at the same time with loose fitting waists. The other two were 550's, and they were perfect. If I'm a few pounds overweight, the &#34;loose&#34; part of the 34&#34; waist lets me cheat a little bit and still fit in a 34&#34; pair of pants, comfortably, and without a belt.That's where the 569s fall short. These 34&#34; waist pants are more like a 38&#34; waist. Even when I can comfortably fill out a 36&#34;, I have to have a belt or else these pretty much fall right off my waist. They are just loose... Just too loose. Unacceptable for a fit really, and not like other Levis jeans that I've experienced.Also - they just don't feel right. The material seems to be more thin than what I'm used to and a lot looser than the 550's that I prefer.Honestly if they didn't say Levis on the tag, I wouldn't think that these jeans were from Levis. Not just the fit, but also the material. I really regret not putting these back in a box and sending them right back when they first arrived. I tried washing them on hot, and wearing them often, and they are just how they are. No impressive.
