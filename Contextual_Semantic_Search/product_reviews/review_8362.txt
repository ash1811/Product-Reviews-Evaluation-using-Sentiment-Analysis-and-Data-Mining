I read the reviews and ordered this bra in my normal size and one size up. My regular size would have been too small. The band is fine but the cup's too small. And it does make a weird shape, cone-like. One reviewer said that went away after a while. I don't know, I have returned this sport bra. The fabric feels nice, and it is comfortable. It's for medium impact I'd say, not enough support for running etc, which is what I was looking for.
