I swear by Dickies work pants, especially the poly blend. The pure cotton ones won't last as long. These are strong, comfortable, colorfast and have all the pocket room I need. I am a delivery driver. I carry pens, knives, paperwork and everything on me all the time, They don't bind when lifting or driving.
