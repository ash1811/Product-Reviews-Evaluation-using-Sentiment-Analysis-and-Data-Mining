Have been a fan of Skagen watches for years.  Now, both my son and son-in-law love them.  Neither of them wore watches because they can't stand the latest style which is bigger, bulkier and heavier.  I've bought both of them the ultra-slim watches and they love them.  This particular watch has no problems, with the exception of the date window.  It's so small as to be pointless.
