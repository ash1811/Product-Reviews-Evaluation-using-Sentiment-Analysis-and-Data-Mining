These are pretty neat sandals.  Only thing I'm not wild about is the piece between the toes.  It's a bit uncomfortable, but seems to be getting a little less irritating the more I wear these, so I think that it will soften up and be more comfortable over time.  The rest of the straps do not irritate at all.  I think these are very cute little strappy sandals, and would give them five stars if not for that piece between the toes.
