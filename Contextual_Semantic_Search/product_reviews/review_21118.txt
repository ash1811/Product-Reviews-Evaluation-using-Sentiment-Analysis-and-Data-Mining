Arrived quickly, and in new condition. If you're looking for a hat, here you go. I didn't know how cheap a beanie could be until I got this one. It's very thin, very cheap, and too small to fit securely on a normal sized head. Given the choice, I would pay a little more for a better quality beanie. The call is yours.
