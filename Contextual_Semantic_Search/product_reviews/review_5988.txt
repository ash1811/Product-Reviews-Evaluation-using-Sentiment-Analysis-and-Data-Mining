Since finding out about Easy Spirit in 1995 I have found them to be almost always the right shoe for my feet.  I have Reynaud's Syndrome so having a really good shoe is mandatory.  I have tried a few others over the year but have to discard them and get Easy Spirit.  Not every shoe style works for me but usually there is one that does - and this one does!
