This would have been a 5 star vest had it not been for the totally illogical front pocket zipper design. The pockets close by zipping down instead of zipping up. At first, I didn't think this was a big deal but it has become more of a nuisance with each passing day. The pockets are pretty shallow, so if you store anything thing in them (keys, cell phone, wallet etc.), they will spill out the moment you unzip the pockets. I wish I had the sewing skills to remove these zippers and install them the right side up.
