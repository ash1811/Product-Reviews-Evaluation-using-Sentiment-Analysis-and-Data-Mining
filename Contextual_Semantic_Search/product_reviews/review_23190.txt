If you're like me and you have trouble keeping your girls "front and center" instead of in your armpits, this may be a great choice for you. I wear 30DD, which is hard to find, and Panache is one of the few brands that understands that needing a small band doesn't mean "training bra". I love this bra, but it took me some time to get used to it. It fits differently from many other bras because it actually encloses all the tissue, which can feel awkward. When I first got this bra, I was trying to wear it the way I'd always worn my bras (the wrong way, it turns out), and I was pulling this one down too far and expecting the straps to sit closer to my neck. I was getting the "quad" look, big time. I read on a bra blog that the way to "set" breasts in a bra is to pull up on the center gore after the bra is all strapped and tugged and swooped and scooped. I tried this, and the whole fit of this bra changed. Everything literally fell into place, with the cups filling up but not cutting in. This bra lifts and centers and gives me a beautiful round shape, even under tight fitting shirts.
