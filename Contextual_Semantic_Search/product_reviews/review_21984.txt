Purchased these bras for use after breast surgery.  Considering it was not the most comfortable of times regardless of what you are wearing they worked out pretty well.The poly/cotton spandex was soft and it is very pretty gave just the right amount of support.  The only downside for me were the seams right across the top which irritated an already swollen and sensitive area.  To alleviate the discomfort I put a tissue under each side.They will make nice sleeping bras.Wish they had more colors available.
