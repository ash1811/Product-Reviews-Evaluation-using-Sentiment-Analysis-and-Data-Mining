This Tee has a soft feel to the inside, like it was lined with flannel.  Very comfy.  The color is also a rich golden yellow and much deeper than the web picture.  All in all, it was a great buy for the price.  I haven't had a chance to wash it yet; but I expect it should behave much like all Hanes Tee's and come through the wash/dry cycle like a champ.  Since their blue Tee's don't fade, I expect this gold will not fade either.
