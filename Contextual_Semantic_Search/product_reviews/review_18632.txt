I was hoping this watch would have a larger face for my 95 year old Mom with vision problems.  It was not any bigger than a regular woman's watch face.  Also, the description stated that it was for a smaller wrist but we had to end up taking out some links because the watch would turn around and hang under her wrist.  Mom likes the fact that she can wash dishes without taking off the watch because it is waterproof and she likes the lighted dial even though she hasn't had to use it yet.  Looks okay but nothing fancy if you want to make an impression at gift time.  Overall, okay!
