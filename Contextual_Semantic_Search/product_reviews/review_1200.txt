I am 5'8&#34;, about 135 pounds, and the size B is basically what I expected. I wish they had a little more of a smooth finish so that fabrics glide over them a little more easily but I think these will do their purpose underneath a bridesmaids dress. There is not giant indentation for the waist or legbands though, which is nice. But I will not say they are comfortable... they do suck it all in.
