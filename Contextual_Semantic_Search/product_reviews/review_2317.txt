There are actually two ways jeans fit, below the waist ( by that I mean about an inch below your belly button) known as low rise and regular fit. The low rise are good if you are thin with a narrow behind. Levi's 501 are regular fit and straight leg. They tend to run about an inch too long, so if you inseam is 34 get 32 to 33. The main reason I like button fly is due to the fact nothing gets got in the zipper! I paid about $10.00 less than at local department stores. Good job, excellent jeans.
