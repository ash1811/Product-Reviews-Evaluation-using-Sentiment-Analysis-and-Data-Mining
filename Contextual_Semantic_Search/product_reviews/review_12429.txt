After reading the reviews for this watch, I purchased it as a Christmas gift for my husband, who has small wrists and thus finds many men's watches to be uncomfortable.  When the watch arrived, I was immediately delighted with its appearance; the blue face is striking, even been than as pictured here.  Overall, the look of this watch is quite uniquely attractive.  My husband thought so to, and he loves that he can wear this watch under some of his closer-fitting shirts; the watch is both thin and lightweight, making it completely comfortable.  Other reviewers have mentioned some issues with adjusting the band, but my husband was able to do this quickly and easily.  The only thing that is slightly tricky is getting the date to switch at the right time of day (midnight instead of noon), but we were able to work this out easily as well.  I definitely highly recommend this watch, which looks great (appears MUCH more expensive than it actually is!) and makes a great gift too.
