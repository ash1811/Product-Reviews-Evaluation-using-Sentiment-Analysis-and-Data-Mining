I have big boobs. There, I said it.I have such big boobs, in fact, that the largest cup size (DDD) of this particular model is just a teensy bit too small to hold in my particular sweater puppies. But I buy them anyway because Bali got it right with this one; in fact I've gone through several because they're the only bras I wear.The under-wires, though they will eventually break (it's inevitable if you are blessed with enormous melons), are comfortable, which is hard to be if you're an underwire.The cups themselves are soft and cozy, and there are no seams - no bullet bras here!The straps are padded where they should be, as opposed to way too far in front like some of the more "just add more fabric to the cup" types of extra-endowed bras out there...those folks don't realize that the massive mammaries drag the bra *forward*...which means if you leave the straps the same as for the B-cuppers, those half-conceived padded bits will be somewhere on the front of the shoulder, doing nobody any good at all.Lastly, you should know this is NOT a minimizer. At all. And why should it be?! Be PROUD of your assets! Don't strap em' in like they did something wrong! Let them be round and bouncy and pleasant for all to behold, including you. Grab one of these accurately-sized bras (measure yourself first, check online for the way to do it properly) and a v-neck t-shirt, and let em' be happy hooters.The only thing I wish for this bra would be a few more cup sizes, and more color... if I could, I'd buy this bra in every color of the rainbow. I'd buy two of each, in fact, and some for friends as well.
