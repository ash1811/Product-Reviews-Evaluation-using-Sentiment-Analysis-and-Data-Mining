Received this product a few weeks ago.  Used it several times already.  Its a compact umbrellas that folds up small.  Strong spring-loaded automatic opener and closer.  The wind vents are very useful so the umbrella can withstand normal windy, rainy weather.  Quality construction is better than average as the &#34;spokes&#34; are thicker than the typical compact umbrella spokes that bend/break.  Highly recommend.
