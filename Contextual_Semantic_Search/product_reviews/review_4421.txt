I was a little disappointed with this bra. I ordered the size I normally wear, but it is so tight, it's uncomfortable and flattens me out. If I were ordering it again, I would go up to a 36. Not sure about the quality because I don't wear it. Thinking about investing in some extenders, since I paid a good price for the bra.
