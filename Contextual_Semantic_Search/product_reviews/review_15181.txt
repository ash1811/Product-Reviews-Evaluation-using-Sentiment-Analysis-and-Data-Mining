June 29, 2012: Update. I've just lowered my rating from 5 to 4 stars because, although they kept their sizing and shape after washings, the bottom hem turns up, and even ironing won't keep it in place. I also really dislike the sewn in label although it is on the bottom and not on the neck. The review now stands for all colors, not just forest green. Had the same trouble with navy, gray, burgundy... Still comfortable, and great for hiking.***May 15: I just ordered 6 more. I've laundered four, and two twice. They're almost wrinkle free, but most important, they don't shrink. XL is still XL. I wish I wasn't, but that's another story.April 30: The don't shrink! For quality and sizing and color, worth twice as much.April 29: Just got these Hanes Beefy-Ts (I suppose "Beefy" is better than "Portly"), and just got back from a 9 mile hike in 85 degree weather. This is truly a comfortable T, has my much-needed and used pocket, and the neck didn't bind. It's certainly soft enough and felt good through the hike. Seemed to stretch with me when I was climbing, and didn't bind at all.I do have one concern - and will report on it in a couple of days: Is this going to shrink? It's a perfect fit NOW, but it's 100% cotton - albeit pre-shrunk - and that's going to mean it'll be tight after the first wash. I honestly can't read the instructions even with a magnifying glass, but I think it says, "For best results, let your wife wash this T. She'll know what to do."Since my experience has been that color does make a difference in softness, this review is for the Forest Green. I have a couple of gray on the way.EW
