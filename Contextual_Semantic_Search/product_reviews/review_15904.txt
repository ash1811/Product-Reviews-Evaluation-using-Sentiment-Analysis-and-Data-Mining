I have worn Thorlo tennis socks for almost 20 years. Both crew and low. They are as good as it gets. Comfortable, padded where it counts and best of all durable. They last. They fit me as well. I wear size 14 shoes and the XL socks fit with extra room to go up to a 15. But they aren't baggy or slack. I also have Thorlo boot socks. My highest recommendation.
