This is my fifth Ugg dakota slipper. (I have a black, a tan, a silver and a grey and I wanted a red pair. ) I  could not find a red one in a size 6 at my favorite retailer.  These slippers are so comforable, I wear them everywhere even at work. I love that my feet are  soft and cozy when I wear them  Lucky for me, Amazon had the right size and the specific red that I wanted and they were delivered on time as promised.Thank you Amazon.
