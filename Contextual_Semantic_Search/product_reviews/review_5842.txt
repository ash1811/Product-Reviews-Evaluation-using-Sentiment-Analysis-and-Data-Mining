I knew going into this shirt, I'd probably expect nothing great. But man, its barely breathable, it's small when compared to other brands of similar type and size. And when I can go get a Jockey shirt for same price that fits like a $30 one, this one is just a joke. Will not buy again, and probably wind up in the car drying towel pile
