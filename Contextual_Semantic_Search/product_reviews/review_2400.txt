I am so hard on watches and this watch has made it through it all. I LOVE my Skagen and probably will never buy another brand of watch.My particular one is fairly water resistant, I've splashed water in and near it, and even put my hand into the turtle tank once when I had to get the turtle out when the lightbulb got wet, exploding sharp glass all over. I didn't have a moment to take off the watch, so in it went. It came out fine. I do not usually immerse this watch although I don't take it off to wash my hands or scrub dishes before they go into the dishwasher. I wouldn't immerse it often though.In 5 years of ownership, I wore this watch almost every day for the first 4. Then I bought 2 more Skagen watches to expand my "wardrobe." That should tell you something right there. Here's my analysis:Pros:*Many Skagens have this mesh bracelet. It is WONDERFUL and I can't say enough about it. Hypoallergenic, breathable like no other band. I'm allergic to everything, my skin is so acidic it will literally eat the chrome finish off of things. Not so with this watch, since it's surgical stainless steel.*In 4 years, I have had to replace the battery once. Great battery life.*Attractive, gets comments.*Flashy flat glass gets attention and if you can't read, just tilt to angle and it works great.*Love the sparkly little crystals.*Matching brushed silver face.*Easily adjustable band. Takes a small screwdriver to pry up the clamping clasp. Easy.*Good locking safety clasp. If the catch gets loose, just give it a little pressure from pliers and it becomes tight again.*Super low profile. Sits close to your wrist which helps out on the first "con"Cons:*All Skagens have low-quality glass. It does chip, scratch, etc. I'm very hard on watches so it's definitely taken some abuse. It still looks good though-- that was the only thing that made it lose a star. I wish Skagen had a more expensive line with real sapphire crystals, I'd be willing to pay more. They are WORTH IT.*No second-hand.
