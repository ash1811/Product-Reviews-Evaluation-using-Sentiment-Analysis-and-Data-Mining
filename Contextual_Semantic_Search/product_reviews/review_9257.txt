I love these and they were only 20 bucks! I used to have shearling moccasins but they were too hot in the summer and made my feet sweat.  Eventually the shearling rubbed off in places.  I love these shoes because when they are dirty (every week or two) I just throw them in the wash and they come out good as new.  They feel like socks - so comfy!  When they finally wear out, I can afford to replace them because they are so cheap.  I would buy these again in a heartbeat.  I also found the recommended sizes true to size.
