As a retired pilot, I have worn Rayban sunglasses since 1956.  I have purchased an estimated and used approximately 20 pair since that time.  Over that time period, these glasses have served me well.In the past the Rayban carrying case that is out of necessity worn on my belt, used an interior hard shell encased in a ersatz leather case that was robust and withstood the rigors of daily wear and tear.  However, the current case is appears chintzy and has no reinforced interior shell.  As a result the case often rips loose because of their very inferior quality of material and design currently used in their manufacter.  Shame on you Rayban!
