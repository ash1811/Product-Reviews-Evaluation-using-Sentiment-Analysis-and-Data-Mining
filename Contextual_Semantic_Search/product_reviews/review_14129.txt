I hate ordering clothes online because it is rare they fit like they say - but these pants fit true to size. Great fit in the hips and waist and perfect length. I really like the side elastic (which isn't binding). If I find pants that fit in the hips, they are gaping in the waist - well not with these! So glad to have found them.
