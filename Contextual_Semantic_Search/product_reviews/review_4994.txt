I've tried all sorts of boxer briefs and sports briefs. I started with hanes and other cotton boxer briefs, and then I ended up with Under Armour (UA), which I've been using for about five years. I took a shot at these since they're $5-10 cheaper than UA, per pair.I am fairly impressed. They are lighter than UA, and a bit more comfortable. The fabric is thinner than UA, and although it may not last as long (I can't speak to this though), it dries faster and feels lighter on the skin.  On the fit, I'll get specific, these under garments don't have space below the crotch, which I have always disliked with UA. I like the garment to slightly compress my body in all areas, and the UA has that empty space below the crotch that allows stuff to rub together. This gently applies support to all areas.The underwear features the same moisture wicking material, and it does dry fast after a workout. I really can't speak to long term use, but right now this is a slam dunk compared to other major brands that are more expensive.
