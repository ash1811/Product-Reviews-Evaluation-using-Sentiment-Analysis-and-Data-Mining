This T-shirt seems to be well constructed.  It fits nicely through the body and shoulders, and is long enough to tuck in nicely.  The material is fairly substantial. While it is not the thickest material I have seen in a Tee, it is substantial enough.  I would order this shirt again, and would recommend this T-shirt.
