Nothing particular about this drag suit.  It does what it's suppose to do.  The only issue I have with it is that it is really tight around the thighs.  I'm not sure if that's a manufacturing problem/defect, but it doesn't effect the fact that it still catches more water than a regular speedo.  If anything, the tightness helps keep the drag suit from looking like really short trunks.  Overall, I like the purchase and would recommend this product.  I'd suggest to order true to size and deal with the tightness around the thighs; afterall if you're that serious of a swimmer to buy a drag suit then you'd know that it loosens up over a short time.
