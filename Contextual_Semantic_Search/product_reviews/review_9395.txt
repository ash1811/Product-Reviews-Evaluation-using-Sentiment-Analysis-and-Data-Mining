I was going to be wearing high heels for my son's wedding.  This would be my first time wearing heels in years and I found a pair I really loved.  The problem was that they had very slippery soles, and I did not want to become part of the wrong kind of wedding memory.  There were two pair of the petals in the package, but I only needed one pair.  They went on easily and stayed on for all the wedding festivities and beyond.  The difference they made in my confidence was priceless.
