This is my 3rd pair of Reebok Princess sneakers, because this style is perfect for me.  I ordered my usual size in this sneaker, and found that the toe box is a little snugger than I am accustomed to.  But, after wearing them for several hours, they began to feel more comfortable.  Aside from that, I have always loved this style.  I use them for tennis on soft courts, and for me, they are the perfect style for these courts.
