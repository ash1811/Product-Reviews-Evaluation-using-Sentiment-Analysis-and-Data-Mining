I received this as a gift from my spouse and could not be more pleased with it! I have recently relocated to Oregon from Texas and I was in desperate need of an umbrella to help keep my dry on my daily commute to the office in my new town. This umbrella is easy to tote around in a purse or backpack, it shakes off easily, and the one-button-open action is much appreciated. There isn't much worse than standing in the pouring rain trying to get your umbrella to open. No worries about that with this guy.This umbrella comes with a sleeve that you can store it in, however, I find it quite useless. It's hard to get it back in there and if you use it every day, it becomes a pain to fuss with. The wind has yet to turn it inside out on me, so it seems to be a sturdy design and product. I've enjoyed having this and would recommend to anyone looking to stay dry.
