This is a handy sun visor. It does not mess up my hair since it just slips on. It does not give me headaches. I frequently wear it in the car to help cut down on early morning or late afternoon sun glare. On a breezy day it does not flip away from my face like the brim of my favorite sun hat. When I am going inside and outside I can slip it around my neck so it doesn't get misplaced. This makes it very convenient when traveling and sightseeing. I currently have 2 in go-with-everything black and tan colors.
