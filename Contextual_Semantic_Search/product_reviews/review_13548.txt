I can't believe how confortable these slippers are! They do have a noticable arch support that is just what I needed and a wonderfully soft memory foam foot bed. Also the slipper fabric is very soft--like walking on a cloud. Would definately purchase these again--in fact I bought pink and an thinking about also purchasing the black.
