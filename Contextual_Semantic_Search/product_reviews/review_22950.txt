You can dress this shoe up or down.  You can get away with it at work if you're not looking for boardroom style.  It's a functional, comfortable shoe, but it isn't stylish.  Be aware that the leather does not have a high polish to it, so it looks more casual.  But if you face a morning walk, and you have to deal with the weather, these shoes can't be beat.
