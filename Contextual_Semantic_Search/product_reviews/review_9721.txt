I like the jock. It offers a roomy pouch, which may not work out for some who want a tighter feel on your goods. It offers comfortable support without making you feel that the guys down there are choked up and uncomfortable, which you don't want. The straps and waist band are well made and dont pull back too tight, making for an all over comfortable, yet supportive jock for us guys.
