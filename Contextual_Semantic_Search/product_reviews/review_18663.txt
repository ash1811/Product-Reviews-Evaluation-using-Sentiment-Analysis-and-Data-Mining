I love my Easy reader Timex. The lighted face at the push of a button is so handy. The watch keeps perfect time too. It is comfortable to wear, I never take it off. It is water resistant, so taking a shower, doing  dishes etc doesn't ruin it. This is the third Timex Easy reader watch I have had. They last several years for me, but then the battery needs to be replaced. At that point I just get a new watch. But if one is so inclined to replace the battery, the watch continues working well. I have had the battery replaced in one but found that the battery and service fee to replace it were as much as a new watch. I am not handy enough to be able to replace the batteries myself. For a wonderful watch with back light, a second hand, a date keeper where the number three on the dial is, a face that I can see, I am totally satisfied. And I will continues to purchase this variety of Timex.
