I nay have liked this product better if I had not seen the real thing.  I have seen many rasta'a and spent a considerable amount of time on the internet trying to find them.  I have owned the ones that are hand made and I wish that I could find them again. The ladies on Maui make them, and they are gorgeous! The yarn is heavy, and the knitting is spectacular.  They are large because most people that wear them, wear them over braids or afros. I would love to send you one so that you could see what they should look like.  They would fit a toddler's head, (a bald-headed toddler)but nothing larger.  I hope that I can return them, but what I would really like is to find where I can get the real deal. The colors are nice, but they are very cheaply made. Size, material, and workmanship get a thumbs dowm. My friends complemented mine, so I ordered 8 of them as surprise gifts.  They were a surprise alright!
