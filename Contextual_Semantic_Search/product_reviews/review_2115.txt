they are a nice off black - not shiny.they seem to fit well, but the waist is the kind in old school undies with an elastic band around the very top.  like panty hose.  so hopefully they will stay up, but they do squeeze the muffin top.also, for some reason they slightly flared the ankle so while i like these... i don't love them.
