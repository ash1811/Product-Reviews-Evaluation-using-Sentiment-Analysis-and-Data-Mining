This is a basic Tank/sleavless workout shirt.  I bought a few of these in different colors to work out in, due to the low price.  I was pleased with the size (L) and the fabric seems to be comparable quality with anything you'd buy in the store.  I think I paid 6 or 7 bucks each with free shipping, which is a heck of a lot better than the average of 10-15 each in the store.
