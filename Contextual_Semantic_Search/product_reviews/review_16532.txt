My husband works in maintenance and is pretty tough on his jeans. Buying the Walmart cheap brand is useless.  Over the has consistently gone back to the Wrangler Riggs carpenter style work jeans.  They are more expensive, however he feels like in the long run they are no more expensive than the $10 jeans that have a short life.  I shop online for these watching for a good deal. Amazon is the best price I can usually find with free shipping.
