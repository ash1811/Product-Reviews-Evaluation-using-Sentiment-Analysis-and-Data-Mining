You gotta give it to the Japanese. They put four cylinders in a mid-size car and the car has muscle, good looks, and refinement. This Orange Monster has muscle, good looks, and is one of the most accurate watches I've ever owned! It ticks (sweeps) right along with my Timex Easy Reader (which is the most accurate watch I own).  One can feel the quality in the build of this watch. It is a brick. I own watches up and down the bunny trail, from solar atomic to watch snob automatics. The bracelet is very comfortable (better than most). The power reserve is better than any automatic in my collection. Please do not set the day/date between 9pm-4am. I did that and it caused the watch to stop running after 30 min. consistently. However, I rotated the time forward for a 24hr cycle. Whatever, had the hands hung up went away. It has been running like a top since, two years now. This watch behaves like it has a battery inside. Amazing.
