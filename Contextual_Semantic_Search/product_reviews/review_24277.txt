I am 25 and quite amply-busted (38 DDD), and it seems that my choices are cheap udder holders or $70 Cacique bras in ugly floral prints.I had one Bali bra that I have stretched out, but I use to sleep in, so decided to give this one a go. I couldn't have asked for a better fitting or better-looking bra for the price. It offers the support I need without pinching or digging in, and the elastic in the straps is minimal so I don't experience sagginess. Though there is some thickness on the shoulder straps, they are not wide enough to peek out of my sleeveless work shirts. Plus... these bras are pretty. They're simple and soft, but attractive enough that I feel kinda sexy wearing them! They perk the girls up but take the strain off of my back. YES!
