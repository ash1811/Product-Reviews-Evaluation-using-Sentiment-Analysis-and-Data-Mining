Made for outdoors but I chose these for indoor use only. I wear a 7 1/2 and these are a 7 and fit just fine. They keep my foot and ankle so warm. They don't hold moisture from what I've experienced and they haven't shown signs of wearing at all. Easy to put on. Taking off you should use your hands and not your other foot so as to keep the integrity of the heels. :) Bearpaw is truly a well made boot.
