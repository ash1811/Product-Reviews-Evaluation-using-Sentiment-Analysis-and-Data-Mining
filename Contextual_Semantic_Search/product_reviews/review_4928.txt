Got a couple of pairs of these for my husband and he loves them so much he called them his lucky underwear.  The first pair I bought him over 2 years ago got worn once each wash cycle since they are his favorites and are still holding up strong, so they are definitely worth the price.  I decided to buy him enough pairs so he can have on a pair of lucky undies every day!  I expect these to hold up as well as the original pair.
