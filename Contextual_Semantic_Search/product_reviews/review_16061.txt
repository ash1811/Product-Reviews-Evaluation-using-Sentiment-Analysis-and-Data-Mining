Just purchased a pair of polarized Pit Bulls and wanted a nice case for the dresser to store them.  The fit is great but would really like to have the bottom more flat since the case has a tendency to roll when bumped.  When added to the glasses this would make a great gift presentation.  Okay but I ordered the soft vault for travel.
