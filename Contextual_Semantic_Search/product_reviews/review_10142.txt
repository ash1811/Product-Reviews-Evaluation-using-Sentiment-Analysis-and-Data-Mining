This shirt seems good, above average even.  Not sure if it worth the  money yet.  My other riggs shirts are very comfortable, sized true, and made of a thicker cloth.This Tee seems a little tighter, and material is of lighter weight.  It is soft, and appears well made, so I will see how well it wears.Color is excellent, and true to photo on Amazon.
