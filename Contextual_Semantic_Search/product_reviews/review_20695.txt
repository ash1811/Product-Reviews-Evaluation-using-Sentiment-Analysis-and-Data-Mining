Good quality, the leather is soft & supple, and they are very sturdy. I got these to wear to work (in an office) with slacks. I think they'll be perfect for fall. Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is they are a bit "old lady-ish" (No offense! I'm 30) but for work in a conservative office, they are perfect.
