The treads work super-well on water, ice and (hopefully not) blood or bodily fluids. I mention this because Police and EMT personnel may want to purchase this boot. It is light enough for summer use, and good for short-term (2 to 3 hours) outdoors in Winter. It is NOT waterproof, but for the money, is a great boot. I use mine daily for 6 months at a time, and they last close to 2 years that way.
