Wigwam has made improvements over old model socks by reenforcing the easily worn spots.  I love to see improvements like this from any company.  They don't smell after being worn all day and they keep your feet as dry as your shoes will allow.  Get a few pairs!Also, I like how these are made in USA.  The quality is truly excellent so far (we'll see how they age).
