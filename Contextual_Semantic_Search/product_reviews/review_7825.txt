I buy three V necks to wear around the house every year. Last year I bought these shirts in Large and White. They were a bit bigger than I wanted and got dirty quickly. This year I bought Medium and Black. The fit is great; not too tight in the stomach area or shoulders. I am average build and wear a 42 long suit coat. These shirts are great. Hopefully they do not fade too much from weekly washing. I will check back in if there is anything to report down the road.
