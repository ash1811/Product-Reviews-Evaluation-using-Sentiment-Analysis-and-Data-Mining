I love these jeans.  The blue is VERY blue... keep that in mind.  But it's true to size, fits great.  The pockets are wonderful.  I might fade them a bit because the shockingly indigo color is pretty bright and I'm not likely to wear them down to a muted color anytime soon (very robustly made).Great jeans.  Thanks, Dickies--you magnificent bastards.
