Seriously.  Obsessed.  Asks for them every birthday and Christmas.  He's a pretty tall slender dude and the fit is perfect for him.  He's a 34x36 which is also tough to find.  He's pretty hard on his clothes and these things really hold up.  They do seem to stain though, it's like trying to get a stain out of concrete.
