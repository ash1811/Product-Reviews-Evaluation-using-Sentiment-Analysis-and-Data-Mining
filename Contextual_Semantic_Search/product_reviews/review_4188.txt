The support of this bra is amazing. However, the wires and boning come up extremely high, which is difficult when you're short in that area. I took the boning out, and was pleasantly surprised that it's acutally metal. I swapped out wires from a different bra for a bit, but that wasn't working so I put the originals back in. I'll probably get wire cutters and shorten them a bit.
