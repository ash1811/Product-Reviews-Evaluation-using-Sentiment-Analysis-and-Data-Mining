These shirts are by no means heavy-weight.  I ordered three of them, have washed them a few times in warm water and dried them on low heat.  They have not appreciably shrunk or become misshapen.  The one I ordered in 'true red' bled  (no pun intended, but it is kinda funny) the first time I washed it, but that seems to be typical of red items for some reason. I'd recommend pre-soaking the red in a strong vinegar solution if you choose to buy that color.These tees should be perfect for around-the-house wear in warm weather.  For $6.65 each, this was a good deal as far as I am concerned. I will buy more of these.Update:  I did buy more of these.  'Pacific Blue' bled like there's no tomorrow, and also required a vinegar rinse.  Not happy with this...!  All I can say is Beware of Dark Colors.  Revising the rating from four stars down to three stars.
