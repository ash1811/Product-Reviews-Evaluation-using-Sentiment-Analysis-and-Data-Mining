Took these out for the frst time for a long walk in a snow storm. Feet remained warm and dry. I yet have to test them in the creek for waterproofness but so far I would rate this item very well and would recommend it to anyone wanting to hike or Trek in the winter. Its functionality and ability to attach ice walking devices or snow shoes is a big plus for me since I like to go "offroad" or "off the beaten path" when I walk. I am becoming a big fan of Merrell boots and footgear. The design for the grip on this sole is worthy of almost anywhere I would dare to tred. Aggressive yet it rolls with your step.
