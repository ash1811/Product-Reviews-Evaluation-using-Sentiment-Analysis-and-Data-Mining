I was disappointed with this bra.  It looked pretty and I was looking for a pink, lace bra; however, this is difficult to hook (has 4 or 5  hook and eyes - don't remember exactly and I have since given it to a clothing drive since I only wore it a few times) and no padding at all (and I need it!)  So, this wasn't the bra for me.  If you don't need any padding or support and like all the hooks, then you might like it.
