Bought these because I basically dislike shoes and they are minimally constraining.  Have worn them every day since....wash well,and comfy.  I recommend them , it's like going barefoot without cold feet!!!  Plus, they are cute...I wear a lot of denim and they go well.  When I leave the house, they are right by the back door to slip into when I return!!!  Thanks.
