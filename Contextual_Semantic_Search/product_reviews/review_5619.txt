I wear a size 4 - 6 or small in misses' clothing or a 5 - 7 or small in juniors' clothing.  Because these shorts are made of a 50/50 poly-cotton jersey knit, I ordered them a size larger than I normally wear--medium--thinking that even though they initially might be a bit big, they would shrink enough to be a good fit on me. Unfortunately, the medium was far too small for me.  In fact, I'd guess that the medium would be a perfect fit for someone who normally wears a small.  I have reordered the shorts in a large because they are nicely made and exactly what I need.  My only complaint is that the sizing seems very inaccurate.  They definitely run about a size smaller than other knit shorts in the same size.
