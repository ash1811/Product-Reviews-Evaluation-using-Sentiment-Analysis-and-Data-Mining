So, let me list all the great hings about these briefs.1) They fit great2) They wick moisture3) They don't smell!!BUT, they sure do ride up on you!! I find myself always having a wedgie, doesn't happen with regular boxer briefs though!I guess you have to weigh the pros and the cons. Just know that they're very comfortable as long as they don't bunch up!
