These shoes are very cute.  I am glad I got the wide width, it is just right... and my feet are not THAT wide.  I would have given the shoe five stars if the sole was more cushiony.  I wear Aerosoles a lot and so I think I'm spoiled there.All in all, a cute shoe and probably very comfy for younger women whose feet are still in pretty good shape!
