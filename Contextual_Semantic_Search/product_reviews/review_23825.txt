What a great price for these! I bought them for my boyfriend for Christmas.  He has a wider face and they fit perfectly.  I'd recommend these for those with bigger faces as they are the bigger frames.  I can't stress enough how important (and easy) it is to go to a Ray Ban dealer and try these on before buying them -- you are really saving yourself time.  They came with a beautiful brown case as well.  I am used to the black cases so this was a surprise to me!  My boyfriend couldn't be happier with them.  He has had a more modern pair of Ray-Bans for a few years but now he only wears these!  Ray-Ban is seriously the best brand of sunglasses you can get!
