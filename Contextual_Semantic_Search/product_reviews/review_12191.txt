I typically wear a size 12 (with some Reef's I even wear an 11).. I ordered the XXL size of these Rainbow sandals and they fit perfectly.. the straps are a bit tight but will loosen up after a while.Also - these came in a sealed plastic bag, and have a very strong &#34;new&#34; smell to them.. enough to give me a headache.. I set them outside to air out for a bit.
