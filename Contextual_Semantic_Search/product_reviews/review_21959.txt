This is the very best combination of a house shoe and comfort shoe that I have ever owned. If you want to run to the store or other quick errands and don't feel like socks and laces then these are just the shoe for you. Great with or without socks. Gives great support that regular house shoes don't. I like the grey ones so much that I purchased a pair of the navy blue also. Anyone with Arthritic conditions will absolutely enjoy these. I purchased mine about 1/2 size larger and they fit just right with or without socks. I normally wear size 12 and I purchased these in a 12 1/2. Great fit from day one.
