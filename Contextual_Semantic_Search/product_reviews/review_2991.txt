My husband's favorite winter jacket finally wore out.  He was heartbroken.  Naturally, I went to Amazon to find him a new one.  Looked at many, many jackets and read reviews.  Finding this Carhartt Jacket, reading the reviews, I ordered it.  I told him about it and he just knew he wasn't going to like it, it wasn't going to fit - blah blah blah.  Well, it arrived just in time for the severe below zero weather.  This jacket is everything it claims to be - keeps him warm in below freezing weather, looks sharp, has the inside pockets which are a must for my husband.  He's 6'1 and 250 lbs. and most things I buy for him are XXL.  Went with XL on this jacket because it's a Tall and it fit him perfectly!  Highly recommend.
