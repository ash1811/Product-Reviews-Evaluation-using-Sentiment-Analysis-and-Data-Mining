I bought these Spira Women's Classic Leather Walking Shoes to take with me on a trip to Europe last summer. I put them on in Brooklyn the night before we boarded the Queen Mary 2 to cross the Atlantic on July 6. They were my only pair of shoes during the entire ten-day voyage to Hamburg with a stopover in Southampton for a shore excursion to Stonehenge, Salisbury Cathedral, and the New Forest. They were also my only pair of shoes during our ten-day Germany/Austria car trip. I really put the shoes to the test with all the walking we did, especially in Weimar where we couldn't drive the car anywhere and had to walk everywhere (Think of Colonial Williamsburg in Germany).Then I wore them back across the Atlantic to New York. By then I had to get new shoes! The pair I wore to Europe lasted me only one month.
