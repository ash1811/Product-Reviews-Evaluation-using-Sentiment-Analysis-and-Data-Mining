Everything about this bra would be totally awesome if it fit right. I normally wear a 36DD, but knowing that each manufacturer does their sizing a little bit different, I retook my measurements according to the directions on this item's sizing charts & got 1 36DDD & it was too small - I leak out the top & sides some. So, if you want to get this one, go bigger than normal! Otherwise it's a great bra for busty women. No bounce, keeps you dry, & the look of it isn't half bad.
