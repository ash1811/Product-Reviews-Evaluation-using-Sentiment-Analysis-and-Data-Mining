I bought these shoes so I could have something to wear at work and while I am out and about not at work.  I guess I thought they would look just a little bit more professional than they do.  My bad.  I ended up sending these back and getting a pair of Dockers that look very similar but don't have the silver metal lace holes.  They were very comfortable and I would buy another pair no problem if I didn't need to wear a nicer shoe for work!
