Not really small I'd say, but not large like a backpack, it is just right for me (male, 5'11" 170lbs, age 66). Good as a daypack. Waterproof, lots of padded pockets (big and little). Good flaps, magnetic closures (don't store magnitized strip credit cards near them), and zippers. It can hold a lot and quite a variety. Great quality. I will be using this mainly for travel and carry-on luggage. It is very versitile and lightweight and attractive. I do not understand why the price varies so much due to color. I highly recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps someone.
