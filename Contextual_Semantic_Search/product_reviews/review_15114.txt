I'm a 5'1&#34; girl so I knew what I was getting into buying these in a size small - they are too long for me.  I use them for sleep pants and lounging around the house.  I roll up the waist a bit when I walk around and it works great.  My boyfriend is 6'4&#34; and he has the size large. They are a tad short on him but he still likes them a lot and they still do the trick for sleepwear.My favorite parts about these are the pockets and drawstring.  It's hard to find a simple pj pant that with pockets for this price.  I'd definitely recommend!
