The size is a bit smaller than you would expect, so order up one size. Other than that, this is a great suit with good workmanship and quality material. Cheap suits will degrade in chlorine in a few months, but this one lasts. So far it has gone six months without any sign of deterioration. That is swimming three to four times per week.
