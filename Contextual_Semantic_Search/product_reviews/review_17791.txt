Very good databank watch.  not expensive.  the singular drawback that i found is that the crystal is kinda cheap plastic.  definitely not mineral glass like the G-Shock series.  also, because the face is not recessed like many of the G-Shock series, i can see the face of this watch getting marred up over time.  still an okay buy, based on its inexpensive pricetag
