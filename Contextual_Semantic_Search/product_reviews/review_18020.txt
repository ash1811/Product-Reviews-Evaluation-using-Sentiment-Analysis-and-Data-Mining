Recently I gained more weight than I realized and my feet got bigger, that means trying to be in acceptance I have to go up another size,already had big FEET. From what I'm seeing I probably only needed a half size bigger. but it's hard to find sneakers or shoes higher than 10. So when I saw these sneakers in an 11W I ordered them, beause I know the qualiy of Sketchers cause I had ordered a pair before from Amazon.
