I was diappointed with this purchase.  The inside sole of these shoes move all about and do not stay in place, so I have had to remove them. Instead, I have my own insoles for support, another thing this shoe did not have. I do hope the exterior of this shoe holds up.  I expected so much more from a speedo product.Don't waster your money or time on this product.
