Made my 91-year-old mother smile. Can't beat that. She likes the easy-to-read numerals and she loved the push-button night-glow feature. My mother has thin wrists but she says the band fits fine and is very comfortable. All-in-all, a success. Delivered in three days by Amazon prime. This does everything she needs a watch to do. Can't give it five stars only because the crystal is not super-hard -- this will scratch over time. But my mother is very pleased. Thank you Timex and Amazon Prime.
