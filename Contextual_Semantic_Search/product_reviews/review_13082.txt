I've worn Playtex bras ever since I can remember, the most recent one the classic 18 hour.  I really like this &#34;new&#34; style.  It holds me up and in where I want.  The wirefree component of it works fine for me.  Regular underwires just cut into my rib cage.  Am going to buy a couple more soon.  Very comfortable.  Maybe different sizes fit differently as I read in some of the comments, so just for everyone's info--I wear a 36C.
