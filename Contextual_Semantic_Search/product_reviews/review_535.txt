I really like this wallet.  It has plenty of room for bank cards and I do not have to fold up the bills when I put them in the wallet.  The only thing that I was originally looking for and this did not have it, was to have my ID in a window outside the wallet so I would not have to open it up in order to show my ID.  Aside from that, it was just what I was looking for.
