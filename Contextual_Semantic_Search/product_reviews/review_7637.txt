These arrived in good condition and timely manner.  However the maker has changed the product. Not made in USA anymore.  Quality shows it too.  Will use but not reorder this brand.It is now a thin single waffle type that will be OK inside  or outside in winter. Not as a really warm thermal  outside protection from cold.
