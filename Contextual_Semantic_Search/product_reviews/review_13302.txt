In 50+ years of wearing sunglasses I've now gone through four pairs of Ray-Ban aviators.  One pair is at the bottom of Galveston Bay, another somewhere in an airport in California, one pair destroyed after a heavy relative dropped and stepped on them (by accident), and the fourth pair fell off during a motorcycle ride during a brisk crosswind gust.  The nice thing about Ray-Bans is that they tend to last a long time.I bought this pair for the 62mm 'giant' lens aspect, and it fits my face better than the previous glasses did.  Be aware that if you don't have a large, wide face, these will likely be too large.  A few other reviewers commented on quality and fit, but I am pleased with both in this specific pare of sunglasses.One negative comment, which kept this to 4 stars: I wish Ray-Ban would upgrade their glass case,  It is clunky and the flap is an annoyance.
