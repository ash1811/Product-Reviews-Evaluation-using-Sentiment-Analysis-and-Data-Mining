My husband wanted a pair of shearling slippers for the winter. After looking at some that are mega-expensive in big-name stores,  I looked online and found this pair. It was reasonably priced and they looked just like what he wanted, so I went ahead and bought them.  He wears a Men's size 10 1/2 - 11, so I got these in 11. They fit him we'll and are super warm. He loves them! I highly recommend these slipper booties.
