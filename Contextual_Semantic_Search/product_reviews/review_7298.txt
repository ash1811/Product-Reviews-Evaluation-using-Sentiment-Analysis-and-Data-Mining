Good quality leather ballet shoe.I ordered up from street shoe size (in my girls case 1 and a half sizes up) and then they fit without toe squeeze, which is nice for little ones.As they grow a bit the shoe gets more snug on the foot (as ballet shoes are supposed to be) but they remain comfortable for a long while due to the leather being s soft.  This way I've found my girls get a full year of use out of them.Note: There is no left foot and right foot in ballet shoes - you just alternate weekly so they keep the rounded toe shape.
