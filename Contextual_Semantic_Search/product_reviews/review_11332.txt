Ordered this backpack because Jansport use to make good quality gear.  Unfortunately this pack was not made to handle the rigors of middle school and the zipper ripped out within a week.  I understand the need to make profits but if you are going to call a backpack a "BIG Student Daypack" at least make it capable of handling the heavy books and binders teh schoold require kids to cart to and from school.
