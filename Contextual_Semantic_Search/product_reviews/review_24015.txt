I am a Nine West Nuncio fan.  This is one of those shoes that you pray they don't discontinue until you can afford to have every color.  The heel is the perfect height for a day at work, but the pointed toe is sexy too.  It takes me about a day to break them in to perfect comfort, but it is all worth it.
