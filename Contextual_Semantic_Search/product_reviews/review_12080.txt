and I am happy with those... I will buy these black shoes this month They are "no-nonsense" "low-quarters". Not elegant, but will work with a suit or dress pants or jeans....As another reviewer wrote, already, the shoe-laces are round (!). They are hard to replace. All in all a good buy at the price. Cant do much better at the shoe store,I think.....
