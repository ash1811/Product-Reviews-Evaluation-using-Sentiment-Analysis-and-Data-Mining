I ordered this for something comfortable to wear while working from home. The band is nice and wide and provides good support, though I had to use the tightest setting to get a solid fit, which is usually not the case for me. The straps are sturdy and the lace makes it much more attractive than a sports bra or other wireless option. The weird part is the cups- they create a retro &#34;cone bra&#34; look. It's kind of fun, but I was expecting a rounder fit. If you don't mind two torpedos pointing slightly outward, for the price this is a good choice. I actually think it's kind of fun.
