I bought these for protection against a cold ceramic tile floor but would still allow my feet to breathe. They are padded for comfort and they help keep my feet warm. They are so pretty and I would also wear these for a long night of dancing as others said they have done. The beading is a nice touch on an otherwise plain slipper.
