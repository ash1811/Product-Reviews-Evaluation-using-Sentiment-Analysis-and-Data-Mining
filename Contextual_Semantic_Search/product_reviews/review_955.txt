The Whole thig was Huge I normally wear a size 38DDD so I figured I'd be fine with a 40DDD but the straps were huge! Even with them tightened all the way it's like they expected my boobs to be a lot closer to my belly button then my shoulders. I had to cut 5 inches off the straps and re-sew them to get it wearable and even then the fabric was so worthless that it did absolutely nothing other than make me not naked.
