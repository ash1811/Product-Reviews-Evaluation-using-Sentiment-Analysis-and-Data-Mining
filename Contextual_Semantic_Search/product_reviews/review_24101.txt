I purchased these a few years ago, at first they were the most comfortable underwear I have ever worn, but with extended use they loosen, tend to bunch up and all around feel uncomfortable.. Love the fabric, i own their undershirts made of the same fabric and love them but the underwear do not pass the test of time.
