I take a men's size 12, which is what I ordered, and these fit like a size 10-10.5 on me.The shoes are very well made and look sharp...and I've experience with Rockport walkers in the recent past...so I feel qualified in rating them, and give 'em 4 stars...but I cannot fit into these comfortably, hence I'm taking a star off for poor sizing.I am going to try/buy these locally now since the size seems to be such an issue...and donate this pair to our local thrift.
