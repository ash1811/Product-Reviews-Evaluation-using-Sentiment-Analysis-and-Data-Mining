I am constantly buying Hanes t-shirts for my husband for work. They are more of a weekend t-shirt.  I saw a review about the Russell brand t-shirts and they are by far much better quality.  Yes, when purchasing Hanes you will get 6 shirts in a package but you really want quality and I highly recommend the Russell brand. My husband is 6'4, so get the tall...what a difference !
