These were the most reasonably priced cowboy boots I could find.  I needed them for a wedding (yeah a wedding), but they served their purpose.  I do not neccessarly like cowboy boots, so I am not the best judge of them, but overall these seem like nice sturdy boots.  They look nice and fit reasonably well.  They were on the bigger size considering my dress shoes are normally a 11.5 and these were a bit big at an 11.
