I have been searching for a supportive strapless bra for a long time. This one is quite supportive. I wear a 34 DD or 32 DDD if I can find it. This one came in the 32 DDD and I think because of the smaller band the bra stayed up and held up the girls. The price is very reasonable. The only real problem I have with this bra is the center gore and cups come up very high. It would not work well with a v-neck or low cut top. This worked well for a strapless shirt that was straight across.
