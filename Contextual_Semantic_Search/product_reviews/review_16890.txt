I really like this bra.  So much so that I bought another one recently.  However,  don't use the measuring guidelines given to determine your size and cup.  I used these and the bra was much too big, so am having to wear it using the last set of hooks.  When I reordered i brought both the size down by 2 sizes and the cup down by 1 size.  Other than the size, I liked the materials and the style.
