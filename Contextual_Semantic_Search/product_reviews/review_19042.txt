If you're looking for a simple, no-frills watch for someone with a slender wrist, this is hard to beat. It's nicely sized for such people, the strap isn't overly long, and it wears very comfortably. It looks great, it tells accurate time, and does nothing else - no illuminator button or anything else to run down the battery. It's very easy to read day or night. The hands, hour markers and second hand are all brightly luminous, and a few seconds' exposure to a bright bulb keeps them glowing all night. The ticking can be loud, but usually it's not all that noticeable unless you're one of those people who are bothered by such noises. (I wear it snugly, which seems to help muffle the sound.) It's water resistant against splashes, but not immersion, so it can be worn in the shower, but not while bathing or swimming. My only concerns about it are the plastic crystal and the durability of the strap. The strap is very thin nylon, but seems to hold up well, and dries out almost immediately if it gets wet. The hook on the buckle has a lot of play, so it can be a little tricky to line up with a hole in the strap. Also, the buckle tended to itch a little until I got used to it. The watch case is almost more brown than green, so if the strap does wear out or fail, I'm sure a conventional leather strap would look fine on it if the nylon strap it comes with is unavailable.
