I wanted a water shoe for my 3 year old daughter, so she could mess around at the beach and in the creek.  It was a little bigger than I thought it would be in the fit, but it's OK because there is an elastic draw-string type closure to tighten the shoe around the top of the foot/ankle.  Plus, she'll have room to grow.  I'm very satisfied with this.  She's already used them twice and we've had no problems with quality or size.
