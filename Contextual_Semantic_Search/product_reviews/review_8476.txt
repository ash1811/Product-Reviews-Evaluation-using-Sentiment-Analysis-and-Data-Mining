It says 100% lambs wool in the specs for the scarf.. twice. It is not. Its 100% Acrylic. But I only knocked it down 1 star because the scarf is actually pretty great. The logo is stitched on fine, its super soft and comfortable, its a good length, and its licensed merchandise. So for about 18$ its a good enough scarf, though it is not lambs wool as it so states two times..
