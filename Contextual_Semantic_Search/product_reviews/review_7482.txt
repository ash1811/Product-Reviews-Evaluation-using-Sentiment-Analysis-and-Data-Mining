I like these shirts.  I just purchased 3 of them and they are great.  I wish they were wrinkle free but if you put them in the dryer on a medium heat for about 5 minutes it will take most out.  I love the pockets and a place to stash little things.  Word of warning however, these run large in my opinion.  I really think I could have used a medium whereas I wear mainly large in most shirts.So it you want a lightweight and UV protection shirt in great bright colors then this would be a great pick for you.  These also wear well tucked in if you wish.  Forgot to mention the collars are velcro so you don't have that small hard to manipulate button like most shirts that have button down collars.Great buy and price!
