When I first got this jar, I kept getting the urge to wet down the wipes (they are supposed to be dry). I think I'm just so use to wipes in these kinds of containers to be wet and heavy. I had a pair of silver earrings that had tarnished very badly and were in much need of some TLC. I pulled out a wipe and rubbed the earrings down with it. These wipes even removed the tarnish in the delicate hinge areas. The size of the wipes is not very big, but you don't need a huge one to get the job done. One single wipe will go a long way.Works perfect, 5 Stars all the way!
