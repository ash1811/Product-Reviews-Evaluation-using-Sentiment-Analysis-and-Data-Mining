I ordered these in my waist size, in Russet Brown, to make up part of my steampunk outfit, but then actually tried to cancel the order because I worried they would not fit (being men's pants and I'm a woman).  I was worried they would not fit over my hips properly.  Well, no worries, they fit fine (although the zipper is cheap and took a few tries to get zipped).  They also look awesome for the outfit.  They looked a sort of caramel color online but in person they're a sort of greeny-browny color.  Nicely slouchy and Sky-Captain!  Ah yes, they are very long, but since I will be tucking them into boots I don't care.
