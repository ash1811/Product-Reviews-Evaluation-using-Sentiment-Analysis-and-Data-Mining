I've worn CK basic briefs for more than a decade, and used to consider them the best out there.  But the briefs in the package just received don't match the prior quality.  The waist band is stiff, thin and uncomfortable.  The fabric is thin and not as soft.  The cut doesn't seem as good (longer in the sides).  Will not purchase again.  P.S.  These are made in Thailand; the quality has gone down hill.  For this quality, may as well go back to FOTL (Fruit of the Loom) or Hanes.
