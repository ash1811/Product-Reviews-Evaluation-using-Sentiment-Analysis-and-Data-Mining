* Overall i am very happy with this shoe* it is very classy, good quality and light on the feet to wear on. I did not give it 5-stars because like a previous review indicated, the lacing becomes undone for no apparent reason - in my case it happens more on the right side than the left. Also, while very comfortable, i was expecting more from the full-length EVA cushioned footbed with gel heel pad, and All Motion Comfort Technology. With a name like that i was expecting real noticeable exceptional cushioning.
