I put these on after I get home from work. I stand all day at work and these make my feet feel better at the end of a long day. They run a bit large though so you might want to size down.I already had these in the Chinchilla and just ordered the Ocelot recently. These are super comfortable and the Ocelot is adorable, much cuter than it looks online.
