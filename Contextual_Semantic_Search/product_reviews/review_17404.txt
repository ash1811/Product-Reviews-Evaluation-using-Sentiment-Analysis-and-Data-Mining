Ordered 42Wx32L. In normal pants the width would be just OK and sometimes a little snug. Not with these pants. The width is at least 46W actually. The pants are nowhere near the body, at least there is a 4 inch gap, plus if you streatch them the gap could be easily doubled. I would say order at least one size smaller, but I would not risk it anymore. The length is correct though.
