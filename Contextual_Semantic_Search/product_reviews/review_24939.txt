I am 5'9 and wear a size 8 or 10, depending on the cut and 36 DD bra size.  I love how this gown glides over my curves, and so does my husband!  However, with any movement, the front of the gown rides up up too high.  I doubt this would be an issue for a woman of average height.  The material has a lot stretch, so I imagine someone of average height up to a size 12 or 14 could probably wear this comfortably.  However, I am not sure this would work for size 12-14 women, who are my height or taller. The front would likely rise up to the navel!
