This bra is void of all padding, which is exactly what I was looking for since being 32D I don't need any help with looking bigger.  But for women who need the extra help, this bra will be a disappointment, as it actually makes your bust line look smaller (not flat).  I also like the silicone strip at the top which helps keep the bra in place.  No drooping or sagging.  So far so good and recommended for bigger busted gals who are looking for support without the extra bulk.
