Some of the reviews had already said that, but I went ahead and bought the size I always do.  Ended up being just a bit too snug.  Don't get me wrong...I could fit my fit in, and I LOVE the shoe...I just should have listened and bought an 11 and not a 10.5.  Needless to say, I ended up swapping it out FOR an 11 and LOVE THEM!!
