For the most part this belt is excellent.  The only gripes I have are pretty minor.  The loop will start to bend after awhile and you will have to bend it back every so often and the very tip of the belt is about to fall off, after only 2 months, though it is not an important piece.  Other than that its pretty strong and was definitely worth the very little money I paid.  Highly recommended.
