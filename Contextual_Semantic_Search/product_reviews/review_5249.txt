Gloria Vanderbilt &#34;Amanda&#34; jeans have been my favorite for a very long time.  I've recently lost some weight and instead of women's sizes am now in misses sizes. I wondered if that would make a difference, but I'm still satisfied with the sizing and fit. It's nice to know you can order a style and size and be reasonably sure of satisfaction.  I do so dislike having to return items. They also are of good quality.  In the past, I've had Amanda jeans for years, laundering them about once a week.  They really wear well and last.
