If this longline bra ran true to size, I'd give it an enthusiastic 5 stars. I bought 2 of them. One in 38DD for my mom and another in 36C for me. Neither one of us can get into them.I think this bra is fairly well made and as long line bras go, pretty as well. I also like that the hooks/eyes are in the front so you can get into it easily without hooking it first and then having to then slide it around so the hooks are in the back like some longline bras.As for the size: I'm a good sized C cup and might go up to the D cup when I reorder although it's hard to say because I couldn't actually get it on to really tell how well the cups would fit if they were in the proper place.I was able to hook two of the hooks between my breasts but only just barely and the hooks at the bottom I could get hooked but there was NO WAY I could do them all from top to bottom. Just too much of me and not enough bra to cover it all. My mother had the same problem only she couldn't even get the hooks closed AT ALL from about halfway up to the top.I always wonder about bra reviews because so many women wear the wrong size but I've been measured at Victoria's Secret and Macy's and by myself and I am a 36C cup. I measured my mother and the tape measure definitely says she's 38 for band size and then using the formula to figure out cup size said she should be a DD. So if you are wondering about this bra review, wonder no more because I'm reasonably certain both of us are wearing the right size and also, I never have trouble with too small band size in many other bras I buy including Playtex, Bali, etc.Bottom line: I think this IS a great longline bra, very reasonably priced, especially for a longline and it is very pretty in person but if you decide to order, I'd go up at least two sizes in your bandsize. I intend to get another two but will substitute a 40C for my usual 36C and will be getting my mother a 42DD in place of her normal 38DD.
