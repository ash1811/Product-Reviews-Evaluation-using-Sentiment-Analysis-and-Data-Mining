The bra is wonderful. Quality is great and it's very well constructed. That being said, it is a little scratchy and I had to return it because it does not work for my full on bottom breasts. There was a lot of wrinkling and gapping at the top.I ordered Cleo Lucy 32G instead and the cups are perfect.
