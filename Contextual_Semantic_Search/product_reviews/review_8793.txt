Extremely comfortable bra. The bra cups fitting very well and give a great support. It is easy to put on and get off. However I didn't find that this bra helps correct my posture( and it is not a big deal for me). But maybe that is because my size is too small ( 34B). I am pleased with my purchase and I am gonna order more.
