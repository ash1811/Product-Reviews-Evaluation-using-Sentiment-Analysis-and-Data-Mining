I love these boots for what I purchased them for... Being out in the snow and cold.  They are definitely not fashion boots.  They are big, heavy and clunky.  That being said, I didn't buy them for fashion.  I bought them to keep my feet warm and dry in the cold and snow, and they do both very well.  They fit nicely at my normal size as long as I wear wool socks with them.  If you like to wear your boots without socks or thin socks you may want to get a smaller size than you normally wear.
