I ended up returning these because they were larger than I expected them to be. They are the type of glasses that go from the top of your eyebrows down to your cheekbone and then out to about the end of the hollow of your eyes. I am a fan of big glasses but it was jsut a little too much for my taste. However, the glasses were nice, and felt sturdy enough, and came quickly, so if you like glasses that big they may be for you!
