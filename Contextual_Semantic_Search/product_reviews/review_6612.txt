If you're going to get fishnets and you know you'll use them more than once (even if infrequently), don't bother with the cheaper ones. This is the one to get. The bottom of the foot is reinforced, and the "strings" of the net itself are very durable. It's also comfortable to wear-- you don't feel like the net is digging into your skin. The sizing is good. The space between the netting doesn't appear to get much larger as it goes up your thigh.This will stand up to cleaning and wear, and they're worry-free when they're on you. Get 'em!
