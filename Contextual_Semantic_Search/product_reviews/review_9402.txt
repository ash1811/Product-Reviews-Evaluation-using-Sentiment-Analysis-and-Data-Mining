I just attended my niece's wedding and gave a reading during the ceremony.  It was the first time I have worn high heels (4 inch spikes) in about 10 years.  I knew the church had lots of marble stairs that I would need to walk up and down without a hand railing.  I had visions of falling with my dress up over my head for all to see!  So I searched out products and ended up buying this one.  They worked great!  In fact, one of my sisters went out between the ceremony and reception and bought a pair for her dancing shoes.  I plan to buy more for several other pairs of shoes that are slick on some types of flooring, especially during wet weather.
