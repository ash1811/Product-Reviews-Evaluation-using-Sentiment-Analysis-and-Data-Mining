This is a very nice watch that keeps good time. It's an attractive easy to read watch that's priced right. The Indiglo and date features are nice added bonuses. The band is almost perfect. At first it fit a little tighter than I liked, but I easily adjusted to the fit. I would buy again if I needed too, but I really hope this will serve me well for years to come.
