I got these specifically b/c I have long and narrow feet (A width heels, but normal width forefoot).  Regular slippers just fall off my feet after a few steps, literally.  These stay on.For wider foot folks, I'm not sure how they'd do... but for normal and narrow feet, they are great.  Nice quality sole materials also (not cheapo fluff).
