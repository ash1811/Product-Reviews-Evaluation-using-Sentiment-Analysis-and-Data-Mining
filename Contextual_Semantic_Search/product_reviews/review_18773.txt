These shoes are definitely crisp, clean, and white.  The only thing I didn't like was that they don't lace up very far on your foot.  I like my shoes to lace up farther, so they feel snug on my foot.  Next time, I will be a little more observant, and make sure there are plenty of eyelets to lace up.
