These can't be real Levi's?!; the fabric is thin as a handkerchief and the stitching is cheap single stitched cotton thread. If I had the chance to feel these before buying of course I would NOT have bought them and bought the real thick Levi's jeans. Costs more to ship back from here overseas than the jeans cost.Very disappointed in Amazon because these were sold through Amazon.
