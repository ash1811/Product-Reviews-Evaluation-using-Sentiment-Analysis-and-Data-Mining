These flats were incredibly comfortable and would be great as slippers or to wear around the house, but they are kind of wide and didn't look that nice. They kind of make it look like you are wearing clown shoes. Perhaps if I had tried a smaller size (I wear a size 8 and therefore got the large based on the sizing chart) the fit would have been better.
