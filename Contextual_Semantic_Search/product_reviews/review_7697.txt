Some time back I  bought the Perry 1 1/2&#34; suspenders. I like them but they are a little too weak to really do a good job of holding up Jeans. Sooo...I ordered a pair of the Perry 2&#34; heavy duty ones. I like them too. But they are an overkill, for me.There's almost no give to them so they are always reminding me that they're there when reaching, etc. Finally, I got this 2' pair & they're JUST RIGHT. They hold up my pant's under any condition, but there's enough give that I forget they're on most of the time. Both these & my 1 1/2&#34; ones tend to lose their adjustment by slippage at the buckle. I fixed this by just running a bead of &#34;Shoe Goo&#34; on the back side where the web feeds through the buckle. Really, I just love these things & now I no longer have to cinch up my belt so much & the belt hooks will never unhook, like the kind that clamp on to your pants do.
