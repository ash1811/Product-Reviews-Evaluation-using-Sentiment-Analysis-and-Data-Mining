I love running, and I hate when flat or small chested woman tell me to get a breast reduction surgery. I wish I could slap them in the face.  its not my fault I have big boobs or that guys prefer my boobs over theirs. I love this bra, it is the best; most supportive bra I have ever had. I can finally run without pain or discomfort.
