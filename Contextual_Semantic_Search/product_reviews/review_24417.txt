Nice quality, I can see that I'll get good use out of these shoes but I normally wear a 8/8.5 and ordered up a size.  These are still small.  They've improved as the top has stretched out but even the sole is shorter than what I'd consider an average 9.  I'll keep them as I think I can make them work but would order an even larger size next time.
