The fit of these pants are very bad for me. The waist of the pants fits as they should (I bought a 32x30), but the seat of the pants hang down about 1.5x too far. This unfortunately makes it feel far too baggy to be comfortable. I will point out that I normally wear a pair of Levi's 505's or prAna Bronson's, both 32x30, so that is the fit that I am used to.Another thing I noticed is that there is a tag on the pants that say &#34;relaxed&#34; fit, but there is no mention of this on the product page.On the plus side, the quality of the fabric feels to be pretty good. They feel quite thick and should be able to handle a beating. The overall style is pretty good. I would feel comfortable wearing it to work, then straight out for a hike. I also like the zippered side pocket, which feels like it will be super useful on a hike for keys etc. Unfortunately, I have to return this pair due to the poor fit.p/s: Also take note that these are apparently NOT the same as the &#34;Ultimate ROC&#34; pants, which have a different style, at least according to the Columbia website. Why they named these pants so similarly, I don't know.
