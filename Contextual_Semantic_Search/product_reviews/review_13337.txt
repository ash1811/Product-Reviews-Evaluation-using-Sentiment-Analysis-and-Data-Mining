I was looking at this watch to buy for myself as a holiday present.  My husband ended up coming into my home office and asked if I wanted it .  I said yes, and glad I did.  It can be worn as a dress watch or casual.  I usually need a second hand, which this does.  It keeps very good time and looks good with my gold bracelets.
