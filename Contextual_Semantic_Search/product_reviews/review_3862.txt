I had such high hopes for this garment. It's PRETTY, well constructed, relatively lightweight, came in higher sizes, and had decent firming and control for a time, but this garment is soooooo UNCOMFORTABLE! I found the material scratchy and hard, it also didn't really "give" or conform to my body. While the upper half did do a decent job of holding me in, the lower half was an  EPIC FAILURE!  The legs kept rolling up, and that made the whole thing constantly twist, UGGH! Needless to say I spent the day adjusting, and by the end of the day I was peeling myself out of this shaper in pain with red marks from all the twisting and adjusting. I made my purchase based on the reviews I'd read, I bought it in black, white, & beige. I wish people were more forthcoming and analytical in their reviews, it would have saved me a great deal of time and disappointment.  Maybe it's me but I returned the 2 I didn't wear and my search continues. So sad...
