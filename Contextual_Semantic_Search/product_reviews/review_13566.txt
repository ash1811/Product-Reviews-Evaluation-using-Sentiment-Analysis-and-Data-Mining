Taking off my shoes and slipping into comfy slippers is one of the little things in life I look forward to each day. Unfortunately, with these slippers, I am now dreading putting them on each evening. They were somewhat comfortable at first, but after two weeks of wear, the cushiony insole is all squished down, and not providing much cushion any more. But the worst thing about these slippers is the hard rubber sole which makes them extremely noisy when I walk on my hardwood and tile floors! I usually get to bed at least an hour after my husband, and he has actually asked me to PLEASE go out and buy new slippers because I wake him up each time I walk through our bedroom!! Yes, I suppose you can wear them outside, but I have had other &#34;indoor/outdoor&#34; slippers which aren't as hard bottomed, and therefore don't sound like I'm walking around in tap shoes!! It may sound silly, but I just feel like part of the joy of slippers is to be able to quietly pad around the house..not a concept in this pair.
