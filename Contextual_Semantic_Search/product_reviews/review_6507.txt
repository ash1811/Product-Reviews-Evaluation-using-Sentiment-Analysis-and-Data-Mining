I haven't yet danced in them, but they seem much more durable than my other pair of tights. I ordered a S/M when I should have ordered a M/L, but they fit quite well save the waist elastic (which I will be adjusting). Be aware, the color is very vibrant. I'm hoping they fade slightly after some washes.
