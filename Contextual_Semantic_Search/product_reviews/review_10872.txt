These desert boots are the same high quality you remember from college. They are sturdy, light and look good with everything. Just brush the suede now and then, and your good to go.  Note for those with podiatric issues: traditional Clark desert boots are not cushioned, except for the incidental cushioning of a crepe sole. You can compensate, however, by inserting a Dr. Scholl orthotics, which are available everywhere. I did that and compensated by ordering a half size larger than I would have. Presto! Perfect!
