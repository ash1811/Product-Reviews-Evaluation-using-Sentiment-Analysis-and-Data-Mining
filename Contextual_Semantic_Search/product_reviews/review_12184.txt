THEY WERE NICE LOOKING BOOTS BUT MY HUSBAND WEARS AN 11.5 AND HE HAS A NARROW FOOT BUT THESE WERE TOO SHORT IN LENGTH FOR HIM SO APPARENTLY THEY RUN SMALL. I HAD TO SEND THEM BACK. I FOUND THAT HE COULD WEAR THE 11.5 IN A LOGGERS BOOT JUST FINE JUST CATERPILLARS RUN ON THE SMALL SIDE,SO IF YOU WANT THEM TO FIT THEN YOU SHOULD ORDER A SIZE BIGGER.
