I love the feel of this compression undergarment.  My only issues are that the collar has discolored from rubbing on my neck (despite washing, of course!) and the neckline is also a little warped from repeated removal of the garment over my head.  I will try to use more concentrated bleach along the neck line to get it back to pure white, but the warping will not go away. I like a nice, clean smooth neck line to show under my overshirt and looks like I have lost that at this point. For the price and quality, I would have expected the neckline to be better preserved.  Delivery time was outstanding.
