I probably have about a dozen or so of these in just about every available color. Totally worth it. I wear them to work everyday and I have no complaints. They go through the washer and dryer like a champ. The longevity is good. I have never had to throw any out in the year and a half or so since I've been wearing them. They show age after a while with heavy usage but it's minimal and you cant feel the difference.
