I'm a drummer and I play speed metal so I need shoes that are lightweight and good for double bass pedals. I've tried a lot of different types of shoes and brands, like Nike, Adidas, Converse, Vans, etc. and these new balance are the way to go. They are very comfortable, they fit perfectly, they last for years and years and they are great for running. I'm 100% satisfied with this purchase.
