hubby looks &#34;hott&#34; in the old 505 but these?  ugghhthey came out of the dryer wrinkled up.  quality of jean material is shoddy.also, the pockets were stitched in to the leg.  such poor workmanship.so bad, itz funny.  since needing new jeans this year, i will be buying carhartt or dickies for work jeans.these are Junk !!
