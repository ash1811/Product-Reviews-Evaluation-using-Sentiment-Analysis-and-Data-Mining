Price wasn't that much better than others at stores, but I got the style I wanted, the color I wanted, and time will tell how durable they are. I'd say these are &#34;more polarized&#34; if that's possible, than the ones I've bought cheap at places like academy. These fit great, and they are definitely polarized, as looking at my lcd monitor from different angles and heights reveals quite handily.
