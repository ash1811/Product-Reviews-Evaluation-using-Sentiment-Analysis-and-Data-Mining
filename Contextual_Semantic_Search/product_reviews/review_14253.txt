Bought this sweatshirt and really should have followed the previous reviewers suggestion to size down. My medium fits like a large (or XL if you're used to more fashion-oriented sizing). The neck hole and lower cuff (around the waist) are narrow and fit snug, but the body and arm is very boxy and generous in room. The shoulder is also very roomy and long - the seam where the sleeve and shoulder meet is about 2.5 - 3" past where my shoulder is. As a point of reference, I could cross my arms inside the sweatshirt and still have plenty of room to spare. I'm 6' 180 with a 15.5" neck, 39" chest, and 33" sleeve.Update: I exchanged the medium for a small and the fit is PERFECT! The body is trim with enough room to wear a button-up shirt without feeling tight and the sleeves are slim. The length is also generous so if I lift my arms up my midsection doesn't show. Overall the cut of the small sweatshirt is very flattering if you usually wear medium and like to wear your clothes with tailored proportions, not baggy and not skinny-fit.
