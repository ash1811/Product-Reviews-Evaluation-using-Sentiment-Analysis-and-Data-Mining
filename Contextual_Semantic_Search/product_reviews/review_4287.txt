I loved my Keen sandals, mostly due to nice fit, they were a little sweatty though.  So much that I bought the shoes (very good), bought the work boots (steel toed also very good), bought the socks (not so good).I don't honestly wear the H2 sandals that much, maybe had them about a year (bought them last late summer/fall), but live in the northeast so its mostly a summer shoe, 4 -5 months a year or so.  So we went to Grand Tetons, these were my "off hiking day" shoes for the trip.  We did a 6 mile flat hike and the backs ripped out of one of them. By the way the socks have holes in the sides (not heals or toes like you might expect).  Used to be all their products seemed to have 5 star ratings... me thinks the expansion to all kinds of shoes may be causing some kind of performance issues.So not much use, the treads on the bottom frankly look brand new but the heels ripped.  I dunno if I will get another Keen shoe, I am seeing some of their newer stuff has some bad ratings.  Still I'd take them over almost anything Teva, but not at full price. I guess I would take another shot for $50 or $60... but for $100 they need to last more than a season.
