I'm not pleased with the quality or look.  I bought this same exact boot in brown many moons ago, and I absolutely love that pair.  Decided I needed a new black boot so ordered this one.  The leather feels thin and the boot looks cheap - definitely not up to standard of the boot I bought years ago.  It still has the same quality rubber sole and it fits fine so for the price of a little over $100 I guess it's okay, which is why I kept it, but I would look elsewhere or to another line.
