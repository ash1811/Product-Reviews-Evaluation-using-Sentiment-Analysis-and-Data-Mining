To start with, the night lite isn't any good, putting out a washed out blue/green light that shows the numbers up as an almost impossible to see pale yellow!  I quit wearing it after a few days, threw it in a box and forgot about it.  It is now long past time to return it and so I am throwing it in the garbage.  Am taking a loss on this sorry piece of junk, but learned a good lesson about buying such items without first trying them.  MY ADVICE TO ANYONE CONSIDERING THIS WATCH IS TO FORGET IT, YOU WON'T BE SORRY!  If you feel a compelling need to buy it, please, please go to the nearest Walmart Store and try one out first.I have owned low priced Timex watches in past years that had great nite lights, but not this expensive model.  HOW SO VERY SAD!UPDATE:  The poor rating I gave the Timex Ironman watch is based soley on the horrible nite light which is of the greatest importance to me.  If I can't see the time in the dark without using a flashlight, it is totally worthless.  If you never have need of a nite lite, then this is probably a great watch.  Too bad there wasn't a short consumer video showing the sorry nite lite - it would have saved me much needed dollars.
