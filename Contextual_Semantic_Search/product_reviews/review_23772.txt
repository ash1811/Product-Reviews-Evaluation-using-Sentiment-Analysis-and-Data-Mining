If you've got animals, be prepared to use a lint brush ALWAYS.  The high polyester content, I'm assuming, acts like a magnet for any type of lint, hair or even carpet fibers.  As for the fit, I am 165 lbs and 5'7 1/2&#34;, but have long legs.  Based on one of the comments from someone who is similar in height and weight to me, I ordered the average large, thinking, as she stated, would be long enough.  The size was great, even a little roomy, but definitely not falling off of me, but the length was too short.  They are lightweight and comfortable.  Had it not been for the fabric (lint attracting), I would have gotten these in the large and just had them hemmed, since the price was terrific.
