Only gave 4 star because of sizing...but Levis are great.  Ordered these for my son 6'3&#34; athletic build (they wear their clothes tight now) and he normally wears a 31&#34; waist in regular pants but the 31's were way too small - I reordered 34&#34; and he still has the slim fit jeans but now he has room to breath. are He loves them - but they very SLIM...just order right size.
