I received my 8932A last week and was very surprised to see such a great looking watch for a very affordable price. I took a few links out myself and it fits perfectly and looks like a million bucks. So far the time has been perfect. I liked it so much I bought one for my dad and also the 1770 Pro Diver for with the red and black bezel for myself. Highly recommend these to anyone looking for a great looking daily wear watch at just a fantastic price.
