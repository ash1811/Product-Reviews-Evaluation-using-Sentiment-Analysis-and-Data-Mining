The sizing said they will fit women who wear size 6 1/2 to 7 1/2.  I wear a 7 no matter what company makes the shoe and these are snug  so I would classify them as suitable for sizes 6 to a small 7.  The seam at the toe rubs a bit but I hope this will pass as the slippers stretch out a bit.  I bought them for dancing at a wedding.
