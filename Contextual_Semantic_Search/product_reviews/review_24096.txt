I bought these along with another brand on here to test them out.  These are very soft and comfortable but I found that they were shorter than I originally thought.  They are closer to briefs than boxer briefs I think.  There is also no fly so just FYI for you guys.  All in all I like them but not as much as I like the other pair I got on here that were rated the top on amazon for boxer briefs.
