I've been very familiar with the Timex band as 80% of the watches I've bought in the last decade have been Ironman Timex watches.  So the familiar feel of the buttons was a great plus to buying this watch.The only downgrade from previous versions of the Ironman is the 50 lap "memory".  I've had other Ironmans that allow you to save previous runs, swims, bikerides, or whatever else you've been timing.  Now you can only save one... with up to 50 laps.  When a new time starts, you must delete your old one first.But my biggest complaint is the band.  When I first put the watch on my wrist I fell in love with how it feels.  The unique look of the band also fit my wrist like a glove and I thought I had the perfect watch.  Unfortunately, it has just suddenly came off twice in the last half year I've owned it.  And not from anything too rough.  The last time I was just driving.  And putting it back on was worst than solving a Rubik's cube.  And if you want to replace the band, forget it, findng a replacement has been fruitless thus far.  A price to pay for such a unique look.Recommended?  In the end, no, I regret buying this watch.  If they can figure out how to keep it held together better this would be a wonderful watch to own.  Though 2-3 times more expensive, my favorite watches of late were made by Nike.
