I recently purchased my Invicta Pro Diver #8926 and am impressed with what I got for the money.  This is a superb dive watch, and I own or have owned over a dozen dive watches, since I started diving in 1975.  The dive watch is not the primary piece of equipment that it used to be, since the advent of dive computers, the dive watch has been relegated to the role of back up piece of equipment.  However, most divers that I know wear one, and the Invicta Automatic Pro is an excellent choice.  It keeps reasonably accurate time.  The Miyota 21 jewel movement is a reliable workhorse that has proven itself over time. This watch has all the necessary features required by a dive watch- 20 atm case, one way ratcheted bezel, all stainless steel, etc.  It looks fantastic, like it should be way more expensive.  The only drawback, is that the stainless steel bracelet won't fit over a 6 mm wetsuit sleeve.  I suppose that you could get a rubber, urethane, or velcro band at a dive shop.  Oh well, when diving in cold water I will use a Casio G-Shock which is wrapped around my console.  All in all, the Invicta Automatic Pro Diver S2 Watch #8926 is a beautiful watch, feels good, looks great, and is certainly well made.
