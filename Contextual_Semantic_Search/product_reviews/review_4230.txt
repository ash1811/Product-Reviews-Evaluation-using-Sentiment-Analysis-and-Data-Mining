Although the fit was good and the bra itself was comfortable, I returned this bra due to the uncomfortable &#34;buckle&#34; type adjuster on the strap.  I could constantly feel it digging into my shoulder blades.  Since I wear this type of bra all day (not for sports), the straps have to be comfortable.  Instead I'm keeping the Lily of France Sport in Action sports bra.  The straps aren't adjustable but fit fine on me and feel divine compared to the Natori straps.
