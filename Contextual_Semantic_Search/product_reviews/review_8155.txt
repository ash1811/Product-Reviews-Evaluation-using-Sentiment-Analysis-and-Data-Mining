I put this on this morning and realized that I had never written a review on one of the best products I ever purchased.  In looking at my puchase history I was shocked to see that I purchased it in January, 2008!  And I still wear it every cool morning.I purchased the "one size fits most", color silversage (not shown now- too bad, it is very pretty) from the same vendor.  It arrived wrapped in tissue with a handwritten thank you note!  Not an every day occurence on an Amazon purchase.This is a very heavy, warm robe.  It might be too heavy for some people, especially if elderly or frail .  For me it is perfect.  I don't wear this as a house robe.  It doesn't get extremely cold here so I use this fall thru spring when I take the dogs out in the backyard in the morning, sitting by the pool drinking coffee, etc.  In summer I use it as a wrap after swimming- even when it's 100 degrees, the quick evaporation in a dry climate leaves you chilled.  But after five years of very hard use, it has held up well.  Other than some fading and fraying at the collar you would never believe it is so old.Update 12-31-13:  Ok evidently I jinxed it by writing a review.  The past three or four washings it has come out of the dryer looking more worn and frayed.  So evidently five years is its limit when constantly exposed to sun, chlorine and laundry :-)  I just ordered a new one- one size fits most in navy blue :-)Update 1-9-14:  Received my new robe and other than color it is exactly like my first.  No tissue paper and thank you note tis time, but it is fullfilled by Amazon now and got it in 2 days.  A little squished from being in the bag but since these are like giant towels, one wash and it is soft and cozy.
