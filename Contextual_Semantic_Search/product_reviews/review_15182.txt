I will be ordering more of these.Fit is generous without being over-sized.--Shoulder, seam to seam: 21.5 inches--Arm length (across the top): 7.75 inches--Length (from top of the collar on the back): 30.25 inchesThese are heavyweight fabric with a nice satiny finish. In all respects they appear to be very good quality. They compare favorably to more expensive shirts. Origin is El Salvador. Note that Prime eligibility depends on color.
