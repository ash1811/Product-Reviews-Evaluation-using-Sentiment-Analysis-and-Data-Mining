My mom has worn this bra since I was little.  She loves this bra and has never tried another one.  I never liked it from the time I started wearing bras and thought it pushed down on me unnaturally.  I wear other bras and buy what ever is on sale and fits good.  My mom, who is now 77, has worn this for so long that she knows what size to order and can only find it online so she is really glad that Amazon has this bra.
