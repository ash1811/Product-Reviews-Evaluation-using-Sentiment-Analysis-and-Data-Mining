I own the Swiss-quartz version of this watch (which is brilliant) and I was expecting the lower Japanese movement to be similar in build quality and construction. Unfortunately it is not. I purchased this as a gift for a family member figuring that it would be identical to the version that I have aside from the movement.The Metal on the watch just isn't constructed with the same material as it is on the higher end Swiss models that Invicta makes. The crown and chronograph buttons feel as if they can be easily stripped when screwing them down. The biggest complaint I have with the watch is the fact that the watch doesn't appear to have a "lap timer" function. I'm going to call Invicta to see if this is a faulty functionality or if that's just how the watch operates.For those who don't know:A "lap timer" function allows you to pause the stop watch on a chronograph while it still keeps time. This is so you could record a "lap time" and resume the timer and it will jump to the correct position that it would have been at had you not paused the timer. This is normally done by starting the timer with the top button and pressing the bottom button. You would then resume by depressing the bottom button again. This watch just resets anytime you press the second button.On the good side. It is a fairly well constructed watch. The casing feels heavy, but not cumbersome. It looks like a $400 watch, but cost less than $100 bucks. If you're a watch enthusiast or if you've owned anything better than a Seiko chronograph then go for the Swiss model. This applies to ALL Invicta watches.
