The cups were larger than expected, and the padding wouldnt stay in place.  They kept sliding into my arm pits.  I tried to remove them, but then there was to much material and it was very wrinkly under my clothes.  Not satisfied.  I would prefer a thinner more beathable cotton bandeau. This material did not breath well at all.  I was sweating in this all day.  Will not wear again.
