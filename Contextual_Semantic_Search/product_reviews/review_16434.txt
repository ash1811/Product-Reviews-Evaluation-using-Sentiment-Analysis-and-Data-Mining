Cute... but so dainty, you can hardly tell what they even are when you wear them. I mean, I should have realized this by the photo. They are clearly smaller than an earring backing, so this is clearly my fault for ordering them and then being disappointed. I have still worn them plenty, and they have stayed silver, so that is nice. Also, they don't irritate my ears, like many other cheap earrings. Cute little tiny dainty small studs.
