A bit of a surprise.  I purchased two identically sized compression shorts.  The other one provides perfect compression; this one is too big, like regular boxers. I like the material though - feels good, is easy to wash, and dries quickly hung up in the bathroom.  Will come in handy on trips; with this and one other like it, I won't need to take bulky cotton briefs.
