I am a Licensed Vocational Nurse currently attending a transition program to obtain my associates degree of nursing. I have been working double weekend shifts (16hrs) at a nursing home for almost a year and realized very fast that I needed a high quality shoe to keep my feet from throbbing the five days I am off. I actually purchased a very expensive ($170) pair of Nike's that I love. However for nursing school I have to submit to a very strict white leather only shoe policy for clinical settings. I decided to buy off amazon and looked at many customer reviews before selecting this particular shoe. I liked it because visually it's not clunky, has no shoelaces (nothing worse then dragging laces through a dirty floor or stepping on them) and seems a little more stylish than other options. My previous pair of clinical shoes (Cherokee brand) cracked and turned yellow on me pretty fast. They were also cheaply made and uncomfortable. I figured I'd try these sketchers a try.They were worth it by far. They shipped fairly rapidly (5 days) and came in great condition as described. I got a size six, which I was nervous about since I range from a 5 1/2- 6 1/2 depending on the shoe. The six fits perfectly. The shoes are incredibly comfortable, so much so that I've started wearing them to work as well to keep my other pair in better condition. My feet hardly ever get sore and I've gotten many compliments on them. I wasn't aware when I ordered them that they are my mom's favorite style of Sketchers that she thought went out of production so she went and bought herself a pair as well. They are relatively light weight, easy breathing shoes. Love them! Great buy for anyone who is looking for comfort or needs something that will hold up for long hours.
