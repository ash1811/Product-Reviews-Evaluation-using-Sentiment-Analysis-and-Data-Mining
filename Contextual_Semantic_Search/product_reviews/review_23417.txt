I was looking for a lightweight tote.I could see why people would love this bag for traveling.Purpose for my purchase when I go to sporting events with kids - I could put their jackets in a bag, zip the bag and put it under the seat. The best part is if something spills on the bag I could wipe it off.It looks very very nice better than on the picture.I got it on sale, I think it's worth it even if you have to pay full price for it.I got in red!For me it's a perfect size not too big and not too small and has a zipper.
