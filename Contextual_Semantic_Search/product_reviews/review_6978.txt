Not much you can say about a sock, but these are great. They are not paper thin like many of the athletic socks you find now. These socks provide lots of cushion, and the upper elastic portion stays up on your leg without being too tight. I've washed them a few times, and they seem to be holding up quite well. I will be purchasing more of these.
