I got these in a medium because I figured the bow would make them tighter at the top than normal thigh high tights. They are still way too tight! They create a really bad bulging in my thighs that just makes them pretty much unwearable. On top of that they come to pretty much the top of my leg because I got them in too big of a size and I am a petite person. They are really cute and look exactly like the picture (I got the black with black bows), but I just can't see ever wearing them because they are so tight and uncomfortable. I had them on for maybe five minutes and had to take them off because of it. I'm 5'1 weigh about 130 lbs and a lot of my weight is in my thighs and hips, so that's probably why they wouldn't work for me. If you have skinnier legs then get them because they would work for you, but if you're bigger in the legs then I wouldn't recommend these.
