I  THINK I'VE BOUGHT 4 PAIR OF MUCKBOOTS, WITH ALL TYPES OF TREAD.  THIS STYLE IS MY CHOICE FOR EVERY DAY USE. A PAIR WILL LAST ME ACOUPLE OF YEARS BEFORE  THEY LOSE THEIR TREAD, AND BECOME SLIPPERY.  THEN I ORDER NEW.ORDERED FROM AMAZON PRIME, AND SURPRIZED WHEN THEY CAME THE NEXT DAY. I'M OUTDOORS PLAYING RETIRED ALL THE TIME, AND CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER CHOICE !!!!!
