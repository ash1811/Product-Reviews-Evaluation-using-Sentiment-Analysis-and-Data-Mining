I'm traveling to Thailand and needed to find a light weight bra, something cooler than normal but not a sports bra. Found it! I am a 36C, not a full C. I bought my size and it's great, only thing is i feel like i could have purchased a 34C bc i have it on the tightest closure and it's not tight  for a new bra. It gives a natural cup appearance (no headlights) and love the sheer mesh back strap area. I also love that the shoulder straps are thin. I will update this review after our trip to Thailand and see how this bra performs in hot humid temps.UPDATE** 6/8/13Back from my trip. The bra worked well in Thailand. I did wear sports bras for day time stuff but this was my go to bra for nicer dress occasions and evening time. I felt like it was lightweight and breathable. May not work great in colder climates bc the fabric is thinner than most brass i own.
