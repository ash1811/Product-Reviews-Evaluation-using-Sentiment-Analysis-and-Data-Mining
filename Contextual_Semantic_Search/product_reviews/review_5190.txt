It's a Timex!  That means it keeps surprisingly accurate time for an inexpensive watch.  At first I thought the strap was going to be its weak point; but it has held up like a champ for nearly three years of daily wear as in 7days a week daily.  The crystal is slightly recessed, which has kept it scratch free in all that time.  However, the bevel has no fared as will.  Most of the silver coating over the plastic housing has worn off.  It there were some safe way to replace it, this watch would be invincible.  And best of all the battery shows no signs of wearing out yet.It looks nice on the wrist and is light and airy, removing one of the biggest complaints about a resin strap, that it is stiff and sweaty.  I will soon be replacing it with another.  Perhaps I will go for a different color this time........
