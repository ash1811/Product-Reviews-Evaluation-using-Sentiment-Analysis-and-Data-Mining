Seiko got it right when they upped the ante on their 7000 series dive watch by making an already great automatic time piece just that much better.  They changed the bezel design completely going with the later models of the 7002 click ring and a more solid construction.  It stays at 200m water resistant and this model came with Seiko's black dive strap.  Wear this and feel confident with the time keeping and water resist.
