I wear a girdle every day - it holds in my tummy but gives me man boobs. I wear a bra forsupport and to shape my breasts. The Bali 3820 double support is wonderful. I wear a 40 Bcup and fill the cups fully - no padding, no pushup and no falsies. My bra makes me standtaller and I am not at all self consciou. With gridle and bra on I look and feel greatin my clothes - women's underwear does just provide the support I need and the shaping Iwant. Would not leave home without my foundations - also - do wear stockings to hold myOBG down (black) and panties (pink)to make it easy to pull on.
