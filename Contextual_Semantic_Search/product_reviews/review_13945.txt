I bought this pair of Lee Jeans for my husband and he just loves wearing them.  That's all he loves to wear, but it's hard for me to find him in his size at the store so l just go to Amazon and buy them.  Great price to!.  Yes I would recommend to buy them.  The fit is great and the color was just like it said it would be.
