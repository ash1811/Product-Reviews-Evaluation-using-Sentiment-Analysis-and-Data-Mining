First off, I'm a young female in her mid 20's looking for a decent and formal yet casual looking watch, and Citizen's women's watch just won't do, since most of them seems to be too thin and flimsy for me. Friend recommended this after browsing on the Internet, and though I'm reluctant at first considering it's a &#34;men's watch&#34;, I'm happy that I took her advice and bought it.I dress in formal (and casual) black a lot, and the color matches perfectly whatever I wear, suit or dress. Burgundy strap with the black and gold surface is simply amazing. I've been receiving compliments from many the first day I wear it, and they never realize it's actually a men's watch. Only thing is the size; it still comes off as a bit loose on my wrist, but it's do-able. It's meant to be a men's watch, after all, so no complaints from a woman. For a guy, they might have some size issues of the strap being too short however.For the function, a few minutes out of the box and it's moving. Didn't even have to read the manual to set the correct time, and the date and day of the week is extremely convenient. Easy to read and beautiful.The price on Amazon tends to fluctuate, and at $105 with shipping, it's a steal.
