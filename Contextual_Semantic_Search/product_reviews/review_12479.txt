I don't normally like to order shoes online because I have a wide/fat flat foot... so support can be weird and shoes too narrow or not tall enough (cuts into top of foot), etc. But these fit perfect. They are true to size as well as cheaper than they are offered in the stores I've been to. I was looking for a chic subtle neutral shoe to be casual/dressy casual with while still matching almost everything. This is it... thank goodness. And comfortable. I will definitely be ordering more keds. This is my first pair (shame on me).
