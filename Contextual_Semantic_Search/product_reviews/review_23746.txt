Only scrubs that I wear! I love how you can wash and wear them, with little to no wrinkling. I love the empire waste scrub tops best, as this one was a bit bulky on me. I returned for the empire waisted style by Dickies. I still love all of the Dickies products. I ordered a large and it fit me a bit big, but that is the way I like it. Im also about 155 pounds, so this was a perfect size for me.
