my husbands ring seemed to be ruined after spending time in a hot tub on a cruise.  he has had this ring for about 10 years and always wears it.  we are not sure but it might be silver.  it has turned a deep charcoal.  he used this cloth and it came up bright and shiny again.  I was sure the ring was ruined but the cloth did a great job.  he did work on it a while though, but well worth the effort.
