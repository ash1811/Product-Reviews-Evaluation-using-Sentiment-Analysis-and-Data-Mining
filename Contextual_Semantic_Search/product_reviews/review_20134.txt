My very comfortable daily dress/casual shoes were separating at the sole and I decided to try this in attempt to save them. So far 6 months later (est 900miles of walking) the sole is still firmly glued to the shoe! It dries really fast, turns kind of hard, so you must apply it quickly once you get it out of the tube. I've previously tried super and gorilla glue on other shoes, and they never lasted more then a few weeks. Give it a shot, I'm sure they'll work out great to repair your shoes!
