Another reviewer complained that seams caused discomfort. I carefully inspected mine and found that the sheepskin in the sole had been pieced together, sewn together so that there are ridges to be felt by the foot bottom. This is an absolute NO-NO in the manufacture of shoes. One does NOT utilize scraps of construction material in this manner. Someone needs to supervise this factory.
