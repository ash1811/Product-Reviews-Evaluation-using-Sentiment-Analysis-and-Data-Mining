I purchased a new pair of New Balance shoes and I wanted a nice &#34;no-show&#34; style sock to wear with them.  These are pretty darn near perfect.  I have worn and washed all of them several times and they are holding up exceptionally well.  They are soft, cushiony, and never fall down over the heel.  They are not entirely no-show, but they are low enough that they look good with some pretty low shoes.  I definitely recommend these.
