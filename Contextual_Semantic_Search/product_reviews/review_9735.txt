I have two pair of this particular suit.  They are short enough not to feel like you are dragging a diaper through the water.  They are long enough and loose enough so that you don't feel like you're advertising your package.  I wear a 32 waist so I bought a 34 to be safe-great fit.  I love them.  They are not shorts so you most likely don't want to run to the grocery store in them as they are exercise length.
