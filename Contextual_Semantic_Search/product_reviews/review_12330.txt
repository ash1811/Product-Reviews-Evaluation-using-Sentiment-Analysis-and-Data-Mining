I debated for a really long time before buying these, but eventually caved and bought them in brown. I bought my normal size (8) and they fit perfectly. I have ridiculously small calves and I didn't find them too slouchy at all. I can fit all my fingers around with room to spare and they still stay up, no issues with the fringe dragging on the ground. The sole is flexible, but not as flexible as the nubby ones on the Kilty mocs. As with all Minnetonkas the bottom is padded to boot (no pun intended) and it feels like being barefoot but better. I walked around for a long time in these at a festival and they were very comfortable, no rubbing.As I'd hoped, the fringe makes a very fun noise when you walk. It's not loud, it just sounds nice. It's also fun to look down and see the fringes swishing around. My boyfriend is someone who hates fashion or anything in fashion that's not traditional and plain but even he loves these. They look great with everything, skinny jeans/jeggings, dresses, skirts, shorts. I can also ride my bike in them and the fringe doesn't get caught in the chain. So that's a plus.The brown dye will come off if you get these wet and dye your feet a lovely shade of orange, so do not use these as rain or snow boots! I have 6 pairs of Minnetonkas (have purchased 10, 4 I wore until they had holes in them), so you could say I'm a fan! These absolutely do not disappoint.
