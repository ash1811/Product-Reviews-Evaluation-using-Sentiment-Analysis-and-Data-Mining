I'm a dentist and am constantly shuffling from patient to patient.  I think these shoes are great for people who are on their feet a lot.  I also tend to suffer from "flat feet", and I find these shoes provide sufficient arch support.Overall, great looks, comfy feel, provide a small heel.  They do scuff to a minor degree, but I've never had the sweaty/damp problem that other posters have mentioned.I find they are true to size (may want to go up half size for thick socks).My only real gripe is that these shoes are super heavy, which one would notice if they walk around a lot in these shoes.  For that reason, I also LOVE my other pair of work shoes - Merrell Encore Breeze 2.  I am also going to check out Dansko shoes, which are also known to be super sturdy but lighter in weight than these Klogs.
