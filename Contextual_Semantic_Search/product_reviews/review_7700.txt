I purchased this Beanie Visor by my nephew, a writer, who lives in Canada.  I thought it is was a fun cap and knew he'd get a kick out of it.  I felt it was a good value for the price and was pleased.  It isn't really a thick knit so don't think he'll be able to wear it during the really cold months but am sure he'll enjoy part of the year.
