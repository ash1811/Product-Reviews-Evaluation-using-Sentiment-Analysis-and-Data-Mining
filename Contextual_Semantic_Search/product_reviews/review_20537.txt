I am a 34D and often have difficulty finding a bra that provides adequate support and comfort at the same time. I have spent all kinds of money experimenting with different styles and brands only to be disappointed. This bra provides both comfort and support, and it looks good as well. I can run, do aerobics and kickboxing, or just wear it for everyday use. I would prefer a little more support for some of the exercises I do that include a lot of jumping, however I am still happy with it. Ultimately, it has become my favorite. I have washed it several times and put it through the dryer and its still held its shape well. Although, I have started air drying it to make it last longer.
