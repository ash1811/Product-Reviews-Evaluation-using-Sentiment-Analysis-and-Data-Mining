Wonder Woman wore a leotard so I guess I shouldn't be terribly surprised that this skirt is super short.  My daughter is 135 cm and we ordered her a medium, which should be good for someone who is 5'.  Not so, very very short.  But still cute and they have a lot of fun.  The headband is crazy small and doesn't stay on but it is a cute costume for a lot of fun.
