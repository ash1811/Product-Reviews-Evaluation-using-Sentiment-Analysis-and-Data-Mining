The perfect watch?  Maybe.  But only if you want/need a dive watch, traditional design without bizarre gimmicks, world-class construction, stainless steel band, both day and date display, automatic winding, freedom from batteries, a bezel that rises slightly above the tough crystal to make it harder to scratch it against objects, cool sweeping second hand, incredible glow-in-the-dark readability, legendary Seiko accuracy and reliability, very affordable price, very cheerful orange color -- I could go on and on.  And someday I will.  When I have enough time.Actually, it's a lot easier to name the few things that could possibly be improved.  If I can think of any.  Yep.  Yepper.  Yepperino.Oh yeah: the crystal isn't sapphire.  Then again, everyone says that sapphire doesn't scratch: it shatters.  So let's skip that one.  And I guess mechanical watches can get magnetized and run fast, so you have to watch (no pun intended) out for that.  And we're done here.
