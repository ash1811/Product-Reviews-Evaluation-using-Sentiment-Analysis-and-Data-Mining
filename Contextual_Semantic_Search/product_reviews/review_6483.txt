I have a light olive tone complexion but I didn't know which color to go for since the pictures don't really give you any ideas. Also according to the charts, being 5'5,125lbs I'm a b but really I'm a c as these run small. I bought the toast in size b and light toast in size c. The toast was too dark, better for those with a caramel or darker skin tone. The b was also kind of tight on the waist. The light toast was too light. the toast though is closer to my complexion and since this is for my Wonder Woman (Linda carter style) costume, it will work. The c fit quite comfortably too. I really like that these tights have no lines and I wish I would have thought to purchase dancer tights a long time ago. I would like to buy a pair of normal, non shimmery ones for every day wear but I'm not going to spend extra on finding my right shade. But overall am pleased with the product.
