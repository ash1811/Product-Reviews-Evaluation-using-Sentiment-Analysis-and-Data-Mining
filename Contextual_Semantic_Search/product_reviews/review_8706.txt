I confess. I never read directions on the package on how to use the watch. So its pretty simple to set up. Secondly, looks great on my wrist.  I just wish it had a pedometer on it.  If you're looking at something with a timer, a light and an alarm, you have it. What else does Casio make other than a reasonably priced watch and does what it needs to do? Hopefully I'll have it around for quite a while why I run around trying to get my excercise done or do yard work. This particular watch is my go-to for the gym, yard and just running around. Would I use it for anything else? NO
