I was a little worried about how these would fit because of how other reviewers have felt, but they fit my daughter perfectly. They are very close to street size- I don't think they could be closer. They're exactly how I would expect them to fit. The shoes seemed wide at first but that's how all ballet shoes are until you adjust the front bow. I had to tighten it a lot to fit and then tucked the bow inside the shoe so she wouldn't step on it. These ballet shoes are definitely a great value.
