I would never wear these as a primary layer, but as a base layer with running shorts over it works great.  I run about 120 miles per month and have become a believer in compression.  It simply works as advertised.  You have more stamina and recovery is better.  Providing stability and compression makes the muscles work better and helps move lactic acid out post-workout.  I even wear compression socks.  Yes, they do look stupid.  However, they really help.  I predict that many more runners will be wearing compression socks and shorts in the future.  There is no downside and a ton of upside.
