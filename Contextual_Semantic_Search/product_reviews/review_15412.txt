I bought these as elegant but inexpensive Christmas gifts for my adult nieces, whom I am close to, but for budgetary reasons, don't generally exchange gifts with.  When I saw the quality involved, I felt proud to send them.  They also like them quite well.  The wide variety of available colors allowed me to work with their skin tones and, since both have long hair, also to think what would look pretty against their hair.  The service was quick.
