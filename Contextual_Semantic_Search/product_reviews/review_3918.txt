I have worn this bra for several years and you can't beat this style for comfort, at least I can't.  I try more expensive styles but ultimately come back to this one.  Hopefully, they will never quit making 7959 or I'll be so sad.  The leopard print is so cute and this bra is affordable so you can have several different colors for fun.  Black and tan are the essentials but why not branch out with more colors?
