The soles are durable for going outside and they do keep you warm.  But, now that they have gone up to $40 they are not worth the price given the sheepskin lining is not attached to the bottom of the shoe very well and starts coming off after about 4 weeks of use.  Leaving you with patches of sheepskin on the bottom and parts where it's just the bare "plastic?" bottom.  The sheepskin does stay on the cuff portion.
