I have been buying American Apparel Yoga Pants for years. These all fell apart at the seams in less than one year. In an effort to save the smallest amount of fabric by cutting the patterns with tiny seam allowances, the brand betrayed it's commitment to quality, making inferior clothes.The pants normally last me about 3 years of steady use, washing weekly. But these all has so little fabric at the seams that there was no double finishing the exposed edges. The pants all (I bought 5 pair in the last batch) came apart at the thighs and crotches because of the poor cutting and bad sewing. There was plenty of use left in the fabric so these were wasted because of bad manufacturing practices.American Apparel is raising prices and now wants double the cost of the regular yoga pants for a straight legged version. This is absurd! Straight legged requires no more sewing and less fabric yet they want twice the price? This company is making me feel cheated. I am shopping for better choices at better prices.
