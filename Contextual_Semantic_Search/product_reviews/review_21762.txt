Look: it's a cheap bag that's surprisingly well made for the price, so complaints should be kept to a minimum regardless.But the one thing that vexes me -- and I purchased two of these for gifts -- is that the strap clasp is not placed appropriately.It doesn't matter that the latch on the flap is placed midway up. What matters is that the strap part -- the part on the bag body itself that loops through and back out of the latch to "tie down" the flap -- is sewn way too high for the depth of the flap.Meaning that if you actually needed to fasten the flap closed (personally, I carry a messenger bag with a full-sized flap and no closures whatsoever, so it's not necessarily a must to secure the contents) either the bag must be so overstuffed that the flap doesn't come nearly as far down the front of the bag as it can when empty, or (and this will probably be 90% of your problematic closure encounters) the flap has to be rolled or bunched up in order for the strap end of the closure to be pulled through the latch.Think of it as looking at Venetian blinds, which sit beautifully flat when in their fully extended "down" position, but which are designed to compress accordion-style when pulled taut.This bag will have to pull taut when closed, though it's not supposed to be (and isn't) designed to do so.
