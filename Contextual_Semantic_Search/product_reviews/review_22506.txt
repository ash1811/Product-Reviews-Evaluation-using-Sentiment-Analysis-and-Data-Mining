I normally wear a Seamaster, but wanted a cheaper watch to wear when traveling, being outdoors, etc. I find I wear it much more often than that and it has earned a place in my rotation. It's simple, accurate, sharp looking, and the small band doesn't create a problem since I have normal sized arms. I suppose those that can't fit can easily swap out the band, but I like the canvas / metal eyelet styling of it.
