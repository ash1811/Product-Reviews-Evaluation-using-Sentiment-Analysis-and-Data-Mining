Bought this watch as yet another watch-present for the boyfriend.  It's perfect for everyday wear.I would recommend this to those who prefer not to wear metallic bands on a daily basis, but instead rather a durable and stylish watch..The watch itself is of good quality (After all, it IS Casio), but what really sets it apart is the band.  Love love the tire patterns.  My brother actually wants a different watch with a similar band so I guess we'll be searching for that.
