No... seriously. This is the best shirt EVER! I bought one about a month ago and I've been buying another each week. I have five now. It's all I wear. They dry almost instantly and they don't change colors when they get wet with sweat. I'm posting this review as I'm buying shirts 6 and 7.The only bad thing is the color choices. I wish they had more &#34;normal&#34; colors.
