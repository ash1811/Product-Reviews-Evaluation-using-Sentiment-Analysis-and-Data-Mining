When you find a well constructed product, you purchase again.  These t shirts are very well made and stand up to laundering while maintaining their shape.  The pocket doesn't sag and the heavy gauge keeps me warmer on cool mornings.  I have a pair of white ones and liked them so well I purchased a pair of black ones.  The t shirts are soft and the neck rib hasn't stretched out of shape or sagged.  Some t shirts get that threadbare underwear look after a few washes and it is. Disappointment.  These perform much better.
