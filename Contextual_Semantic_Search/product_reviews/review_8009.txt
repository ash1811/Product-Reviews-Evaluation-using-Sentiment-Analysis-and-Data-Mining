I need a lot from a daily bra and even more from a sports bra. My puppies are DDD and I have loose skin from losing 115 lbs, that double whammy makes it a pain to buy sports bras--or did until I found my 3 faves. This is the most affordable of my sport bra triumvirate (which also includes the Anita Momentum wirefree and the Wacoal sports underwire bra). If I want to be kept in place and have my bosom look separated and sexy, I go for the Wacoal. If I want a bra that sits flush and neatly against my skin and moves freely for Pilates, I like the Anita.For just about any exercise use, I like this Goddess. It lifts and it holds in, though it doesn't separate (there is an attractive monobosom thing going on). I like my profile in spandex-enhanced workout wear with this, cause it brings the bosom up high and the loose skin nicely tucked in with its wide side band. It doesn't let me be as flexible as the Anita, but I've used it for Pilates in a pinch. For walking, aerobics, dancing, really nice.For half the price of its pricier triumvirate cousins, this bra is a workout wonder for DDD girls (who can have a hard time finding a good bra for sweating sessions). Recommended.On, and for me, these run small, so I had to size up. I use a 38 band size in the Wacoal and Anita, but in this one, I had to use a 40DDD, which offers good support and band constriction. To be honest, a 40 band is quite snug. I might even be able to go up one more, but that might be LOOSE. A 38 would have been way too tight--I would not be able to hook it. Please pay attention to the comments about how this runs small in other reviews. I'm not alone in noting this.Be well...
