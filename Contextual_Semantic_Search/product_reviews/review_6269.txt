I was looking for a light-weight, quick-drying, sun-protective shirt for my husband for a trip to Africa.  The cost of "safari" shirts was outrageous.  This "fishing" shirt had all the advantages at a fraction of the price.  The only reason a gave it a 4-star instead of a 5-star is some quality problems.  The buttonholes are not completely cut open.  I had to pull out my seam ripper and finish cutting them to get the buttons through.  It's fixable, it doesn't detract from the shirt after I made the fix, but I would appreciate a little better quality work on the shirt.
