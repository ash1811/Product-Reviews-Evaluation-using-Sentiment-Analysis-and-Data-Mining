These were a gift for a grandson who works hard on his feet all day and on the weekends loves to go hiking. He tells me they are wonderful - soft, warm, and they stay up, which may be his most important requirement.  Of course, I AM his grandmother so maybe he's just putting me on, but I don't think so. Will definitely get him more of these.
