I bought this at JCP. While there, I tried on a few other products that serve the same purpose. This one worked out the best. The other ones were generally too heavy.they pulled my breasts down, making them look absolutely horrendously saggy(especially the clear one, which costs more ironically).This Ultralite Nubra works very nicely with my backless dress, pulling my breasts together to create eye-catching cleavage while providing decent support. How you put the bra on makes a difference in how much support this bra provides. So experiment a bit to find the best way to put yours on. I have quite a few dresses that either require a backless bra or a halter bra or a low back bra. Now I have one bra for all those dresses(and even for the bra top dresses,too!!). Even though I do have halter bras and low back bras from VS, I hate them--the halter bra kills my neck and the low back upsets my stomach. No more of enduring them now that I've discovered the ultralite nubra!!p.s. I am a VS 32D or 32DD for pushup bras. I wish this nubra covers just a little more, but as it is, it's still working out for me-definitely better support than those bandeau bras.
