Peridot is my birthstone.  Twenty to 30 years ago, I purchased 6 mm round peridot earrings for around $110 from I. Magnin.  The oval earrings from Amazon compare favorably in the amount of gold and stone size.  From there, the color and cut of the perfectly matched peridots on the Amazon pair are clearly superior.  The picture doesn't do them justice.  These earrings cost me less than $18 including super saver shipping. Anyone who loves peridots is going to love these earrings.
