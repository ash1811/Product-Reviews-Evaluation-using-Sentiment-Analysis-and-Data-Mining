So I purchased a $30 pair of Tech Treads while in Florida last year, and they were very comfortable, but I didn't noticed they were undersized until I'd worn them for a couple days.  I read later that you should always go up a size when purchasing sandals, so I bought a size 9 of these for my 8 to 8.5 feet.  The day these arrived, I had to leave for Chicago in the morning, and ended up having someone picking them up and holding them for me so they wouldn't disappear from my doorstep.  They arrived on Wednesday, and I finally got to open the box and slip them on on Saturday of Easter weekend.  My first thought was, "OMG!"  I wanted to just leave them on all day, but I've already been to one Easter Egg Hunt today, and I plan on going to another, and it stormed all day yesterday and into last night and this morning, and I just don't want to trek around in the mud in these.  Keep in mind that I've had some pretty nice sandals over the years.  I lived in Florida for over 10 years through my teens, and I can't even say how many I've gone through.  I've had a pair of slip-on Adidas for the last 6 years for the house, plus I've gone through a pair of Quicksilver I bought at Ron Jon's in Cocoa Beach 2 years ago, and the Tech Treads I got in Jacksonville Beach last year.  These are $28 plus tax at Pacific Sunware at my local mall, and I got them for $22+ on here, with free shipping after including a nanostream flashlight for my keychain...and these are just the most comfortable sandals I've ever felt.  I think once I wear these out, I'll be getting a pair of Reef Fannings with the heel air cushion and bottle opener on the bottom.  Don't think I'll ever use another brand of sandal again, and I may even retire my Adidas slip-ons for around the house lol.  Just buy these...you'll love them.
