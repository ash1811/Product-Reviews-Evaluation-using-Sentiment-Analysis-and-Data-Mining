Needed to give a review to help others with 'hard to fit feet'!!! I kept on wearing an old pair similar to these because I have tough time finding shoes like this!!! (I need an 11 W) There are times when I get so frustrated, wearing the shoe box would be easier!!! LOL! But these fit like a glove right out of the box, the width is fine and my heel is inside the back of the shoe!!!Hurray! I wore them for about 4 to f days and then quickly came back to get another pair!! Same great fit!!!The one hope I have now, it that they keep making this exact shoe and DO NOT DISCONTINUE IT!!!! I've had that happen a lot!!!By the way, I threw 2 old pairs away, that's how much I like these, wear them every day so far!!Ok. that's it, try it!!! =:o)
