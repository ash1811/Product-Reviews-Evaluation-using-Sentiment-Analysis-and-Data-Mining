These are the best socks I have ever bought.  They are made well, extremely comfortable and very, very soft.  I have bought (3) sets of 6 each, and they are worth it absolutely.  I have every color.  They are not the very thick sock but made well enough that you can wear them in winter and keep your feet warm but also able to wear in summer because they let your feet breathe.
