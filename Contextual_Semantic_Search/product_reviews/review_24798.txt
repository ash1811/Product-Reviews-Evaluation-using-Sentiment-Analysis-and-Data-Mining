These are not the glasses to buy if you want super durable glasses to wear for the next 20 years.  Obviously.  They are a very cute pair of vintage-inspired &#34;bug eye&#34; sunglasses, styled after something Jackie O would wear.  They are a nice thick plastic and the hinges work well.  If you are looking for something for a vintage look, a costume for a play or party, or just something to add to your accessory wardrobe for occasional wear, these are a great deal.  I got mine right around $12 and I have been using them for a community theatre production.  They've been dropped a couple of times and have held up well to the light use I've put them to.
