The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is that the product advertised says "High MCR" and the product shipped says "medium MCR" for moderate activity.  I learned from the Champion website that the larger cup sizes in this style of bra are only "medium MCR"  It is High MCR" for a 34/36CD and smaller. I'm a runner and need high impact.  That being said.  This is so comfortable! It can be worn as an everyday bra because it looks awesome under clothes!  The girls are nice and high, for you larger chested sisters, you know what I mean! I did use it to go running and was pretty comfortable. I'm still trying to find the high mcr version but this isn't too bad. The trick with the sizing is to get yourself on the larger end of the bra.  I wear a 38 D in a regular bra so I got the 36DD/38D and it fits perfectly.  The 38D/40C was lose and would be of no use in a workout.****************UPDATE****************After several months of using this, I still love it! It's my favorite sports bra and still using it for everyday use under certain tops. Leaves me with out the side bulges that some bras give.  Very happy with this!!
