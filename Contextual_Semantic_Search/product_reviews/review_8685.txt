This make up bag is really well made!  This bag has been used and abused and it still looks like new.  It's travel most of the world with me and my handling has not always been gentle.  It perfectly holds all my travel toiletry items...and more!  My ONLY reservation is that it is large!  For international travel you might find that you have to put it in your luggage rather than your carry-on.  (depending on your personal carry-on) This bag does NOT fit in my carry-on.  Soooo I have a make-up bag for my carry-on and this one,  with all my other necessary toiletries goes in my luggage.  If you do that, the Baggallini Complete Cosmetic Bagg is absolutely perfect!
