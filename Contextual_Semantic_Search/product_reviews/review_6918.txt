Needed long socks because my girlfriend didn't like seeing the leg over the sock lol. Its ok quality, washes without bleeding. Nice material. It's Ok for work as it holds the calf better and stays up. For a retired gent who wears sneakers not 100% necessary but as I said, my girlfriend likes them, enough said.
