We have wood floors throughout most of our home so I need something warm and that won't slip all over.  I also have a high instep so I need a slipper that gives me enough room on top. These are so comfortable and warm. I love them. They don't hold up forever -- I go through about two pairs of these every 1.3 years or so. However, at under fifteen bucks you cannot beat it.
