I really thought this sarong was pretty when I ordered it.  But was I surprised when I received it.  It's totally beautiful!!  I was going to giveit as a gift, but now I'm not so sure.This one is very nice with heavier fabric.the best part is how on the same side, one 1/2 is dark with orange flowers and the other is orange with dark flowers.Very different!MEF
