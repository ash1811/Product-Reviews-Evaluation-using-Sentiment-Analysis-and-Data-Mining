Nice style, good fit, terrible smell. I tried two different pair of the brown. Everything started out OK with each, but about a week into wearing them the musty smell of the leather became overwhelming. I don't mean a new leather smell. I mean a bad, embarrassing, pungent smell that followed everywhere. My guess is something must have been wrong with the leather. But after two pairs of the same problem, I gave up.
