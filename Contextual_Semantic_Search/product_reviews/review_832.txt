first off i'm 4'9, 34 dd, an its hard to find a great bra that actually fit.now because i'm heavy on top, i have the bras that have skinny straps that dig into my shoulder leaving me sore and a mark. this bra is heaven, it fits like the picture.now it doesn't give much lift if that's what you, want but it supports an don't poke you (wire) or cutting into your shoulder.now far as making me size look smaller... yes! and when i wear shirts it don't leave those lines.i will buy more!!!
