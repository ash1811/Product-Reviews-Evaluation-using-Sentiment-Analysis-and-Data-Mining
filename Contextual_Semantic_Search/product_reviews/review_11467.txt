I ordered this and the Rago cincher. Both were too long and added extra &#34;curves&#34; at the bottom when it ended. I didn't look like a better me at all. If you're short (I'm 5'3&#34;) I don't recommend either of these products. I was trying to avoid getting the shorts because that seemed like it was going to be a big pain if I ever needed to go to the bathroom, but I should have probably gotten those instead. Other shorties, stay clear!
