Bought this for my husband.  It's a fantastic looking watch.  I work with a lot of men who have very high-end versions of this watch (Rolex, Omega) - I knew I wanted the look without the huge price tag and this watch delivered.  My husband loves it.  Gave it 4 stars since it's new so I can't speak to how well it holds up yet.
