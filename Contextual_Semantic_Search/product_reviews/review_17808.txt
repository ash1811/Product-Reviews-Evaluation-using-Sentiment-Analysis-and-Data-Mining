It's a nice, inexpensive watch. It's Casio, so it's gonna work & keep good time. Nice looking, easy to read, gives me time, day & date at a glance. Good night light. Manual was a bit tedious to follow at first, but once you get the gest of what's going on, it's not too difficult. If you have a large wrist...forget it, though. I don't have a very large wrist, yet I'm using the next to last hole. Here's my main problem with this watch. One of the reasons I bought it, is to have a second alarm...my cell phone being the main alarm. BUT UNLESS THE WATCH IS WITHIN 4 INCHES OF YOUR EAR, YOU WILL NOT HEAR IT!!!!!! Obviously, this applies to the countdown alarm, as well. Other than that, I do like this watch...LOL.UPDATE: Had this watch awhile now. Liking it less and less. Besides not being able to hear the alarm, I'm disliking the band more & more. As I stated, I don't have a large wrist, yet I'm using the next to last hole. When the watch is centered on the front of my wrist, the buckle in the back is almost to the side of my wrist. The buckle wants to center itself, which moves the watch face to the side. Not liking this aspect. I gave downgraded it down to a 2 star.
