I've purchased this bra for many years. It is never my only purchase. I use this bra for specific purpose in specific garments when I was to have a true shelf type bra that hold your breasts up and out. Wearing blouses or dressed, or even casual tank tops, can make the breasts look droopy and thereby making you stomach area look thicker, and your torso shorter.  With this bra, the band does most of the work holding up the breasts so that the stress is not felt exclusively at the shoulder straps. No the straps are no elastic and it isn't due to being cheap. the do the job of holding the breasts in perfect place and they have soft fabric under the strap which makes them very comfortable. The only discomfort you should feel is you choose the wrong size because they don't have a lot of &#34;give.&#34; They wear like iron and look great through many washes. I recommend never putting any bra through a dryer, nor using any fabric softener or high sudsing detergents that destroy the elastic. (sulfates causes sudsing) Try Charlie's Soap. You can purchase it through Earth Fare.  You will never regret it and it keeps the washer clean as a whistle, even the moving parts. What I also like about this bra is that there is no side breast because of the wonderful &#34;stays&#34; on either side of the bra. These push you side tissues towards the front. Just own it and throw your shoulders back and look great even if you aren't used to looking so good. You will be glad not to bounce all around if that is an issue for you i other bras. Don't let the less expensive price break distract you from getting this bra.  Inexpensive doesn't mean it is &#34;cheaply made.&#34; Remember to lean fully forward while making the connections so you distribute tissue. Enjoy this purchase. Cindy T. God Bless
