This purse is very likeable.  It's a handy, small size and the leather is quite soft to touch.  The drawback is that the gap at the top when the purse is clasped is so large little items may fall out.  With the price of lipstick these days, I won't chance carrying it loose in this purse!  I did keep the purse, though, thinking I can use it for special occasions when it suits my outfit.  On those occasions, I plan to put the smaller items in a cosmetic bag and carry that inside the purse.
