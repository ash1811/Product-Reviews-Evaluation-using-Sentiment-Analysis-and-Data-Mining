I wear a ladies size 10 and this sandal was discontinued for women.  I purchased the men's size 8 and it fits perfectly.  The only difference is a slightly wider footbed, not quite as feminine looking.  So if you're a woman looking to replace your beloved Tango Thong, order two sizes down in the men's sizes.I wear these kayaking, in dirt, water and everything South Florida can put on them, then throw them in the washer or shower and let them air dry.
