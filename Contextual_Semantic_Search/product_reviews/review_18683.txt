3 Timex watches in the past year. All three were great for a week or to. this one the date didn't change properly. Every day or so I'd have to correct the date. Pain in the but. Another of the Timex watches I purchased hour hand moves slightly to slow, after a few months when the minute hand was on 12, the hour hand would be mid-way between two hours. The third Times simply broke, one of the band pins popped for no apparent reason and the watch fell to the ground, the back popped off and I couldn't find it... I used to, and now do again, use Fossil watches. Much finer quality at a fairly reasonable price...
