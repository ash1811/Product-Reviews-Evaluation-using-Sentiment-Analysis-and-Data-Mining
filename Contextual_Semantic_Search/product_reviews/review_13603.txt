I wear black sweats around the house so wanted a black slipper but nothing that would enclose my foot totally. These are OK but a little on the clunky side and because they are 7/8 and I wear a 71/2 are slightly large and I have to be careful especially going down steps. On a flat surface they are better but I only wear with black pants otherwise they make me look like I have big feet. Cushioning is good and toe box is roomy. I think many would be very satisfied with this slipper. It is one of the best I have found except for the size.
