My husband is bald and wears hats all the time, but never baseball caps. He has gotten many compliments on a similar cap purchased in England over  20 years ago. We can only hope this is as durable! It's light, attractive and the venting is nice on our 90+ degree summer days. It runs a bit small, but Amazon immediately sent a bigger one.
