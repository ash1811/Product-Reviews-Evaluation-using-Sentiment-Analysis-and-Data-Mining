The fit was perfect.  The support on the shoulders is wonderful.  I wear it over another bra for the added support I need for higher impact activities.  I don't like bounce at all and I am a 38C.I haven't discovered ANY bra - and I have spent at least $1,000 on sports bras that claim to be high impact but are NOT! - that I can use by itself.  Years ago Champion made one but women must have complained about the uniboob look.  I LIKE to be compressed so my breasts don't fly everywhere while jumping.  This one is great for the &#34;over bra&#34;  and I alternate it with one by Champion that I like just as well.  I am set.
