These socks, in the largest size (sock size 13-15, shoe 12-16), are the only socks I ever want to wear. Though I'm not an athlete, I do a lot of work that is hard on my clothing in terms of wear and sweat (e.g., running a tractor, cutting trees, chopping wood, etc.). Thin socks, meaning most dress socks, don't help with sweat, usually feel annoyingly slippery between my feet and shoes, and because they are thin, wear much faster than these thick Gold Toe socks. I like thick socks, I like the way they feel and they match my activity level and physiology. And the Gold Toe cotton crew socks in the largest size are the absolute best I've worn and of which I'm aware. I like them in black and I like them in white. The black Gold Toe men's cotton crew athletic socks tend to leave fuzz on the off-white carpet, but I don't have this problem with the whites, and so I prefer the whites for wearing around the house. I'm stocked up on the whites, but next time they have the black socks available in the largest size (I hope they'll stock them again), I'll probably buy two or even three 6-packs. (Last time I bought a 6-pack of these socks in black was 2008, and the ones I can still find are still good but for a single sock that got holes in the heel and toe.)
