Awesome little shoes! My daughter has wide feet so I ordered the wide size. It was actually a little too wide (using the stretchy string to cinch them in helped a lot.) Unless your child has Flintstone feet, just order medium instead of wide BUT REMEMBER that you need to order one size up from her regular shoe size.
