I wore these for the first time yesterday. I was very excited, as they had been delayed in the snow storm last week, and put them on for a chorus practice. It didn't take long before I got complements for how pretty they were.I was a little bit disappointed when I got them, as they didn't dangle 1.25" off the ear, it's the entire length of the earring. I don't blame anyone but myself, because I misunderstood.They do sparkle quite a lot, and are very light in the ear. I could hardly feel I was wearing them. However, I did feel tingling in my right ear, which I was not so happy about. But I can hardly blame anyone for my being sensitive. I have since purchased the same in pink, so I'm happy with my purchase.
