There is no question that when it has came down to watches over the past 30 years, Casio has been one of the most influential brands in the watch market. They definitely broke the mold when they became the very first digital watch company back in the 80's, and since then they haven't been duplicated. That shows well with so many of their G-Shock watches, and this one is definitely a great one. The Men's G300-3AV G-Shock watch actually works well not just in the digital readout, but also with the analog movement of a traditional watch. The movement of the hands works in perfect sync with the digital displayed time, has a very high 200 Meter water resistance, and is great for any watch owner young teenager or for the business casual. It definitely suits very well, and at a price that is definitely affordable. I absolutely recommend this Casio G-Shock Watch as a great buy for any watch lover young and old, and for anyone whom wants to be fully in sync by time.Price: B+Setup: B+Overall: B+
