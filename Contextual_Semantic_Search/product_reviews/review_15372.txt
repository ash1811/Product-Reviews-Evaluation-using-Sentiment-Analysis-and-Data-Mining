I should have passed based on previous reviews posted here but I love all the other Spanx products I have tried, including the wired Bra-llelujah, so I really wanted to give this a try.  The straps are too short on my 5'8&#34; frame, so it rides up, as noted by other reviewers... I do not have this problem with the wired version.  The bra is pretty unattractive.  Wireless bras are never the best in this regard but you can do a lot better than this one.  And to top it all off there is some really itchy stitching where the straps attach to the band in the back (again unliked the wired version), so it is not even very comfortable.
