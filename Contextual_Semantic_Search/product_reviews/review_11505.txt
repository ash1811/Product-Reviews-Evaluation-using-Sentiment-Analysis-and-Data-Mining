Victoria Secret used to get all my purchases for intimates. Unfortunately VS bras makes you look bigger. I need bras specifically for minimization. I am a 40D and with other bras it feels like my breasts are under my arms and it is very annoying. These bras fit perfectly and as claimed, they did minimize. No more bump under my arms. I will buy more of these in every color.
