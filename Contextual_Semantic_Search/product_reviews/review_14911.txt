One year ago, I purchased a set of Champion athletic clothing knowing that the trademark was representing mid to high quality line of products.  Having recieved the set, I was strongly dissatisfied with the quality and the cut of the Champion set, PICTURE OF UNTIMELY WEAR IS POSTED ON THE CHAMPION HOODIE RATINGS, giving an approval rating of ONE STAR.  This time, I tried another band, Fruit of the Loom, representing a lower to mid quality range of clothing products.  Checking out the set, the material of the clothing is thicker, the cut and tailoring a better fit than those of the Champion set, the products are much better than expected from this manufacturer.
