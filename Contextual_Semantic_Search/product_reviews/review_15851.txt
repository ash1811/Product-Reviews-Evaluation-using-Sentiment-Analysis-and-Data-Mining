I wore these socks on a short hike tonight after receiving them in the mail today. LOVE them so far.  They are not too thick, but thick enough to be comfortable.  My feet stayed warm without getting hot.  I was concerned since they are made of wool the socks would be scratchy but they are soft and comfortable.  And better yet - they are MADE IN THE USA!
