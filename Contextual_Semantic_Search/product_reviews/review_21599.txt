When I first saw these boots a few years back, I didn't like the look.  However, one day I actually tried them on and omg, they felt so good, comfortable, warm.  I live in a warm state, but often travel to cold states so these boots really come in handy. They aren't cute, but they don't need to be. :-) Love these boots!
