I've held back one start b/c as a few have voiced the illumination for the entire face should have been added. I like the style and feel. I usually dont like to wear rubber watch bands but this one is very comfortable. I have only had it a few months but seems durable and is accurate. I have not any any problems adjusting it. And it looks pretty sporty!11/20/13 UPDATE: Primary everyday work watch. I'm a GC so basically all my EDC/EDW items get a beating no matter how careful I am. I take it off if I'm mixing thin set or grout, try to take it off if I'm hang/mud drywall as to NOT got out of my way to beat the piss out of it. But at the end of the day it IS a work watch not a $200 Seiko so I will use a toothbrush and hand soap at the end of the day and it still looks great! Thought an update would be good for you inquiring minds, SO if you are a desk-jockey who sits in a cube-farm [no offense - no all of us are lucky enough to get paid to play with tools outside and do man-work :)] It will last you forever. great buy!
