The fabric seemed very strong and without flaws, the weight of the fabric was nice, and the fabric had that great Levi comfy,cosy  feel that we all love in levis.  At least if they are not made in America anymore they still feel right.If the size would have been right ( which was my fault , should have measured first and matched to size chart) all would have been well. Again the size thing was not Levi's fault , it was this consumers lack of attention upon ordering.Still a great product, just wish they were not as pricey as they are.
