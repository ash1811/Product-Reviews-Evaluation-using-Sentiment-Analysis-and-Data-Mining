I just ordered my daughter her second pair of the awesome little boots!She wore them with everything from bathing suits to Fancy dresses.Very sturdy and really held up. The only reason I am buying another pair is because she has grown out of the other pair.Highly recommend these and at $40 bucks who can pass up this little pair of boots!
