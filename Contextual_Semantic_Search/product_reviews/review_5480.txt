These, and ALL Dickies brand work pants would be perfect if it weren't for the following:1.) They are stiff as cardboard. Incredibly uncomfortable until you wash them several dozen times or wear them in. If you wear them for the first time and it's hot outside, they are stuffy, itchy and you sweat like a pig in them.2.) A button really needs to be what holds the pants closed, not a clip. When you kneel down to do something, it pops open, which allows the zipper to come undone. Not cool.3.) Waist rides too high and is so tight that if you tuck in a Dickies shirt (which some places require) you won't be able to close the pants. The shirts are a whole different story...... they suck too.
