This is a nice Timex, I enjoy that this one has the day of the week function beside the date which the other Easy Reader's do not. The band is ok, I am thinking of switching it out for a slightly nicer band. I wear this watch to work, it is a basic watch but looks great in my business casual environment. It is easy to read, and isn't too small on my medium sized wrist.
