Attention girls over 5'10": This waist cincher is not for you. It's obviously just not made for tall girls (I am 6'1"). While it does provide minimal support and looks nice, this was way too short to hold all of me in. Extremely disappointed, but if you're tall, just opt for Spanx instead. They'll do a much better job and are much more comfortable.
