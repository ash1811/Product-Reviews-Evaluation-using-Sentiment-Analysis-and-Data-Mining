I always pick garments with the Columbia brand over their competitors, not only because of their consistently high quality, but because if you get a broken zipper or some other defect, Columbia will replace the broken item with a new one.  This happened to me a while back.  Columbia actually donates many of their returned items to charity to be mended (if need be,) and distributed to the needy.Other than that bit of praise for the manufacturer, there isn't much to be said that other reviewers haven't covered.  It's a thick, warm fleece jacket with a high collar and drawstring hems, a more substantial garment than a cheap fleece zip-up.
