These tights were bought in black and pink. Sturdy material. Good for young Ballerinas.' I am so happy that I bought size 8-12, because they fit my tall 7 year old perfectly and I can't imagine how they could fit a 12 year old. No problem with the black color but the pink had a perfectly round hole the size of a nickel, no run. However, as usual Amazon took care of it immediately. Great customer service, Thanks Amazon! I would buy these again.
