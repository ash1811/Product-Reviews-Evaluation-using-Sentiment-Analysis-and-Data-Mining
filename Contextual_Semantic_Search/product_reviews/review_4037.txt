I wanted to return this right away but never got around to it. I hated this. It wasnt long enough and it pushed all of my fat down making it look like I had a ugly pouch. Then the top around my ribs it was too big. It really needs to have multiple slots to choose from like a bra so you can tighten one area and loosen another. If your trying to reign in the love handles try something else.
