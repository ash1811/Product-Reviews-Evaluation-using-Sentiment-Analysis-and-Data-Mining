I hate the hood.  It rides up on my head and is uncomfortable in the car.  That said, I'm sure it will soften after a wash.  This jacket is so warm!Just an additional comment, I bought this in black and the material attracts lint and pet hair like a magnet.  I have other black jackets that don't show a speck but like I said, this material is a magnet.
