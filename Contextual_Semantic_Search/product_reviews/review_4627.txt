Was a little disappointed with this jacket. First of all it is pretty short(vertically). I was looking for a longer jacket. Maybe I should of bought a size bigger(I bought an XL). Also another reviewer mentioned this jacket looked pretty good. Well when I wore it all I could think is mechanic style lol. Descent work jacket and that's about it.
