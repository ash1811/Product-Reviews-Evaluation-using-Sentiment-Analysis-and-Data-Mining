After reading all the reviews I decided to order a size up and I'm so glad I did. I usually wear a 7.5 but I ordered the large, they fit great, wash well and feel amazing!  They are SO soft and have a soft suede like bottom (so if you have wooden floors, these might be a bit slippery).  I wear mine all the time and they are not falling apart and I wash them every other week in a mesh laundry bag.  Very quality item, I would definitely buy more (and did).  My soles have not separated and I wash them a lot.  They are so comfy I've found myself at the store wearing them on accident because I forgot to change them!
