Being a Levi customer since forever, I was a bit skeptical about Wrangler.  Will they be as comfortable as Levis?  As durable?  Do guys wear Wrangler jeans?  These jeans answered all my questions and more.Right out of the box, these jeans feel rugged.  The denim feels heavier than the average pair of jeans.As I put them on, the leg cuffs surprised me.  The cuffs are big enough to fit over a pair of work boots.  No tapered legs here.  The cuffs fit nicely over a pair of Timberlands or other heavy-duty work boots.  The cuffs also have some reinforced stitching so they will not fray.This pair of jeans has plenty of belt loops.These jeans were made to fit at the waist.  Regular fit means just that -- regular fit.  These jeans are not baggy and or "relaxed".Only complaint (minor one) is the front pockets.  They are small.  A good 2 inches smaller than the front pockets on a pair of average Levis.  Rear pockets are normal and hold a wallet comfortably.Would recommend them to anyone looking for a pair of durable jeans.
