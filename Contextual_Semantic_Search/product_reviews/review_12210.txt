I bought a pair of single layer Rainbows about 7 years ago. They are still holding strong, but my wife complained when I was wearing them to church that they were not "nice enough anymore." Hence I bought a new pair. This time I went with the double layer based on people saying they were more comfortable when standing. I have to agree. A word about the "break in" period. I have read numerous reviews that complain about this so called "break in" period and numerous home remedies. I myself had almost zero "break in" on both my Rainbows. I wear them as if I were breaking in a new pair of high-end, leather dress shoes. I wear them around the house in the evenings a few times. There is little real walking involved. I have worn then to church a fews time, also little walking, and they are now very comfortable. I am very happy with the fit, hopefully the Sand color holds up. I bought Sand as a neutral color I could wear with either grey shorts, beige shorts, or jeans. I have tried them in all combinations and they look great to me - most importantly my wife approves. Pull the trigger on these if you want a good pair of sandals that will last several years. Buy from Amazon and they have free returns and exchanges so you can get the right size!
