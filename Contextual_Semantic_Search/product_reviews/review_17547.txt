My son is performing outdoor work in the mountains in France so I purchased polypropylene items to keep him warm.  This was a great price and does the job keeping the ears and neck warm without the fuss and workplace dangers of scarves, earmuffs etc.  I don't know about static electricity.  I have long hair and seldom wear hats scarves due to the static, however, my son wears his hair military short, so it is not a problem.  Highly recommended!
