Even though they are no longer made in canada (china people)  there very good ,clunky for the fashion minded woman  but my wife has warmed to them and says they sure are warm  10 below 0 as i right this..and totally water proof.  again a hot product for this harsh witer,,had to wait for shipment that just came in and sold out in 3 days ,,,  very worthy ....time will tell as to how long they last ,not like the 25 yr old pair i still have and the last new pair i bought 2 yrs ago that were still  made in canada  ...  sorel  kings ..m.
