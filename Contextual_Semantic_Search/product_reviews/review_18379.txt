This is a nice slipper with size appropriate. I ordinarily order an 11 (US 10-1/2) but ordered a 12, fearing the slipper might be a bit on the small size. Actually, an 11 would have been fine.Slippers are not Uggs, but then they are half the price. Sole appears to be of adequate quality but time will tell. All in all a good slipper for the price
