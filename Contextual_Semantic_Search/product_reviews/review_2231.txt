Same problem, different type of stone wash! The main problem is hip and thigh room. I'm wondering if they save money by using less mat'l--making Levi's tighter, or...is it today's fashion trends dictating their behavior? Dunno! What I know is that my legs used to feel good in 501's now...they feel cramped! Had to go to 550's (relaxed fit)--w/only drawback is zipper fly v buttons. But they now feel good w/same waist&length!
