Getting slippers that fit is somewhat difficult....too small and they pinch and are hard to get on and off...too large and they are too loose on your feet.  I measured my foot and luckily must have done it right, so they fit wonderfully.  Very warm, in fact maybe, if anything, a little too warm.  But overall very satisfactory.  And, the price is not too high for my wallet!!!
