These slippers molded to my feet because of the soft leather.  They have a nice squishy interior and padded sole.  I always wear sox with my slippers.  I normally take a size 7.5 shoe without socks.  I ordered an 8 and wear an ordinary pair of athletic socks with them and they are perfect for me.  I highly recommend these.
