Perfect replacement for an old pocket watch that dangled too far from my belt loop for comfort, but not quite far enough to fit in a pocket. This one clips on securely and hangs just far enough to be picked up for reading, but doesn't bang on things or get in my way. Easy to read, pretty, and the little light came in handy the very first time I wore it. My only complaint is that I don't know how long the battery will last since there was no slip to prevent battery use during storage and shipment, and the watch was running when I got it.
