I have a pair of these and a pair of Whispers. I like the style of these better. They seem to be a classic look for KEEN, and I adore the yellow triangle with the ! in it. They're comfortable, cute as heck, fit very well with plenty of room in the toe box, and people actually stop me to ask about them. These shoes have plenty of support without being too snug or lumpy, and will be great on the trail in warmer weather (it's a very cold end of March here in NC). The sole is made of a sturdy rubberish material that seems like it will resist damage and foot odor, and the lacing / tightening cord on the top is perfect for insuring an ideal fit. You cannot go wrong buying KEEN!
