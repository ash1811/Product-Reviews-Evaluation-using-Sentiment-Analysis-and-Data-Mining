My daughter bought me a pair of UGG Australia Men's Ascots as a present. I have worn them every day for several months and they look as good as when I first took them out of the box. They are wearing extremely well, despite the fact that I am home much of the time, wear them constantly around the house, and even take walks to the mailbox with them. They fit perfectly and the fleece lining is warm and snuggly. They are simply the best pair of slippers I have ever worn, and I would highly recommend them.
