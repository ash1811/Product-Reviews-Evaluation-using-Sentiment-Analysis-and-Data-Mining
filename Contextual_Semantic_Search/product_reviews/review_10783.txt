These are a replacement for my husband's other Reef Fanning sandals.  He wore them so much they finally wore out.  My husband has very wide (4E) feet and has trouble finding sandals to fit.  These fit him very well.  That being said, they also fit well on others (with feet of normal width) who have tried them on.
