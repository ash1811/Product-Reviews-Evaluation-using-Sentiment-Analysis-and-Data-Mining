I have tried many swimming suits for triathlon training.  I swim laps in an indoor, high-chlorinated pool for training and as part of an adult swim team.  I'm not great (or fast) but need a good suit.The material of the suit is great -- holds shape well and doesn't fade quickly.It's not totally obvious from the picture or the detailed product description, but this suit has a "moderate" cut to the leg opening (so a little more conservative than those suits that seem to have a leg opening that goes to your rib cage!).  The high neck also helps containing cleavage.I will not hesitate to buy another of these suits.
