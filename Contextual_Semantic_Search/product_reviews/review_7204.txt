Review for Men's Classic Short boots 5800 - At first I was not sure about spending this much $$$$ on a pair of boots.  Most of the reviews for UGG Shoes were good so I gave it a shot.  They are comfortable and warm, I wear a size 10 shoe and the size 10 UGG fit perfectly.  If I have one complaint it's there is a little heal slip when I walk but because the lining is so thick and soft, no blistering.  For me it was well worth the investment.
