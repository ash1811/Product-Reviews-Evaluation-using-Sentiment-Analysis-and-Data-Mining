I decided to try these as I have not had very good luck with other similar styles in different brands.  My niece had a Keen size 7 similar style so I tried it on to make sure it would be okay.  I usually wear a 6.5 but need a 7 when the shoe is closed in.  These have great support and I have been wearing them around as they are also very ventilated and keep my feet cool in the hot weather.  Very pleased with the service from Amazon.com and the price. Would highly recommend this brand.
