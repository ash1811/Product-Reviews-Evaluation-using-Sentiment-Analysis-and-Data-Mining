Jeans have always posed a problem for me.  I have always had big thighs.  For this reason, most jeans that fit my waist usually strangled my upper legs.  I was never a real big fan of jeans for this reason until I was given my first pair of Wrangler Carpenter Fit jeans.  Before getting them, I would always try to find the baggiest jeans I could for comfort's sake.These carpenter jeans, however, are just right for me.  Not only do they feature standard jean pockets, they also feature a hammer loop on one side and two side pockets on the other.  These pockets are perfect for needlenose pliers, crescent wrenches, screwdrivers or just about any small hand tool.  They are also perfect for cellphones when you're not at work.They are also extremely durable.  I've had a few pairs last me for a couple of years before I quit wearing them to work.  I usually have three pairs of these jeans in my closet.  I wear each pair once and on Wednesday, wash all of them and wear two of them again to finish off the week.The jeans have a very baggy fit to them and leave plenty of breathing room for my thighs.On most weekends, I primarily wear shorts everywhere I go.  If I don't wear shorts, I have on a pair of these jeans.Highly recommended for their toughness and comfort.  As stated in the title of this review, these are my favorite jeans.  I mean that completely!
