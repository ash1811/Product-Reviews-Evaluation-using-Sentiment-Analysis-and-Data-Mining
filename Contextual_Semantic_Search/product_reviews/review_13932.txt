After just having bought a pair of bad jeans for my husband, these Lee jeans were a very nice change.  The color, "Steel",is a blue that is fresh looking and does not appear too worn.  The fabric is sturdy while not being overly heavy and stiff.  The fit is perfect on my husband. I know Lee is a quality manufacturer of jeans.  Don't know why I didn't order these before.
