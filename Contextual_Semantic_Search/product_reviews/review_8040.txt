This item is listed as a checkbook cover, but it is really a checkbook wallet. It has 7 card slots, came with a plastic insert for pictures, and even has a zippered change pocket. All I wanted was a bloody checkbook cover. On top of that, the wallet is made of the cheap, rough, chalkboardy-feeling leather that I hate. I wanted wallet-leather, the smoother grain leather that wears down to a nice smooth texture.To add insult to injury, the fold-over flap for duplicate checks is about 2 centimeters too short! It only covers a portion of the check, so in order to use the cover, I have to have the checks slid over to the right, so the numbers will all be recorded on the duplicate.Needless to say, the hunt goes on for a decent checkbook COVER (not wallet)I gave them 1 more star than an absolute worst rating, because the item still does fit the checks, and more or less can act as a cover -- it just isn't one, and it does a poor job at it.2 stars
