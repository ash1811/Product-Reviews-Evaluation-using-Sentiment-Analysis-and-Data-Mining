Roomy fit, comfortable yet sturdy material, good color. But unlike my other pair of Wranglers I bought at Target or someplace, these keep sliding down, butt crack issues, keep hoisting them up like some caricature. Belt so tight it's causing other issues. Not saying they're like those designer jeans that are deliberately cut low for people who want to show off their thong or whatever, but they just don't stay up.
