My neighbor liked this shoe for Zumba, so I ordered a pair.  The toe box was too narrow for me, and I would only be able to wear these shoes with very thin socks.  The overall fit was odd, too, with no sole in the midfoot.  I am afraid that they would be uncomfortable fo rme in the long run, so I sent them back.
