I put in a request with Amazon about 2 weeks ago to have the image removed, as the image is not what you will recieve.  It is a very beautiful piece and after reading many reviews (before buying) I knew that image above was not what I was going to get.  The cross is not raised at all.  and it is much thinner looking.  My sister loves James Avery but the ring she wanted was much more plain and much more expensive.  She opened this on Christmas Day and it fit perfect ( I ordered a .5 size bigger)  and she said it was so beautiful.  The detail in the ring is very stunning.  She was very happy and the ring seems very durrable.
