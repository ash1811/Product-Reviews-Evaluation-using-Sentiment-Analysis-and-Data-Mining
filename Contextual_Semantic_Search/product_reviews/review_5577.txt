1.  This product is REALLY pink.  I had expected a desert camouflage pink but this hat is bright.  This is not a complaint just a comment.2.  I wear a size 7 3/8 hat and ordered a Large but this hat is tight.  This IS a complaint.  I bought a Large boonie from another company and it fit perfectly.I am keeping the hat but am going to wash it in the hope that the color will fade at least a little bit and the hat will stretch a little.I did wash the hat and the pink did not fade.  I took the hat out of the dryer while it was still damp and it is a little bigger and I am trying to stop it shrinking back as it dries.  I guess that means it is a well made hat.  I also note that the black band on the outside used for holding a length of parachute cord or something similar is almost 1/2" above the seam between the hat and the brim.  Much higher than my other boonies.  Looks a little strange.
