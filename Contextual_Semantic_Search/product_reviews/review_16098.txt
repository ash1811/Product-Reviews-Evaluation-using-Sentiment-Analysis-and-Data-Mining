We needed this and used it, it is light and compact. Did not like the plastic liner that would fold up inside, it should be attached somehow so it doesn't crumple down. I like the idea of the plastic liner, if you get wet somehow or are sweating, it's a good idea. My husband wore this one and I wore a different brand, I liked mine better.
