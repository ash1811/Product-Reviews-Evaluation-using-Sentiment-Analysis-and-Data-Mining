I know the material on the top is a tad thinner than what they made several years back, but I still like the shoe.  I enjoy them.  They are cute on my feet and believe it or not, I have worn them when going to visit family.  They have been so comfortable I just didn't want to put shoes on my feet.  So I wore them in the car and to the front door of my family.  So I hope that lets you know how much I like them.  IF I wear them out, I will just get another pair.
