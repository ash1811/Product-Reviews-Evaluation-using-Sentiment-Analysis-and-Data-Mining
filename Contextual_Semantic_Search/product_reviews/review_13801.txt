I ordered this item in "yellow" to get our 7 week old son through the summer. I thought the shorts would be bright yellow, orange, and green to coordinate with many of the clothes he has. When they arrived, I saw they were dull colored and ugly, with shades seemingly inspired by various forms of vomit. If you're looking for something cute, look elsewhere or at least don't get the yellow. I returned them so cannot comment on size.
