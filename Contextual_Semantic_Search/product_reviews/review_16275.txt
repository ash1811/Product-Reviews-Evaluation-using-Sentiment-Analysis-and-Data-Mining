Very soft and comfortable! Even though the temperature was close to 100* it really didn't add any extra discomfort. I took someone's advice and cut the elastic strap because it was too long for me. Luckily I had cloth medical tape with me because on my trip the strap started to unravel. So, if it is too long sew it up at the cut end or it will be a stringy mess! Most of the time I was completely unaware of it around my waist. I kept my passport, credit and debit cards and larger paper money inside and it was very easy to access. Highly recommend! Great "peace of mind" purchase.
