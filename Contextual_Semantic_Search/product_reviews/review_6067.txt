Can't say enough about the Lerato. One of my favorites in my closet since going on a &#34;shoes that won't kill my feet search&#34; this month. Finances kept me away from Naturalizer for many years. My feet have suffered. But back even if finances aren't much better. Life is too short to die in pain with your feet everywhere you go.I love the style & fit of this shoe. Ever feel like a favorite shirt or PJ is your buddy? This is how I feel about this shoe.I've gotten several colors. Would buy all if available. VERY comfortable shoe. Wear anywhere. Have the Camelot, Russet & my fav the Coffee Bean. The little brass buttons on them are a perfect design touch. No wonder there are so few left of this style.Note: I wear an 8.5W. This shoe runs long in heel so I exchanged for 8W. PERFECT!
