This was a surprisingly good quality kids Halloween costume for the 8yo boy.  We ordered Medium and it fit perfectly.  The material and accent pieces were really nice and really spruced up the look.  I also liked that his eyes were not covered over with a mask and he had full visibility.  We purchased the Dragon Ninja Weapon Backpack Weapon set to go with this costume and it was a big hit with the neighbor kids.
