We'll see how it holds up.  Bought this for my 12 year old son as one of his Christmas gifts, so he's only been wearing it since December 25th,2011.Pros:It's light.It's very readable.It has a light and the date.If it holds up, it's perfect IMO.  It's simple readable, has everything he (and I) would want in a watch and doesn't weigh much.  The band is my favorite, leather.  Comment from my son without being asked four days after he got the watch. "This watch is Awesome, it's so easy to read and the light works great."
