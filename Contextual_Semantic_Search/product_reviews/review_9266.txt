It only took them one day to ship the item, and they chose UPS, which delivered the item within four days, one day ahead of schedule.Material is a bit tight. The sole isn't quite long enough for my foot. I think I need half a size bigger. However, the material is soft, the sole is cushy and very comfortable to walk on, and if it had fit I'd say it would have been a five star review. Though, since I measured my foot and knew myself to be a size 10, they should have fit, which is why it's only four stars.
