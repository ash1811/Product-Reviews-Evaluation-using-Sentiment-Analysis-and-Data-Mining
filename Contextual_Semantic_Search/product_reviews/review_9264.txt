Ballet slippers are my go to footwear around the house. I've purchased dozens over the years and wear them to rags.  I can't say that Isotoner is my favorite brand (the best I found was Robinsons May Charter Club but haven't been able to find them since RM was purchased by Macy's) but they are far better than most.I just purchased the black version of these classic terry Isotoners (model number 9896H).  The terry fabric keeps my feet warm but it is "breathable" so my feet stay comfortable.  Isotoner has one of the thickest most padded soles I've found which means I can wear them comfortably all day.  In addition, the sole is firm and has some treading so I don't feel like I'm slipping on our hard wood floors.The one negative I have is that this pair runs small.  I wear a size 8 shoe and always buy Isotoner L(8/9).  While this pair is OK, they are very snug and my toe goes all the way to the end.  No way could a size 9 wear these.  Glancing at other reviews, there appears to be quite a disparity in sizing results.  My experience with buying shoes on Amazon is that just selecting a different color can effect the quality and sizing.  Looking closely at the product pictures you can see some of the difference.  The white slippers look like another pair I have with terry like a soft, fluffy bath towel.  But the black, which I bought, looks (and is) like the flat terry of a beach towel. I wish everyone would be specific about the size and color they bought because it can make a difference in results.I would recommend that if you buy the black, go one size up.
