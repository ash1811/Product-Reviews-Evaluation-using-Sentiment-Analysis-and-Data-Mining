I love the slipper, but they did not last very long for the high price I paid for them.  They are not true to size, I wear a size 8, and my toe was at the end of the slipper.  They were hard rubber sole which I liked for wearing indoor or outdoor, and genuine leather......but....when I needed to wash them, I washed them by hand with a mild soad, and after a few washes they fell apart.  The sole which is glued to the bottom of the leather gave way, and I now can not wear them anymore.  I still have them, hoping that I can somehow glue the sole back onto them, but I dont really know if they are worth all that trouble.  I now buy washable slippers.
