for school. It is very big and well made. It seems to be holding up well and fits all her books and extras in it with no problem.Just one little gripe about the bag.... I wish the material were a little thicker. I have an Ogio and while it is a $100 backpack, I guess at $45 the Jansport is what it is.... a very good backpack at an affordable price. I reccommend it.UPDATE ON REVIEW: My daughter is having a lot of problems with the zipper always getting caught in the protection flap that covers it. I have fixed it several times and now the zipper is broke. I am not very happy with this design although think it may be more of the person using it than the bag itself.
