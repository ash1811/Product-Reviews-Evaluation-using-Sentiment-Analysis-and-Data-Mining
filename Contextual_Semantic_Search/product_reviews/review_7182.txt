I was glad to find a sock that would actually fit a larger foot. I didn't really know what &#34;liners&#34; meant when I ordered these so be aware that they cover the foot only...they do not come up far. Other than that they feel fine. I give it five stars because so far I can find no particular fault with the sock...even though I am not sure if I will continue wearing them.
