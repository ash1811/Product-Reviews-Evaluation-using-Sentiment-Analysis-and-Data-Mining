I got this for my self. i am a female with very small wrist. the face of this watch is medium size and it looks great on my wrist after I adjusted the links. For a guy that doesnt need a flashy watch this is great for the ladies who adore men's watches but dont want an oversize watch then this is perfect. excellent price and my male friend always compliment my watch.
