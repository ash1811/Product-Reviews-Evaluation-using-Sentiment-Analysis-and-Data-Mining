I ordered a pair and it arrived quickly in about 3-4 days with standard shipping. These pants are warm, thick and strong. They had the exact size I needed and the price was fair. Also they are nice looking pants which I can wear to work or anywhere else. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. I've bought pants similar to these in local stores at similar prices. However, the store bought pants were not as thick and durable as these. I highly recommend these pants and I will definitely order more pairs in the future. The quality here is excellent.
