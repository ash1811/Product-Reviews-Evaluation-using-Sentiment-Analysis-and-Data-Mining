I have these and the Desert Trek (stitch going up the middle) and they are perfect. These are likely a tad bit more casual as they do not have the stitch, however, they will compliment any outfit. The sole is crepe so it is very comfortable, however, gets dirty pretty fast. I ordered the Beeswax and Black (from another web site) and am happy, very happy. Get them, order a size smaller than your normal size as they run big. I am a size 13 and order a size 12 in all my Clark shoes.
