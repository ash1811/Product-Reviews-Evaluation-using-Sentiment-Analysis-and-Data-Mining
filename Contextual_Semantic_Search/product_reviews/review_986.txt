Felina makes some really great underwires, central gores, and band structures. Of the various brands of bras I have tried, Felina is the only one that creates bras that will perform to the standard that a good fitting bra should on me: stay on with the central gore flush with the breastbone, cups around the breasts, and underwires against the ribs under the breasts WITHOUT the straps on shoulders or band fastened. Seriously, the only brand. They seem to have the perfect structure for people with large, firm, dense, close-set breasts on a narrow frame. I've been fond of various Felina bras in the past. Unfortunately, the cup fabric does not quite perform quite as well. Felina bras tend to expect the vertical center line of your breasts to be farther toward your armpits than they are on me. This seems really odd to me given how well the underwires fit and lay flat. It causes some sagging at the top of the cups and any seaming or cup fabric structure to not line up properly with the breasts. This particular bra has the added drawback of having weird fabric. It's a stretchy mesh with either lace or stitching of some sort in a lace-like pattern. The mesh stretches and conforms to your breasts while the lacy detail prevents the fabric from moving and conforming. Unless you're toting basketballs around, this causes some weird indentation effects where the lacy detail is. Overall, the cons outweighed the pros for me.
