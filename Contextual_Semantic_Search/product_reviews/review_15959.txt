Use them for running.Takes some getting used to with the padding.Feels a bit odd at first. But the padding definitely is a plus.Only downside is wear. Mine have developed holes in the toes.Figured they'd have lasted a bit longer. So a bit disappointed.May try another brand in the future.Overall the socks are okay.
