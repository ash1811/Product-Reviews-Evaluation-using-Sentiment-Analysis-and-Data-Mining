This shoe was purchased for my 95 year old Mother who needed something that was of good quality and closed in.  They were a bit tight for her; therefore, I ordered the next half size larger.  I was happy to see that it came in the next half size because the whole size would have been too big for her.  I know that she will be happy with the larger size and will fit more comfortably.
