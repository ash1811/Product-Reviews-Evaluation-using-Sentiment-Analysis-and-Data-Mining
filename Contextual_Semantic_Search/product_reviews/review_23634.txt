They didn't fit too well for me. There's too much room in the toe area. Ankle support was great but overall the boots felt a bit unbalanced, maybe because of the extra room and looseness up front. I heard the originals fit better. This is my first experience with the brand so I couldn't compare them to the original Italian-made Sundowners but they do seem to be pretty well made even though many 'veteran' Vasque users here will disagree. I needed a pair of boots where I can use for both outdoor (light hiking) and casual everyday use around town - and they MUST look good! After many comparisons and reviews, it came down to either theDanner Mountain Light IIor the Sundowner. The Danners are American-made but the Vasque costs nearly $100 less at the time. Unfortunately the Vasque didn't fit too well so I returned them and bought the Danner Mountain II. Yes, they costs more but they can be re-crafted or re-soled down the line by Danner. Also, they are U.S.-Made, not necessarily quality these days but at least I'm doing my part. We'll see how that goes on my next take.
