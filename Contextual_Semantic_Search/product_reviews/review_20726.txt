Just a wee bit long- but what a rugged pair of jeans- the material is tough too- yet soft enough that they don't feel like wearing steel mesh- Pockets are good and deep and made of good strong material- The material seems pretty rugged and should last a good long time- unlike some other brands I've had i nthe past that always seem to fray badly because of cheap weave/material- lots of room to move in, a little baggy, but not too bad- they are a heavy jean- but the weight is worth the warmth over traditional non lined jeans
