I own more than a dozen watches, some costing hundreds of dollars, but I wear this one several times a week. Why? This is my favorite running watch, that's why. You can buy all kinds of fancy watches for running, with multi-lap memory, GPS, heart-rate monitors, and other features.This watch doesn't have any of that. This watch is EXTREMELY light, very comfortable, and has large numbers that are easy-to-read at a glance. And the price is right, too.When this watch dies, I'm buying a new one.
