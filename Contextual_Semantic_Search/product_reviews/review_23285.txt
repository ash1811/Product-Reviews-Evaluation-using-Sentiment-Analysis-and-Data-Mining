This isn't the most compact traveler's umbrella I've had, but it is easy to stash in a pack or my computer bag.  It has a spring-powered opening, with one touch of a button.  When wet, all the folds make it drippy, so you definitely want to make sure you keep the sleeve it comes with.  Just insert the wet umbrella in the sleeve, then dry when you get home.It's a bit smaller that I would prefer, but... it is a traveler's umbrella!
