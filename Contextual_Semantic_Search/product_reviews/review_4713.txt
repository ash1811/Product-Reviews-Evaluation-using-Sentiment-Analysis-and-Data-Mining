first wear after first wash and already ripped pulling them down after buttoning. seriously, these are thin. I got them because I have some duck canvass ones and thought these may be a bit lighter on warmer day.  yes, they are light, and are NOT durable at all.  unless you want these for the additional pockets or because you think they may be a good carpenter pant forget it. too weak.
