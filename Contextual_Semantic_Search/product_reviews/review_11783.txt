I have been looking for shoes similar to a pair of gray Nubuck Bare Traps I'd had for many years.  They were so comfortable, always looked good even when they got wet in snow or rain.  So when I saw the Merrills on Amazon I was ecstatic!  They are as good as, and maybe even better, as my old pair.  I am so glad to have found these.
