I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. The watch is very high quality, and the stainless steel is just beautiful. The mother-of-pearl inlay is very nice and not over done. This watch just looks classy and goes well with both work or casual clothes. For point of reference, the watch face is about the size of a US Quarter.The watch is surprisingly light and the band very flexible. The watch band is highly adjustable, and does not involve removing any loops of the band since the band is a steel weave. Instead, there is an small lever built into the fastener and small ribs in the watch band. To adjust the band all that is required is to loosen the lever, move the latch to the right location and then tighten it down again. You'll need a small screwdriver to do this as it cinches tightly onto the band.I wanted to get my wife a watch that was quite nice,had a high build quality, but one that was not extremely expensive. This Skagen watch gets 5 stars on all three of those criteria. We both love it.
