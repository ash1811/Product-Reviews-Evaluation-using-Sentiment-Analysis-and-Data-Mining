Great casual watch. First thing I did was to switch the band to a flat rubber watchband; this actually made the watch appear office quality. Love the solar power; I have been checking the time against the time.gov standard regularly and it has been running consistently 2-3 seconds fast each week. This is much much better than my previous (and much more expensive) automatic watch. Also, I have not had any problems keeping it charged despite wearing long sleeved shirts to work. The watch runs nearly silently. My old automatic had an audible sound in a quiet room from about 2 feet (right about the distance from my wrist to my ear when typing). You have to put the Citizen watch on your ear to hear anything. Size of the face is perfect for a medium-sized wrist. I prefer smaller watches in general and this is at the upper end of, but well within, my comfort zone. Best of all - I get compliments on the watch. Small complaint: as others have mentioned, the second hand is fractionally off the mark - not enough to get bothered about.
