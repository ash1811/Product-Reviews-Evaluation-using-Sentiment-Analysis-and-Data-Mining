This is my third pair of Isotoner slippers...and I plan on buying more. I wear a size 9 1/2-10 shoe and an X-large fits perfectly..very comfortable. I have Fibromyalgia and severe peripheral neuropathy in my feet and they never stop hurting. I can't walk around barefoot or in socks as it causes the pain to become worse. These slippers are the only thing I am able to wear that helps the pain while walking. I am going to make certain I have at least two or three pair so when I wash them, I won't have to go without.
