It's a comfortable money belt for your passport, money and credit cards that you aren't using for the day.  I wore it on the small of my back...actually a little bit lower and several times I forgot it was even there.  You might want to try not to forget it's there when you are using the restrooms!  It did get a bit sweaty at times but dried out fine overnight in the hotel room.  I just got home and washed them in the washing machine and they came out fine as well.  Don't forget to try them out before you leave because if you are of average girth, you will need to trim the edge off with a pair of scissors.
