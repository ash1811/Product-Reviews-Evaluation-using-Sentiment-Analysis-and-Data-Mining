I liked the look of these but the minute I put one on it went right back in the box.  I ordered my regular size 8.5 Wide and although the width was fine the length was not.  My toe immediate hit the front of the shoe when I put it on.  I was sad.  I really wanted to get walking!!  Guess it is iffy ordering shoes online but sometimes you hit it lucky.  This was just not not of those times.
