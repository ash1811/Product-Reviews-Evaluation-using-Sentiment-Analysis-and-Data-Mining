Nice looking shoe. I bought this shoe hoping it's work.  What matters most for me is how WIDE, how stable, how much heel support & price. These 10XW turned out to be too long & narrower than what I wanted. The bottom of the soles are also VERY slick.  Avoiding falling, while wearing them, would be tricky. I spend HOURS looking @ Ros Hommerson, Clark, Trotters,SoftStyle (among other brands.) From the 1 pair of Soft Style I tried on, I'd say they'll soon feel like shoes that will be hard on one's feet & will fall apart in no time. Since the bottom of the sole is SO slick, avoiding falling is also problematic.  I'm returning the pair I bought for a refund.  I found other brands in similar prices that are much better made shoes.
