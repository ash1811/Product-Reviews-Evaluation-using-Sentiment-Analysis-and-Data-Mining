Dan Post boots has been around for years. I have always worn Justin - by personal choice.These were a pleasant surprise with the fit - true to size, out of the - not a lot of break in aside from just the normal 'new leather' process.I ordered the 11.5 but changed the order, via email to the company, to a size 11. Elite wasn't super responsive but they did make the size change for me.Bottom line - GREAT boot, S U P E R price (local DFW street price is $200).
