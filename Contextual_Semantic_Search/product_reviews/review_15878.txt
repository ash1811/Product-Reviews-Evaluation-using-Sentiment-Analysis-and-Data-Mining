I was hoping these socks would be what I needed for my Justin pull on work boots.  The boots drag my socks down as I walk.  These socks are very nice thick and cushioned socks but the cushioning is so thick in the forefoot area they cause the boots to be too tight.  If the boots had the roomy round toes of combat boots (what the socks were designed for) it would be fine but my boots have a roper toe shape to them so there isn't much room.  The socks would have stayed up and solved that problem but because they don't fit well into the boot they don't work for me.  I look forward though to wearing these socks in the house when the cool weather comes back.
