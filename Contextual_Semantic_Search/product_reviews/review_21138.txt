These sandals are very comfortable around the house, but I really bought them for vacation on the beach and quickly found out that they cannot get wet.  Even the slightest bit of moisture gets quickly absorbed into the top layer which is like a soft memory foam type material.  They can take up to a day or more to dry out, and they really can't be worn while wet unless you want to squish out slippery foam with every step you take.  Very annoyed by that.  They are great sandals if you keep them bone dry, otherwise - beware!
