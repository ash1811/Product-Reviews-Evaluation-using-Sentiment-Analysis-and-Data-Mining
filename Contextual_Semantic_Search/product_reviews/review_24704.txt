I have loved these flip flops since the day that I got them. They are extraordinarily comfortable, and durable. The underside of the part that goes on the top of your foot was soft from day one, which was great.The only complaint I could possibly have about these flip flops is that they do have a tendency to hold smell.....and my feet aren't usually overtly stinky, but these tend to bring some stink out!Short and Sweet: Excellent but stinky!
