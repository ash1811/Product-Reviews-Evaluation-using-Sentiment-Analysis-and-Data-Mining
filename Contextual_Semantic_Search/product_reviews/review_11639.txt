I love these pants.  I looked long and hard to find a pair that were of this quality.  They are made of nice, thick material, they stretch comfortably, and the only reason they are even a little transparent is because they are white.  I plan to get more in other colors, and I don't expect that anything will show through.  They are worth the extra money I paid for them because they will last much longer than the cheaper ones available.
