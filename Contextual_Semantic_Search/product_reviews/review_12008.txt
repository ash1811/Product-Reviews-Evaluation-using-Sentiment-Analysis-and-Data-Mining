the size 8 seems more like a 7.5 (but that may just be me).  If you like a lot of padding between you and the ground then you will like this shoe.  My only critism is of that loop attached to the top of the heels.  I had to cut them off because pants get caught up -- very annoying to me.  As always, with Amazon, the buying experience was great -- I usually go with the free shipping and my order arrived 2 days early.
