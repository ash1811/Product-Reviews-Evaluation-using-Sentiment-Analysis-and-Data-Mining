Sizing was exactly as I expected. Comfortable, will,wear well and look good with most of my shoes and shirts. The grey is almost too pale, but just has enough tint to be a pair of jeans and not school trousers! They have washed well and despite being thinner than normal tough Wrangler jeans, they don't feel flimsy. I'm very happy with this purchase. When these wear out I will buy them again.
