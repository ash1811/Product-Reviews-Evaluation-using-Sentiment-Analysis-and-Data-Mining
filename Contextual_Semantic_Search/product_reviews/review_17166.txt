We have hardwood floors and air conditioning so I wanted something other than my Uggs to wear around the house in the warmer months.  These work perfectly and are super comfortable. I like that they have a rubberized sole so if I have to go to the garage or run outside I don't have to switch to something else.  I will be buying another pair when these wear out.
