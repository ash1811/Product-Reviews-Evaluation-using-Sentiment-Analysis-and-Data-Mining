Bought them in Blue Ox and Black. Had them taken up (always buy my jeans longer so I can wash them and account for shrinkage when I take them up --hate when jeans fit just right at first then shrink and/or bag at the knee when you wear them and become too short).  Wore the black jeans this weekend and love them.  Just the right weight not too heavy material and not too light.
