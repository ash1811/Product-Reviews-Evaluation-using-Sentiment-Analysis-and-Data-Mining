Anyone claiming to have this watch with a screw down crown is lying and just copying from other reviews.  This watch arrives with the 8932 number on the attached tag, but on the back of the case it clearly says 8932A.  Why?  Who knows?  This watch was purchased specifically due to its claim that it is water resistant, it clearly states in all advertisements that it has a screw down crown.  It does not have a screw down crown.If you look around and read through the reviews you will see again and again, people who actually have the watch realize it does not have a screw down crown.This means if water is splashed near the crown, it can go right into the watch body.Do not purchase this watch if you intend to ever get water near it.  It is not a diver watch by any stretch of the imagination.
