I absolutely LOVE these shoes! I wear them until you can't wear them any more. The only problem is that I wear them almost every single day and once they stink, they stink. I guess having &#34;vegan&#34; shoes is like wearing a dirty hippy on your foot. Oh well. I'll continue buying these! Hemp is great for products!!
