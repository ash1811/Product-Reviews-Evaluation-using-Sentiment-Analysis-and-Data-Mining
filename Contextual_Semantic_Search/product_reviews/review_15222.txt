Feels more like a synthetic than pure cotton. It is not really soft but a little coarse. Slight shrinkage, so now is snugger, but still fits. Now fits like a large rather than extra large. It is styled slimmer than most which I like. Washed 4 times and looks like it will be durable. Seams are taped and look good.
