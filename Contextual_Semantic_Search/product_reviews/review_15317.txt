Swarovski has been making crystal jewelry since 1892, and their consistent quality has kept the company going through wars and the rise and fall of empires. These excellent earrings are made of sterling silver and Swarovski crystals, and are quite attractive. If you are looking for some nice, crystal and silver earrings, then these are the ones to get.By the way, they look great when combined with the Heart, Star and Starburst crystal tattoos - which I also highly recommend!(Review of Shimmering Clear Swarovski Crystal 925 Sterling Silver Threader Ear Wire Earrings)
