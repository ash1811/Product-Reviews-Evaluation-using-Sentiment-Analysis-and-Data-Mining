Have always loved Gold Toe sox, however, never bought them because of living with my daughter & her habit of leaving sox wherever she took them off, thus, they ended up under the couch, under something so usually many one-sox pair was left.  Now that I've moved out (yes, I left) from my adult sock-losing daughter, I splurged & bought 2 packs.  Lovin' them.  I'm on my feet most of the day at work - they're comfortable & warm.  and both sox end up in my hamper at the end of the day!!!
