The watch looks good and as with all Citizen products it keeps great time.  My only caution is that the band is more green than some of the pictures look.  Now I'm also a little color blind, so take that for what it's worth.  But to me, I was a little surprised at the color of the band.  I was hoping for a darker green.  I'll probably end up replacing the band.
