Man!!!!  I am a size 11.5 and ordered  size 13 and they are still too small!!!  I wore them anyway to do zumba yesterday but was aware of my toes touching.  Another half size up would have been perfect.  They are comfortable shoes though.  40 minutes into the workout my feet started getting numbe.  Not sure if it is because of the toes touching the front or what.
