Victoria has it right as far as getting that delicious subversive feeling when wearing these earrings.  I haven't worn post earrings since I first got my ears pierced as a child, but these are a reason to do so.  Honestly, they could be a little bigger and still be invisible - and then it would be easier to put them in!  I didn't know I had such huge fingers.  These are very cute and secure to wear.  I am reluctant to wear a skull pendant along with them, as then I would have a trinity, and I don't know what kind of effect that would bring!  As far as the minute size of these, it is more a plus than a minus.  Certain earrings would be wrong if too small, but not these.  It does make them a little harder to handle and easier to drop.
