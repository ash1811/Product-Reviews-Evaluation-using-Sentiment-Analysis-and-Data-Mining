I had been looking for fingerless gloves to wear while I type-- they keep the office I work at at very cold temperatures.  These gloves seeemed perfect--because many fingerless gloves- don't have fingerless thumbs--but these gloves do.  The cost was only 2.99 for a pair of black or navy gloves.  I ordered the black pair.  Well, the knit gloves began to fray on the first wearing- there are many stray strands at the fingers-- they snag easily.  They are warm and I would love them if they did not snag and fray so easily.  But I did only pay 2.99 for them so I guess it's a case of you get what you pay for.
