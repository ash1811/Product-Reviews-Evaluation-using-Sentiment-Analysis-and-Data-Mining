Compared many site, many prices.Fro my needs, this boot is tops and comes with a composite toe which is great for going thru metal-detectors without a hitch. Also great for foot protection. The boot breaths well, is light and durable.Takes a spit shine after the wax build up nicely and is a long-lasting value. Great purchase.
