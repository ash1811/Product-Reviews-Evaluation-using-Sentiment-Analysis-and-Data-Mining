I have been purchasing these Gold Toe cotton crew socks for years and have always been extremely satisfied with the cushioned and comfortable feel of the material on my feet as well as the product's overall durability.Buy multiple pairs of these socks all in one color - specifically black - and you shouldn't need any others.When holes develop, simply throw away the defective ones and buy some more.And it really does take a very long time to wear these socks out - highly recommended!
