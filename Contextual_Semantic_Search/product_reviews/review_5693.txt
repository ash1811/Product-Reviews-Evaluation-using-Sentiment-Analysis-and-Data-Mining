My daughter's birthday is in early August so I get an e-mail via  Amazon saying "These"! Interpretation: Mom, I want these because the fit is so perfect for my wide feet, and they are gorgeous in the black. Perfect for my calves, and they feel like they've already been broken in. The comfort for a new boot is amazing. I'll be able to perform without worry about blisters in these beauties. Result: I immediately ordered the boots at a great Amazon price with free shipping. I did have her try them on even though she said that she knew the fit would be great. They were! I was impressed by the detailing on these boots, even to the color of the lining. I also loved the roomy round toe. She did have me order these 1/2 size larger than her normal size, but I'd attribute that to the different styles of Ariat boots.
