This is pretty much the exact size that you need to keep all of your stuff in. In one of these bags you can fit a kick board, buoy, snorkel, paddles, and even your water bottle if you want to get lazy and throw it in. I have each of my swimmers purchase one of these bags, and specifically the Speedo brand. I've got no complaints from these, and the one that I own myself has lasted a long time and does not rip or anything like that. Well worth the money.
