This is the only minimizer bra I have found that supports me well.  I tried another,more expensive brand at one time, but came back to the Bali. I discovered with the other bra, my breasts were always sagging and spilling over.  I wear a 34DDD.  If I don't have a good bra my back suffers, not to mention the fit of the clothes.  The Bali provides both.
