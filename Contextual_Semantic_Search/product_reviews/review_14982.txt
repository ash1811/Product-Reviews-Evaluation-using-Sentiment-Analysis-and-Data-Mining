Everything I wanted in a polo shirt and at a price that is hard to believe. But you have to be careful when ordering, even off the same page. Some of the colors come from companies that charge shipping while others are shipped free from Amazon. I recommend the shirts. Less than ten dollars each but as I said, watch out for the shipping... I did not notice at the time I ordered that this shirt does not have a pocket....but I'll keep it anyway because it is comfortable.
