I purchased from the Gold toe outlet. Turns out there are various versions of Fluffies so that may be that makes some people confused. They all look Fluffie from a distance yet some have cotton and others have more sole. I like the 75% Acrylic, 25% Stretch Nylon. I only use these critters so I do not have to mix and match. Just wash once a week but have enough for a month. All black.I have used these critters for decades and like Twinkies they will be here long after the last person on earth.I read horror stories about Fluffies so I checked; I do not have acrylic balls, wholy heals, band around my leg, no repelling ropes, or any of those daunting things.On a practical note these socks look good for dress-up and casual.
