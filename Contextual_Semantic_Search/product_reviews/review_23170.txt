I will most certainly buy more of these sandals in different colors.  I have a very wide foot, size 7 in an EEE to EEEE (mostly EEEE) and these shoes meet my needs.  They are pretty and well made with excellent materials - I would recommend to anyone with similar wide feet as mine.  I love these shoes! One of the things I especially love is that they have no heels, just not even surface which is such a relief on my back - I have spinal stenosis and any kind of lift in the heel is torture... thank you for a wonderful pair of sandals...
