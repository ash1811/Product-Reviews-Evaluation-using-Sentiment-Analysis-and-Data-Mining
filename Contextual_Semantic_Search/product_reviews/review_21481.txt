I was expecting these to be a more "tan" color, but they are definitely a darker brown than I consider "tan".  That said, I don't hate them, but they're not really what I wanted.  I guess they are not far off from the picture in shade, but I was expecting them to be closer to a "tan" than they appear, and also didn't expect the glossy appearance.  Hopefully the more they are broken in the more the leather will get lighter through distress?
