I've been a levis 501, 505 & 550 wearer for twenty-plus years and wanted to give Wrangler a try.  I was unfamiliar with "Rigid" (unwashed) denim, and actually returned these jeans in favor of the Pre-washed (Antique Blue) version of the exact same style.  I like them much better than levis.  The fit (especially in the seat) is better for me, the construction is excellent, the quality of the material seems to be higher and more consistent in appearance than levis, & Wrangler's prices are generally better.  Upon receiving my first two pair, I immediately ordered two additional pair.  The 5-Star rating is based on my final purchase, and although I returned them, I would also rate the original "Rigid" denim jeans the same based on the overall quality of the product.  After my original purchase was returned, Wrangler's web site was very helpful in finding what I ultimately wanted.
