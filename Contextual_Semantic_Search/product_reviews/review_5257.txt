I always buy Gloria Vandervilt Amanda in several colors.  They are the best for curvy figures.I am a size 8 and I like that these jeans allow you to show your wait and wear belts withoutany bulges showing.  They are really flaterring and comfortableIt is becoming more difficult every year to find these jeans, so all cury ladies please join mein demanding that they continue to be manufactured and in more colors.
