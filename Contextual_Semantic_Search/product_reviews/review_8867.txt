I am 5'4&#34; and currently 140lbs (working my way back down to 123).  I ordered a small, and it fits very well.  Due to the stretchiness of the lace, I believe the gown and robe will still fit very well when I lose the extra lbs.  The length was good for me, too.Yes, as others have mentioned, the fabric is very thin and see-through.  If you need more modesty, consider purchasing the robe, as well. The gown and robe are absolutely beautiful, very flattering, and amazing comfortable.  I plan to order more in other colors.
