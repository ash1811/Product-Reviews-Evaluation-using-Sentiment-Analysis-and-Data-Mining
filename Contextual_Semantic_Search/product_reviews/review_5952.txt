I mostly bought this because I like the retro look and not because I wanted a lot of waist cinching. I have a 32&#34; waist and 42&#34; hips, and I sized up by ordering the 34-XXL. It's still a little more snug than I'd like, creates a roll above the top and around the bottom. In the future I will order a 36-XXL. Otherwise, this is very adorable, just right for getting that pin up girl or Betty Draper look! :)
