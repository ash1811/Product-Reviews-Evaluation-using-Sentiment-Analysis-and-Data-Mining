These liners do fit rather snuggly, hugging my very curve and bump. The waist band is about an inch or so above my navel, and the lower hem ends a couple of inches above my knee. There is, indeed, no tag, and I see no laundering instructions, so I am going to wash them medium (permanent press), and dry on low. I don't think they will shrink much with just 43% cotton, but with 14% lycra, I don't want to wash and dry them too hot or roughly. They will make good liners under shorts to work out, or even under other clothing for "curve contol".  Not bad for about $14.  There are not terribly thin, but too thin to wear alone. I would like to see them available in more colors than just the Birch (light gray).
