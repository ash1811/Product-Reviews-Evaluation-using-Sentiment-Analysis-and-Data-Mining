I use to love Dearfoam slippers, but now they sew the tag in such a way that you can't remove one side of the tag. I'm a sewer, so I use seam rippers, but still can't get the whole tag out. The tags are made with a really stiff, itchy ribbon type of material and I actually get blisters from them. I just can't wear their slippers any longer. One lady wrote that these are quite stiff and not as comfortable as the older style and I agree with that too. It's a shame that they've become for concerned with people removing their tags than the comfort of their customers.
