The slipper keeps my feet warm, but the bottom is pretty heavy in relation to top, which tends to make the slipper pull off my heel.  With the elastic around the top of the slipper, you can't just slip them back on when this happens.  You have to stop, bend over and pull the slipper back on your foot.  If you're just sitting around, this isn't a problem, but if your active around your house, it can be annoying.
