I purchased these for my son, and he is very satisfied. I'm a longtime Thorlo wearer myself and prefer to wear nothing but Thorlo. The socks are durable, lasting a decade or more before they wear out. Plus - importantly - they don't have the toe seams that I find so uncomfortable in cheaper socks. They're also soft, cushiony, warm in winter, but cool in summer. I just wish these walking crews came in more colors than white, black, and navy.
