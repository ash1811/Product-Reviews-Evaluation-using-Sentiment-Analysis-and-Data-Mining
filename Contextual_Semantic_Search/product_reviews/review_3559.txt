I'm a nurse that works on the cardiac floor of a busy hospital where anytime something can turn. I wear the most comfortable footwear but I was really starting to feel the aching in my legs. When I saw these I tried them and have been delighted. Not only do they take the aching out of my legs but their firm support steadies my ankles while the padding cushions the pounding on my feet. I'm not slipping in my footwear which can throw my back out. If your a nurse, I highly suggest them. I went back to my old socks for only one night and said &#34;never again.&#34;
