I've worn 527s for years.  Probably have gone through 6 pairs.Ordered a pair of these and they are a completely different pant.  The material is not only much thinner but rougher than my current 527s.  It doesn't even feel like denim.The front pockets are also at least an inch shorter.The jeans also seem to be a bit smaller.  Granted, my current 527s are probably a bit stretched out and, yes, I've put on a couple pounds, but these new 527s do not seem like a 34 waist - they are much tighter.  I buy plenty of other pants in a 34 that fight just fine so something is out of whack with Levi's sizing.These facts lead me to believe that these jeans are counterfeit.I never wear these jeans.  They are too tight, the fabric is rough and thin.  Complete waste of $40.
