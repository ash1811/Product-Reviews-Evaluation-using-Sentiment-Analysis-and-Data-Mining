I have worn these same moccasins since 1973 in High School. They still are cool~like the bellbottoms we wore that are now the craze. I love the fact that these are the soft sole version..they are the best. I see mocs with hard soles & laugh cuz they look so dorkey! Thanx for making THE REAL THING! They are awesome!
