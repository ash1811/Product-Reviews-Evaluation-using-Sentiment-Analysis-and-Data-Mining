I was concerned about the fit and read all the reviews. My foot is 10.5 exactly but I almost always go with size 11 - they feel better, more roomy etc. I like things loose. In this case, because these are all leather, I went with my exact shoe size of 10.5 figuring they would stretch a little. And, they did - and I love them.These moccasins work beautifully for me. They felt a little rough at first with the laces rubbing the top of my foot a little uncomfortably. After a few hours, everything started to come together and they were stretching to fit my feet like a glove. I should say I only wear these barefoot. For socks I definitely would have had to go with size 11. I should say, I had to loosen up the laces - they were tied to tightly out of the box and that's why they were rubbing annoyingly on the top of my foot. New sneakers are the same for me every time.I'll probably do the water trick and wet them down and wear them for a few hours so that they truly fit my feet perfectly. But, they're so close already at this point, after a few days, I may skip that trick.Very happy with these. If they last for any length of time - like a year or more - I'll buy again in a heartbeat and they have a customer for life. Super comfortable.
