This is a very nice business looking shoe.  However, it really almost looks as if it's a black patent and not an overall leather looking shoe.  Teens won't touch this one, however, if you're looking for something to go with a tuxedo, then be sure to try these!  They fit true-to-size, look amazing on, and just a very neat, pulled together look.  The soles are made well, probably would last about 2 years if you wore them on a daily basis.  However, again, these are more for going to the opera or conducting an orchestra than they are for wearing to work.  Recommend, based on your needs.
