I was hoping to love this bra.  It fit well, the straps and base are sturdy, but the cups are stretchy and there is no support.  I would not wear this for any kind of sport.  They have discontinued the scoop back bra that has seams, but super support so I was hoping this would take it's place.  Not supportive as advertised.
