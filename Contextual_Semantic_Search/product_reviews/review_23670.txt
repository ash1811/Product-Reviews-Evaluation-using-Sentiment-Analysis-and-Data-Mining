After alot of shopping and history with many, many river sandals, I chose the Venice Sandal (not the H2 version), because it was affordable and I like the color. I'm wearing them now with casual dress and will take them in the water next summer (hope the leather straps don't shrink too much). They are as described and incredibly comfortable, with or without socks, on my awful feet.
