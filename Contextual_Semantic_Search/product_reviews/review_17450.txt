As usual Levis fit well. My only problem is that these jeans aren't sturdy like the previous models.Its the  quality you  expect from a $12 jeans.Wash on delicate cycle if you want them to last.Product delivered on time!!!Aug 30 ,2010Just tried the other jeans, though the tags are the same they are very different.The legs are about 3 inches narrower so the pants fits tight. I don't know what is happening to Levis, but they seriously need to look at quality control.If i wanted tight jeans i would not have ordered "straight loose". I live in the Caribbean so i cant send them back.
