I received this shirt in good condition and was shipped to me nice and fast.For the price its ok but I expected the "eagle, globe and anchor" USMC Logo to be a bit nicer quality.The text on rear of shirt is fine my only complaint is regarding the USMC emblem on the front breast, its just "ok" kind of looks like a cheap silk screen rendering. The photo on the listing is accurate but because its so small it can lead you to believe that there is more detail than actually.overall im satisfied I will make sure I look at the pictures better before I buy next time.Semper Fi
