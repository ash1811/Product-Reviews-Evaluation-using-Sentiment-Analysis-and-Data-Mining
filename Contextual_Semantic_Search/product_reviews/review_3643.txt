I usually wear 501's or 517s'.501's since a teenager, and 517's are great motorcycle pants, because they fit over the boots just enough to look great.I got 505's out of curiosity.I have been doing lots of AB, and glute work, ( stomach  and leg presses ) and 501's sit lower, and are baggy in certain areas.517's are great bike gear, but ride higher up on the hips. so I bought 2 pairs of 505's to try. 33x32, and 32x32.I was a 35 waist.the material in 505's are different than 501, and 517.while 501 and 517's are more a traditional thicker 'jean material', the 505's are not.while the sewing looks like a 501, but has a zipper like a 517, its a lighter and more stretchy material.the 33's fit good, but the 32's are allmost too tight right now. they look like they have been 'painted on' me. they fit very tight, but I can move and squat in them. if these were 501's and they fit that tight, forget it, their would be major pain in the groin area!hahahaguess I'll just wear the 33x32's until I can burn off a little more tummy to fit into these 32's.505's are a great pair of Levis!
