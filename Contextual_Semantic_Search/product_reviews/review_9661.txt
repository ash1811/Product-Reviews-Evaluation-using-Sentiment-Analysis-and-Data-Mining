If you are used to Levi's, here's some help in choosing a Wrangler jean that will fit you properly. This jean is the classic "Cowboy Cut" that Wrangler has been making since 1947. Among the Levi's jeans, the fit of this jeans is most similar to that of the Levi's 505, which in turn is similar to the Levi's 501, meaning that it is a fairly standard fit, not too tight nor too baggy. It doesn't have as much orange stitching as a Levi's, the back pockets sit higher, and the rise is a bit longer, giving it a slight dress pants look. Unlike the Levi's 501, it has a zipper fly (like the 505) rather than a button fly. The so-called "rigid denim" looks a lot like the "shrink to fit" rigid denim of the 501 when new and will lose a lot of indigo dye on the first wash, but that's where the resemblance ends. The 501 shrinks about 10%, but the Wrangler Cowboy Cut shrinks less than 3%, because it is Sanforized. So, you should buy your correct size, erring on the side of slightly larger if you are right on the border. The the really neat thing about the Wrangler is that they still have copper rivets on the back pockets, something Levi's stop doing generations ago when schools complained that the rivets scratched the wood desk chairs the school kids used to sit in!Note also, that the Wrangler Cowboy Cut "Slim Fit" is quite a bit skimpier than this jean. The slim fit seat is smaller and the legs are pretty trim--it's more of a boy's cut. If you are really on the thin side, it may work for you, but many men will find it too constricting in the waist and seat.Wranglers stonewash finishes are pretty mainstream compared to some of the more exotic things Levi's is doing now. These definitely are not so-called "destructed" jeans. You won't find whiskering or abrasion the way you will on the stonewash Levi's.Overall, these are very solid well-made jeans that offer a nice alternative to the more popular Levi's models. Like Levi's, they are well made and indestructible.
