Extremely reliable, easy to read, looks like the Rolex style, only it is very lightweight. Good for everyday use because you can wear either gold or silver jewelry with this watch. I would have given it 5 stars if it were one of those models which does not need a battery.5/29/07 - This is an update.  I give it 5 stars now.  I got one of those models that does not need a battery and it is heavy and not sleek like this Seiko women's watch.  It is still my all-time favorite watch and will never be without one.
