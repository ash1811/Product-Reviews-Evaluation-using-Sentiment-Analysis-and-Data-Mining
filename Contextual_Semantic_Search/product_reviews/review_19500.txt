This is hands down the most comfortable shoes that i have ever own.  I loved them so much that i bought a second pair.  I wear these every day for work.  Only down side would be is that the laces tend to shred after a while from tying the laces.  I wrote to timberland and they sent me a few more laces.  I hope they dont ever stop making these shoes.
