This strap fits a small wrist like mine very well without having a long "tail" hanging off the buckle. Unlike most other plastic straps I've seen, it's also nearly smooth inside, without a lot of creases, knobs and so forth that can be irritating. Some brief work with an Xacto knife made it fit my 18mm Casio watch perfectly. Very pleased so far.
