these fishnets are incredible.durable, flattering, comfortable, well-constructed, and the footbed really makes a difference. there are regular ol' fishnets, and then there are these capezio fishnets. ive worn fishnets in the past that nearly ripped while i was trying to put them on. i can tell that these will last a good while.because the material is somewhat rigid, these are the most flattering fishnets ive ever worn. they really tighten up the look of your legs.sizewise, they fit just as expected-- the sizing chart is accurate.depending on how much your thighs touch, im sure chafing can be an issue because the material isnt very soft. the thing is, if it was a softer material, i suspect it wouldnt be so durable.definitely worth the $20.
