This cap sits quite high on my head.  I am accustomed to low-profile as more 'baseball cap' type, versus trucker style.  In this case the cap looks more like the kind Beaver Cleaver wore; or, like on the kid in the Godzilla movies.  (Maybe that's what is meant by "Vintage.")  The fabric itself doesn't appear time-worn; more like the twill of a Texaco shirt when new.It's tough to be too critical of an $8 hat.  Otherwise, the three-star rating would be lower.
