I LOVE THIS WATCH. I ALSO HAVE THE 009 MODEL BUT THE 007 IS ALSO VERY WELL BUILT AND LOOKS FANTASTIC. I AM A SUCKER FOR DIVE WATCHES AND THE FACT THAT IT IS A SEIKO DIVER MAKES IT EVEN BETTER BECAUSE SEIKO IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE WATCH BRANDS. THESE WATCHES ARE GREAT, LOOK AMAZING AND HAVE A GREAT LEGACY BEHIND THEM. ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING AT GETTING A GOOD ENTRY LEVEL DIVER WATCH OR JUST A GREAT AUTOMATIC WATCH IN GENERAL, I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND THIS WATCH!!!
