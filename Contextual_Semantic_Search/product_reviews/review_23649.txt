This shoe is prettier in person.  That little hint of orange-red across the top is a nice accent next to the rich brown.  I love that it comes in wide, but trust me the W is not too wide as I believe another review pointed out.  I'm probably more of a C- and it will require some break-in wear( why only 4 stars) but I feel sure it will be fine.  I think it's a nice workplace shoe, but would look cute with jeans too.  The heel height and shape are comfort oriented.
