Ok, first an admission:  I am traditionally a ZZ top styled "cheap sunglasses" kind of guy.  Not that I cant afford expensive styles, I just normally don't fork it over for them.  I bought these because I just liked the way they look.  Not for this week's trendy style, not for comfort, not for the name.  I had been searching for a pair of black frame shades in the 1960s enduring style of cool (think Dirty Harry) and came across these.  My hat size is 7 5/8 and I did not know what 55mm meant size wise.  Surprise!! They fit like a glove!!  Excellent quality, excellent "cool" factor in just the thing I had in mind.  Durable?  We will see.  Practical?  Probably not.  Over the top?  Not by a long shot, there are hundreds costing much, much, much more.  Will I be careful with them?  Youbetcha.  Nice item and rapid transit from the seller via USPS parcel mail.
