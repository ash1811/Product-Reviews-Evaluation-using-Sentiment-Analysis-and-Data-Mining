I always pack my toiletry kit last and then am left wondering how to fit it in my already-packed suit case.  This lies flat on top of everything else.  OK, it doesn't hold everything - I put my contact stuff in a separate bag.  But here's what I've got in there:  Waterproof larger side holds full sized toothpaste, toothbrush, and floss.  Middle holds large daily pill container, full size deodorant, 3 large Go Toobs, bag of Q-tips, and small razor.  One skinny zipped compartment holds two small Go Toobs and a small bottle of sunscreen.  Other skinny zipped compartment holds two cosmetics tubes, and another small Go Toob.  They don't show it well in the pictures, but one end can be expanded.  Bottom line:  This will hold a lot of stuff.
