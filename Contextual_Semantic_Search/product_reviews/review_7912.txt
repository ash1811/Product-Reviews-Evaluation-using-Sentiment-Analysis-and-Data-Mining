This is pretty much the perfect fleece jacket especially when the price is considered. I like this jacket so much that I bought two of them, one for home and one to keep at work. I paid $30 both times. My dad also bought one as well as several of his friends. A jacket of this quality at this price is just too hard to pass up. The thickness of this fleece is just right for a cool days outside (50 degrees and up but I mostly wear it indoors at my office where it's cool during the summer from the air conditioner as well as during the winter. I also wear it around the house in the winter. The construction quality of the jacket is excellent and I haven't had any problems after a year of wearing it almost daily. The collar stays up and the zipper is sturdy. I also like the elastic cuffs on the sleeves. That way it fits people of varying arms lengths. On my jackets without elastic cuffs I often find that the sleeves are too long. The pockets zip which is nice and there is an adjustment cord around the waist of the jacket. I found that the sizing is perfect. I normally wear a large in shirts and jackets and a large in this jacket is just right.
