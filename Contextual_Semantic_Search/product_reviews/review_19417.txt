These slippers are very comfortable, they were shipped very quickly. I wish UGG sold them in 1/2 sizes but a little big is Okay.They are so comfortable my daughter (also has a pair) wears them as shoes. We both love them, they are well made and very soft on the inside.I would recommend them to a friend or anyone looking for a slipper that should last a lifetime.
