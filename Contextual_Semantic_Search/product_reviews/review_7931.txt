My current pair of ear muffs in this style cracked the other day when I tried to put them on. They'd been in the car and the plastic was probably pretty cold and brittle. I couldn't believe how hard it was to find a replacement in this style! I didn't want the current style of behind the head muffs. They just don't stay put... I can't imagine how anyone can stand wearing them. And most of the over-the-head muffs today are not adjustable; they're designed for fashion, not function. I don't care how out-of-fashion I am with these muffs... because I'm warm!
