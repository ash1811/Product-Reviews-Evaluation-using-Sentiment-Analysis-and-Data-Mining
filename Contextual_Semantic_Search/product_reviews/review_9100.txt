I chose this rating because I had to pick a star. would be preferred to of given no stars Cuz after one wearing without washing they were completely covered in anything possible that would stick to it and lots or fuzz from blankets or anything .  I'm very unhappy with them don't know where they're made but you should check for if made in China do not buy them Levis were a U.S. product & should of stayed that way. I would not recommend this to anyone . I'm Very unhappy and when you do wash them it doesn't come off.. I was very happy with jeans bought from &#34;Elite Hero company&#34; Perfect all around.
