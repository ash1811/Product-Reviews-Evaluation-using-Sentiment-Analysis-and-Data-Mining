I originally purchased the Beeswax version over 10 years ago in NYC. I dragged them through the rain, snow, slush, and sun; and they were great (minus wet and cold feet). I joined the military, and these sat in storage for 8 years. Pulled them out and slipped them on, and they felt just like the last time. Ditched those, and purchased a brand new pair. Needless to say, I'm still in love. They are stylish, comfortable, and excellent for long walks immediately out of the box.
