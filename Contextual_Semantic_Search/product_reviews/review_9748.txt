I have always steered far away from &#34;speedos&#34; of any stripe, but these are a great option.These &#34;jammer shorts&#34; are streamlined to your body, but have a somewhat thick lining and are not uh &#34;revealing&#34; as other speedos might be. I feel great wearing these in public, and don't feel like they will elicit stares for any reason. Also they are long, from the waist to the knee, and they stay put when swimming. Happy with them completely.I notice that if I sit on the concrete of the pool, the spandex will start to fray and get &#34;fuzzy&#34; a little. This is purely cosmetic, it doesn't affect the suit so it doesn't bother me. I'll buy again.
