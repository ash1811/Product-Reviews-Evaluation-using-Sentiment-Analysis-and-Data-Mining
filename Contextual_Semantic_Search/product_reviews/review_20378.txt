I love this vest. The price was right and it's very good quality. I wore it a lot and I haven't noticed and pilling at all.I think it runs a little big. I usually wear and XL on the top so I ordered and XL. I could have easily fit into the large but I kept it anyway because I couldn't bare to give it up.
