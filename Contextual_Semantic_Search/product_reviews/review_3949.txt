The Maidenform T-shirt bra is a real winner.  I was totally sold on the bra when I purchased several of them a few years ago.  They quickly became my favorites.  They are perfect for any t-shirt or other form-fitting tops or blouses.  They are simply cut and there are no bra lines/outlines.  Perfect.
