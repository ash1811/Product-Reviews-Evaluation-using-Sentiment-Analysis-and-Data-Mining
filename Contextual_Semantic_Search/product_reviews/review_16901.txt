I love Glamorise bras. I bought a front-closure bra previously and wanted to try this back closure which is great too. Supposedly I've been measured as a 38C but I cannot find a bra that covers everything that needs to be covered; you know what I mean, ladies. So a 38D with Glamorise is perfect. I plan on purchasing another front-closure bra because then you don't see anything under your blouses and sweaters but a smooth back. I like that.
