This is a great watch. It's got a 200 M water resistance, an easy to use interface, and it's very damage-resistant; I've been wearing it while working in a warehouse and while exercising for the past few months and it honestly doesn't look much different than when I first got it in the mail. If you're looking for a basic watch that will taking a beating, G-shock is always a good way to go, and this one is basic and not as ugly as some of the others (don't get me wrong, I love them, but they're ugly).I'd recommend this over timex for a workout watch unless having a bit more weight bothers you; it really isn't heavy and it's comfortable to wear (the strap is wide and textured) and it'll hold up to way more abuse than a timex.
