This is a gorgeous and "delicate" looking watch. I can read it without my glasses and so far it works. I've had trouble with Timex in the past, so I hope this holds up well. It is very pretty and can go with casual or a nice dress in the evening. Update: Don't run it through the wash cycle! Hah. Darn.
