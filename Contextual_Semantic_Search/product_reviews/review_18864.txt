Ordered these boots for my son. He is 5'11&#34; and 175 lbs. He has a long but wide foot and these boots fit perfectly! He likes the low cut because of summer weather and they don't look odd with shorts . The steel toe is a necessity in construction.They are just perfect with some thick ankle socks. He wears them after work, as well. Great strength, wet doesn't seem to hinder them; just simply comfortable working and wearing boots!
