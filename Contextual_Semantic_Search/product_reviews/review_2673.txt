Very nice Timex watch with comfortable expansion band which is a little tight for my small wrist(7 inch) but not too tight and is easy to remove and put back on. The best thing I like is the easy to read dial and the indiglo light to read in dark. Just push stem button in and lights up nicely in dark.It looks like the band is gold plated though it does not mention. As for the day and month setting,I just can not get the stem in right position for that feature,I am not interested in the month and day setting,but would be nice if easier to use.I like the 10 year battery as the instructions state,I remember not too long ago having to get new battery about once a year.Another good watch at a good price that looks more expensive than it cost from Timex. I do recommend this Timex watch with the minor points I mentioned.A very readable timepiece to tell the time with and that's what counts.
