Some people have commented on the scratchiness of the scarf.It feels insubstantial to me.  The crest feels flimsily glued on and is itself stiff and cheesy looking.  The colors are less vibrant than I imagined.  The scarf is also narrower than I imagined.  We bought it to accompany the Harry Potter robes we ordered.  The scarf was too itchy and the kids abandoned it for trick-or-treating.The scarfs at World of Harry Potter cost $10 more, but felt like soft polyester.  They looked much better worn around the neck.  I consider this scarf as more of a costume and decoration (to be used at Halloween only) rather than an everyday scarf.  Our kids do not like to wear it, so I cannot consider it a very good purchase.
