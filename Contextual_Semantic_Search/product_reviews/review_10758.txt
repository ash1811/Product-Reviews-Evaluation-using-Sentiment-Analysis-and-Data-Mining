I lost a pair of sandals in Mexico and a friend had a spare set of Reef Fannings. They blew me away. Not only are they incredibly comfortable (basically open faced shoes), but they are stylish and have a handy bottle opener to boot. I promptly picked up a pair and have been wearing them in the spring and summer ever since.
