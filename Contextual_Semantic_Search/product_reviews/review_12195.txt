I was worried when I first got these, they fit very tightly and chaffed the sides of my feet.  The latter complaint was my own fault as I haven't worn these style of sandals in years, and after about 5 wearings the leather loosened up just enough to make them feel customized for my feet.  These are a great choice for a comfortable, &#34;dressier&#34; flip-flop.
