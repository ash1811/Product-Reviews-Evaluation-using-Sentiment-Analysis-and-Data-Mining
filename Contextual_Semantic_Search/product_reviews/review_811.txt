I'm 56 yrs old. Size 34DD. There are only two bras that I can wear. This is one of them. Amazon is a great place to purchase it as the price is less expensive than stores (Kohls rarely has my size in stock) and it seems to always be in stock. I hope Bali keeps on making this bra. Within the last year I did have an issue with a bra (a piece broke) but I called Bali and they replaced it for free.....UPDATE..this has happened twice....the adjustment pieces on the straps are made of thin plastic. Thin plastic to hold up DDs??????? Cheap.
