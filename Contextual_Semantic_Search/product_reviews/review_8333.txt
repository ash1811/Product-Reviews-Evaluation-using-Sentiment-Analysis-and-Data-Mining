My son was awed and amazed when he received this for Christmas. He kept saying, &#34;Wow, thanks Mom...You didn't have to buy something so expensive!&#34; The price was so amazing I couldn't pass this up. This is a beautiful watch and he loves it. He couldn't wait to get some of the links out to fit his wrist.
