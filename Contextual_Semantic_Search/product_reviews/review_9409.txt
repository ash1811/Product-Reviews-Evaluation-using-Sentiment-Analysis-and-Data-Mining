This is a very practical bag at a reasonable price.  For a while it was my snorkel gear bag but since I have moved away from warmer waters and therefore snorkel only infrequently, I now use it as a gym bag.  It is nice and roomy with a breathable open mesh material so my towel will dry after I shower.  It also seems durable and can be washed.  A good item to have on hand.
