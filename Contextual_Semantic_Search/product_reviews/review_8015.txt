Honestly didn't expect it to fit. I never expect a bra to contain the entirety of my breasts. But this one fits. I don't think I could take a hard core aerobics class with it. I would have to wear another bra under this one for that to be productive. But this is good for low impact stuff - walking, etc. The straps are great - wide and comfortable.
