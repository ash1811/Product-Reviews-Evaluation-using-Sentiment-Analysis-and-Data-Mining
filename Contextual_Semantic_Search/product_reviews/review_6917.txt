What kind of socks a person likes to wear is purely a matter of personal preference, but I've tried a lot of different types of hosiery over the years, these have turned out to be just about perfect for me. Like all Gold Toe socks, they wear like iron, but they also look and feel great. They are definitely the dressy type made for wearing to the office, but I have found them so comfortable that I also wear them on the weekend, too. While they aren't fluffy like athletic socks, they are still pretty cushy - i.e., not the thin type like a lot of dress socks made for men out of nylon. They have a fairly high wool content, which means they keep your feet dry in the summer and insulated/warm in the winter, but they also have just the right amount of stretch to go on easily and to stay up on your leg. These are definitely on the long side (over the calf), and will come up to an inch or two below your knee, which is where I like them so that they don't roll down on you. I bought both black and blue colors, and after at about 10 to 15 washes, they have proved to be totally colorfast, and have not faded in the least. I highly recommend these as a top quality product.
