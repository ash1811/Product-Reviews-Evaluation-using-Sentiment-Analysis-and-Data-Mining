When it has came down to Incita, they have been the highest demand for all kinds of watches. Not just in price, but value and longevity in their timepieces. Their automatic watches have been the highest of demand, not just in price, but value and longevity. definitely follows as well. Their Pro Diver automatic watches are great not just in value, but in convience too. This blue-faced Pro Diver is definitely one of those watches that works brilliantly on the wrist It is a very easy to setup watch, but the big disadvantage is the unidirectional bezel which at times really can stick, and not rotate as briskly as other watches and their brands like Bulova and Citizen. I do like the shine on the piece, and has a great value. for anyone who wants a automatic watch for the people.Price: BSetup & Comfort: B-Overall: B 1/2-
