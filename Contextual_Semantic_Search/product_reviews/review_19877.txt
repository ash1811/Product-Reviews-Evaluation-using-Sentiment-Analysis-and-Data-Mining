My husband wears these shoes to work and I was a little hesitant to buy shoes for him online due to his wide shoe size.  I had a bad experience before with getting wide shoes that weren't really wide at all.  Ultimately, he emptied my Amazon bank (and then some) on a pair of Dockers and was so happy that they fit just like the worn out pair he could now retire.
