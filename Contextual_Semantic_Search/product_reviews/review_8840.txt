This the perfect silky, lacy negligee. I feel like I stepped out of the 1950s. I bought the robe to go with it to make it into a negligee set. While this covers a lot of skin, the bodice is entirely see-through. Wearing this around the house is luxurious and sexy for you and your partner. I am used to buying vintage sizes, and this is definitely not in those sizes. I will size down when I repurchase in the future. I also purchased in red.
