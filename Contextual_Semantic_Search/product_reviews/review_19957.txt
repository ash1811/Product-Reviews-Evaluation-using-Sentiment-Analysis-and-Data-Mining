Slipper was too big, but due to sizing of 12-13, and I wear a 12, that was understandable.  However, the inside of the slipper felt weird.  Not like the fleece it appeared to be, but very synthetic and ultra smooth, like I was walking on sliding fabric.  Hard to describe but that with the too big feeling and the all synthetic fabric added up to &#34;no better than a cheap department store slipper.&#34;Amazon is very easy for returns though.
