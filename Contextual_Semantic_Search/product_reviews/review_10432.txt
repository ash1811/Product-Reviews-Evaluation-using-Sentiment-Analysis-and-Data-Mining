Denim is denim is denim. These jeans meet all the usual standards in terms of appearance and toughness. The problem is that although I ordered my normal size they are cut slightly, bot noticeably,  too small. The next size would be too large. One particular oddity is that the back pockets  are so small that they are difficult to use.
