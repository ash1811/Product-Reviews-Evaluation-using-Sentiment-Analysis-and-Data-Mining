This was a lovely watch however a lot bigger than it looked in the photo, for most that will be fine, and for Invicta that's what you would expect, but this one was just bigger than most, and my husband is skinny just felt it wouldn't work well. 'It was a lovely watch though, just not for me. I won't give it a wrong review because of the bigness because it really was a pretty gorgeous watch,
