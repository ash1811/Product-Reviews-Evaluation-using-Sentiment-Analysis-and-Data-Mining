These overalls fit better than expected.  The stonewashed denim is soft and not stiff as a board.  The pockets are many and placed in convenient places.  The straps are very supportive and the hooks in front are sturdy.  MY husband is particular about overalls and he loves these from Amazon.  I can recommend these for men or women if you like overalls.
