Glad that I bought a pair of Levis for my son who is 6'-6" and 17 yrs old. It is so hard to find pants for his size and at an affordable price. To keep them at the same length size, we just take them to the cleaners or even hand wash and let them air dry.The only thing is that I wish they have a 38 Length in addition to the 36 length.Overall, he is satisfied.
