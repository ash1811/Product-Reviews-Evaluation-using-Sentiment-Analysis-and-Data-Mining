It looks like it can hold quite some cards, however it's much LONGER than a wallet, and won't fit in the pockets of the pants.it does not look like a tool that you'll be taking with you on a daily basis!The black leather is good looking, feels ok!But it's size makes me wonder if anyone actually uses this or not?Never seen anyone pull one out of their coat pockets! It's about the size of a magnum!
