I weigh 87 kg and my height is 1.85 meter and my size L or XL. My size is L or xL depending on length sleeves. body fit is L, but depending on the length of sleeves xl must be sometimes, staying fit a little loose. I bought L and the fit is correct, the sleeve length is just  so it is right for a tall person. Fabric is thin and good. Did not like that the neck is too open.
