These are my favorite jeans, as Lee brand seems to fit me the best.  However, I should really know better to order pants online, as the pair I got was slightly looser than what I'd normally get in a department store.Not amazon's fault, but if you can't try them on before buying, you are always susceptible to getting a pair that doesn't fit quite like you're used to.Still, these jeans have always been quite durable and very comfortable for me.  The black washes out kind of quickly, giving you more of a very dark gray, but most denim will be this way.  It's my jean of choice for the quality and the price.
