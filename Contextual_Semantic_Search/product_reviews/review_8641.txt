These socks do NOT fit as knee socks. I have ordered several pairs, from different manufacturers, in the recent months & of all of them, these are the worst fit for me.I am 5'4.5&#34; tall, not overweight at all, with a BMI of 21.5...so I know that my calves are not that heavy, although I do have large bones...maybe that's why??Anyway, they only reach half-way up the calf, so for what I wanted, they did not fit the bill. I gave them all to my daughter, rather than go through the hassle of returns, etc. At least she can get some use out of them...
