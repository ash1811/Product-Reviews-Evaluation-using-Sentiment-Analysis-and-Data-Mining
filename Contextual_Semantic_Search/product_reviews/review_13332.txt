I should have ordered the next size, they are a little too narrow for my face but the quality and look is awesome,  They have attitude and style, they clearly protect my eyes.  I'm in south america on the equatorial line so the sun is stronger and far more damaging than in other parts of the world.  These are absolutely perfect!!!
