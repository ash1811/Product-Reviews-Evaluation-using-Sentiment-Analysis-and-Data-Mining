I cannot comment on the watch itself because I returned it after trying it on. The problem is with the band. Where the wrist strap is attached to the watch the band is not flexible. As a result the band sticks out on both sides of the watch making it difficult for a shirt cuff to pass over it and making it unsightly and easily knocked or caught. It would be fine on anyone with a broad wrist but not on an average or smaller wrist.Pity. I spent a long time looking for a watch I liked and this seemed to fit the bill because it has a pleasant blue face with white fingers etc which are clearly seen.
