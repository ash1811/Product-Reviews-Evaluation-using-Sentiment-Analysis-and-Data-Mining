LOVE THESE SHOES!  I read the reviews about how comfortable these shoes were and I was a bit skeptical.  How comfortable could they really be?  EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE!  One of the most comfortable, true to size fitting pairs of shoes I've ever owned!  The egg carton type cushioning makes the difference!  They arrived very quickly as well.  I will probably purchase an extra pair as a spare.  Highly recommend.
