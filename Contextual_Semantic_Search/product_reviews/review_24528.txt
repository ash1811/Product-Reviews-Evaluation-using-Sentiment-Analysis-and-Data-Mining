This Bulova #96R19 is really beautiful in person and can be dressed up or down and the chronograph adds style and personality. The watch does not look cheap and the face is not too large even for my small wrist.  It is a tad bigger than the traditional woman''s watch but it still is smaller than the larger faces now in style.  I actually chose the Bulova 96R19 first after seeing it in a department store but being the researcher that I am, I discovered the Bulova 96R134 model and I liked it more for the slightly larger bezel, shaded gray face and additional diamonds, especially for the same price. I have added pictures of this watch on my 6" wrist (probably smaller than the average ladies' wrist size) and some comparison pictures next to the Bulova 96R134. For a watch in this price range, you cannot go wrong with this Bulova. I am very happy with choosing this brand and will buy more in the future.
