Having reached an age when my middle is expanding (slightly) despite all of the exercise and dieting I can do, it was great to be able to find jeans that fit on-line. The relaxed fit is just my style.For 40 years, I've been wearing a 34x34; lately, they're just a bit tight. Very few (if any) stores carry 35" waist, and the 36" are just too big.So I was pleased to find comfortable jeans in my size.  They look great, feel great, and were delivered as promised. (Extra bonus: a couple of stones from the stone-weashing process ended up in my pockets).
