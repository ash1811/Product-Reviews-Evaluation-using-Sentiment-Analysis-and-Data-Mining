Having read the reviews, I had high hope for this shoe.  The fit is true to size and the shoe is lightweight.  However, it does not provide comfort for long term wear.  I tested it standing doing house chores for half an hour and my feet is tired.  So I bought insoles for the heel and bought an arch support which makes it more comfortable.  I think it is OK for short term wear but I like my Klogs better (but of course, you cannot exercise with Klogs shoes!).
