This is a great shoe, they are very comfortable, true to size, MUCH BETTER than your discount stores house slippers, but of then they cost a lot more too..AS for my 4 stars it's not really the shoes fault. I have MS, and I actually didn't want much traction, because I scoot my feet when I walk(lots of other diseases do the same), but they don't slide very well- I realize this a good thing, if you can walk right. My fingers don't work very well either, and it seemed they were a little harder to get on than they should be. Again I'm NOT knocking the shoe, but for my unique situation, they weren't what I hoped. So I continue looking for that perfect shoe ....
