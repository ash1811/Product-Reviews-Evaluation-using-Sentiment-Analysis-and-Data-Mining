I needed a bag that I can take to the club and fit into a locker.  I need to fit my tennis shoes a size 12, a towel for the pool, gym clothes and swim trunks and shower shoes.  This bag fits into the locker and holds everything perfectly.  There is an interior pouch that zips on the inside for my wallet, ring and watch.  Size wise I could not ask for anything more.The material is a well constructed plastic and seems to be well crafted.  The zipper is larger than a typical zipper and thus easy to grab ahold of.  The shoulder strap is lengthy and is just right for my size 6'4".I had planned on buying an addidas bag but I did not like the color that was available at the mall.  I remembered Diadora from my days of playing tennis and thought I would give it a try.  It is $10 less than the addidas bag and seems to be better made.
