Horrible cheap flimsy material, irritating and scratchy on the breasts. The band width is a bit large for 36; the cups are sewn into a bullet bra formation that is like something out of the 1950's with an unlined seam that runs right across sensitive nipples. I couldn't stand to have it on my skin for more than 15 minutes. Tossed it in the trash; a waste of 20 bucks and a lesson well-learned: cheap bras are awful!
