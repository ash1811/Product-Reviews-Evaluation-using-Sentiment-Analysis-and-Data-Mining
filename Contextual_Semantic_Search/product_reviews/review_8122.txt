Love this Sarong.  It looks great on my girl whether tied at the waist, or above the breasts.  She is just a tad on the plus side, but the Sarong was still plenty big enough.  If you want to wear it around your neck...get a cover-up dress, not a Sarong or wrap.  The colors are rich, and the wrap seems to be decent quality.  I sent her out to get a plum purple pedicure to match the purple hibiscus flowers, and also purchased the black & purple New Balance women's WMN Rev II Flip Flops.  She was already the hottest thing at the pool this year, now she's doing it with style & taste.
