I adore this spacious, good-looking carryall/tote. Holds it ALL, and then some. The khaki is terrific - doesn't steal any theater from any purse you may carry, yet is more delightful than a business bag when you require something to hold the abundant 'stuff' you may have to transport.NOTE: Just bought my 2nd ONLY BAGG, this time in black. This is the BEST bag(g) made for people like me who cannot reduce the essentials to just the essentials that you need to have at your disposal, wherever you may need to go.I expect I may need (want?) a third bag(g) soon - perhaps sage?
