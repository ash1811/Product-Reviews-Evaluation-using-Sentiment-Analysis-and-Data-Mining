I was looking for a new sports bra as my last one wore out.  I am well endowed and need something that gives a lot of support when I jog.To be honest, I liked my old one better (bought on Amazon: Moving Comfort Women's Maia Bra) but it wasn't available in my size and I really needed a new one.This bra is lined with white cotton on the inside, which makes it a little warm, although it does wick moisture well.The underwire is supportive but actually feels like a plastic rather than wire, although I do not know that for sure.One of the problems I have with it is the clasp.  It has 3 hook and eye closures, but the hook side is very thick, with the fabric folded over about 3 times in that spot.  That makes it hard to clasp, especially since this bra does not have much give to it, which gives it the support it needs.Overall I am happy with this purchase, but when it is time to buy a new one, I think I will again try for the Moving Comfort Women's Maia Bra again.
