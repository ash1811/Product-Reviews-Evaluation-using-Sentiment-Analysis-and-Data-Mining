I'm short.  It's difficult finding pants in any store that fits.  Levi 501 & 505 jeans are my favorite jeans, but it's always a hassle trying to get them in the size I need.  Ordering them from Amazon got me closer to my size than any previous experience in any store I've gone to. Guess where I'll be buying my Levis from now on?
