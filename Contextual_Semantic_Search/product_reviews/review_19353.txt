Talk about toegasms. I've long lusted after these boots and they're exactly as comfortable as they look. The lining makes me apoplectic with joy. They're warm but breathable (and actually kinda cuter than I expected, heh).The other reviews are right - buy about a half-size down. I'm a 9 1/2 or 10 most of the time and got these in a 9. They fit perfectly. I just wish the sole had a little more traction.Great boot, worth the money.
