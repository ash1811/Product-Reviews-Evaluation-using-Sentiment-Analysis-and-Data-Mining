FRYE Women's Belted Harness Mulei got this mule and it was rather heavy and clobby when i walked. I ordered the tan color. I am sorry, this was about the ugliest shoe i have ever bought. My foot kept on sliding back over the little leather heel when i walked and it was very uncomfortable. Sent back, of course.
