Uggs in general are UGLY shoes, but for kids they are light weight and warm. These shoes are not the quality I expected for the money. It's made of micro-fiber Suede with a small patch of suede leather at the heel. The shoe is flat without any arch support. It's like wearing expensive slippers outdoors. By the look of them ... it'll absorb any splash of water. I would highly recommend Bearpaw boots over these any day. At least Bearpaw is made of 100% suede leather through out with soft sheep skin fur and the sole has better traction ... it's half the price. I returned these and the seller was very responsive and helpful.
