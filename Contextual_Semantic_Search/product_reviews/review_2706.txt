This watch is really nice, I liked it and ordered it. However, when it showed up, the size was way too small not as the description mentions. It indicates Case diameter as 34 mm and Band width 20 mm but the truth is the Case diameter is 28 or 30mm and the band width is 16 mm. the only wider part is right at the case but the rest of the band is thinner! I was so disapointed because I have a Timex that has a Case diameter of 33 mm and band width of 20 mm so I was very sure the watch I was ordering would be just the right size! I had to send back. I am considering ordering the same watch but in the men's version which is Case diameter 40 mm. Hoping the measurements are right on this one! It is a nice watch for everyday wear and really light. Gave three stars because of the wrong info.P.S. This watch doesn't have a date while the men's version has a tinny window for the date. Actually I have seen several buy it for younger boys and girls and i believe it is a good choice and also for those who like smaller watches/have a smaller wrist!
