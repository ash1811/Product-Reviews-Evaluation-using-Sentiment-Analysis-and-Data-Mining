my daughter was a harry potter freak at an early age, she devoured all of the books, but now that she is 15 she has longed since moved on to other things. but this item, along with several other hp themed items i purchased for her this xmas, took her back to the days when she and harry were inseparable, it was great to see, she loved the wand and all of the hp gifts she received this xmas, even at 15.
