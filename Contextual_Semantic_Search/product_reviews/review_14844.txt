It fits well and he wears it...that's a score in my book!We all have those gifts we gave him to wear that never again see the light of day, and then there are those that he keeps forever and refuses to get rid of when their day is done.  This one has definitely made the keeper cut.  (Carharrt usually hits the mark with men...well, with mine for sure.)  I like the thick quality of the cotton, and the Henley neck makes for a nice, dressier change from the usual tees. The red color is really deep and rich.  Fits true to size without being either too tight or too loose through the body (he's picky about that) and he's wearing it both tucked in or left out.  I will be looking at this shirt for a long time so it's a good thing thing that I like it too!
