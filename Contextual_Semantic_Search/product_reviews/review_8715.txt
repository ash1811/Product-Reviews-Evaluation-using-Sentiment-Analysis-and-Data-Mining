I have always been a Swatch person, and I have to say I have been very wrong! This watch is amazing, I love everything about it. Easy to operate, water does not get in, love the light, love the dial... It is very nice! The picture on Amazon is not quite accurate. The red that you see is actually Barbie-pink. I personally like it better pink. It has a really cool feature where you can activate the light just by twisting your wrist. Very convenient. It is light and not bulky. Very feminine. The strap and the whole watch is really good quality. I never take it off. No more Swatches for me.
