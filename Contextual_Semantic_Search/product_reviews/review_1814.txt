While there is always some minor variations as the years have turned, I have been a fan of Rocport shoes for the past 20 years now.  I often wear them into the ground (probably for longer than I should) and they always have been a stylish, comfortable shoe.  Great when you have to put a lot of milage on in a day, as these shoes are just about as good to wear as my running shoes, yet be acceptable for less dressy days at the office.
