Bought 3 one of these.  The watch is easy to see, has 3 alarms, and has nice colors.But, the bands are not replaceable (they stretch off the watch) and the lighter colored ones show dirt, and some of the dirt can't be cleaned off.  The band on 1st watch gave out after one year.  The 2nd watch didn't survive beginning open water diving (20 minutes at a maximum of 35'). The band on the 3rd watch lasted only two months.
