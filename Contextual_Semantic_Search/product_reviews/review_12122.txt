I purchased these shoes to wear to work and with my new 511 outfits. I normally don't order shoes online because I have a wide foot and it's hard for me to find shoes that actually fit my feet, thus I like to try them on before I buy. However, in the case of this shoe upon checkout it lets you choose your shoe size and width. So I took a chance...Wow, not only do the shoes look great but the also fit my wide foot and are very comfortable for not having been broke in. They also seem to add an inch to my overall height so the heels of my paints don't drag on the ground anymore. Very nice.So far I am happy with them and I'm glad I took the chance. If something comes up or they don't last long I'll update this review.
