I picked these up and slipped them on my feet and they felt like they were meant for my feet.  These were the most comfortable boots I've had with initial wearing.  Wearing them for the last couple of months, they have remained comfortable.  The only issue I've had is laces have to be double knotted or they come undone after a couple hours of wear.  Also, they are not as waterproof as described.  I did treat them with mink oil when they first arrived and continue to do so as needed, but water does seem to sneak in somewhere low in the sole if you step in a puddle or muck through some snow/slush.  Not soaked, but you can feel a little cold wetness in the arch and ball of the foot.
