I bought one of these neck stashes for my most recent cruise and used it everyday while on vacation.  You can adjust the strap to fit your taste. There are three sections and you can get quite a bit in it.  I stuffed cash, my passport, driver's license and several credit cards in it and still had some room to spare.
