I love these shoes and have been wearing them almost daily since purchasing them almost 6 months ago. They are comfortable (extremely!) and easy to slip on and off. They match with almost anything I wear which is a bonus. I will say whatever is coating the inside of the shoe sort of melted away and clumped up, turning some of my socks brown at first, though this eventually went away. I will definitely be buying another pair of these if and when my current pair bites the dust.
