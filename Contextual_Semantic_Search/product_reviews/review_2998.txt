this is the jacket ive been looking for!! very tuff outer shell.. the flannel inside the jacket is very soft and warm. this is now my favorite jacket. the large tall is fits me well.. iam 6'4 so the extra 2in in length over the standard large helps. Carhartts run large so this is a very big jacket for a large size but i already knew that and i don't mind. perfect work jacket and its made in america!!! which is why i chose it over other models of work jacket and iam very glade i did.. bottom line buy this jacket you wont regret it.. just remember that they run big so if you normally wear an xl or xxl jacket a large carhartt will pry be your best bet.
