When I got two cans of this stuff I was immediately angered how mold had grown at the top of this polish.  I then went outside and used a lighter to heat up the wax a little bit and scrub the mold out.  The rest of the cans however were flawless after this process.  The polish lasts quite a bit longer than my normal kiwi parade gloss, yet it looks just as good.  I simply just brush my boots to clean them, then i apply polish using an applicator, then i use a shine brush (i use the same brush as my cleaning brush!) to get it looking good.  This polish hasn't let me down, and it is now my goto polish for cleaning my police boots (5.11 and bates) each week.  The can is also bigger than most kiwi cans you'll find (hence the upcharge for this item), and i normally get around 5-6 months use out of one can with polishing one set of boots once a week.
