I'm a 40DD. The girls need support and this bra delivers. No uni-boob whatsoever. The girls are held beautifully in place. No side boob.  In fact, the way the bra is designed, there is an extra piece of fabric on the sides that gives your chest a very flattering, shapely look.  Also, the shoulder straps are perfectly spaced unlike some bras that fall down your shoulders and you're forever hiking them back up.The highest quality straps and fasteners of any bra I own.  Does not loose support over time. Washes well.I now have one of these in every color.  What I love about this bra is it's supportive enough for a workout yet comfortable enough for everyday wear. In fact, it's the most comfortable bra I own.  I have 7 different brands of sports bras and all manner of regular dress-for-the-office bras, when all my bras are clean and I have the pick of the litter, this is the one I grab.
