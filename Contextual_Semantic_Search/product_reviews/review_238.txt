I wear my high-top chucks until they have holes everywhere so I know my size and style.  These were cheaper than the chucks on the converse website so I took a chance and am happy that I did.  They are the same ones I get every time, perfect size, perfect fit.  They are just as comfy as always, needing only one double-socked wear to break them in.  I love them. &#9829;
