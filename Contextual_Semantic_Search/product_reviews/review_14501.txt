I remember wearing birkinstocks as a child and that they were some of the most comfortable sandals ever made. I was so disappointed when I out grew them. Now, as an adult, I decided to try them out again. This is the best deal I could find for a great pair in a great color. They come out of the box hard, however after a few wears they soften up and conform to your feet.
