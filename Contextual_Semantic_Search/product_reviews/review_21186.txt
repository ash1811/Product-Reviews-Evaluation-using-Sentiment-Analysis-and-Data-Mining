I bought a pair of these last year that were sadly eaten by my puppy. I bought an Aqua pair as a replacement this year. I couldn't imagine going through a summer without a pair of sandals this comfortable. Apparently I didn't pay enough attention to the picture of the product. I didn't realize the sole would be brown instead of black. It looks nice with the Aqua blue though. The sandals look great with my whole wardrobe.
