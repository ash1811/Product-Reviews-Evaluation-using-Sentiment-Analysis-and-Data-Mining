we got a TON of compliments on the costume!  It was thin and came with a bunch of the ties that were all different lengths so I had to &#34;figure out&#34; what went where, but it fit him perfectly and he LOVED it (which is really all that matters) and the kids in the neighborhood liked it too! Again its THIN and you get what you pay for....but for the price its a WIN!
