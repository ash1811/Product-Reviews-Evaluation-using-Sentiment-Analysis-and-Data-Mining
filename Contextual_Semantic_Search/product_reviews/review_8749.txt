I had to order different sizes several times to get it right-  but it was worth it.  I normally wear a 36C/D, but the 36C in this bra was too big in the cup.  I was disappointed, but I decided to try again, because the cotton cups have potential, and it is hard to find a front-close bra with cotton cups.I wear a 36C/D, but in this bra I am wearing a 36B-  the cups run large.I encourage you to size down in the cup.I am wearing this bra right now, and it is so comfortable.  Support is good due to the front close, which can be a bit difficult to fasten.  But, The straps are among the most comfy I've ever had on a bra.There is no padding, and these cups give a fairly natural shape (not pointed like some other front-close bras).
