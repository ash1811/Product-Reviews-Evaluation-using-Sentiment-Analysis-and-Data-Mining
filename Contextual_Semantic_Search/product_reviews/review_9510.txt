I recently bought 5 new pairs of socks, all of them different styles and brands.  For the past few years I've been wearing Thorlos thick cushion running socks which to date are the best socks I've ever worn.  However, they are pricey.  Only a few dollars more than what I paid for these socks, but when buying 10 pairs at a time, a few dollars per pair can make a big difference.I would say that these socks are superior to your average Hanes and Fruit of the Loom socks, but not ton much better.  They breathe, feel quite nice against the skin, and seem very durable.  But I don't think they're worth $10 per pair.  Maybe $5 per pair, $6 maximum.  They lack the cushioning that I desire and are a tad bit too big.Overall, I think you're paying for the name on the sock than the sock itself.  If you find them on sale, I recommend these socks, otherwise, I suggest you fork over a few more dollars and go with Thorlos.
