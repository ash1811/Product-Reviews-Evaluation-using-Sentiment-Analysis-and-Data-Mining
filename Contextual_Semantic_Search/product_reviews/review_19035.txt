Easy to read. Not a single imperfection other than the basic style. Nice looking crystal, no debris inside the case even under a magnifying glass. Very clean looking, light and comfortable to wear. Not for XL wrists. I'm an average dude and I wear it on about the last rung. Strap could be heavier- but, It's o.k. Great for hiking, mountain biking, outdoor use. If I were actually in the military, though, I would choose something a little smarter like a G-shock but, I like this one too. I would never wear it &#34;out&#34;, but what Can I say, 30 bucks. Philippines movement, China strap and case.
