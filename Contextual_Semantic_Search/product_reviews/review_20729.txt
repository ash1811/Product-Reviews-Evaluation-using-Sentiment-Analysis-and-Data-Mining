My hushand is always saying you can't buy jeans online. I ordered nine pair of various jeans on Amazon, going by reviews of fit and the picture of the man actually wearing the jeans...who is built like my husband, you can generally tell from the picture how these are going to fit. Men are not like women when it comes to a million different shapes and sizes, they are pretty generally alike in most ways and most differences. He loved these and they fit perfect everywhere! We were able to keep all nine pair, when I had expected to return many of them and re-order, I love, love, love that many sellers have free returns making shopping a breeze!!
