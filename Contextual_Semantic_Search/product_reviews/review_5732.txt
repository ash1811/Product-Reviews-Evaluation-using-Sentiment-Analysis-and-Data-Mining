After reading the other reviews, I decided to get a large rather than a medium.  I tend to wear anywhere from a size 8 to a 12, depending upon the item.  When I received these, I loved them, but they are not tight enough to be considered compression tights at all.  I kept them rather than returning, because they are still useful for cold weather running, and they are very comfortable, well-made and otherwise very nice.  I also did not have a problem with the ankle elastic as some other reviewers mentioned.  I'm writing this review in case there are other people trying to decide about which size to get- I wish I had gotten them a bit smaller.  If you're between sizes, size down!
