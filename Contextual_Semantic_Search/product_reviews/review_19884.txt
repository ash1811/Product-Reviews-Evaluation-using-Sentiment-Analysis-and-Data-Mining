I ALMOST totally love these shoes.  They fit great, look great, and are very versatile.  However; my job requires me to be on my feet a lot, and after working for 6-8 hours, my feet feel really sore and swollen.  Could be the floor I work on, could be the fact that I'm on my feet the whole time, could also be the shoes.  Who knows, I do like them very much though, although next time I'm going to look for something a little more comfortable for my job.
