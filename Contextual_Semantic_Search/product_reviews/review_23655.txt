I HAVE AN UNUSUALLY HIGH ARCH AND THIS IS THE ONLY SHOE I CAN WEAR ALL DAY LONG. I HAVE SEVERAL PAIRS. THESE COVER MY FOOT SO I CAN WEAR THEM AT WORK IN THE SUMMER. I HAVE THE FULL SHOE ALSO (LONDON) I'VE HAD FOR 15 YEARS. I KNOW I WILL GET MANY YEARS OF WEAR OUT OF THESE SHOES. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SHOE TO SOME ONE WITH PLANTAR FACITIS LIKE I HAVE IT TAKES THE PRESSURE OFF THE HEEL.
