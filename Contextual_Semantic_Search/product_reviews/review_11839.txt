Had trouble finding Navy boat shoes for my husband until I found this pair on Amazon.  He said they felt a little snug at first, but didn't take long to break in and become quite comfortable.  They were also the exact shade to match his navy blazer, so they were a nice finishing touch to his boating association dress attire.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this great shoe!
