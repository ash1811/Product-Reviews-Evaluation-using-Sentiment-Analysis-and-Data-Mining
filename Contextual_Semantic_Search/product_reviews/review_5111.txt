The order arrived earlier the estimated date. Vendor's customer services is great.My shoes size is from 6.0 to 7.5, it really depends on kind of shoes and brand. This was slight larger, but I can work with it.It is good for shoes low rise, flat. It works in some flat boots as well. The material is great.Oh, they came in pairs....I hope this helps. Enjoy!
