My husband loves Cargo pants mainly because of the pockets.  We looked locally for some good cargo pants but couldn't find anything in his size.  Decided to check online with Amazon and found these.  Ordered one to check out the fit and quality and was so happy I ordered two more pair in different colors!  My husband noticed that the length was different on each pair even though we ordered the same size.  Still need to be laundered but very happy with the fit and comfort.
