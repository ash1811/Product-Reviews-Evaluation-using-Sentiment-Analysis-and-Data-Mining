I tried these shoes about a 8 months ago with a Gold Box deal.  I am delighted with these shoes and in fact I am wearing them now.  You might fine yourself wearing them all day, even going to a ball game or a cruise.  I have since ordered and received an additional pair and will order more.  Be aware that the you should order your simple shoes about one size larger as I normally wear a 10 or 10 1/2.  In this particular shoe I wear an 11 1/2.  Additioally, they wear long before showing any signs of wearing out.  You will be happy.
