The new pair of boots are great!! I had to send the first pair back, but Amazon shipped another pair, and those were perfect. I wear these boots everywhere. They are very comfortable. I did put a foam insert in the boot for extra comfort. I also sprayed them with water proofer, because I do wear them through the snow. Everyone who see's these boots gives me a compliment. I am very happy with this purchase.
