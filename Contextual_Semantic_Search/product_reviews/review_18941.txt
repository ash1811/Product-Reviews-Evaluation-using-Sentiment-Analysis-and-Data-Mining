I bought this as a gift for my 7 year old nephew, who had asked for a digital watch for Christmas. He was so excited when he opened it that he called his mom right away to tell her about it. He's small for his age, but this watch was able to adjust to fit him perfectly and was easy to set. I'm definitely pleased with this purchase.
