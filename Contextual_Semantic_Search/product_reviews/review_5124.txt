I use these in my cowboy boots and they have done a wonderful job of keeping the toes from curling up with infrequent use. All of my boots are exotics and require dressing to be applied quite frequently. With these in place the task becomes a joy instead of a chore. I am going to buy many more pairs! By the way they fit perfectly and are very easy to put in or take out. I use my boot jack hooks to remove them as my arthritic fingers are no longer up to the task.
