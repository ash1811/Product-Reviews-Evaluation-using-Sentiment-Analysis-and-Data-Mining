I am short & worse yet, I have short legs. Most shorts are just too long & wind up making me look fat and squatty. these are short, so if you have  really big legs, don't get them. but if you have average or slim legs, these are ideal!  Comfy, pull on quickly, launder well. They are so inexpensive you can do your outside work and not worry about ruining them. they are made, I believe, for younger women, but I'm over 50 and I think I look nice in them. (I don't have a lot of flab or cellulite).  Good for canoeing, lawn care, hiking, bike-riding, walking or just about anything in the summer . It's HOT down here, and the very light material allows you to do work without the shorts giving off extra heat (like blue jean or thicker shorts)
