My daughter, husband, and I love going on nature walks and I decided to purchase these boots for my first grader since she loves splashing around in puddles and wading in streams and creeks. These are nice, sturdy boots. The pink color was greatly appreciated by my daughter, and she loves walking around in them. I had her wear it last weekend when we went fishing in a nearby stream. The boots did a good job of keeping her feet comfortable and dry, well, until she fell into the stream!Anyway, I purchased this in  kids' size 1 so that she'll get more use out of it (she is actually a 13), and though it is a bit big, she is still able to walk in it comfortably without it slipping off. When we got back from the walk, I rinsed the boots out, and the insoles come off quite easily, to make cleaning convenient.
