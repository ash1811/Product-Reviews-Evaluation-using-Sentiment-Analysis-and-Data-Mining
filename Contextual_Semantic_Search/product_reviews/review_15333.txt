I bought these for my wife to spice things up a bit. As a bonus I thought that maybe she'd like them and find them comfortable. I was hoping for kind of an old school, traditional / conservative look. They do look great on her, as everything does. However, they're made of a rather thin material, and simply weren't quite as sexy as I had imagined. Additionally she doesn't really care for them because they wear so high that they hang out of her jeans / pants. However, these issues may not be a problem for you, and I can see how some women would find these to be perfect.
