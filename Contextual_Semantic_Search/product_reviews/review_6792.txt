I ordered these socks in the tan set and the colours are just as shown. They are thicker than you'd expect--not as thick as wool or those special hiking socks or anything, but definitely thicker than your average sneaker sock. So, I'd really only wear them in warm weather. I wear a size 8-8.5 shoe and they fit just fine. They seem pretty durable so I think it's worth the price. So glad I can find socks on Amazon b/c I work and have no time to go to department stores.
