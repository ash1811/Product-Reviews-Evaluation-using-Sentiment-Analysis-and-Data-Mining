Buy them for their looks, you know it's not the first time you spent some cash on something with smooth skin and an attractive figure, but you know you'll get satisfaction in return from these beauties. On a side note: I found my new ones to be even more comfortable than my old ones with almost no break-in. The leather inside a new pair feels so good you'll want to experience it on bare skin.
