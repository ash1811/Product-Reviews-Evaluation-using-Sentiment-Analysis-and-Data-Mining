I'm a young woman with kids, and sometimes I get sick of lounge pants and t-shirts and I want to wear something that makes me feel pretty. That's why I bought this gown.However, it doesn't work for me. While I typically don't wear my PJs around the house, and wear robes and all when I do, this would be completely unacceptable to wear around my kids because the lace bodice has absolutely no lining. The picture makes it seem like it does, it looks solid with a lace overlay.I had to return it.
