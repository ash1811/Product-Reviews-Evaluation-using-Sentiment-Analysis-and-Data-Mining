My old jansport was on its last legs after I've had it for 8 years so it was time to get a new one. I looked for the most basic, affordable backpack and found this guy. Very impressed. It's well-constructed and reinforced to let me know that all of my belongings are safe. Recommended for people who just want a backpack for school, the gym, or for outdoor activities.
