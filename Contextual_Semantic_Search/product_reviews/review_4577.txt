These pants are kind of baggie as I am a woman, but my job demands quick and free movement. I can't wear anything out there that is offered for a woman as they are too confining and revealing. I must have no restrictions and look professional. I am very happy with these pants. And they last, not like my old Lee's I chose to work in. They were nearly 40 bucks a pair and lasted maybe 6 months. This is the product that works for me.
