I used this product in Oslo, Norway. I'm from Virginia Beach, Va and I'm not used to extreme cold like I experienced in Oslo. There were alot of days and night it was below zero and the Carhartt overalls kept me warm. They take a while to break in cause they are stiff and will stand up on their own, but worth the wait.
