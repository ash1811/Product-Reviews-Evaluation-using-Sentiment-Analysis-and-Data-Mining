The look is a bit off --- two dials, not three (days of the week?) for balance such as on the Seiko very similar chronograph (non-perpetual, non-kinetic).  This is an important comparison as the chrono (sold by amazon) is $180 and this is $360 ($330 a month ago).  The chrono looks better as it has three subdials and is a very dark blue while this is a blackish gray.  The big dates on both are great for those with less than perfect eyesight such as I.  The workmanship on both is very good and I personally like the look (a bit like a Patek Nautilus).  Both have sapphire crystals.What's nice about this one.  The perpetual aspect (it works!) and it's apparent superb accuracy.  The first time the date catches up after sleep ids a bit cool but also means the watch battery will last a shorter period of time (i.e., will be able to retain power for maybe 4 years, not 8).  Replacement probably $150.  (Kinetic is a mixed bag.)Three year warranty, not five such as form Citizen.It is a nice watch.  If you like the looks buy it or get the similar chrono for $180  (I like the looks but some won't.)Recommended with reservations --- if you buy this you need to wear it every day for watch health.  Maintenance seems a bit expensive.Many will love this.
