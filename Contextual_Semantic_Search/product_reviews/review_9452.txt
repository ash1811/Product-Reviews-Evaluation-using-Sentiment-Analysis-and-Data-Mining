These look like the real thing and for the price you can't beat them. If not alligned correctly they have a tendency to fall out. I found that if I very slightly raise the stud it is perfect. I sleep, work and play with these in 2 holes and I have not lost one yet! They are comfortable when sleeping and I forget that I have them in.  I'm always checking my earrings to make sure that they're still on. But not with these. I have also received numerous complimentsand you can't beat the price.
