I like dress watches and usually wear something more elegant than this Casio watch, but I felt like having something casual and thought it would be fun to have a digital watch like I had when I was a kid.This watch is great for me because it's big and beefy but very lightweight.  It probably weighs a lot less than any of my other watches, yet it seems fairly durable, and it's so inexpensive that you don't really worry about it if anything should happen to it.One of my favorite things about this watch is its simplicity.  With a quick glance I can see what day it is, including the day of the week, in addition to the time.  I know that might not seem like a big deal to most people, but I'm kind of absent minded sometimes, so it's actually nice for me when I can look at my watch and see that ok, today is Saturday.  Yes, I can do this on some of my other watches, but they have dials mostly, some of them that need to be set periodically, so I can't really trust that maybe I set it correctly, or else they are tiny and hard to see.Also I like the timer feature, for when I am cooking something and I can't hear the timer in the kitchen because maybe I am too far away.Some reviews I read say the buttons are very hard to push, which I found to be true in the very beginning of owning the watch, but after an initial breaking in period, they are a little bit easier.  Not to say they are a soft touch, they do require some effort.  The upside is that you're not likely to push one of the buttons and change a setting by accident by bumping it.
