I bought this shirt because of the Russell brand of sweat shirts I previously purchased. The Russell sweat shirts are great, this shirt, however, is not well made.This shirt is not the same high quality standard of the Russell sweat shirts.Within two washes, the collar and the cuffs began to lose shape. The fit and construction of the shirt is very poor and the Russell logo on the left sleeve also began to fade.I have also purchased the Champion long sleeve shirt on Amazon at a lower price and found that it is a superior product to the Russell shirt.The Russell shirt is made of 100% cotton and is made in El Salvador.Jon Green
