I love these garden shoes!The Original MuckBoots Adult Daily Garden ShoeI have high arches and wear orthotics in all except my indoor Crocs, so when I slipped off my Crocs and slipped into these for the first time - WITH NO HANDS!!! - I was amazed at how supportive and comfortable they were. I'm in and out of them many times a day and they are worth every penny. The inside comes out for washing, but they are high enough that I've never had anything leak inside. I plan to buy a second pair in case these ever wear out, but after one year there is absolutely no sign of wear.
