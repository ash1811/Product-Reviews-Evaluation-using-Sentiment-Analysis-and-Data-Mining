Based on the positive reviews, I bought this for my boyfriend who's owned the same wallet for half a decade to the point where it's falling apart. I thought it would be a more supple leather, but it was actually fairly stiff and had a weird chemical smell. The stitching and construction of the wallet seem ok, but the leather was weird. I tried rubbing some conditioner on it to soften it up and that helped a bit.
