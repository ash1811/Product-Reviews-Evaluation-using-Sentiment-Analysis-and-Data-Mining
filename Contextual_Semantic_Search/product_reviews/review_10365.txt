I bought this for my daughter's best friend as part of a birthday gift. She is the consummate &#34;Potter&#34; freak, and we already got her Harry's wand, so let's keep going! It was soft, and well-made. She was very pleased, and proceeded to wear it all night long, my daughter told me! I guess 'nuff said....It arrive super fast, and well-packaged.
