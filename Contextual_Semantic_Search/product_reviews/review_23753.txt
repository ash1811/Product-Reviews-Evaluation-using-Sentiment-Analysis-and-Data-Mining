This fit surprised me because I thought I was purchasing a unisex top; if I would have read the description clearly I would have definitely ordered a large. I am somewhat busty & of course prefer to downplay my assets at work; any t-shirt or button-down top I absolutely have to order a &#34;large&#34;. This top is much bigger than I expected, so much so that I feel a little &#34;fluffy&#34; when wearing it, which isn't the worst thing but a surprise nonetheless. Other than that my only other complaint is that the fabric collects lint like crazy.
