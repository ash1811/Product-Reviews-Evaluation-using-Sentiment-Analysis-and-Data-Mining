I bought these for my boyfriend as a gift, not even knowing whether he would want them. He's been wearing them ever since!He says they are the most comfortable pants hes ever owned. He is 6'2, 34&#34; waist and 34&#34; inseam, and says they fit length and waist better than any pants he's owned, as well as being soft outside and great color. I would say that they wear a little baggy, but I guess they are still very comfortable to wear.The dark grey that I purchased has a bit of sheen, so I'd call it more of a gunpowder color. Also the slick texture seems to resist cat hair pretty well (we have 2 cats so this is a big deal in our house).
