I bought two pairs of Docker khaki's, a pair ofD1and this D3 'classic' fit. While the D1 was amazing and fit perfectly as I'd imagine but these were just horrible. The first thing I noticed was the cut before I even put them on. These were hideous looking and it is not even remotely close to the picture (I posted some pics). They appeared fat and baggy and when tried them on it they made me look like a hip-hop fan. One of the reviewers here stated that he's also gotten different sizings. Returned this and kept the awesome D1.
