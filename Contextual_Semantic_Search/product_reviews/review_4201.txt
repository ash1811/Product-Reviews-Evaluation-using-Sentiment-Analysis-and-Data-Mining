I'm a 38H and this bra was great at first. But the weight of my boobs has formed a permanent crease in the band under my boobs, right where I need support the most. This results in a saggy appearance. I'm giving up on trying anything that doesn't have underwire. At my size, I think it's just absolutely necessary for proper support and lift.
