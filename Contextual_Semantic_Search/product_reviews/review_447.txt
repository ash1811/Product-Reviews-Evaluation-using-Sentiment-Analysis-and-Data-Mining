I had been wanting another pair of the unbleached Converse Chuck Taylor's for years.  I am so glad that they fit the same as they did years ago.  My feet are a little wide.  So I order the unisex size and not the women's shoes, as I find the women's fit snugger.  These are made well and I'm completely satisfied.
