I have to start out by saying, I thought this was the brand of bra I have been wearing for the last 8 years, (it looks exactly like what I wear) I didn't realize mine is a different brand until after I placed my order.. I am Sooo Happy I did order this Bali!! The fit (for me) is perfect!! It stays in place, the back is &#34;U&#34; shaped so I don't have to keep adjusting it through out the day!! It has GREAT SUPPORT, (I'm 64 yrs. old, 5' 5&#34;, 137lbs). I purchased a few T-shirts at the beginning of summer, little did I know how clingy they would be (I almost sent them back) with this Bali Bra however, I look great in those T's!!! I LOVE &#34;This Bali&#34; Soooo Much Better than my brand!!! I LOVE the U shaped back, I love the support, I love the comfort, and I Love the way I Look with this Bali Bra!!! I can't wait to buy more!!! Thank You Amazon and Under Moments!!!
