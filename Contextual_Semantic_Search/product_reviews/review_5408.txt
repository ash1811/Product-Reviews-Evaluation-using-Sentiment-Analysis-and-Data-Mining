This style runs on the large side. I have size 12M feet but all of the western boots that I tried in that size were too big. I finally tried this Heritage boot in black in an 11M and the fit is perfect. They have a slim look to them so it does not look like I am wearing men's boots. I wanted these for yard work but I seem to be using them to go to work in. They are very comfortable! They fit snug at first but after that they conform to you feet. Very easy to walk in, do not put pressure on the ball of your foot. I would buy these again, and probably will, just don't tell my husband.
