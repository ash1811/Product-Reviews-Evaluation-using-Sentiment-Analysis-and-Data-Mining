No one on earth is as picky about shirts as my husband.  I'm serious.  The man is meticulous about grooming, hygiene, and keeping our home neat and orderly.  But he will wear a shirt he loves until it has holes as big as the neck.  So I bought this for him because he was catching a draft.  I'm not kidding!Nice quality, and we're very happy with the fit.  He wears size L, but I bought size XL in this shirt because he wears long sleeve t-shirts for lounging in the winter.  He won't wear fleece shirts, and he told me he was having a hard time finding long sleeve t-shirts in stores.  So I bought this, and ta-da!  He likes it, and I'm pleased with it.  Wash and dry, comes out nice.
