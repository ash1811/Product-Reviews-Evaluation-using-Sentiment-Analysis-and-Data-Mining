I ordered one full size larger with a medium width, size 11 m. They fit good but I ordered another pair only this time I ordered a 11wide width, just because I wear really thick socks. I am on my feet pretty much the whole time I'm at work. They have proven to be very comfortable. I have been looking for a replacement for the Propet' style I had been wearing, they decided to stop making them. I just hope that these Easy Spirits aren't going to be discontinued too.
