I like these blue jeans.  They look and feel like the classic real thing.  Mine were the stonewashed variety, I bought my normal size and even after a few washings they still fit perfect. Some reviewers say that you may want to size up a bit for the unwashed variety butI haven't tried those. I'm 70 years old and the ladies say that they like my &#34;Wrangler butt&#34;.  Whatever that means.
