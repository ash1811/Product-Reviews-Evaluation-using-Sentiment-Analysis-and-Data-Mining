Seems to be well mqde, comfortable, very casual looking, leather is darker than shown on the picture and contrasts with the lighter rawhide of the laces and bindings because of this they are much more casual looking than a traditional deck shoe ... were a tad large but easily overcame this just by tightening the laces/binding ... good looking, am pleased
