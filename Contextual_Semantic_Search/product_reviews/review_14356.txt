These worked very well for my Fionna Halloween costume.  The stay opaque as long as you do not stretch them up too much.  I'm overweight (5'-8&#34; and 190 lbs)  so I would not pull them up to my thighs without them rolling down but the worked well as over the knee socks.  I just clipped the bow off to make them work
