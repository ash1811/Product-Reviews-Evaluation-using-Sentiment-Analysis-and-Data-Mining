I really like this boonie hat. I had one I wore for years while backpacking. It keeps the sun from burning your ears,neck,and face. Another great thing about it is, if you are really hot you can put it in the creek and get it soak and wet. If will keep your head cool for a bit, and doing this won't ruin the hat at all. The last one I owned I bought it from an army surplus store. I had no complaints about it, I just lost it. This one seems to be a lot better quality. The price is great, and the quality is even better.
