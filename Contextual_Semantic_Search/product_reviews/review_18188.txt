I wear a size 12N womens and the 11M fit me. They stay on just fine now but I do think when they wear down they may be a bit big width way.I got the pink and it is more toward orchid or liliac than what the photo looks like, just so you know.For the price they are very much worth the money. It's hard to get 12's that are cute and comfy. Even if these don't last for years and years for the sale I got them it is worth it.The memory foam bottoms are an added bonus!
