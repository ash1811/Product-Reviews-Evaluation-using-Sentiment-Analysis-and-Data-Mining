Received the Timex watch faster than I expected, great delivery by Amazon as usual.  I have no complaints about the watch at all.  It's relatively inexpensive and almost anyone could afford this watch.  It's water resistant to 50m and has the great night light feature.  I think it's one of the better buys in the watch industry.
