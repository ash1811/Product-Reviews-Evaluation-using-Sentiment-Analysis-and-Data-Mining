Have bought four different pairs of Acorn slippers and they are all warm and comfy. Quality is good as are the materials. Sizing was perfect - these 9-10 fit my 9.5 feet perfectly. Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that the foam cushioning does not last as long as I would like. They are very cushy at the beginning, somewhat cushy after a few months, and pretty much not at all after a few winters of use. For the price, they're very good but I do wish they'd use a better quality, longer lasting foam sole.
