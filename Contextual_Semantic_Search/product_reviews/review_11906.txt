These would have been great if they fit the person I gave them to.  I read the reviews, Maybe they should have said traditional fit! All of his other mostly cotton shorts are way too loose. The shorts themselves are very nicely made, look like they will hold their color and shape through repeated washings. When we opt for a brand  that leads us to believe the sizing may be off, we try to hit a store to buy a pair first.  That wasn't possible this time, so I let the words loose fit and the fabric poly/cotton determine my choice.I don't want to pay return shipping and there was someone else I could give them to who is using them as a diet incentive ;-)
