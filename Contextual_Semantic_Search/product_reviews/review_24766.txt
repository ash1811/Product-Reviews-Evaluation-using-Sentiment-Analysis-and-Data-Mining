I say it's somewhat small because I wear size 9.5 sneakers and size 9 dress shoes, and for this I purchased a size 10 but they fit just right. People probably will be better served buying half a size larger.But these are plenty comfortable. The fabric toe joint doesn't cause discomfort (something experienced with plastic toe joints), and the overall build so far looks pretty good. I'm hoping these will last me a long time.I purchased them to replace two sandals I used to wear: one because the toe joint separated from the slipper, and the other because they way I walk puts a lot of weight on the big toe and my walking eroded away the big toe area after 2 years of use.
