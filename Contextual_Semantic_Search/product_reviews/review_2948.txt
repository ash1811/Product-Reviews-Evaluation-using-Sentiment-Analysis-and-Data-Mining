This is my 3rd Carhartt coat and I like this one the most.  My other one is the C003 model that looks similar but this one has somethings that sets it apart from the other: 1) the outer material is not a cotton denim that can fray but is 100% nylon (not shiny either) 2) the right sleeve has EXTREMES embroidered into it 3) the white/tan Carharrt tag on the left chest is back/gray/white.  It fits a bit larger, also, than my other Carharrt.  The other coat is a 46 Tall and this extreme is a XL Regular.  My advice is to go into a store that sells Carharrt coats and try it on first to make sure it's gonna fit right when you buy it here...that's what I did and found out that I can fit into a Regular when I've worn a Tall for years.  It's still roomier than my other Carharrt (which is still good after 5 years, buy fraying so it looks raggedy) but the other one is tight if I zip it all the way so I probably got used to a smaller sized jacket and this extreme fits just right now.
