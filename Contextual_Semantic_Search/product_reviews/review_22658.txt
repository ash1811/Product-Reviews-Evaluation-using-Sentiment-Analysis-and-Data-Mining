If buying this strictly for an inexpensive costume option, then this dress is worth it.  The sizing runs a bit small (as other reviewers mentioned) so order up a size (or two) if you want to be comfortable.  Also, please note the fringe is a bit fragile so you can expect to lose a string or two in the course of the evening.  Otherwise it was just right for a flapper costume on a budget.
