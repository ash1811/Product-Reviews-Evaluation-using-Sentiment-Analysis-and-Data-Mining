For some reason, I can't find this style locally. My son needed some shirts dressier than a T-shirt, but didn't want button-ups or d-bag designs printed on them. These look very nice and the price is great! The fabric is soft, washes well and is comfortable. It shrank a very small amount with the first time in the dryer, but all shirts with cotton will do that. It even packs well without wrinkling too much. The fabric isn't super-thick. I'd say just right.  Bargain! I'll be buying more.
