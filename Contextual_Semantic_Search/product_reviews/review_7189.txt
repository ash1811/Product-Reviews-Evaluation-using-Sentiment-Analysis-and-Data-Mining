This is a DEAL! these socks are very good quality, they are thick and comfortable. They stretch and they don't shrink too bad in the dryer. I would definitely purchase these again. I use these as gym socks and they are great for any kind of training, walking, running, or even daily use. My only complaint is after several washes they still lint pretty heavily on the bottom of your feet when you take the socks off. Outside of that I love them.
