First let me say that this review is neutral because of the fact that they didn't fit properly and were returned.  I purchased these for my mother and while she has had a lot of Naturalizer shoes in the past these were a bit small in both the width and length.  If you're ordering these you may want to try a size larger and make sure the shoes are being sold by Amazon or a dealer that allows for free returns if they don't fit.  Props to Amazon for their easy return and quick credit after we returned these.
