I got these on sale and they were priced cheaper than Payless.  These are far better quality than Payless.  My daughter has no issues with them and loves using them at dance class.  Her dance teacher and the other dance moms could not believe what I paid for them.  They were at least half the price of the ones of similar quality that were at the dance store.
