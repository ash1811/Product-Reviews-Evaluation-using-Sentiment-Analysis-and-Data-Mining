I've used on all sorts of metals - copper, nickel, all grades of silver, stainless, and weird amalgams of who-knows-what.  Even schlocky cheap costume jewelry turns out looking spiffy.  Wear some kind of gloves and roll up your sleeves while polishing - these cloths swipe off so much tarnish that it gets all over the place.
