60% COTTON and 40% POLYESTER T SHIRT. Now, it was described as 100% cotton, and that's what I wanted to buy. If the sellers are not able to honestly describe their product, then they will lose the ability to sell to people via the web. ITS IMPERITIVE that the sellers are honest, for us to buy sight unseen.  People don't realize, perhaps, that polyester cotton blended cloth is much cheaper than pure cotton. PURE COTTON breathes in hot weather, and absorbs sweat better.  The shirt looks OK, the color and size is nice, so is the cut.  BUT, it will wear out MUCH faster, than 100% cotton. It wont fade in that cool way that 100% cotton does, nor will it shrink a bit, which is why I buy 2X for 100% cotton. I'm VERY DISAPPOINTED, especially because my TIME was wasted, simply because the seller felt like being dishonest.
