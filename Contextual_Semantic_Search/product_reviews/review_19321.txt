I apparently missed the part of the description that said this was a push up bra...wish it was described as such in its title.  Perhaps without the &#34;bump pad&#34; the bra wouldn't feel like it was crushing my chest.So far it's been the best strapless bra I've ever had for the simple fact that it's stayed up on its own thanks to those sticky bits along the edges.
