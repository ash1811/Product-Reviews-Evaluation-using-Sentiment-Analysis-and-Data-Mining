This visor has a nice large brim and is pretty comfortable to wear.  The weave is not as tight as I would have hoped and it does allow some sun through in between the weaving.  I use it while walking in the late afternoon so it's okay for that but I would hesitate to depend on it to protect my face during the noon time sun.
