I get these ever year or so for my dad.  He has always had trouble with his back and feet.  Since he started wearing Rockports many years ago it made a huge difference in how his back and feet felt.  He has been in the Pro walker for several years.  I also like the fact the company makes shoes for for regular and extra wide.  If you order just double check the cart for sizing.  For example 2E is Wide.  He is extremely happy with this shoes!!!!!!!!!!!!!
