As with all Seiko Watches this one keeps great time but it's very hard to put on your wrist. The little prongy thing that goes through the holes in the band keeps going of the left or right and that makes it hard to clasp. In fact I just gave it away to Goodwill because I was tired fighting with it. If you buy it you may wish to think about replacing the band with something better. That being said it's a bargain for the price.
