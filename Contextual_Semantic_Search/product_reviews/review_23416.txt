This bag is monstrously huge. It should be categorized as luggage. It's like "take to the beach" huge - you could fit a rolled up beach towel, cover-up, sunscreen, books, hat, sunglasses, bottle of water, shoes, and still have room for the beach-ball.  Baggallini bags are great quality - but this one is too big and doesn't have much style.
