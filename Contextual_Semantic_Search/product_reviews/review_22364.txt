I ordered larger than normal.  Fit me the way I like, slightly big.  I do not like my toes or heels to hang over, and they don't.One drawback.  They did leave the bottoms of my heels black, and I think after being out in the hot sun with them, it left a light black trail on my carpet....Other than that, they are very comfortable, cloth straps, doesn't hurt my toes or top of my foot and do provide some support.Haven't made up my mind yet if I would order again.
