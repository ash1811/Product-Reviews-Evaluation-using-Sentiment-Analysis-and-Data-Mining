This is the first time that I have ever worn Merino Wool.  I will never go back to brands like Under Armour that use synthetic materials, at least when it comes to the cold.  These are warm and they also feel amazing.  I wasn't too hot when inside our clinic with the heat on or while outside around New York in the bitter cold.  Not itchy at all like most people think of when they think of wool.
