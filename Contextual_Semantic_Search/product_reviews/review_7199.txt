I have a pair of light colored suede Clark desert books that I wore out without having sprayed on any water/stain resistant coating. My friend proceeded to spill his drink on my shoes which created a huge spot on the shoes. I tried out this product and the difference from before is night and day. The shoe almost looks brand new. You can only really tell a difference in natural light. Great product, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to remedy situations such as mine. I did read about complaints that the suede bar creates a lot of dust, which was true. I would use this outside if possible. It did not bother me though. I would definitely buy this again if need be.
