Incredibly small! also the material was very coarse. I ordered a Levi's Mens 527 Bootcut Jean of the same sizehttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004G9OIPY/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_17Fit's perfect and the material is WAY nicer. Perhaps the color I ordered is just a crappy material, and perhaps this was a defect but the jeans I got are terrible and I'm returning them and will never buy Wranglers again.
