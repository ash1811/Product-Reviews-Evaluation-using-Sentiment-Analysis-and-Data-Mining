This fabric is not good. The jeans could standup on their own after three washings, so I finally went for hot water and now these pants are a hot mess. The wrinkles are etched like wiskering, and even ironing does not improve the appearance. Hot water was a bad idea, but it was liked these pants were shellacked. Now they are small and wrinkled.
