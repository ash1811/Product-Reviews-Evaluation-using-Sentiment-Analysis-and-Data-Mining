I bought these for my 3 1/2 year old son, because he wanted army boots for Christmas. They came in an extremely cute little box, and seemed to be exactly what he wanted. He wore them for a month, (from Christmas Day almost to the end of January) and they have split on the side just above the sole. This means they are no longer waterproof and the split is getting bigger by the day. Too bad because I probably would have kept coming back to get other pairs. They are so cute..
