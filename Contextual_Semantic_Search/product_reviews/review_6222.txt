These are not expensive pants. Accordingly, while the value is pretty good, don't expect the finest grade of cotton, or an extraordinary fit. Many of the negative reviews of these slacks are unfair because it seems they expected high-grade spun Egyptian cotton and custom tailoring, if that's what you want, go buy it (and expect to pay accordingly).That said, these are nice medium weight khakis that are perfect for movie night or a saturday  outing. The sizing is good. If you're like me, and appreciate a sharp crease, know that these are difficult to iron crisply. ( god save us from 'perma-press!' Keep that treatment, manufacturer, and let us iron our own!)All your pants shouldn't have to be office-wear quality and cut. These are a good second level pair of trousers, and I recommend them as such.
