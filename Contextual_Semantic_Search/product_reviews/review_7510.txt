I own several styles of Kangol's and wish there were more reviews on them. It's tough to know how they're going to fit ahead of time since you usually can't go to the mall and try all the styles on. I buy Kangol's in size Large. I'm normally a 7 3/8 in New Era 5950 baseball caps for size comparisons.Compared to the classic Ventair 504, this Wool 504 is sized wrong. I own several different styles of Kangol's, and this is the only Large where it feels like an Extra Large. When I lay my Ventair 504 next to/on top of the Wool Cap, the Wool one is definitely wider and longer in length.As I said before, the brim is huge on this hat/ it's very wide. The brim is also a little tougher to shape than on other Kangol's. I laughed when I read another reviewer say this looked like it was cut from a big fleece blanket, because I can kind of see that. It does fold very flat if you're taking it on a trip.The Kangol wool 504 hat does a nice of job keeping my head warm. I don't find the wool itchy at all.If you got it sized correctly, it might be a really good hat. It's smooth-looking and it's a Kangol. I'm just dumbfounded at how big this one fits.
