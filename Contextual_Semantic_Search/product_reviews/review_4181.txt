Sent it back because at 34G there is just no way the tiny straps, and double hooks would support me. Other brands like Fantasie, Freya, Prima Donna, when you order larger cups you get wider straps and triple hooks.but perhaps for someone very young this could work. Good price but SUPER sheer, not like what the models have on.
