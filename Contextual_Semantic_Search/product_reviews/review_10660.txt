These are a nice sturdy, comfortable pant.  They do fit a little big through the hips and legs, but the length is what you would expect from a petite.  The length was just right for me and I am 62 inches.  The one thing I would change is that only the back half is elastic.  The tie fronts usually end up breaking on me well before I would normally need to replace them so I prefer the all elastic waist.  Still, I am happy with these pants.
