I bought these because my son is into bowling and I am tired of renting.I did not try them at the house when I got them. I just brought them to the bowling alley, so I used them and didn't try to return them.So be warned I am a consistent size 8 , and these a tight, with thin socks ~ I wish I would have tried them on before having to use them.
