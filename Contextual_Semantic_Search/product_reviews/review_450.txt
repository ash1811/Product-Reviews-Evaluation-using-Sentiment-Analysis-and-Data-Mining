My... 10th pair of cons in 10 years.  If you have never owned a pair of Cons, they will last about a year of regular use.  They are not good in bad weather.  They do not have any arch support or cushioning on the sole.  They are not waterproof.  They have poor traction.  That being said, I love them just the way they are.
