This pant is just a basic. It is exactly as described and is very comfy. However, I did not listen to other reviews and should have. This pant runs way large!! I got the medium for my husband who wears a 32 waist pant and it is way too big and a little too long. I would recommend this to someone, just get a size smaller than is your regular size!
