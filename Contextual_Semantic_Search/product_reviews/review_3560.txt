I purchased these socks because I developed spider nevi and varicose veins. I'm on my feet long hours when I work so I decided to buy these socks for support and better circulation.  They make my legs feel like they are getting a massage. My legs don't feel fatigued at the end of my shift.  If I could I would wear them everyday!!!!
