I usually go to Old Navy and just stock up on cheap flip flops. But I wanted something that would last longer than a season or two.  These turned out to be just fine.  They are padded enough that I think I'll get my money's worth out of them.  I usually have trouble finding flip flops because I have a narrow foot, but these fit just fine, they're not sloppy and I don't feel like I'm going to kick them off my feet.  They have a little bit of a built up arch for extra support, the strap is pretty thin, but it works for what I want.
