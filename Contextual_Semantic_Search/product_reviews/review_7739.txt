the service was excellent; ordered them on a Monday and received them Wednesday!  The pants are what I wanted and expected and the Propper brand has always been reliable and great quality.  Ideally, I would have preferred shorter length but they weren't available, and I intend to use these for hiking anyways so the length isn't a big deal.  Not much more to say than what's already been said; these are very good BDU pants for the price, and for the ever popular multicam pattern....
