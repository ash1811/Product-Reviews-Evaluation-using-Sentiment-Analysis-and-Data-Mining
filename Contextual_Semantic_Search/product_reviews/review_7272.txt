My daughter's feet run on the wide side, but not hugely wide.  I bought the 9.5W and they fit great on her feet.  She loves putting them on and wants to wear them all the time.  I take this as a good sign for the shoes.  They must not be too tight and hurt.  Would recommend them as they fit as expected.
