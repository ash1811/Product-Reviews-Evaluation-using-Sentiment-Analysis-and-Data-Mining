I like this bra a lot. It is a nice light fabric bra that is comfortable but still lends support.  The cups flap all the way down when you unsnap them so they aren't hitting your baby in the face like the foam cups do. The snap for the cup is easy to maneuver with one hand. I can sleep in it comfortably.  There are a few things I dislike but none of them are bad enough to really skew my review. It doesn't clasp in the back but rather pulls over like a sports bra. I just don't like that. I'd rather have it be like a regular bra. Because of the sports bra like back (racerback) it also shows under some tops. There are seams down the cups which are kind of bulky and uncomfortable but I don't notice them much because I always wear nursing pads.  There is only a thin piece of elastic to hold the bra  strap when the cup is open which is nice because it doesn't get in the way like the wide band does on some nursing bras, but it seems like it is way too long. Also, the sizing of these bras is really confusing. But i still love the bras! Despite all the sorta negatives, it performs well enough merit 4 stars easily.
