they make these packs in two sizes and this is the smaller one of the two.  I got it at a much better price here than anywhere else I looked for it.  I got it for my 14 year old son, who said this was a must have item for school. He is very happy with it.  I looked it over and he has been using it and taking care of it like a teen (so some pretty hard use) and it has held up. If you must get one then I would get it here.
