Since my wedding bands temporarily aren't fitting due to pregnancy, I ordered two of these rings in two different sizes to cover my bases. The size 7 band was perfect and looked great as a substitute wedding band, but the the size 8 ring was obviously not the same quality. The first thing I noticed was that the bands though the same 3mm band, were not the same thickness, which wasn't a huge issue for me at the time. However, I was a little annoyed to find a seam where the size 8 band had obviously been sized and from there, I noticed that the band was flattened along the seam, giving it a squashed look to where it had been cut. I'd give the one band 5 stars and the second band 1 star, so I've decided to average them together to come up with the 3 star rating. Shipping was super fast and the presentation was cute as well, I'm just annoyed that one of the bands was obviously shipped out damaged.
