I'm a little disappointed in this watch, mainly quality issues.  First the Pros:- Nice big numbers to read when on a run- Band is unridged, so reasonably comfortable- Alarm and Interval Timer work nicelyCons- Flix technology broke, then...- Indiglo feature died- wrist band loop broke (annoying!)- the band is better than others I've worn, but still tends to 'imprint' itself on my wrist.
