Make legs look fabulous almost too perfect but love it. Nice and strong material and wont run easy. I ordered a Small and fits good but for anyone over 115 pounds may be too small. These cover everything but still look real and can wear with skirts but beware it does get a lot of people staring at your legs. I can see why cheer leaders and dancers wear these as they perfect the leg and give support. I'm fair and the light toast works well only because I use Lorac Tantalizer on arms, chest and neck otherwise would be darker than my fair skin but will be perfect for summer. I will order more in other colors. If you are looking for something more sheer go with Oroblu Repos 70 which I also have and love but more like a strong pantyhose.
