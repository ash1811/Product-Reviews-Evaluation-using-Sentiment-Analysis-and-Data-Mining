These are a good pair of jeans. Got the jagger style, always got compliments on them, I did like the pattern. But unfortunately just a few months after getting I lost weight and they are too loose now. I gave 4 stars just because they are a little thinner than the last 569's I bought. Now need to get more in a smaller size. Seller shipped fast.
