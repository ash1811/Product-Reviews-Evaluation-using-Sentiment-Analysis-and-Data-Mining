If you are blessed/cursed with large breasts you need this bra. I have never had another bra that actually holds you in place comfortably while you exercise without choking you. It is a bit pricey but definitely worth it. I would recommend this to any woman who never thought they would be able to do a jumping jack without hurting themselves or others! Terrific fit, great bra.
