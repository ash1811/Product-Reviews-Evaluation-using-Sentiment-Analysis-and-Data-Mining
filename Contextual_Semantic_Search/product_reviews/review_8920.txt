This is a heavy-duty bra that gives good support and a nice shape.  I said &#34;somewhat small&#34; for the fit, but I don't mean the cups - those I find true to size.  I do find that the &#34;frame&#34; of it is narrower than I like, meaning I guess the space between the cups - the Motherhood Maternity bras work better there for me.  As others have said, the cups are stiff.  Also, because the inner support (the part that remains when you fold the cup down) encircles the breast, I just find it a bit harder to get everything where I need it even for pumping (but it's doable).  Not my first choice for nursing but it's a good bra if you'll be pumping.  Finally, this is a pretty old school bra in terms of coverage, so you won't want to wear low necklines with it.
