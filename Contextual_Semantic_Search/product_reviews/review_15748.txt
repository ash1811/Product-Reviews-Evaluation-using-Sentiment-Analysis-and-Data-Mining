I was initially skeptical about spending over $10 for a single pair of socks, but the moment I put them on I became a believer. These are now the only workout socks I use and I am planning on buying a second pair.The material is thick and VERY comfy, but it is also quite breathable and my feet never feel hot or stuffy in them. After running or using the elliptical my old socks would be wrecked and reeking from the sweat. These socks, however, just get a little damp and within a few hours they are totally dry and still odor-free. I also used to have some slippage around my heel, but the socks' rolltop and extra cushioning have eliminated that issue.All in all, I can't recommend these highly enough. You definitely won't regret buying them :)
