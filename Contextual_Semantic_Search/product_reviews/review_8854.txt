I now have this in purple, black and ivory.  I was looking for something as comfortable as sweats but much more feminine.  This delivers!  This is so comfortable, but yet very nice looking.  For the most part this is great to wear around the house. The only drawback is that the ivory nightgown is extremely see-through.  I wasn't expecting it to be as shear as it is.  Even though, I would still highly recommend this gown! Very pleased!
