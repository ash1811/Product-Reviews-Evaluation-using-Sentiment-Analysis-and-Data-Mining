This has to be a knock off. I've worn K Swiss shoes for as long AS I can remember. This is my first attempt at buying them online. I'll never do it again. The soles are removable in these shoes, which real K Swiss does not do. They are so uncomfortable! Like walking on 2x4's. They are super heavy and bulky. They don't soften up, and now because they were worn to find all of this out, I doubt I can return them. Save your money and buy them at the store to make sure it's a real K Swiss shoe because this shoe is terrible!!!!!
