I am an athletic person, and at 5'2&#34; tall and weighing about 126 it is rather difficult for me to find a bra that both gives support and is comfortable. Especially for someone who is rather busty with a smaller frame. Well, I am EXTREMELY happy with these bras. I have owned this same style prior to this and looked everywhere trying to find them again ( you can find them but not often in the 36C.) I LOVE the fit and plan on buying a few more ASAP.. When something fits this good you don't wait to long or they are GONE..
