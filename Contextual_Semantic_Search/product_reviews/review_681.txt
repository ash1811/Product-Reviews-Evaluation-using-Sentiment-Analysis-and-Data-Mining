I was amazed at the quality of this night gown. The nylon was not the thin flimsy material that you usually see but a nice weight that should hold up well. It washed up beautifully and came out of the dryer wrinkle free . The fit was very accurate and the length was just right . I'm 5ft 3inch and it was perfect! I plan to order other colors and these usually sell for much more!
