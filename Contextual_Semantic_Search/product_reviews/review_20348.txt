These socks feel so wonderful on my feet that I forget I have them on.  I've washed them a couple of times and there hasn't been any shrinking or thread pulling.Wearing them to bed keeps my feet nice and toasty all night long and I read recently that warming your feet at night with socks will actually help you fall asleep faster.  Cold feet keep you awake.  Who knew?
