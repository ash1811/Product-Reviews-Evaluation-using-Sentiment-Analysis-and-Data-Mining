I ordered this, as I am a huge LOTR fan and figured for the price, it wouldn't be too bad, even if it was a little cheap looking. It was supposed to come in two days (I have Amazon Prime) and yet it never came it. The order was confirmed as shipped but I've already waited a week and a half. I got refunded my money back. Good thing it was only $6, or else I would've been really upset.
