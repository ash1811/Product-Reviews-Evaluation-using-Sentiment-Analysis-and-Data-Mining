Unfortunately, I missed the return date by 2 days so I am stuck with these socks.  I have 3 pair I ordered direct from Thorlo and the are far superior to these.  The bottom is good but the tops are already thread bare and will wear through probably with the next time I wear these.  I will never order these again through Amazon as these might possibly be seconds.
