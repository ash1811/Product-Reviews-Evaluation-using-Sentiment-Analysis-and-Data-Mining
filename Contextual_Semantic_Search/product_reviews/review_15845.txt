I bought my first pair of these socks 6 months ago. I loved them so much I now have 5 pairs. I use them only for wearing around the house, not for hiking. They provide great cushion. So far they are holding up great with no visible wear. I wear a women's size 6 shoe and the medium/Ladies size sock fits perfect.
