I've owned Reebok Club Sneakers before.  The only difference was my others had the New York Yankee logo on them.  I don't know why Reebok stopped making these!These fit well.  I use them for all occasions. If you're looking for a comfortable sneaker that can be used for all occasions!Great sneaker! Great price! Great Deal!
