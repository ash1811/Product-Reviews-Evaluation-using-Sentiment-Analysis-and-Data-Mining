This ring has nice earthy colors but it is quite bulky and the band is very thick. It is somewhat uncomfortable to wear.I previously rated this ring 3 stars. After wearing a few times, you get used to the thickness of the band. I have received many compiments on this ring and now that I am used to the thicker band, I like the ring quite a lot.
