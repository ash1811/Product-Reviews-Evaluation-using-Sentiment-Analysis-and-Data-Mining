I was using something similar in size to this, but it was hard to get cards out and it had a wrap-around zipper and no convenient place to put dollar bills. Well, this is perfect. An elastic holder for a pen, pens or lipstick. many organizer pockets including at least 2 with zippers. It's small, but that's exactly what I needed to put in my purse to use as a wallet or a small purse when I don't want to carry a larger purse.With both my wallet/purses I attached a round key ring to each cross body strap attachment loop. Then I have my keys on retractable clips and clip them onto the rings. I use more than one key ring.
