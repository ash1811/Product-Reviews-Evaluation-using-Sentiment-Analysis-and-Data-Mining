Love the pretty blue color. They are not a solid blue, but have scratches throughout the color. True to size. I am 135 and ordered the large. Paid 5. Great price because the store sells them for 12. I did not like the matching full coverage bra that went with these, but the undies are comfortable, do not ride, and are very sexy.
