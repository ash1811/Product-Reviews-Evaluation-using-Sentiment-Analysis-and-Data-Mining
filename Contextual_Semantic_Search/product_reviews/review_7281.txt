These are classic pink ballet shoes. My daughter wears a 10 in street shoes brands like Stride Rite and these fit great in a 10. She outgrew a 9.5 in her ballet shoes from another manufacturer reinforcing my assumption that these are true to size. In reading the reviews it appears that people buying smaller sizes (7,8) experienced the sizing issues but others with slightly older girls (4 and 5 year olds with bigger feet!) are finding them true to size. I bought an 11 just in case so I may return or keep in the hopes that she continues dancing. Great price and quick shipping.You do have to pull the strings to make them fit the foot properly.
