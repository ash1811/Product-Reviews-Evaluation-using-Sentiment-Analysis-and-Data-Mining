In my search for some comfortable panties that stay in place, I came across the positive reviews for these undies and decided to give them a try.  They fit true to size (according to the measurements given in the Product Information section), are super soft, and really don't ride up.  As other reviewers mentioned, they also look sleek and modern -- and look nothing like the granny panty look.I'm definitely going to be buying more and replacing all my old undies with these!
