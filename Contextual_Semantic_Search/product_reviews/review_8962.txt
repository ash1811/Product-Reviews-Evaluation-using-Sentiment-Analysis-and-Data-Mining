This bra is not only beautiful, but fits wonderfully!! and there is Enough lace to make it a &#34;Peek a Boo&#34;, which is what I want under low cut tops.  I can across this wonderful bra  quite by accident.  I had ordered The Milana  Cami bra with lace thru Amazon.  I was Very dissatisfied with this bra, as there is Hardly ANY lace, and to wear under low cut apparel makes it almost obscene.Not only was i unhappy with the Milana bra,as it is not like the picture..there is Hardly any lace, but then the company wanted me to pay postage to send back to them . Amazon of which I am Prime member resolved this issue .  In searching for something else. &#34;OLGA bra came up and I am so pleased with this bra!!  I will order more in 2 different colors.  I highly recommend this bra.  I used Olga's scale for bra measurement.  I have yet to wash said bra, when I do will use Delicate on warm.dorothy
