I didn't want to pay a lot for one of these so I guess I wasn't surprised by the quality.  It worked well enough for the first couple of weeks postpartum, though you can often see the belt under your clothing.  But then the velcro started to go, and now five weeks later it doesn't stay on at all.  My belly is going away anyway, but if you want one that lasts longer this isn't for you.
