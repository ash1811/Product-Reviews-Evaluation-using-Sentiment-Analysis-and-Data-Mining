For the money, this is the coolest watch I have seen.  If you want a watch that will impress your friends, look elsewhere, because most non-watch people won't appreciate it.  Most people don't realize that Seiko makes excellent quality watches.  I love mechanical watches, and this is the best bargain around.  My watch is almost perfectly accurate (unheard of for a mechanical watch).  I simply adjust the position I leave the watch at night, and it speeds it up or slows it down slightly as needed.  Very high quality for little money.By the way, you will probably never see another person with this watch, because Seiko dealers don't sell this in the United States.
