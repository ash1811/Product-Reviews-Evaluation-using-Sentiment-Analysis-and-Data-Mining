Actually this could be a little more perfect if they supplied a sweat barrier. I put some plastic in mine to stop the sweat, so it worked.. But, this is a great product. Some people talk about the extra length belt being an issue, and it is, sorta.. some people cut the extra off, after they know about how much they need, but the extra did not bother me, so I just left it one.. Worked as good as I have hoped. Actually better.. I had never worn one.. I expected it to be a hassle.. It was not. I did not even notice it until it was time to use the bathroom or get undressed at night, and even then, it was not a real problem.. so, I can recommend this as being a great product for you to buy and use... You will be getting your money's worth.
