Great bag.  Fits our Evenflo Symphony 65 quite easily.  I did not give it 5 stars because it's basic and gets the job done, but it doesn't have any knock-your-socks-off features.  The straps are moderately padded (not super plush) and as you can see in the picture, there's a carrying handle/strap on top.  I wish this were more padded.  There is a built-in luggage tag.Note that because of the thick material and padding, this does not fold very flat.  It will easily fit in an overhead bin, but it will take a fair bit of space.Also, remember that when you're carrying a car seat with this thing, it is big and bulky!  Wearing something this big impacted our mobility more than we expected.  (Not the bag's fault, of course.)
