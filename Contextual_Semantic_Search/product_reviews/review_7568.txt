My hat arrived on time today w/ my cologne w/ the delivery special Amazon advertises. Hat fits just like the tan one I bought 10 years ago and fits the same but I need to wear it to break in the elastic headband a little more, for the perfect fit. I'm a big Kangol fan and its fairly a better price than buying a Kangol from a retailer (online or in a store).
