This backpack works great and it does not hurt my back, the straps are comfortable, almost hug you in a good way. I am able to even fit my laptop with it's case in the smaller front compartment and it does not hurt my back with 3 binders included and sometimes even textbooks. It has plenty of storage space and I believe designed really well. Very happy with my purchase!
