They look great, they are super comfortable, and I am in them all day at work. They are at a good price and I've received a lot of compliments from people. Brown color is excellent too. I took another reviewer's advice and purchased the Kiwi Express Shine Sponge, and it keeps them looking like new every day (so thanks to that reviewer for the tip).
