My son loves Levi's and they are the only jean he will wear. He had to settle for relaxed fit with regular legs instead of boot cut as I could not find that style anywhere. But the 550's fit great and he is pleased with them. He also prefers the Stonewash, it is the only denim color he will wear. So this was a great purchase and he is pleased with his new pair of jeans!!
