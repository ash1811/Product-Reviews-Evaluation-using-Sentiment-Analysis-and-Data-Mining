This is the second Dickies jeans product i've purchased from Amazon.com and this pair of &#34;stone-washed&#34; has not the bright red logo on the rear pocket, but blue. the stichings are not bright orange but a dull white or grey too. The feel of the cloth is also not as stiff as cardboard so overall I like this pair better. A good value at 21 dollars with free shipping.
