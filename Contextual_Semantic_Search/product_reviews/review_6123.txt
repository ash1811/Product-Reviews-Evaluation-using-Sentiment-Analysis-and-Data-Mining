I have purchased 4 pair of pants from gap, ll bean and columbia.  The columbia pants are way too tight.  They say 32W, but I couldn't even button them.  The other 3 pants fit fine, I need a belt in fact.  I don't understand how they can say they are a 32W when matching them up to other pants I purchased and own they are easily 3-5 inches shorter in the waist.The difference for the next sizes up with the same length some how increases the price of the pants by $20!  forget it, returning and will not buy from columbia again.
