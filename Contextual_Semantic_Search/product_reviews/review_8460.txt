Like many other buyers; I got duped. The scarf I received was purple, wrong color emblem, and 100% acrylic instead of wool. The brand name of the scarf I received was Cinereplica, some french company. The scarf listed is &#34;Elope&#34; brand. I have seen the correct scarf at a book store, so I know it's out there.
