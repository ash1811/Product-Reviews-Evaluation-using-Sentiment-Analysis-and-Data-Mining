levi's 569 loose jeans aren't loose anymore.they WERE my favorite.now they cut them smaller and i can't buy them anymore.before the change, these fit me very well.i've always had to be careful about jeans being to small in the legs.on average, i take a 36 x 34 and my upper leg measures approx 23 inches.now i am babying the 2 decent pairs of old 569s that i have left.washing on hand wash, hanging to dry.guess i'll be looking in thrift stores to find the good old loose cut.or wearing sweats everywhere. nobody wants to see that.
