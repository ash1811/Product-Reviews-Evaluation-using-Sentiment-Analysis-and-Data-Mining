This stuff really works well. It does smell a little strong, but apparently doesn't contain anything toxic. I usually use it with pretty warm water in a mini ultrasonic to clean jewelry and other small delicate things. It does a great job. I agree with others that have said not to use the directed amount. I just barely use a capful and that seems like it's plenty good. This bottle will last quite a while. Made in USA.
