I have bought two of these tees now to try them out as a means for reducing luggage weight on multi week overseas trips.  I have tested the washing by hand and drying overnight and it works as advertised.  The tees have a good feel when being worn.  If you wash with other items beware that the fabric may "pick" due to buttons or zippers.  Overall I am a fan and have purchased two types of the boxer/undershorts to try and am very happy with those.  Actually, they are lightweight and great for warm temperatures or for wear during active periods.  A great product.
