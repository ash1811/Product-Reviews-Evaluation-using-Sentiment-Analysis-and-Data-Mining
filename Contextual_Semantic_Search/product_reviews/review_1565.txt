I like Carhartt in general, and in fact it's my favorite brand of jeans. But this shirt was a disappointment.It was so scratchy when I opened it that I couldn't stand to wear it. I thought it might be from leftover sizing in the fabric, but it didn't get any better after washing. I even tried the "soak in brine" technique, which softened it a bit, but it's still scratchier than my other t-shirts. Four washings so far, and it's still scratchy, though it is getting a little better with each washing.I have other pocket t-shirts of comparable thickness from American Giant and Key. Both are much softer and more pleasant to wear than this one, even right out of the package.On the pro side, the fabric is thick, and the size is good. I've gotten medium t-shirts from department stores that shrank to uselessness after a few washings, but this one kept its size pretty well. I also like the color (I got Sand). If only it were more comfortable to wear.*** Update 6 August 2013 ***Nine washings now, and the problem is no better than after the fourth or fifth washing. It still feels prickly the moment I put it on, unlike any of my other t-shirts, including cheap department store ones.I looked at the fabric and it has a fair amount of pilling on the inside of the shirt. So it's pretty clear that the scratchiness is not going to get better. I'm ready to put this one in the grunge clothes bin. I'm guessing it was just a bad batch of cloth.They probably make these shirts in various locations. For reference, mine was made in the Dominican Republic.
