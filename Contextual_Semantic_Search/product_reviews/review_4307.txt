I bought these for my hubby after raving about my own for months - I took a punt and based my hubby's size using the EUR sizing to match with current shoes and sandals he has and  ' shazam ' I had a win ... I've been wearing these in a Big Kid size 6 because it's a 39 but nice and wide for me and they cost less so I have them in about 6 different colors - WASSA (the hubby) loves them we wear them walking the dogs cause we usually end up in the water at the beach or in the creek and he thinks they're perfect - I get the one's with the closed in heel for myself,  I'm a little paranoid about cutting my feet on rocks and coral which can end up in an ugly infection ... really really comfy and you just can't kill 'em - throw them in the washer or a bucket with soap to freshen if they get a bit on the nose.
