Far and away, the best pair of paints I have ever owned.  They are rugged and durable, but also they fit right and feel good.  You can fit the biggest wallet into the back pocket and there is plenty of room in the front pockets for pens, a Swiss army knife, and just about anything you want to carry.  The best part about these pants is they won't tear or split on the side.  I have had so many pairs of pants that would rip at the crotch or split on the side from carrying too many items in the pockets. You could probably carry channel locks in your pockets all day long and they wouldn't split.  For a man who is hard on clothes, these are the pants for you.
