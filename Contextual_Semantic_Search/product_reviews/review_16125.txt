This bag definitely took a licking on the one trip I took it on.  It arrived at both destinations (to and from) with holes in it but it still held together (the zipper, in particular).  I used it to store my LO's carseat as well as his clothes and toys and everything.  Hey, if they're going to charge me for a bag, I'm going to USE the bag! :)
