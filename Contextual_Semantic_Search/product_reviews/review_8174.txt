I went to Sam's Club to buy a Seico watch ( I have had two of them) and liked the one I saw except it didn't have the luminous hands I liked. I was going to buy it anyway but when I tried it on my wrist, there was no way the clasp would work. I asked the saleslady if she had another one and she 'sighed' and went to a cabinet and found one. I tried to get the clasp on this one to work and it was the same as the first. She finally got it to hook, but not while on my wrist. By the way, I was already irritated with her long, decorated and embelished purple fingernails and her attitude. I finally  gave up and left. When reading the reviews I see that I am not the only one who had problems with the clasp. One 'expert'said the size of the clasp and the hook did not match up. So I am off to find another brand and goodbye to Seiko~
