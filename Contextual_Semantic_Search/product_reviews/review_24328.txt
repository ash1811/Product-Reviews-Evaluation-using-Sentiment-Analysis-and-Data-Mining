Nice supportive shoes that aren't totally flat (this is suprisingly hard to find).  I also sometimes have problems with slip ons that come up to the ankle with my high arches (cant get my foot in the shoe!) but this is not at all a problem.  Very cute with the design too.  I'm a 9.5 or 10 and take a 10 in these.
