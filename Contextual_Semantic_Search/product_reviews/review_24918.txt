I have noticed that this style of Vanity Fair is getting harder to find in stores, so I turned to Amazon.  I bought a few to stock up on -- I have been wearing them for about ten years now.  Very comfy and soft.  The material in the underarm area does not ride too high like in other full-figure bras.  The straps are stronger than the typical thin ones that can cut into your shoulders, but aren't too wide, like you're wearing a harness.  I tend to have a reaction to nylon thread and lace with bras, and itch terribly.  Not the case with this bra.  Comfy comfy for this size 40D.
