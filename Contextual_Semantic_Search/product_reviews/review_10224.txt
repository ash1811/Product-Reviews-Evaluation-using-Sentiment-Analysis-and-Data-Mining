I work out twice a week at a warm-water pool to help with a broken vertebrae in my back. I used to use a small tote bag to carry my towels, swim shoes, and shower materials. When I needed to add weights to the bag, nothing really fit anymore, and I started to look for something new.This bag is large enough to fit two large towels, swim shoes, soap, two 5-lb ankle weights, and some spare clothing for post-workout. I don't have to shove everything into the bag, and the drawstring makes it fairly easy to close.The drawstring was a bit stiff at first, but with repeated use, it's become easier to open and close. I love the bag, and it will hopefully stand the test of time to keep me at the pool every week.
