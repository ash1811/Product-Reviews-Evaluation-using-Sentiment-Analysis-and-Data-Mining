I purchased these for my 10-year old grandson to be used as school uniform pants however the nvay 20 is too large and the 18 is toooo small.  He wears a 16 if they are sewn true to scale.  I purchased the khaki for him and they are fine although they are 18s.  I really wanted Dickies because of their durabilility and I find them to be fade and stain resistant.  I was disappointed that they didn't have the knee pads but I purchased some from a local store for under two dollars a pack and it was well worth it.  (They do appear to be rugged enough that I didn't need the knee pads but it's just a precaution.)  I also like that the Dickies name is not on the outside because that would not comply with the school's dress code.  Also, I removed the hook and eye and replaced it with a button because my grandson and me like the button closure.  My daughter has a part-time job and she wears black Dickies and after almost two years of washing, the appearance is still nice.
