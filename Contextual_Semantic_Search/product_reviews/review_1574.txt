I love Carhartt T-shirts.  They are oversized, usually with a longer tail to prevent "Plumbers Crack" for a man with a heavy belt on.  They are very thick cotton, and will keep you warm in the cold, and reasonably protected from sparks.  Just a good quality, sturdy shirt that will last a long time.  I own many of them.
