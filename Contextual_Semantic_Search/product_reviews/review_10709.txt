Wacoal Halo is the best-fitting bra I've ever worn, even as I've lost or gained weight and moved up/down in band size. I purchased my first one over 10 years ago and although I've owned (and still do) many others, Halo is my go-to bra for everyday wear. They're very well made, holding up well through laundering, the fit never varies and the lace pattern even works under T-shirts. What more could I want? The strapless Halo fits just the same, which is another plus.
