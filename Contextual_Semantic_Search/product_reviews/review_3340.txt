I actually bought several of this style bra in 36 DD some time ago. They looked and fitted very well  and I was very pleased with them. However over time they don't seem to have the same firmness and I've started to notice the underwire bulging out somewhat and catching my underarms. They have lasted about a year but I have had to revert to older  more substantial  ones.
