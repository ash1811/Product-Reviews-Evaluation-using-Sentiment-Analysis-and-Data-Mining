I love this shoe, not the least of which because of the great range of sizes it comes in. I am an E or 2E width, and finding non-disgusting shoes isn't exactly easy. These look nice and despite their very low heels, they are pretty fashionable. I was also very happy to see that they are made in Brazil, because I'd prefer to buy shoes made outside of China.I bought the size 7.5EE, and they arrived in no time flat. They looked even nicer than the photo, although I can't understand the "two tone effect" comment in the top screen. These are black, shiny, nicely woven and are very nice for either work or play. I was delighted. The shoes are very lightweight, a bonus for travel or those days when you're on your feet for many hours. I was very happy when wearing these shoes...Until I wore them for a while. The shoes were very wide everywhere except for the vamp. This part is a bit too narrow, which doesn't happen in any of my other shoes. I think that the company made the decision to make the shoes look better from the outside, while sacrificing comfort for the wearer. In theory, the wearer will live with less comfort because the shoes look so good.And they were right I wore these for the day today and have pinched and sore feet. But they looked marvelous! I'd much rather have shoes where I do'nt have to choose between comfort and style.I'd like to win the lottery as well, and both are just about as likely to happen.
