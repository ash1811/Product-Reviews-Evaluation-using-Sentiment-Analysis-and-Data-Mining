I bought these for my 12 y/o daughter.  I was afraid they would be too long.  They are the perfect size.  They feel and look like they are sturdy and well made.  Take them out in the sun and they sparkle.  These are stocking stuffers for Chistmas.  I know I will get a big hug and a "Thank you Santa" on 12/25/09.
