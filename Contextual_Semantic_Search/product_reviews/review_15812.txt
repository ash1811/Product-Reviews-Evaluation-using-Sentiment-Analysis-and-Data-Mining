I bought these for running to prevent blisters.  I love them!  They provide a bit of extra cushion for my feet and it feels like your feet are in soft plush cotton.  I haven't had any rubbing or blisters since using these and they don't bunch down in my shoes like other socks but rather hold their fitting on my foot throughout their whole wear.  I would highly recommend.
