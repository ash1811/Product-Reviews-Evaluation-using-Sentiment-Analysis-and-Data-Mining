These were the original Keen sandals and the first pair of Keens I ever bought. I think the Keen line has surpassed this sandal now.1) Looks. Copied by a dozen other copy cats now, but they were the originals! They had this funky look to them, which was basically a shoe with a lot of holes cut into it and gave it a very tough look, a very macho sandal. Quite stylish and still very striking, only time will tell if this look has legs.2) Design. A very good design and a very good idea: leather sandals with a very thick and strong sole. Nice drawstrings instead of laces or velcro.3) Comfort and function. This is where I think the new Keens surpass this one most. I wore this casually for the longest time and I was the first to be surprised when I found them tiring for long hikes. A supportive hiking shoe was what they were advertised for, right? But I found the sole to be unforgiving (not enough support) and the leather sandal too heavy. I've never worn them for hikes since then. Other complaints I've heard around the web include: hard to dry out when wet, should not really be used as an aquasock; and things like sand, cone needles and other things get in them when walking in the woods and beaches.So to summarize, this was a great new design, but I think best to be worn casually. Looks >> function for this first Keen, but I still like them very much. My Newports are over 2 years old now (or more), but they are still in very good shape.
