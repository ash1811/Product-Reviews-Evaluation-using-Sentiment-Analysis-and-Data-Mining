This is fabulous - it's a bra with a thin layer of lace covering it and it looks great on with low cut blouses. It's not an everyday bra, but it's great for the occasions you need a little more coverage. I have a large chest & this holds everything in and up and looks great. Definitely worth the price, I plan to purchase more in other colors.
