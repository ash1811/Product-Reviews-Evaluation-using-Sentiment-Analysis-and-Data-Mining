It's hard to find good quality these days, so I was especially pleased with the materials and workmanship of the TAMARAC Slippers.The soft leather uppers, real shearling linings, and the "Romeo"-style elastic side vent help make these slippers amazingly comfortable -- and the cushioned rubber outsoles assure years of durability.As others have noted, the sizes seem to run small. I wear a size 10 Florshiem Shoe, and a size 11 1/2 New Balance Running Shoe -- so I gambled and ordered a size 11 TAMARAC -- which fits perfectly !!All-in-all, the TAMARAC Slippers are an excellent blend of style, quality, and value.Amazon's low price and fast delivery make it a done deal !!
