The SCER053 Dazzling Swarovski Cube Crystals Earrings are beautiful and sparkly. Can be worn with casual or elegant attire. They sparkle from every direction. They are a little bigger than what I expected, but I still love them. The back side of the crystal does have a covering on it. I believe the back coating is used to reflect the light back through the earring. The covering in the back is still transparent (check out the pictures on the main page). Every color of the rainbow shines through. It also depends on the color of clothing you are wearing, since that will also be reflected through the crystals.
