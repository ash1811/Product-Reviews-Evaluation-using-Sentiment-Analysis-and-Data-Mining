I ordered the same size I usually wear in Levi's. They're a bit strange in fit for my body (I'm 5'6&#34;, 140lbs, pretty athletic build) - they fit slightly loose after a wash at the waist, but they're a tiny deal tighter around the calves and thighs than expected. Maybe it's just because I've been doing so many squats over the past couple months! Either way, I'm very satisfied. My girlfriend (and to her ire, girls at work) think they make my butt look awesome lol. All in all, I will purchase these again when the time comes!
