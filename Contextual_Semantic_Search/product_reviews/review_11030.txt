We bought 5 Maidenform bras on Maidenform's website, and when my wife compared them to each other you could see the majority sent were an inch and a half shorter in length (the 36 was more like a 34), and the cup size was 1 size smaller too so it did not fit. They said over the phone they could do an exchange, then when we paid $10 to ship it to them they said 5 weeks later that they do not do exchanges. They have no consistency in their bra sizes, and they have terrible customer service support.The one bra out of the 5 that she did keep because it "mostly" fit she later threw away because it made her breasts look like they were going in opposite directions and the cup size was too small making it pop out in an unattractive way.
