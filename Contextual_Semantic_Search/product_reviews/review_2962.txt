I am very happy with this purchase. I received the item fast and was happy with the price.  I normally wear an XL or size 14 and wanted to make sure they fit good so I got the plus size and they do fit well.  They are pretty good quality material - had no issues when pulling up the hose with snagging and have worn them several times now with no issues.
