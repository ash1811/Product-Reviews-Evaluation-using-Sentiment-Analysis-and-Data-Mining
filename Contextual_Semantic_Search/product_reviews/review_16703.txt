Soft, lovely color exactly as pictured but sized a little small.  I purchased a S and it was still pretty tight.  I am 5'7&#34;, 115 lbs.  I wear a women's size 2 in slacks and am an A cup.  If you are any bigger than me - but still typically wear a S, it WILL NOT fit, especially if you are busty or have hips.  As in many lingerie pieces, the panties are tiny...but again, note I am a size 2.  I would probably return it for a larger size, but usually find a M is TOO big.  It's inexpensive enough to wear until I find something I like better.
