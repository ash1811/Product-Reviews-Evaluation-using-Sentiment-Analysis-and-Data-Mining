After I ordered this at Amazon yesterday (3.7 oz clear), I went to Walmart for other things.  It's $4 at Walmart, between the rows of shoes in the center aisle (since now all Walmart stores are supposed to have roughly the same layout).When I get this, I'll compare the date on it to the Walmart stock.  If this item is newer, then it's worth buying online, since the most helpful review here (labelled 'missing instructions'), says that the material can become stale-dated.I don't have any shoes to fix, yet.  So I won't be back here to revise this review, for awhile.  Hence 3 stars, for benefit of the doubt.
