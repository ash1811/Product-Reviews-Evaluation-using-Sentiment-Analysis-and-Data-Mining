I have been using these for some mountain biking and hill climb / bleacher climb training.Agree with the "4wd for your feet review" as much as I can.  and to that other...if I get 6 months from these with the type of abuse I am putting them thru...lol...I'll be really thrilled!I'm re-certifying for some county EMS / S+R type programs in 3 months - after a few years out of it and I'm way too 'soft'.  I try to get to the point of deep rasping breaths with my training - and then stay there for as long as I can (usually around an hour)I have worn these shoes/boots exclusively for their weight, protection, safety, and the fact I can move better in low boots.  So far mountain biking, hill sprinting and walking back down / bleacher sprinting and walking back down, doing all sorts of drills with at outdoor places like tires, monkeybars, pull ups, sit ups, pushups,etc...  I have treated them like 'heavy duty tennis shoes' and they have been GREAT.  I have a nice pair of 993's I'd train in...but honestly...some of the muck and gunk and junk I go thru...it's nicer to have more of a boot feel.  PLUS - these Keen's don't show discoloration wear.I spray them off in the car wash (with the mtn bike) if it's a muddy day...or sometimes at home with the hose...and they seem to dry like new in front of a fan overnight -  ready for more abuse the next day.I really like how the soles are so aggressive - not needed so much on the bleacher running...but on the hillsides - especially in wet conditions - it's really nice to feel these shoes give me confidence to really give it all I've got.  Also walking back down they don't slip in the mud or wet grass or rocks as much as I thought they might.  very 'grippy'I've been a lover of Newport 2's for years...these are way too much "shoe" for me in my usual off-work time...but in the context of this heavy-duty aggressive training I'm doing...they seem to be perfect for the job.
