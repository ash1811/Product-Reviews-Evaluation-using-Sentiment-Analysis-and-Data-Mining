I have been ordering these hats for a few 3 years. In the past I have been happy, but this time the product was made super cheap. Not that they were of the highest quality, but I got what I expected before, now it seems like they skimped on fabric. I can see the brim through the fabric on the bill, and the stitches are not even. If all that was not enough, the hat has a permenent crease where it was folded, and is generally flimsy. What a peace of junk, especially since the price has gone up!
