Clark's Desert Boots are real Must Have.There are few items like these. Pair of Levi's 501 jeans, Brooks Brothers button-down, bomber, some khakis... Clark's Originals Desert Boots definitely are in that row - style icons, that never dies.Unbelievably comfortable. Excellent material, very solid crepe sole. Looks stunning.What else do men need?
