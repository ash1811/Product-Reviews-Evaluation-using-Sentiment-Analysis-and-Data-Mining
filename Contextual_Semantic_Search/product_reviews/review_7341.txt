Shirt arrived today on time. The shirt is very thin, so is perfect for the gym, for hikes, etc... The color is o.k, but the prints seems to be a whole lot smaller than what the picture depicts. I ordered an XL, so maybe thats why. The shirt also seems to be a little long. I am 5'7 and the shirts lenght is about mid ass, however the shirt is o.k
