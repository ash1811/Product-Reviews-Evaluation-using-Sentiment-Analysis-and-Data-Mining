Although we were hesitant to buy a pair of shoes online, my husband is so happy we did! He's never had a pair of shoes that he loves-he usually just tolerates wearing shoes. But man oh man, these things are incredible! He never wants to take them off. They're very well made, waterproof, and comfortable. They fit perfectly (we ordered his normal size). Plus, the price on amazon is awesome.
