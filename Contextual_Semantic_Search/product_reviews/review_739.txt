Really cute looking bra, but a poor fit for me. I have used Bali underwire bras for years, but I've never had one that didn't fit me well. So I had to return this one to Amazon. And I have to say that I am so pleased with Amazon, the way they handle returns makes it so very easy for the customer. Thank you, Amazon!
