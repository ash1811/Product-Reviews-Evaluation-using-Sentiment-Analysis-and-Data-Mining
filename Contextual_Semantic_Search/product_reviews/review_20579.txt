I really am glad that I bought these for a week's vacation at a beach resort.  I wore these all over the resort, in the ocean, at the pool, on the beach, on walkways; it stayed on and fit comfortably the entire week.  No rubbing, no blisters.  I could even put a heel cup cushion inside the shoe and it still fit.  It is snug (I wear a size 8.5 - 9 but still bought the medium size 8 and it fit perfectly); I like a snug fit to avoid blistering.  it was great.  They also hold up well in the washing machine and dryer.  I recommend.
