If you need to have a bag that allows you to find your farecard, ID badge for work and keep a couple of credit cards, handy this is the one.  It has several pockets and I can put everything where I can find it easily and carry it with me at all times so I can find my items.  I highly recommend this bag.  For those of us who are somewhat disorganized, like myself, it is a great help.
