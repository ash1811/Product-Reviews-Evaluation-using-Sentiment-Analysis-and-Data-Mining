Ordered this as an accessory to the Buzz Lightyear costume my Son wanted to wear for Halloween. Was easy to inflate and put on. However, there is a pretty heavy chemical smell that comes off the item - not sure if it's from the materials it's made with or from the coloring on the jet pack. Rating would have been 5 stars if not for the smell.
