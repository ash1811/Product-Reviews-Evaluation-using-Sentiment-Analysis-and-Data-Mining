I bought these for a brief hospital stay and since I have never had a proper pair of slippers, I got these to match my pjs. They are VERY comfortable. I got the 9 and it is a little big but I usually wear an 8 1/2 so I expected that. The sole is thick and sturdy..it feels like you could safely wear the slippers outside as well. And the fabric is sooooo soft and luxurious. Very good buy!
