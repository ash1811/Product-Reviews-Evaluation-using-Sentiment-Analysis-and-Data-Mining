The fit is true to size and I've been looking all over for some quality, neutral tone, all-cotton panties.  They are so comfortable.  The solid Fawn is a great color for wearing under light colored summer shorts and slacks - no obvious panties showing through in childish patterns.  I highly recommend these - they wash well also - no noticeable shrinkage.
