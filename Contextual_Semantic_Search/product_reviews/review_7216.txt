I was happy to find that this was a very strong compression belt material and in a size that wasn't too large. I ordered the small despite my aversion to ordering anything in small; I normally have a 29-30 inch waist. Their sizing was true to form, I can't currently fit it around my 8 months pregnant tummy at all, so thats a good sign. The overall height seems appropriate, not too tall or too short. Its a little tough to put on by yourself; but that could be because I tried it on my husband and he is bigger than the recommended belt size.I am satisfied with this purchase and I think it will work out well to help reduce my waist size postpartum.I think this is a great accessory for mothers and everyone should get one for their postpartum months to help get back to their original shapes.
