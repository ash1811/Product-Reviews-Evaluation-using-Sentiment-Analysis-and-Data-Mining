Wear 11 1/2 sneaker, size 12 in these fit perfectly.  Have always used Sorels because they are what they state they are.  Biggest selling point has always been removable and replaceable liner so you don't have to get rid of a perfectly fine outer boot just because the lining gets worn down or starts to smell after long winters.
