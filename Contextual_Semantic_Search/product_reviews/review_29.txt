Since learning a language from software is not exactly the same as learning a language from going to live in the country itself, I suggest picking up the Rosetta Stone software 1 level at a time, like this French level 1. That way you know if you are able to learn from the software, before investing even more money into it. Since total immersion into another country to learn is not always an option, Rosetta Stone it the next best thing. While a class environment might work better for some, there's not always time for that either. Sometimes there's just enough time on the weekends, or in the evenings after work to get a few hours of studying in. Or maybe you just don't want to sit in a school like classroom, trying to learn from an instructor. That's where Rosetta Stone comes in.Rosetta Stone tries to be more than just a computer program. Instead it's interactive, and is a cross between software and an at-home classroom Spanish lesson. The software comes with a headset and microphone so that while you are learning, you also speak into the headset and respond to questions. The software helps one learn how to pronounce the words and practice what you've learned to help retain it. Unlike a classroom environment, you can work at this at your own pace, which I appreciate. When I took a Spanish class, some of the students flew ahead of me, while the rest of us were just trying to keep up. Rosetta Stone lets a person learn at the pace they learn at (fast or slow) so they don't end up missing anything along the way. I'm more comfortable learning from the program as well, than in front of a group of strangers .While going to France and living there for a while is probably the easiest and fastest way to learn French, Rosetta Stone is the next best thing, and a more realistic option for most people.
