This shirt is for our son. He has a long, wide trunk, hence the size 3X Large size. It fits him perfectly. The shipping was great.  It was protected by keeping it in a clear plastic bag and sent with the othe shirts I had ordered. Shipping was great.  It is a good thing I ordered long before Christmas.  Shipping seems to be the biggest issue not the item ordered.
