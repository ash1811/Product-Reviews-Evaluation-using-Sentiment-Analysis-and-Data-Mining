I ordered a couple pair of these tried them on and ended up ordering a pair of every color.I wear a size 34 in the waist and Medium fit me perfect. I ordered large at first and gave them to my brother because they were really loose.I'm satisfied. I'm thinking about buying more before they sell out or stop making them.
