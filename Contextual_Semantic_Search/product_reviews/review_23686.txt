These underware are very comfortable but they do not live up to there advertizement. After washing they do not hold the tight fitting shape. This is the 2nd. set (4 pack) of Hanes Boxer Briefs that I have received over the years and still will buy more in the future, but as stated they falsely advertize that they will retain there close fitting shape (only until the first washing)!
