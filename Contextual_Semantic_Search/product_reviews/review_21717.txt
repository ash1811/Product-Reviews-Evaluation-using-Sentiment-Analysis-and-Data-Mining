I'm part of a "Preparedness" group. We recently met and had a discussion about what should go in your "72 hr bag". A couple in the group are hard-core hiker/campers - the real deal. I was in awe. My idea of camping is a 5th wheel with pullouts..Anyway, one thing they mentioned was having several bandanas with you in your backpack. (they mentioned we should all have one in our cars as well). As they listed off all the things you can do with a bandana, I was again amazed: use your orange or white bandanas to flag for help; use for tourniquets, use to carry things; for a sling, etc.So, I went on Amazon to look at bandanas. Good grief. LOW ratings everywhere. People - it's a bandana for criminey's sake!It's a great size, a great color, pattern, etc. I haven't washed it yet; it does say 'made in China', it does say 100% cotton. It does what I want it to do!I also went to Walmart and got 2 bright orange ones for $1 apiece and put one in the car, and one in my 72 Hour Bag, along with this one. This one was $4, so four times the price of Walmart, BUT larger, a tad thicker, and delivered to my door free of charge and tax free.Works for me.
