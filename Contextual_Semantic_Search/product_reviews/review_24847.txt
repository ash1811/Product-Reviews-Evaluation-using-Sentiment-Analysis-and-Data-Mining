I bought the large first. I'm keeping it for when I take a massive trip to Nepal or somewhere,...but, the thing was just too big for a 7 day trip. So, I ordered the medium and it's going to work for a pair of shoes, two pants, underwear and 6 shirts. These things seem well made and the reusable bag they come in is very well made. The only draw back that I can see is the shoulder strap is not padded. That would be a nice feature to have especially since these babies can be overstuffed. Medium and large are not carry-on size of that matters.
