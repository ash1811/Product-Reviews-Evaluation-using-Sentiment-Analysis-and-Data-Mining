I own several Russell t-shirts that are about 10 years old.  They are heavy cotton and even 10 years later...still are holding up well.  I got this one today and the cotton is probably 50% of what it used to be.  You can almost see through it compared to the old Russell shirts.  I think that a Beefy T-shirt is thicker.  Disappointing for what they used to be.  If you don't mind a thinner cotton shirt, this one is good.
