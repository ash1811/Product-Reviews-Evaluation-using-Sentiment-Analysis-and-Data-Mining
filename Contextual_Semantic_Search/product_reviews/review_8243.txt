I was scared this watch might be too classy for me. I'm the guy who buys a cheap Casio or Timex and breaks it within a month. And then I finally decided that I'd had enough with $20 watches, and needed something more upscale for me to wear.I bought this watch wanting the look of a more expensive Rolex; but without the cost. I will say, this watch has a much higher quality than any watch I've ever owned in my life. From the band, to the heft, to the crystal to the mechanism, this watch just screams luxury.I have an 8.75" Wrist, and the band was still too big. I removed two links and it fit just fine then.The movement is nice. Has kept time decently well. Was about 1 second fast overnight (Not bad by my calculations).One thing that really impressed me was the glow on the hands. If you hit it with bright sunlight, and move it to the shade, you can see it glowing in the daylight without covering it.This watch is nice. I've held and borrowed Rolex's before. As far as I can tell; the only noticeable differences are the overall weight, and the lack of the crown inlay on the face, this one is hard to tell apart from the one that says Rolex at first glance. 5/5
