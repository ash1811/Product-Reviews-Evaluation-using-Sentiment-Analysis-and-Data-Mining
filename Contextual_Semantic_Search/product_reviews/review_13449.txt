There aren't a lot of options for quality front pocket wallets, I reluctantly gave this one a shot and it's amazing!  Slim, small yet full of storage solutions.  I've never been pleased with a wallet before, this wallet has changed my tune.  I've only had it for a few months now, but I carry it daily and it has no concerning wear, the corners and seams are like new.  The only wear I notice is on the top/bottom side (depends how you look at it) opposite the window will show marks from the credit card numbers, this is only a minor inconvenience and can be neutralized by rotating the orientation of ones credit cards.If you're on the fence about this and looking for a slim, light and storage loaded front pocket wallet give it a try.
