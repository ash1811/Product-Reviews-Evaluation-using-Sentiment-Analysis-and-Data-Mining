I LOVE THESE BOOTS !!!  I bought them to complete a Native American outfit for a special event.  But now I wear them with everything - long and short skirts, and jeans.  They are soft and comfortable.  They are sized correctly...I wear a 7, and bought the 7.  They are fine with thin trouser socks, but if you are going to wear them during colder months, I would suggest buying a 1/2 size larger to allow room for heavier socks.
