I measured my waist and ordered a pair of these, only to find that the pants were falling off of me. Not good. They're well-made, kind of a slick or more finished material than I expected, pretty dressy, actually. Nice color. I'd order at least two inches smaller than what you assume your waist size is. I need to find my safety pins in order to be able to wear these to a job interview on Monday...
