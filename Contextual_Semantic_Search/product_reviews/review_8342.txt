Originally, I ordered an Invicta watch and didn't even think to look at the size of the case.  When it came, my husband said it was just too big to be comfortable.  I know that younger guys like big watches, but my husband wanted a &#34;normal-sized&#34; watch.  I exchanged it (free exchange, thanks!) for this style, and he LOVES it.  He says it's the most comfortable watch he's ever worn.  It really is a great looking watch!
