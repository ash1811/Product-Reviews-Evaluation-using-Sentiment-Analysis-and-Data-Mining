Started wearing the Traveltime shoes about 5 years ago and love them.  I have also given them as gifts to 5 different relatives who also now love them!  I have bought 5 pairs of the "Natural" and one pair of the "Black with patent trim" and two pairs of the white ones!  I will say,  however......the two pairs I bought this year do not seem to have the same quality of padding and mesh as in years past.  No matter,  I still love them and plan on buying a pair of 'Navy" tomorrow on sale plus I have a coupon for additional savings!)
