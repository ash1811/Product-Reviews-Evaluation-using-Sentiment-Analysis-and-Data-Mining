This is a great swimsuit.  It is well built and is not thin material.  BUT go up 2-3 sizes from what you think you need.  Speedo builds their suits for true swimmers who do it everyday, and I am sure they need them to be tight.  But for the average swimmer like me, they fit a little tight.  I am a 33ish waist, the size 36 fits a little tight on me, not so tight where I can't wear them, but tight enough where I don't even use the drawstring.  I kind of like it like that.  Hope this helps!
