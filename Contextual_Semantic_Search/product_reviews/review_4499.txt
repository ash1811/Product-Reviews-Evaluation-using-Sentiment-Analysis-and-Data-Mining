I bought this shirt looking for a collared shirt with short sleeves thats big enough to fit me. I'm a 6'1" guy with 44" waist and this fit perfectly. It feels great and feels a little rigid giving me a smart feel. It is a little wide for me but doesn't matter much as I've got space to twist and turn. The sleeves are also the right length.
