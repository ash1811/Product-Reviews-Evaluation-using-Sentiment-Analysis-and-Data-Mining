This product actually exceeded my expectations because of some of the reviews that I read before purchasing it. Some people said that the cloth was too thin and wouldn't last. I found the material to be heavier then T-shirts that I normally buy which come from J C Penny's or Old Navy. Some people also complained that the shirts ran way too small. I normally wear 2XL shirts but because of the reviews I bought 3XL. They fit me like a tent. They are comfortable so I kept the but I then ordered some 2XL's and they fit perfectly. If these shirts hold up I have a new source for t-shirts. Can't beat the price or the color selection either.
