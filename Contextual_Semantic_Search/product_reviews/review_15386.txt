I got this for going out on the town at night in the fall and winter downtown.  Most going out clothing is not particularly warm.  This looks graceful, though not like something that will distract from the rest of your &#34;look&#34;.  It will be highly functional, and it's quite pretty.  Well made and expensive looking.
