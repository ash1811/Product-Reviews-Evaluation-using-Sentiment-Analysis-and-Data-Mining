I have been a Wrangler man my whole life.I can't wear Levi's ,they don't fit me in the crotch.Being a very well endowed hairy man,Wrangler fits me very well.I do not like baggy jeans. Wrangler fits my back side very well.The fabric is soft enough while being thick and tough since I usually do not wear underwear.As the advert says&#34;Long live cowboys,Long live Wrangler &#34;
