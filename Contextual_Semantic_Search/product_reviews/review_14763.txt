My husband hates when I wear shoes in the house, but I need padding when walking on our hard wood and tile floors or else my feet hurt. I've been through dozens of slippers and they all flatten out pretty quickly. I was shocked at how comfortable these Isotoner slippers were. They don't look or feel like they have much padding, but my feet haven't been hurting! I ordered black ones and they wear well over time (5 months so far). The best part is that they wash well and are low maintenance. I highly recommend these for comfy home living =)
