These are very good quality socks at a very low price. They also fit perfectly. They actually deserve 4 1/2 stars. My only complaint is that they don't breathe as much as I need them to. They're better than average, but since they'll still make my feet sweat after a while, they're not gonna be my go to socks. I guess I'm back to cotton socks that last 2 months or so. But if you're not as picky as I am and need good quality, durable and yet inexpensive socks, go for those.
