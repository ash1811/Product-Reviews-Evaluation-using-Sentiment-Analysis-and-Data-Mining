I love this bathrobe.  It is simple, warm, soft, thick and absorbent.  It fits me perfectly.  I am 5'4&#34;, 135lbs and I have the xs/s size.This bathrobe is replacing one that is lined with fleece.  Fleece is not really very absorbent so if you put it on while wet (I always do) the water just sits on my skin and feels weird.  This robe sucked all the water off me immediately and left me feeling warm and cozy.
