I love these slacks.  I put a note on Fb asking for recommendations for slacks that were office appropriate but also comfortable, and these were recommended.  They fit great, are soft, they iron up well so are fine for work.  I love them so much I ordered them in navy, and plan to get two more colors over the summer.
