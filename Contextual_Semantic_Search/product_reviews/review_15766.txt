I discovered years ago that these mini crew socks were built with the same cushioning as the running crew sock. For warm weather, playing golf in these socks is much better than wearing the little socks with the small pom-pom, which always slid into my sneakers during tennis or golf. So glad to be able to continue to purchase these socks.
