I just got these earrings for Xmas and they are so pretty! The other reviewers are right that they are a bit heavy in their deep settings, but perhaps the earring backs with the discs would help those people who have trouble with them drooping. The earrings work okay for me. The stones are clear and beautiful and the settings are very pretty and scroll-like. I love that they're all different shapes. A good value!
