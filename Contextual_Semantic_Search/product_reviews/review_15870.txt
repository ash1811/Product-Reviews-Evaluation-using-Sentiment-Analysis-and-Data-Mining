I ordered these socks...one pair...to wear with my hiking boots...During my hike they kept my feet comfortable and dry...After hiking I didn't want to take them off...They are truly the best sock I have ever worn...The quality is wonderful...After repeated washings they still look the same and feel the same...I have ordered additional pairs since trying them for hiking...I wear them all the time around the house...happily....I highly recommend....
