I have a bubble butt some slight love handles and tend to have a really hard time finding undies that really fit well....they usually either roll down at the waist, roll up across the butt, or the elastic/edges of the panties leave awful panty lines. Those problems can usually can be hidden with a nice pair of jeans, but get ten times worse with slacks or a fitted dress (and really, when you're dressing up for work or a special event, that's the LAST possible time you want your undies to show!). Anyways, these panties are great! They don't roll down at the top, they have a rise that is high enough to cover your butt (but not granny-panty high, just no crack showing lol), they don't leave panty lines (for me they skim just below the cheeks so you can't see them at all...if you have a really flat butt you might be able to see them a tiny bit, not really sure on that one....). They aren't super sexy or anything, but the lace detailing is cute and the fit is flattering. The fabric is good as well....some of the "no-show" panties I have tried are too silky of a material that actually make your pants tend to slide down easier...these don't do that. Quality wise they could be a little better, or at least cost a little less, but the fit makes it worth it even if you do end up having to replace a little more often than you would like. I definitely recommend these!
