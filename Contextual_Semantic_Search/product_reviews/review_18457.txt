This bag is of superior construction. The material is about 600 denier (ie thick) and the zippers are big & well designed. The material is shiny & looks very smart.There are two negatives- the carry handles are a bit too long, meaning the bag is close to the ground then you walk- the webbing on the end! I didn't realise there was external black webbing (to hold a football or maybe shoes) at one end, I might cut it off.
