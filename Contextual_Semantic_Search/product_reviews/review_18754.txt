I purchased this bra, and a Glamorise MagicLift Active Support Bra. The latter is softer and more comfortable, but this one is prettier. (It is comfortable, just not as.) It is lacey, which makes it a little 'stiffer'.  The sides of this bra are quite wide, so it really goes up into your armpits. If this would bother you I would look at another style.  I have worn only Glamorise for many years and have never found anything better as far as quality, durability, comfort and looks.
