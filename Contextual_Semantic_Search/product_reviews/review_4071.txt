I just got my order today and tried it on right away. TIP for those who think it's too long - I wear mine upside down and it works even better for me (the cinching part sits a tad lower which works for my waist). The longer part folds neatly just under my bra. I check my back in the mirror and it is not buldging, you can not tell under clothing. (have tried with ivory and black turtlenecks, as well as a white T-shirt blouse).Before I write about it let me start with some basic info which I find very helpful when I read reviews: I'm 5'5" and weigh about 128 lbs right now (I usually weigh around 122). I wear a size 5/6 pants, but am on higher end of that due to an eating frenzy I went on this last holiday season. ;-)  I have that dreadful "muffin top" when I wear tight pants which is the reason I bought the waist cincher.  I got the size 26/small and when I first put it around me I thought there's no way it will "button up". But, no problem. It did, and it fits great! It pulls in/flattens out that muffin and gives me a bit more of an hour glass figure. It also seems to help me have better posture.  I have yet to wear it under regular clothes, or at work, so if my opinion changes I will update this.  Otherwise, I will be buying this in beige and black very soon!!!Update (a few weeks later): I have worn this many times now....and LOVE IT! On a side note: it either stretches out a VERY tiny bit, or since I have been working out (just a little) it is a slightly less tight on me now, but still works the same magic.  I have ordered the 24/XS to see if that will fit and also to see if there is a stretching-out factor.
