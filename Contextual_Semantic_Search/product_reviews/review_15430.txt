They say if something is priced too good, buyer beware. So true of this purchase!  The 'crystals' I received had almost no sparkle to them with the exception of a few colors.  The supplier is being misleading calling them 'Swarovsky Crystals', to say the least!  I didn't return them only because it wasn't worth the cost.
