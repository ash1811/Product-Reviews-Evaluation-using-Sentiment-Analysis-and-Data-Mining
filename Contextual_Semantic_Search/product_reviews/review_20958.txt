This bra fits perfect--cup size and band--but the straps continually slide off my shoulders. Very frustrating because, outside of that, I love everything else about this bra. I even tried sewing the strap slide in place so it would stay at the right adjustment and not slide up giving too much slack. That did not work--even at the right adjustment, they still slide off my shoulders.
