I am a 40DDD and finding a sports bra that is durable, easy to get on, doesn't create a mono-boob, comes in my size and is comfortable while controlling motion is a tall order.  I always put my bras in a garment bag in the washer and never put in the dryer so that I do not damage the materials.  I can jump on the treadmill at the gym or bike around town without feeling like the girls are going to go AWOL while wearing this bra.
