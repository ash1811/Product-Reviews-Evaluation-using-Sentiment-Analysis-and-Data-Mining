I just received my order and the shots are all stamped &#34;irregular&#34; in black ink!  I was a little annoyed because the website says nothing about them being anything less than standard quality new shirts.  I opened the bag and some of the shirts actually had stains!  Disgusting!  I'm really surprised with Amazon.
