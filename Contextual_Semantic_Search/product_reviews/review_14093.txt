Well I'm just not a guy that goes for those designer jeans or shirts or any of that stuff and Lee Jeans have been my choice for many years now.They fit right, they wear tough and I know what I&#8217;m getting plus I look like a regular American guy without any frills or pomp or crazy advertising to make a point.  Lee Jeans have been a reliable and constantly made product for as many years as I care to admit to (hahaha) and the price was fantastic.Like anything else you simply need to shop around a bit and with the sale price they had how can you go wrong?I recently saw the exact same item in Sears for $6 more per pair, no thanks I&#8217;ll stay with Amazon and Lee Jeans &#8211; good deal &#8211; good jeans &#8211; no messing around.  (Even if I have put on a few extra pounds, they still fit right.)
