I bought this after buying and loving the black version with garters. The fit is fantastic. I bought the large for my 33 inch waist and the fit is snug--just want I wanted--but not uncomfortable. I've worn this all day long with minimal discomfort, and it makes dresses look great. It is easy to care for, and the price is very reasonable.I do wish there was a beige version with garters and that there were more colors to choose from overall.
