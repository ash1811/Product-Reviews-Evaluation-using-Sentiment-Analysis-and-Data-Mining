I have always been a fan of calvin klein underwear -- but the body line in cotton tends to lose its shape and elasticity after wear. Not so with the modal fabric. It's soft and keeps its shape. I wish it had a bit more engineering in the pouch area for more support and enhancement like the 2xist lines. That's why I give it four out of five stars.
