Hard to pick the color online! I ordered Barely There hoping it would blend with my skin tone. It was way too brown. I have a light complexion, I wear the lightest shades for foundation. Not really sure what color to try next. I want something true sheer without color. They also got a run the first time I put them on. Perhaps I was not careful enough.
