Like most Carhartt products, these shirts are hands down the best work shirts out there. Heavy weight fabric, top quality stitching and a good fit makes these shirts tops. I do wish they were made in the USA instead of Haiti but that seems to be the norm these days. Until I can find a similar quality product made in the USA, I'll stick with Carhartt.  A few dollars less on Amazon.com than the local retailers.
