I got these for use on two pairs of fancy, slick soled 3+ inch high heels. it doesn't matter how gorgeous the shoe is if you are slipping all over the floor. For the simple purpose of adding some traction to the bottom of the shoe, these sole pads do their job. The key here is to make sure the bottom on your shoe is VERY CLEAN and has a tiny bit of scuffing started before you stick these on. The third thing is to stand and walk in your shoe and know where your foot puts the most pressure - then apply these to that spot.The two star deduction is simple... this package is listed & advertised as having two sets of these anti-skid patches, one in black and one clear. In fact, only the black pair is in the package! Only one pair for this price is a rip off. I am not returning them because I need them tomorrow for jury duty. (Jury duty is tedious, but that is no excuse for ugly shoes. LOL)
