I bought these for my mechanic son as a birthday present.  He says they fit his feet great, but the ankle/top area is a little stiff.  I am hoping that as they wear-in a little bit they will get more comfortable for him.  Perhaps they are like any other new shoe - stiff at first. They appear to be well-made.
