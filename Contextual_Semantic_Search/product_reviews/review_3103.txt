I'm on the short side (5 ft to be exact) and these fit perfectly. I have dancer thighs-- meaning they're kinda big-- and the stockings are able to stretch and hold nicely on my legs even without a garter =) My boyfriend was definitely surprised and pleased when he found me wearing these under my dress.
