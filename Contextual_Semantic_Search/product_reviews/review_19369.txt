I waited until the fad had practically passed before getting a pair of Uggs ... I should have gotten them years ago.  Worn without socks, it's like a little mini foot massage.  They are not cute at ALL.  However, I will wear them outside of work pretty much during all the cold months.  Love love love them.  One caveat: if you have a wool sensitivity, these might bother you.
