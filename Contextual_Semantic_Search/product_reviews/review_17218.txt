I'm pleased with my dark blue Duofold men's long-sleeve thermal shirt. The sleeves do run a bit short as other reviews have noted. I have somewhat long arms, but they're not that long. One advantage (I don't know if it's intentional) is that the sleeves form a pretty tight seal with my arms, which helps trap heat. I ordered it in a large and use it as a base layer. I'm 6'0" tall, weigh about 190-210 lbs and have a fairly athletic build, but it doesn't fit me like the guy in the product photo. The fit's somewhat roomier, like a well-fitting t-shirt. I haven't washed it yet, however, so it might shrink. Bottom line, these get the job done when the weather gets cold. Highly recommended.
