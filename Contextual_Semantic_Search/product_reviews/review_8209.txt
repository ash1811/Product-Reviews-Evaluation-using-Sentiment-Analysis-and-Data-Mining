This is my first automatic watch and I love it thus far. I have been the tracking the time it has been on far with the reviews, with about +/- 5 seconds from my atomic clock. I synced them both up when I first got the watch, and I would check in every couple of days.The styling of the watch is superior to what I expected, and on par with a $300 watch, without the price.The only complaint I have about this watch, is the customer service of Invicta. Their website for warranty registrations suck and hasn't been able to register my watch since I got it. And when I tried calling Invicta, the first couple times after waiting for over 10 minutes, I was transferred to a voice-mail box. Finally, after I got a live person on the line they rudely told me to send in the warranty and they would register me for the free extended Warranty because I bought from Amazon. The only thing I can hope is they actually correctly register it, and if they will inform me that they have done so. The other thing that sucks with this company, is that even though these watches are covered under "warranty" they charge you for it, they claim that they need $20 for return postage (heck,I can get a USPS Priority flat rate box from $6 to $12 that will fix the watch) and most watch companies I have dealt with will let you go to an authorized watch store for repairs to avoid shipping it in.
