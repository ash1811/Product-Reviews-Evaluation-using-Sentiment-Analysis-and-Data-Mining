The watch is gorgeous. The center of the links and sides of the band along with the sides of the watch are highly polished. The upper outer surfaces of the links and the top surface of the watch face are brushed finished. The contrast is splendid. The watch is slightly smaller than my Rolex Submariner with Date but still has the weight and symmetry of the Rolex. The only negative is the "INVICTA" deeply engraved on the left side of the watch when looking at the watch face. But wait, maybe this is to prevent someone who thinks you are wearing a $25,000 Rolex 18 karat yellow gold Submariner from wanting to steal this watch. The second hand movement matches the minute marks or ticks. The minute hand matches the minute tick when the second hand reaches 12 o'clock after the first try. I spent a few dollars more to get the Swiss Quartz versus the Japanese Quartz. I don't know if this was worth it but since I like Swiss watches in general, I spent the extra money. With the link removal tool sold by Amazon, the band is easy to adjust and I have to say that it was easier than some of the bands I have encountered. When removing links on the band and replacing them, you see the quality of the parts working together. I am impressed. After 2 days, it still is within a second of WWV.
