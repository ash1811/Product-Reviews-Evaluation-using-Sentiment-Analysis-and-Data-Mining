So, these pants came in.  I ordered these (Bark) and they send me the right size, but in the Loden color.  I give the pants a high 5 because they're exactly what I wanted.  I give the screw-up a bit of a discount on that rating.Past that (and Amazon was awesome about helping), the pants are solid.  Sizing is good.  Roomy.  Crouching and moving around is comfortable.  Big fan.  Good stuff.
