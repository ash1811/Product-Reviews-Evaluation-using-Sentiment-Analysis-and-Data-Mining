I bought this as a gift for my husband on his birthday ,he liked it very much ! SInce its automatic not sure about the time adjustments needed to done often as other reviewers said ,overall good .Update After 3 months of use :The time has to be reset daily :-( Not so great for people who work sitting in desk all day without much movement ,don't know whether I can return it now ,my husband is annoyed that he has to set the time everyday morning :-(
