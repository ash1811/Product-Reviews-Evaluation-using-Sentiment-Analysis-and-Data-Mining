The watch I received did not have the word "Titanium" on the dial as shown, which led me to think that it was a fake. Returned and waiting for a refund. I'll be buying this watch again but from a different merchant. Do not purchase this particular Skagen model from Jomashop.Updates*: So I returned the watch and ordered another one, this time, from Watchstar. And guess what? It doesn't have the word "Titanium" on its dial either. I suspect that Amazon just sent me back what I had returned. I guess I'll just take the 30% off they offered for this faulty product.
