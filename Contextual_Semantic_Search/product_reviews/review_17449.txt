I do not know what happened to the quality and sizing of Levi's 569's. My husband is extremely picky about his jeans and only wears 569's. The last two times we tried to buy a new set, we were so disappointed with the quality and fit of his beloved number. We picked several different washes, thinking, of course you don't need to try them on, they will fit! This was not the case. Each wash fitted differently and his usual waist size of 32 was huge on him in these "new" jeans. What is wrong with Levi's? You can't change the fit of your jeans when people expect a certain standard for "their" number that they expect to fit perfectly but then, they DON'T!
