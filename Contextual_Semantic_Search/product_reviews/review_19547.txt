~Why do I dread this?Because this is such an incredible jacket that I am concerned that they will sell out and be hard to get if anyone finds out how great this hooded pullover is.The fit is PERFECT.Other reviewers complained [ sorry folks! ] about the fit and sizing information. I order my usual jacket size and when I tried it on, I was surprised that it was a perfect and relaxed fit. However, I can understand why women may be frustrated and, as some stated, this is a men's sizing situation. Not sure what to suggest to the ladies, but it's worth the risk.The quality of the material was superb!! Wow. It has a ruggedly satin texture on the outside and the inside is lined with a clear flexible plastic-vinyl-type material that keeps the rain off of you. It has air holes under the arm pits for ventilation.Quantitatively, this jacket weighs exactly 10.1 ounces making it a very light-weight [ qualitative value ] jacket to wear hiking long-distances [ for me 500 miles ].When I first tested it, it was pretty cold outside and it kept me snuggly warm. Nice as a wind-breaker as well.In other words, I found this jacket so nice that I ordered another one before anyone finds out how awesome it is.Way to go Amazing-zon!!!
