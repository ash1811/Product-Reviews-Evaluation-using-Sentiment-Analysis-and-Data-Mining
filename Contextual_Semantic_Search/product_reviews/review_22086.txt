This was my third pair of this style and believe me they are comfortable beyond belief.  I have a wide foot and have had surgery so it is always hard for me to find a comfortable shoe.  This shoe is not only the perfect fit but also very stylish.  I can wear them with or without socks.  Love the slip-on styles.  Plan to buy more for the summer.
