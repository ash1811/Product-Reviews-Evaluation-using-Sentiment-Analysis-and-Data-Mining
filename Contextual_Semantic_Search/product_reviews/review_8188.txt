I bought this watch in early 2004 and it is just as solid and beautiful as the day I bought it over ten years ago. Not like ten years is some enormous amount of time, but any big watch guy knows that's quite a while to hang on to a timepiece. At least for me. I tend to flip watches with regularity and I'm really glad I have hung on to this one. I ordered it via Amazon when I was at Fort Huachuca, AZ for Army training and I wore it in Iraq for a 12-month tour. After that I wore it less often, but not because of any specific issue, I just moved on to the newest and coolest watch. Anyway, I recently rediscovered this Seiko masterpiece in my case and I am really glad I have it still. Unlike the current issue model, mine has a Seiko Singapore movement, rather than a Malaysian movement. But in both cases, my understanding is that the watch is assembled in Japan using the same movement. So the precise origin of the movement's construction may not be a big deal. Anyway, mine keeps great time, given its cost. Obviously, it can't keep pace with a Casio Solar Atomic model, which is another favorite of mine, but it still is pretty accurate. I've worn mine all day for many days now and its accuracy is about +5 to 7 seconds per 24 hours. I think that's pretty good. And whatever concern you may have over the inherent inaccuracy of Seiko automatics versus general quartz movements, I will say that the absolute aesthetic beauty of this watch greatly outweighs them. It is a stunner. From the robust case width and bold color scheme to the jubilee band and fit and finish, this model is a clear win. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a classic retro diver look.
