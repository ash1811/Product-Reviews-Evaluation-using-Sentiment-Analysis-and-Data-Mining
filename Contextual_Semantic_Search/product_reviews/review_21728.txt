I really was pleased with the two bandanas I ordered except that the camo print is only on one side.  As I had planned on using the bandanas for cleaning my BB and pellet guns I realized that the unprinted side would do very well as a place to place parts when field stripping a pistol or rifle (except for the large parts such as the barrel).  So, all in all I am quite pleased with the bandanas.
