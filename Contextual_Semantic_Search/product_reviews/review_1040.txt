I now have over 40 pair of these fantastic womens panties.  I have found after wearing and washing these for several years, that they always fit the same, and are very comfortable.  The lower gusset seam helps keep a males equipment in place. They will also stretch in the front to accomodate mens excitement. The rear has a soft seam that keeps them were they belong. The more they are washed, the softer the feel. Move over ladies, these are meant for men also.
