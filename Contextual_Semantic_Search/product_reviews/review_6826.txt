Gold Toe makes a wonderful Men's Metropolitan over the calf dress sock. The stretch nylon is actually rather comfortable; and it feels even smoother after a wash with fabric softener! These socks are both durable and very appropriate for business environments. They can be used with "sporty casual" attire, too.Amazon notes that these socks are "only made from the finest yarns." They mean it! Gold Toe socks keep your feet comfortable; and they are very well made and last forever. I especially like the way that they are reinforced at the heel and toe for lots and lots of wearThe socks also fit any shoe size between 7 and 12; therefore it is almost one size fits all. A big plus! I also like that the toe area is literally made from gold colored fibers. Great!I would not dry these socks at high temperatures. This could result in the sock becoming too loose on your foot. Eventually they will "bunch up" or just slowly begin to slide down your legs when you wear them and that's very uncomfortable and possibly even embarrassing. Dry these fine socks at a lower temperature.Overall, you can't go wrong buying Gold Toe socks. They are manufactured so well that you definitely get your money's worth. A great deal!
