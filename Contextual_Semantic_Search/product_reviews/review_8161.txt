I purchased this osfm robe to replace one I purchased from Victoria Secrets.  The quality far exceeds that of Victoria Secrets. I am 5" 7 and the robe length is perfect. Long enough to keep me warm and not have an issue of tripping up over the robe as I go up steps.  I had my first name embroidered on my robe for free by Turkish Towels.  Turkish Towels was a pleasure to deal with. They responded to my order almost instantly and within an hour or two they notified me my robe was on it's way.When I need another robe I will definitely go back to Turkish Towels.
