I have numerous problems with foot pain, so I have a hard time finding shoes that meet my needs and are not ugly as homemade soup.  These Onitsuka Tigers are absolutely fantastic for me!* Lightweight shoe - feels like you're wearing nothing at all!* Minimal arch support - I have flat feet.  Most arch supports make my feet ache within a couple of hours.  The Tiger has a very minimal arch support, and what's there is very soft.  I have had no pain in my arches from these shoes.* Low profile - I also suffer from Achilles Tendon Bursitis, so I wear clogs most of the time to avoid aggravating it.  These shoes are low enough in the back that they don't hurt my tendons at all.* Stylish!  This is a HUGE bonus for me.  These shoes are very cool looking.  I get a lot of compliments on them and people always ask where I got them because you just don't see these around.  They are very unique!* Great for multiple activities.  The Tiger makes a wonderful walking shoe, and I've even worn them to Zumba and have had great results.I don't have anything negative to say about these shoes.  I'd like to own about 100 more pairs!
