Surprised me at this price.  Lee Jeans are still well made and wear well.  Double Black is really black but to maintain it you'll have to wash them in cold water.  I dry them on medium...tho low is recommended...and they haven't shrunk as yet.  They fit great and my posterior looks trim and fit (and isn't that what it's all about).  For the price you won't find this quality elsewhere.
