Pictures tell 1000 words, so please see the picture I posted under "Product Images From Customers".There were many reviews for these ballet shoes that said that the sizing was off, yet others that said the sizing is consistent with street shoe sizing.  Amazon's description currently states that these are in street shoe sizes, however, to be extra sure I went to Capezio's website, which confirmed that these shoes should be in street shoe sizes.  The size chart can be found on Capezio's website here (I hope Amazon doesn't delete this link!):capezio.com/site/co-template/charts/footwear-childrens.jpgSo as of November 2013, these shoes run several sizes too small...so much, in fact, that I don't feel like I can reorder them because I would have no idea what size to get.
