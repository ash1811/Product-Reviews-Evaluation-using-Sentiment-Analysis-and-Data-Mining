I got these for my brother for Christmas. Ray Bans look good on any type of face shape. These Ray Bans are really cool and he wears them all the time.I recommended polarized because of his frequent trips to Colorado and the snow and sun glare that accompanies mountains. This style didn't come polarized. He decided he still liked them and would get a cheaper pair of polarized glasses that he could drive or ski in.
