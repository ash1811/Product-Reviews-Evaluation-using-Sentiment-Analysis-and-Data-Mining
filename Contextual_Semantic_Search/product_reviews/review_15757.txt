I found these socks to fit a little large (i purchased large and I am a male Size 10 shoe).  As disclaimer, I like socks with a lot of lycra in them as I cannot stand those that slip down behind the heel.  These have a substantial amount of padding in the key areas - so much that it was difficult for me to get my shoes on with these without disrupting the &#34;alignment&#34; of the sock itself.  Again, if you prefer your socks to be somewhat loose and sloppy - with some great padding in the heel and forefoot areas, these are for you.
