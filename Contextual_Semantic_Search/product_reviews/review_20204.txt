It's nice medium weight material - - somewhere between heavy and light - - - but definitely sewn for men.  I was looking for something that sits at my waist.  I was tired of wearing hip hugging warm up pants - - but these are for guys.  The elastic around the ankles is comfortable - not too tight.  No pockets or key carrier . It has inner drawstring as well as elastic waist.  Washes up great.
