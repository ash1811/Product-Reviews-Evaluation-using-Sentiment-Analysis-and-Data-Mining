I've gotten to like these Levi's 511s.  At first they seemed a little snug in the thighs compared to all my other jeans but the slightly stretchy fabric (label says they are 2% elastane) keeps them comfortable all day long.  The color 'Cash' is kind of a standard blue jeans color.  Happy with this purchase.
