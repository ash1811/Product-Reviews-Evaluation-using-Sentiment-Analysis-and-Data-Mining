I haven't decided whether to keep these or exchange them.  I ordered wide but these are very snug on my feet.  They don't feel like they are wide, more like medium.  If I order the next size up I'm afraid they will be too long because the length is fine on these.  I just wonder if these will stretch some because if they do then they will be ok.
