I used this product to reattach a sole that was coming loose on my Muck Boots.  I have worn them several times since and it seems to be firmly attached.  I also used it to seal holes and repair split seams in a pair of cheaper boots and it worked for that.  It seems to stick as well and be as flexible as Aquaseal but is thicker and cheaper.  Aqualseal will flow into small crevices and give a smoother repair than Shoe Goo.  I put Vaseline on the threads of the tube so the cap doesn't stick.
