Pros:Don't have that annoying line near the upper thigh.Nice and dark black tights.Super soft! As the description claims.Cons: None yet.I am a former dancer and have been looking for nice black tights to wear during the winter. I get frustrated because spanx and other tights have that built in panty/thigh reducer at the top. Now don't get me wrong, I love that benefit but along with it comes an annoying line across my thigh. It dawned on me my old dance tights dont have that line. And these do not. So for that I am grateful.
