It's simple. Has a nice feel to it and there are no plastic windows that tend to break over time. Plus, I enjoy storing my DL in a slot rather than the window since most places ask you to take it out anyhow. Plenty of slots and the spaces underneath the slots allow for 1-2 additional cards with ease which is nice. Overall for ~$15 ($18 - 20% off Amazon promotion) it can't be beat.I spent a lot of time "researching" the different billfolds and reading reviews and I am glad that I ended up choosing this one.
