I absolutely love how these look (I got the light blue ones), and they fit really well. I'd be delighted with them except that, having only worn them twice, the footpad in one has already come loose and bunches up in odd places under my foot. It's pretty annoying. I spend a lot of time trying to tug the pad back into place, but that only works for a min or so. I'm thinking of trying to reglue it, but I'd have to figure out what type of glue to use.Such a shame because I really like these shoes otherwise.
