Don't let the &#34;Somewhat Large&#34; fit bother you...I have not washed it yet, so I'm certain there will be a little shrinkage after that. What I love is that although this is not a &#34;Tall&#34;, the sleeves are a perfect length for my 38&#34; arms. Besides...I'm found that if I buy my clothes a little bit bigger than I need them to be...people are always complimenting me on my weight loss LOL!
