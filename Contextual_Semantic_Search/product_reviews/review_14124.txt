I read all the reviews.  They all said these jeans run a bit large.  I'm hard to fit: small waist, larger hips & thighs, so I thought I would order the jeans in the size I usually wear and I would probably be okay.  The jeans are too small.  Maybe it's just the way I'm built, but I didn't find that they ran large at all.  They are nice looking jeans though.  I'm losing weight, so I'm going to hang on to them.
