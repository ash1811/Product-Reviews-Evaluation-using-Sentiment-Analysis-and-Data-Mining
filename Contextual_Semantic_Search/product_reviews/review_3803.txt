This is one underwired bra that I would purchase for as long as it is on the market.  I would prefer more options for buying, i.e. vendors, color and sales.  It is comfortable, adjustable and retains it's shape longer than others I have purchased.  The only drawback is that the underwire pokes through the fabric after several months.
