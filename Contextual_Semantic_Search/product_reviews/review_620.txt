This bra is incredibly comfortable, and at least for me, it is true to size.  I am deployed in Afghanistan, so I do not have the luxury of trying items on before I buy, therefore, I am very impressed with the fit and will be ordering more of this exact bra, but in different colors.  The shoulder straps are a perfect width - not too thick or thin. And the back strap is a good width for support and keeps "bra muffin top" away :)
