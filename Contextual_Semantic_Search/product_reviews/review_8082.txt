I bought this bag for swimming at the gym.  I use it to hold my swim gloves, cap, earplugs, and  goggles.  It can hold a lot of stuff but I use it to hold the damp stuff so nothing gets moldy or smelly.  The top closes when you pull the drawstring handles (no zip) though there is a little zippered pouch to hold keys or I.D. on the front.  I don't put my swim fins in as I don't want it to rip (not sure if they're too heavy.)  A really nice bag that weighs nothing and keeps your stuff in one place.  The price is great and I couldn't find anything like it in any retail  store...Amazon  rocks again!
