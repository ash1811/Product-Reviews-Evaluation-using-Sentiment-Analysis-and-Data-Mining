bought them for my son...he loves them as they have a rubber sole that allows him extra grip running up and down the stairs, and when he needs to walk out on the patio. So far they have stood up to 3 months of daily use without losing that great &#34;cushy&#34; feeling. When they wear out we will be getting a new pair.
