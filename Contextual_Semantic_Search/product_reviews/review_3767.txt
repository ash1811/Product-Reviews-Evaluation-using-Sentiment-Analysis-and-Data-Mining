The cut of the 505s is fairly simple and I would agree that it is a true straight cut.  When i first opened the packaged they reminded me of my old 529 which are unfortunately no longer on the product line.  The fit of the jeans is good depending on sizing though.  I ordered one 32 waist and two 34 waist and the amount of variance in sizes is amazing.  One of the 34s ran small and the other ran big.  The bigger of the two seemed like almost a 36 and the smaller of the two was almost 2 inches different.  Not to mention that one of the jeans was mislabeled as 32x34 but was actually a 34x32 according to both the inside tag and the brown tag on the back waistband.  You better order a few and play with the sizes to find something that works.  I really liked the look and feel of the tumbled rigid but the silver fox color has a very thin and cheap feeling material.  I wouldn't recommend those.  I already have a gray 501 that is much better looking.
