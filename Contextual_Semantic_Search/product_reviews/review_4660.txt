These are extremely thick and durable jeans. They are 15oz fabric where my Levi 501's are 12.5oz, they definitely feel much more durable and heavy work ready. I also think these fit me better in the leg and crotch. The seams and construction seam solid and I have no doubt these will last me for a decade. Also consider they're nearly 1/2 the cost of most cheap Levis. I will definitely be purchasing B18's going forward.
