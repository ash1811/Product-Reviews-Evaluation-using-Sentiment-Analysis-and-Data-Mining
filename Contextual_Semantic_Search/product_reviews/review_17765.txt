My teen son really wanted a combo digital/analog watch.  And he wanted one that looked reasonably adult, and not like a sport watch with plastic everything and a million buttons. That limits the field quite a bit.  This was the watch that met the criteria that wasn't crazy expensive.  We got him one and he loves it.Unfortunately the quality is crap so after a year, it died.  When we went to find a replacement we once again found that there were few watches that met his needs so we got the same one again.  Usually a repeat buy implies  a  good recommendation but I wouldn't really say so in this case.It's still working after 6 months.  If this one quits too, I'll give it one star and insist he choose a different watch next time.
