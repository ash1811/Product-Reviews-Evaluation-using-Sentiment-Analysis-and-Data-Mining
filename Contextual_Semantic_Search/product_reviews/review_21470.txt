My son is in the junior marines and needs boots as would be expected. He has already worn out his first pair so I decided to purchase these. They arrived in a reasonable period of time however, in the words of my son, &#34;they are way too big&#34;. And that is saying something considering the fact that his shoe size is a 13. Now I will have the hassle of returning them and finding a pair that fits.
