I got these on a lightning deal.  It's my first purchase of shearling slippers, and since the bargain was phenomenal, I decided to give them a try.The shearling is soft, but not nearly as soft as microfiber.  I wear a half size, so ordered the next size up and the fit is good.  The slippers are comfortable and fairly sturdy, but clearly will not last as long as my washable slippers do.I'm glad I got to try these, and yes, I wear them.  I appreciate Amazon offering them at such a low price because otherwise, I wouldn't have tried shearling slippers.  I know that a lot of people love their shearling, but I know now that shearling isn't for me.  If I buy at regular prices, the return on investment is low.
