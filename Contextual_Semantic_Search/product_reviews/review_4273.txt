If I could wear this year round I would, this is my 2nd pair - I've since worn out the last pair.  Though they definitely have lasted.  I like to run with my dog but have a horrible issue with my right heel (plantar fasciitis), normal shoes still hurt quite a bit -- but these really relieve the pain.  I find myself putting them on first thing in the morning, so I can walk normal.
