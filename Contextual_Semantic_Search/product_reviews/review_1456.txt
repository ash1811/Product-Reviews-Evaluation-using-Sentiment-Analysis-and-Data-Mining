This is a good sock if you have thin calves. It was a bit tight on my calves, which are not large. I was disappointment that the sock wasn't thicker though, which made it less comfortable to walk in for a long time, and won't keep my feet warm in the snow.If you want a thick, warm, and cushioned sock, check out Thorlo Women's Thick Cushion Hiking Sock. Those socks are much better and not very much more money.
