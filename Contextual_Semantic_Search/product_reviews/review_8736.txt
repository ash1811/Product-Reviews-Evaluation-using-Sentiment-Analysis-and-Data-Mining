I have a simple, basic Casio - the model I have has been around 20 years and has something like 700 rave reviews here on Amazon...I do love it.My family decided I needed a &#34;work watch&#34; - I wear a suit and tie during the week.  They didn't surprise me, I was asked and I said I'd always liked the Seiko divers and they got on here and found this one on Amazon and picked it out.  I liked the looks of it a lot too - and we ordred it on my account with Amazon Prime.  The verdict?  - OH MY - this watch is great.  It's not huge on my wrist, but I'm 6'4&#34;.I didnt' attempt the sizing - it cost me $8 and 10 minutes at a jewelers and he even offered to service it when I want it - the jeweler was an authorized Seiko dealer...he had some nice divers and I asked him why he didn't have any &#34;monsters&#34; - to which he replied I did...I usually do...but I sold all 4 of mine I had on hand before Christmas. lol.Of course I am sure Amazon saved me a ton over retail and I really like the watch.  The &#34;lume&#34; as they call it?  It's ok...but it's NOT like hitting the button on my casio and having the screen light up for easy viewing.  That said...I think it's pretty ok.My routine will more than likely be to wear it M-F and take it off for hard core outside stuff like hunting, fishing, canoeing, rock climbing, mountian biking, etc...  or even riding the Harley.  Not so much that the watch can't take it...I see on some reviews that it can...but I have a bombproof casio that costs me only 20 bucks and will outlive this one anyway...plus the casio is matte black and not shiny.  works better for outdoors.The Monster isn't really &#34;bling&#34; - to me - it's just a nice stainless steel bracelet watch with a divers head on it that really looks better than a regular divers head 100x over.  It's not heavy...and it's not light...but it is about just right.I am very happy my family wanted me to 'upgrade' my work watch....this will be nice.
