Love these reefs! One pair I had lasted literally ten years (no exaggeration!) until they finally bit the dust a couple weeks ago. I was quick to order another pair and these are just as comfortable and well-made as my old pair - and I know they will conform even more to my feet over time. I bought a couple pairs of stacked wedge Reef sandals, made from a more rubber-type material that is stiff and does not give, and was disappointed that they were not nearly as comfortable as these classic guys. Reef, don't change a thing!
