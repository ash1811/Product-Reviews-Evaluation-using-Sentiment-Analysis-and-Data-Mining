These earrings are just as beautiful as they look in the picture - in fact, better than they look in the picture.  The stones are nicely colored, and are very clear and sparkly.  I don't have a problem with the earrings drooping in my ears.They came packed in good-looking satiny blue individual gift boxes inside a matching larger box.  Each small box has a square of anti-tarnish paper in it, which is a nice touch.  I am delighted with them - they look like expensive jewelry, but are quite reasonably priced.  I am extremely satisfied with this purchase!For people who are afraid these earring will fall forward - it is possible to buy very inexpensive acrylic disc earring stabilizer guards.  The stabilizer discs keep heavy earrings flat to the ear.  Earring stabilizer discs are available at craft stores.People with small fragile earlobes might also want to take a look at the 3mm gemstone earring set instead:10k Gold 3mm Garnet, Amethyst, Blue Topaz, Peridot and Citrine Stud Earring Set
