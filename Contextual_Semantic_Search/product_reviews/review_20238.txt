These are so comfortable, I am wearing a size 10 EEE. So that is why I put 5 Stars. I ordered my normal size of 9 but my toes just touched the tip. They most likely would have stretched into a comfortable Slipper but I wanted to make sure for what I paid. So to make sure I returned the 9's and ordered a size larger 10 EEE. So order a size larger than you normally wear and you will be very happy with the results...A Great Shoe..
