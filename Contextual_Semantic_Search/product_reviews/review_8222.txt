Received the 8926 this morning and it was expertly packed.  Triple boxed with the third box being the large yellow Invicta box and the watch around a yellow pillow inside.  The entire watch band was covered in a surface tight clear plastic.  It took several minutes to remove.  After finding the manual hidden in the top of the box and unscrewing the crown (keeps it watertight) I was then able to two click it to set the time. The second hand does not stop but by setting the minute hand to the second hand I was able to get them to synchronize.  Now, it did not match my atomic clock by six seconds, but this timepiece will never match an atomic clock throughout the day nor will any other automatic movement. It has been running fast so far just under 1/2 minute per day.  Automatic movements supposedly run fast and slow so on the average the time keeping is better.  If this bothers you, get a quartz battery watch or an atomic watch. It has a heavy stainless surgical 316L steel band and nice clasp.  I think the clasp is easier to open than a Seiko I used to have with a stainless steel band. It is heavy and rugged, but a little too pretty for bashing around.  I'll keep my five year old Wenger for that.  As Invicta is also Swiss I wondered how it would compare to my Wenger Avalanche (Swiss quartz and a best seller in its day).  Without the bands (one is leather) the watches are very close in size and weight, but the detail on the Invicta is much better than I expected and makes the Wenger look far outclassed even though it cost more over 5 years ago.  The 8926 is an amazing value and exceeded my expectations even though I researched it carefully over many days for several hours. I am extremely critical and to me it matches with the positive reviews here and at other sites.  I am very happy to have it for the price of $85 and I received it with free shipping in three business days USPS.
