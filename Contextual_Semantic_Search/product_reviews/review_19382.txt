I have been chastised by friends for my &#34;ugly&#34; boots...now that it's minus 8 those comments have stopped.  I love these boots - warm and comfy.  I like that they are above the ankle as no cold air gets down onto my feet.  They fit like slippers, and as I have narrow feet I can wear with socks if I so choose.  On &#34;warmer&#34; days I opt for no socks.
