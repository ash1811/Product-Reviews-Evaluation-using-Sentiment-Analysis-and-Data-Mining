My boyfriend loves these shirts for working in the shop, which is what I ordered them for. He says he gets slightly warm at times, but they're breathable and he doesn't overheat. He prefers long sleeves to keep his arms clean and free of liquids ( mechanic) and oil, etc. The fit is accurate, and comfortable. Attractive quality at a decent price. I will be buying him more in the future.
