The title says it all. I placed my order days ago yet it sits and sits and Amazon has NO NO NO way to contact any seller despite what they print in their alleged 'help'  section. So I am out the money and NO WAY TO CONTACT ANYONE AT ALL. I have dealt with Amazon for years and I know or I should say I knew there used to be a way to contact them. But in the age of no choices or one choice to fit all Amazon ONLY allows one to cancel. I know if I were a merchant I'd be very pissed about reviews that make the site usafe to use but there it is. Amazon NOW REFUSED TO BE CONTACTED MUCH LIKE EBAY IS AN ISLAND TO ITSELF ABOVE THE LAWS.
