I bought these for my husband who hates shopping with a passion.  I sized up half a size since he wears thick socks and these fit like a glove.  He wears these for driving, going out, and around the house so I'm guessing they're pretty comfortable.  He's had these for about 5 months now and they get heavily used and are staying strong, even in walking around in mud outside and doing work inside the house.
