They have a nice look but they are extremely narrow. I have yet to wear them a full day because they squeeze my feet too tightly. They are classics, but I'm unsure whose feet are that narrow. Will not repurchase unless it is a wide size.ETA: I didnt realize they sold wide sizes. But was also not made aware that medium would be too narrow.
