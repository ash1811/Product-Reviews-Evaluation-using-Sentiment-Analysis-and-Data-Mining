I got this product for my sister who enjoyed taking 4 years of French in high school.  Here is what she had to say about the product:>>>THIS IS AMAZING! I loved working with this product! I picked up on the words and phrases very quickly, and it was fun to do. They show you pictures and then show you the French word, pronounce it for you, and then you say it. It reviews the same things in different ways so practicing the words is not dry and boring. You can do it on your time and at your own pace. It also teaches you the four areas of language - speaking, listening, reading and writing. It offers activities that have you practice a combination of skills (reading and writing over listening and speaking), as well as lessons that focus on just one of the skills. I would highly recommend this product to my fellow peers! I am excited to try French Level 2 and learn even more!&lt;&lt;&lt;I asked her if she had tried any other language learning products that she could compare it to and she said she had not, but she was very happy with this.
