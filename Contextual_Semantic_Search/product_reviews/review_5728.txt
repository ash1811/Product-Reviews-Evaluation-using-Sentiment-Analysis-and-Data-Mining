THE FIT AND CONSTRUCTION OF THIS GARMENT IS EXCELLENT.  THE WARMTH COMPONENT SEEMS TO BE JUST ADEQUATE. THE COST, IS OBVIOUSLY BASED ON CONSTRUCTION AND FIT.  THE UA FOLKS SENT THIS ITEM OUT VERY VERY QUICLY AND IT WAS PACKAGED APPROPRIATLY.  I MISTAKENLY GAVE THEM ONLY 3 STARS THE GARMENT IS A BIT BETTER THAN FAIR AND THE COMPANY SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN 5 STARS.
