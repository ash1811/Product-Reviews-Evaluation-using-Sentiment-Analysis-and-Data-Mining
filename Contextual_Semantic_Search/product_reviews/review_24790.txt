My father is in a nursing home and he loves to wear a white hat. He ran over his with his wheelchair and got oily grime on it. I worked on it and thought it was ruined. My mother worked on it and got it clean (lighter fluid was the trick apparently). In the meantime, I ordered this one for him. When it came it was great. It is better quality than the one he has that we cleaned up for him. I set this one aside and when he does finally ruin it (and I am sure he will somehow), this one is ready for him to wear.I was surprised how nice a quality it was for the money.
