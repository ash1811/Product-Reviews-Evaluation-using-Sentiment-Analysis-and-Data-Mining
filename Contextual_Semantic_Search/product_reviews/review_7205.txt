After spending years buying low quality, uncomfortable winter boots; I finally decided to spend the extra money and get a pair that was comfortable and designed to last. I wear a size 12 shoe, but can get away with an 11.5. I wasn't quite sure what size UGG's I should order, so I went with the 12, hoping that it wouldn't be too large. To my delight; when the package arrived today; I put them on and found the size to be perfect, both with and without socks. These boots are as comfortable as a pair of sheepskin slippers and they are very lightweight as well. I was a little surprised to find out that they're made in China, but the high quality is obvious, so I can't complain. It just seems a little ironic that the label on the back of the boots says UGG Australia, when in fact they're made in China. At any rate; I'm totally satisfied with my purchase and know that my new UGG's will give me years of comfortable use.
