I honestly didn't have high hopes for this undergarment. I've purchased other tummy control type products and thought they were a waste of money. I've warn this quite a few times since it arrives. And I think this product is the cat's meow. It noticeable slims the waste.But I do agree with other reviewers who complain about the product digging into your flesh. However, I offer solutions. First, I think that perhaps some are not wearing the undergarment properly. The woman in the pic is wearing the cincher just underneath the bra. So what I did to eliminate digging is to tuck the chincher under my bra a bit (in the front and back). And this did help to eliminate this a bit. However, what really eliminated digging was to wear one of those control top type pantie girdle thingy majiggs on top of the underwear and cincher. I noticed this eliminated another issue as well. The control top panties hid the ribbing. Unfortunately, the chincher ribbing is visible through my shearer form-fitting pencil skirts. But with the control top panties the ribbing outline is not visible. I hope this helps someone. F.Y.I. I am a size 10 curvaceous woman. However, I've let my figure go to pot so my waist is large. I gots me a dunlap (unfortunately). :-(
