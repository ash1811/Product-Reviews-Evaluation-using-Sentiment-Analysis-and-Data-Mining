My 10-year old is growing taller and longer feet --  which makes shoes for dance classes a problem.  Even using the measurements guide wasn't sufficient; the length was pretty close, but the width was really too wide.  I think they might have fit better if I'd gotten one size smaller than the guide indicated.  At least I think she'll grow in to them.
