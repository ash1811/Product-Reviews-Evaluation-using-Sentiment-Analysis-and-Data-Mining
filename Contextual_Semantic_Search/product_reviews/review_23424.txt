I rarely buy handbags, but I really needed a new one.  I wanted a little backpack purse, but one that had a handle and could be carried like a purse.  This Baggalini is the best of all worlds.  It's a purse, a backpack, a sling bag - all in one.  Conversion is as easy as zipping and unzipping the straps and moving the clips.Construction is solid.  Everything from the zipper pulls to the straps to the pockets scream quality.There is a place for everything.  The main compartment has dual zippers and is secured by a magnetic flap.  It's large enough to hold my Kindle Fire HD 8.9" tablet and includes a strap for a pen, pockets for change and credit cards.  I don't have to carry my wallet with me anymore.  It's built into the purse.  I had my doubts at first, but those cards don't fall out.  The purse also sports zippered pockets on the front and back for convenience and security.I like the versatility.  When I need my hands, it's a backpack.  When I'm just walking around, it's a sling bag.  When I need to hang it from a table, it's a handbag.  The only annoyance is the magnetic flap, which always wants to close when I have the bag open.  On the other hand, that's an aesthetically pleasing feature.  I'm not sure I'd want it removed.  Also, strap length is not adjustable.  This might be a problem for some people.  For me, it's a great bag.  I'm pleased with my purchase.
