I absolutely love these! I wear them every day when I drive to and from class.Pros:1) They look great2) They are very comfortable3) They really do protect your eyes. I drive about 45 minutes with the sun right in my eyes every single day and I never strain or have any issues.Cons:1) They are a little expensive but I'm not complaining they are wonderful.
