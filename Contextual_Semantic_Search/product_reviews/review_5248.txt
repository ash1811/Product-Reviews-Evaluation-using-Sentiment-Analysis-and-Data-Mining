GV jeans are great, if you can find the right size.  This is the same old song sung by so many people here, and it's been sung a long time, and GV jeans company just keeps on experimenting with cheaper and cheaper manufacturers, most of whom don't have a clue about hiring employees who can run machines or teaching those who don't.  Quality control is non existent.  These jeans, this year, the light denim, were manufactured somewhere in southeast Africa and they were laughably small, the completely wrong size, not even a child's size 12 - just wrong.  I don't think consumers ought to have to check the &#34;made in&#34; tag or even be concerned about where an item is made, the company that makes them ought to be involved enough to be proactive in the quest for quality products, but GV hasn't and I don't expect they ever will be. since their jeans are still very popular.  Women get disgusted with sizing and quality, then they find a pair that fits, and they love the brand again.  And they continue to buy.  That's what GV counts on.  So... that's the way it goes with this brand.  As for these jeans in particular, as I said, they didn't even try to hit any measurements, or to check for quality, so they went back to Amazon, who thankfully has a good return policy.  I haven't bought any more GV jeans since this experience, I just don't love the jeans enough to put up with the never-ending hassle.
