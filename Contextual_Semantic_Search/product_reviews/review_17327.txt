I'm size 7 and this feels like size 6.5. The front tho..seemed right length but the back seems a bit short, and the straps were too tight. Not sure if the straps would be comfortable even if it wasn't tight tho... The sole padding feels just ok but the material they use should be questioned... I dont think its comfortable on the skin at all. And its true the bottom can be slippery coz it's pretty much flat. I don't think it's worth the money. If it was $13 bux I would get an exchange for a bigger size.My questions is why the hell do these companies make sandals that are uncomfortable and charge us what it's to worth??? That is plain stupid. It is OBVIOUS they didnt use a shoe model... Thank god for amazon tho I can just get a refund hassle free.
