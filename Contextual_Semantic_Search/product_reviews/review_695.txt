I bought this for my Daughter in Law for Christmas.  She has worn Shadowline gowns for several years and appreciates that the fabric is heavy enough that she can go around the house with the young children with out worrying about having to put on a robe first.  The gowns are comfortable as well as durable.  Had difficulty finding them for the past year or so and understand the company has changed hands, but these gowns appear to be equal in quality as the older ones she has.
