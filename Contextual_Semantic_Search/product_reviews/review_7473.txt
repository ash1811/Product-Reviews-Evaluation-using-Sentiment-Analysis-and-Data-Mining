These shirts are fantastic gifts for the outdoors man. This was a beautiful color, unfortunately I had to return it because it was a bit to big for my dad for Christmas. As usual, Amazon customer service was prompt, courteous, and  made the exchange process simple. These are also a great price, much cheaper than at the local sporting goods store.
