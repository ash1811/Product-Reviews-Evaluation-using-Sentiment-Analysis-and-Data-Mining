For the price this bag is great.  It's big enough to carry everything I need for myself and my dog when we go to the park, or store.  The Velcro on the front is lacking and you might want to sew on a small buckle if you carry a high price PDA.  It's a small enough, big enough "Every Day Carry" bag.  The bag is about 7 inches tall and 6 inches wide.  I got the black cause I wear a lot of black, so most people don't even notice I have it on.  Well, except this one day I forgot to wear clothes, and everyone made a nice comment about the bag.
