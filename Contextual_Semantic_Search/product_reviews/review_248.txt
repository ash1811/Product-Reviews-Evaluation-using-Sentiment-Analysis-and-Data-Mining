They say that "it takes a real man to wear pink", but even among women and girls who wear Converse, pink is an uncommon color. These make quite a statement no matter what crowd you run with. In some ways it can even be a safety measure, as they make you easy to identify in a multitide. Because they are so unique, people that wouldn't normally remember or even pay you a second glance will tend to look twice and/or learn to recognize you - I think that alone makes these worth the money compared to any other shoe.In addition, unlike many shoes, Converse don't mind being thrown in the washing machine for occasional cleaning (just avoid the bleach, or you'll fade them quite fast). Thus, I don't mind wearing these everywhere, because if they get dirty it's no big deal.Speaking of fading, pink Converse have to be worn for awhile before they resemble the color of the image shown - they are a bit more bright, deep pink than they appear. They are not "neon pink" (a separate and easily distinguished color), but nonetheless pinker than the image.Converse almost invariably seem to run a half size larger, and these are no exception. So if you're a 9.5, get a 9, etc. These were my very first pair, and I'm glad that I tried them on in a store to learn this before ordering - it would have been a rather unpleasant surprise.Also true to most Converse, these have little to no arch support, a thinner sole compared to most modern shoes (i.e. you'll feel it if you step on a rock or such), and don't take too kindly to being worn in the rain, mud, snow, etc. I certainly wouldn't run a mile or take a hike in them. For those reasons, I've got to knock one star, as much as I otherwise love these shoes.
