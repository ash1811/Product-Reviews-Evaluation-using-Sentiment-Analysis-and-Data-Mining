This is a nice, compact umbrella that fits easily into a shoulder bag or large handbag. On a recent trip to Normandy and England, I had to use my umbrella several times and the opening & closing mechanism worked well and was very handy for surprise showers. I did learn that, after closing the canopy with the button, in order for the mechanism to work again to open the canopy, one must pull the canopy section down to the handle until it 'clicks', thus resetting the open/shut mechanism. If this is not done, then one must manually open the canopy. This is not a big problem once the trick of the mechanism is understood: Just pull the canopy back down once it is closed and it will be ready to pop open and up when the release button is pushed. I bought two of these umbrellas, one black for fall/winter and one blue for spring/summer and I expect to use them regularly during the year. When they wear out, I'll just buy new ones as the price is reasonable..
