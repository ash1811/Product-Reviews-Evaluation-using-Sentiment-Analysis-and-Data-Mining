This isn't an overly high quality outfit. However since we only needed to use it on Halloween night and one other halloween party, I saw no need to waste additional money. For the 12-16hrs this was probably on - it held up fine. Had no problem with the durability of it. I got the size Small for my (just turned) 5 year old and it seemed to fit him well. The cape was a bit long however and we ended up taking it off when walking around the streets after a while (so it didn't drag on wet ground). The mask is only a 1/2 mask but that's not really a problem. It has shoe covers, the belt and chest computer are just printed on nothing fancy. Obviously doesn't come with gloves or the light saber. The material is what you would expect for a 15-20$ costume, it's very thin and see through - you'll most likely want something underneath it. It does have a very cheap feel to it, I wouldn't buy it if you wanted a costume that would last you several halloweens or one that looks like it cost more then 20$. For the price it is - and all others I saw in this price range (the ones locally were the same quality but about twice as expensive), this is a good deal.
