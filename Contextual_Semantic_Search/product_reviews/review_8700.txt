This watch is hard to use.  Also, it's overly complex: i just needed a watch to tell time, wake me up, and time my runs. For example, it has five alarms (huh??).  I like that it has a dual timezone clock.  But all the features are hard to set, despite reading the instructions. It is annoying to have to read instructions EACH time you want to reset an alarm or change your time. (I travel a lot for work). If you are looking for something easy to use, this is not it.
