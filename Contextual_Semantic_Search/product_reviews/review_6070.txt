This is a really cute casual shoe. I don't know if they are a long distance walking shoe but they are great for the mall or out with friends. The fit is true to size and not too narrow. Great looking with Jean or casual pants. The colour is not too dark...I would call it a true camel, too. I'd like to get them in black.
