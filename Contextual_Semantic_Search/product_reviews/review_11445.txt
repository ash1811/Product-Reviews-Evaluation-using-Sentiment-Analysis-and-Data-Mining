I ordered the correct size, and it fits well.  The only thing I really don't like is that the boning really doesn't hold you in.  It pulls you in, but you still have an obvious belly, so anything I wear over it you can see the line of hook and eye down the front.  I have to say, I like the Rago one I got right before this one arrived.  It works much better to pull me in where needed and make my curves stand out.
