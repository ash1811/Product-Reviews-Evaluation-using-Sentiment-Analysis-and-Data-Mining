I love these shoes and have bought several colors.  Here's why:  The Pros's: great if you are on your feet all day- particularly wonderful for RNs and hairdressers.  Like walking on two rubber balls- but EXTREMELY LIGHTWEIGHT!  The sole is not a steep arch, almost more like a platform because its thick on the front half too.  Also, these are rubber, so they're washable/wipeable/disinfectable!  I also like the extra height it gives me, saves from having to hem alot of pants!  The Con's: slightly slippery in water (wish they had deeper tread).  Also- the slot holes in front means that things you might spill on your feet could go through.  The biggest possible Con however is this: if you are not used to a high platform height, these may be a bit risky for you.  Due to their bouncy sole plus their height & design, they seem like they might be a twisted ankle risk for some people- but if you wear platforms and clogs and such already, you'll probably love them like I do and have no problems with this style of shoe. Remember- they are HIGH in height!  All in all, I LOVE these shoes!!
