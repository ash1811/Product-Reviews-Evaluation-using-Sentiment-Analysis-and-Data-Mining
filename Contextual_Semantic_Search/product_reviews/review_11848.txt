My husband generally does not buy shoes online, but decided to add these to one of my orders since he did not have time to get to the store and try them on.  He likes the comfort and wants them in a lighter color as well.  The leather did stretch a bit more than he wanted after just a couple of days wearing them to work, but he decided that he needed a little more arch support than they have on their own.  After adding a pair of black, Superfeet insoles, they are perfect and he wears them almost every day (even when they don't go with what he's wearing).
