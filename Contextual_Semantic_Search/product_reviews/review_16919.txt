My husband bought a pair about 6 years ago that fit him perfectly (he wears a size 11 shoe & the size 11 muck boot was right on target). However we bought a size 11 from another Amazon seller & it was way too tight, too short also. So we tried a size 12 from this company--it was way too big. Somehow we think the manufacturer either changed, or the sizing is not well regulated. Most of the other reviews from this site as well as from other sites mention the irregular sizing issues. We hope Muck Boots will eventually see the need to sell half sizes-we love the boot, just not the sizing problems.
