I own an exercise belt but this is totally different.  I cannot even compare it with the belt.  It is so comfortable to wear.  I really think it will trim my waist line.  I am currently 34 inch waist without any compression and 32 inch with little pushing.  I got a medium 28 inch waist Cincher.  I have to pull on it to wear it, but as soon as it is on I am so comfortable in it.  Great product.
