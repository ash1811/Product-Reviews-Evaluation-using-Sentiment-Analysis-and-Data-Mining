I bought these as a pair of work shorts for around the house. The right pocket opening was stitched up so high it caused the opening to be too small. So small that you cannot fit your hand into the opening. I should have returned them but I did not. I would never buy these again, nor would I recommend them. Typical cheap mass produced Chinese junk. If you actually buy these shorts, they do run a bit large, so order wisely and prepare to be disappointed.
