If you want a boot that you can wear when your 18,28,38,48,58,68 years old, this is it. They even look good on females too. Hands down Clark's makes a timeless shoe. When your done chasing &#34;new&#34; styles every season and realize that clothes are just a silly waste of money (besides a great watch) get two pair (Brown and Black) and call it a day. Ver comfortable as well and look good in khaki or jeans.
