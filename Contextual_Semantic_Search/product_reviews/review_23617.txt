I purchased this bra to sleep in and it is excellent for that purpose. On rare occasion I will wear it around the house as well. As a 34DDD it is difficult finding bras that fit, much less that are affordable, so this was a great find. I don't know that I would ever wear it under my everyday clothing, but I wouldn't wear anything without an underwire under my clothing.
