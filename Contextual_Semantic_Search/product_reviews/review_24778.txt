It is exactly as expected and is a warm and durable covering of modest weight. Combined with your rain poncho to keep out the wet it can make life a lot more comfortable if the great outdoors turns out to be wet and chilling. It works just as well for napping on the couch or recliner.I'd still like one of these with a zipper located so I can use it as a poncho under my rain poncho. One with a built in hood would not be bad either.
