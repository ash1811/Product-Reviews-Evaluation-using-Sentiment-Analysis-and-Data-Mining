I own almost two dozen of these shirts and I love them. But (and it's a BIG "but") they SHRINK! I wash them only in COLD water and hang them out to dry and now I can't wear three of four of them. I just put on a NEW black one I received a couple of weeks ago, sized XLT (supposedly "Extra Large Tall") and it's too tight. I keep popping a snap when I relax or lean over. I love the fit and cut of these shirts when they are sized properly. That's what you get Wrangler when you outsource your manufacturing to Asian countries! They are great work shirts otherwise - when properly sized and cared for, they wear like iron and look great. I can only give a grudging three stars because of the sizing and shrinkage. Buyer beware!
