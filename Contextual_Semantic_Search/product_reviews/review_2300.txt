I've been using Levi's since the 70s my youth years , and even today they still my favorite jean's ,many kinds of jeans on the market today ,and a few trying to imitate the famous Levi's jeans ,!!!  my opinion  if is not a Levi's jean i do not want it in my closet that simple ,love them all not only the 501..
