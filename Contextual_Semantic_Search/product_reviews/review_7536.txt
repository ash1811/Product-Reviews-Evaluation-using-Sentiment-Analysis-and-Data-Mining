I got these as a lightning deal to round out my personal jewelry collection. I wasn't sure what to expect at this price point, but when the sets arrived I was pleasnatly surprised. These are much better quality that what you would normally find for this price.The stones shine brilliantly with an impressive size and weight. The color and clarity of the stones are also impressive. The only shortcoming are the garnets - they look more like a dull brown than the rich, deep red pictured and sparkle noticeably less than the others. I probably won;t wear the garnets too often for that reason. That being said, I still feel that my money was well spent.I bought the matching pendant collection as well, but honestly the earrings look just as beautiful worn alone or with a second set of earrings (I like them worn with sterling silver hoops).
