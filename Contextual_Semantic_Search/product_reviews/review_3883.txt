I bought this Dopp kit for a girl friend who wanted a traveling toiletry bag. If you are thinking about maybe purchasing this, do not hesitate! It is so cute for a man or woman and looks like a far more expensive bag then it is. The distressed leather is beautiful and it surprisingly has a lot of room! Love love love!
