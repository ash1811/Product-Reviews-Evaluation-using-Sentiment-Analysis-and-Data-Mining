It looks regular orange in the picture but the actual backpack is super fluorescent. I really like the color orange, so this is cool with me. The backpack is sturdy and lightweight and it arrived just in time for school on Monday. I'm quite pleased with my purchase, especially because on the Jansport website I didn't see this color and it is more expensive.
