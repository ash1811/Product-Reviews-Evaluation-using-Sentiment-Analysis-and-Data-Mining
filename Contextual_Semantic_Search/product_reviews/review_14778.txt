We don't wear shoes in our house, and I'm not a fan of big bulky slippers. These are my favorite slippers of all time. They fit snugly, but very comfortably. They are lightweight and very durable. I wear them every day (I'm a stay-at-home-mom) and you couldn't tell. Virtually no visible wear on them. They have lovely leather soles and are lightly padded inside with a terry lining. I'm not sure if it's due to the lining, but I will say that they haven't taken on any smell, as I've found many shoes and slippers often do over time. Also, you can put them in the washer and dryer and they come out like new. LOVE these.
