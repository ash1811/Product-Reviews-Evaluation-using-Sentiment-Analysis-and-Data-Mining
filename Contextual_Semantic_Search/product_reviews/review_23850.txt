Great product.They even fit my giant head. My wife says that the lenses are smaller than other wayfarers, but I think that's mostly because she's used to seeing oversized glasses. A lot of reviewers said that they think the glasses they got are fakes. My order was fulfilled by Amazon and the glasses appear to be real.
