When I opened the box, I thought for sure I had received a narrow size by mistake. After examining them, they only had a "12" on the shoe and the box with no width designation, so I assume they are considered "medium", but let me tell you, they are far from any medium I have worn. This is an obvious reason why one should try shoes on in a store before buying them on the internet - especially if it is something they haven't worn previously, or in a long time.The quality of the shoe is also sub-par in my opinion. On one shoe, the toe upper is sewn crooked and makes a strange folded crease in the leather when I wear it. After wearing New Balance for years, these simply seem cheap - and I don't just mean inexpensive (which they are).Bottom line for me is ill fitting, uncomfortable and inconsistent quality shoes equal a lesson learned in shoe buying.
