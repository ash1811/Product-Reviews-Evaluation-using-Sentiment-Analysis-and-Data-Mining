I've worn Birkenstocks for years and have always loved the comfort and fit well in a size 37 (although the shoes I bought previously were open-toed).  Bought a 37 in these shoes and the toe box was too small, so sent them back (had to pay significant postage) and got a 38.  The toe ridge is too far forward so it's annoying in that regard and the foot bed is not as supportive in the arch.  They're just not the same as real Birkies & overall I'm disappointed.  I'll still wear them from time to time but they're definitely not my favorites by a long shot.
