Worthy of the ExOfficio name. I've loved their boxer briefs and recently purchased two shirts for a two week trip. Washed easily in the sink and dried easily overnight. I use them as undershirts, and they fit to size. I typically will wear large in a t-shirt (the review says Hazel, but I'm the husband), but wear medium in undershirts. I'll be purchasing more.
