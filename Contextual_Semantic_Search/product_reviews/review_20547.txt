I have this in black, white and taupe.  I wear it when I go on walks and hikes, but I also wear it when I am out on the weekends running all my errands.  It fits well and is very comfortable.  I need under wire in the bras I wear.  The under wire in this bra is hardly visible and does not poke out.  like how this bra lifts and hold me in.  It acts like a minimize.  In addition, the clean simple look allows for it to be worn under regular close ( a dress, a t-shirt, sweater top) without looking like you are wearing a sports bra.  No uni-boob here.
