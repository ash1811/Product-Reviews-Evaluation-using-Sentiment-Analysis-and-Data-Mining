Bought these for my son as a gift. Seem like a very nice shoe, will know more once he opens them for Christmas. My daughter in  law suggested them and I couldnt find them in the shoe store so as usual I found them on AMAZON! I hope he love the way they feel on his feet . The delivery was as usual awesome cant wait til he sees them&#62;
