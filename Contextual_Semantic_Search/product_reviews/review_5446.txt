We have just ordered two more of this umbrella.  Although it is not the easiest to use umbrella we have had, it has lasted three to four times as long as any of the others, plus it is itself a safety feature.  Let me explain.  Mid-yesterday afternoon ****in poor visibility conditions**** the front left tire on a friend's car blew on the way to NYC.  We wound up on the side of the road, not terribly long before an exit, with a a tire needing to be changed just feet away from busy 65 MPH traffic.  I was able to walk 100 feet back and open my bright yellow umbrella.  THE ONCOMING DRIVERS SAW THE UMBRELLA, turned off their turn indicators and moved to the farthest portion of their lanes to avoid hitting us all.  Everyone in our party decided after that to buy a bright yellow umbrella to keep their cars in case of the similar situation ever arising.  So do not think of a bright yellow umbrella only as an umbrella but also as a safety feature to be kept by your spare tire!
