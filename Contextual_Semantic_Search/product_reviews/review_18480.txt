THE UGGS ARE GREAT. WELL MADE AND VER COMFORTABLE TO WEAR. THEY RUN A LITTLE SMALL. I WEAR A 10 1/2 USUALLY SO I GOT AN 11. WITHOUT SOCKS THEY FIT PERFECTLY, WITH SOCKS, A LITTLE TIGHT. THAT BEING SAID, WHEN THE SHEARLING PILE INSIDE THE SLIPPER COMPRESSES A BIT,THE SLIPPER WILL ENLARGE A FULL SIZE, SO AN 11 FITS LIKE A TRUE 11. IF YOU PLAN TO WEAR THEM WITH SOCKS, I WOULD GET A SIZE LARGER THAN YOU NORMALLY WEAR.
