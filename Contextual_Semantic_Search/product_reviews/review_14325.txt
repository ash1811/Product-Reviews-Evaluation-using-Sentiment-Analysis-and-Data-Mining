I picked up these jeans on the reviews and advice from other buyers. Everyone was certainly correct. When I tried the jeans on without washing them first I felt those great memories of years ago when jeans were truly jeans. They were a little stiff but after the first wash they became softer. If you wear them without washing them too much you'll find they soften with wear. I found no problem with chafing or scratching on the skin after one wash. The size is certainly larger than Lee in the legs and the waist is higher than Levi 501's. I do need a belt with these jeans but I always wear one anyway. There is enough room in the thighs and the upper gluts to move comfortably. These jeans look great. Dark blue and no one has got to them first to make them look worn. These are real indigo jeans. I haven't found out yet if all Dickies regular fit jeans are cut like these ones. I bought the relaxed straight fit bull denim Dickies jeans and they are very good also but a little different. Transform yourself back to a time when jeans were jeans. These jeans will do it.
