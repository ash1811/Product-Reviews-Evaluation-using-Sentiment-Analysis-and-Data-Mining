These were a bit larger than I was expecting - I looked at the measurements but it's hard to picture until you see the earrings. However, they seem to be very high quality and very shiny. Arrived quickly from seller in a nice little jewelry pouch. Can't verify if they're 925 sterling or not but I don't have any allergies so shouldn't be a problem. Just wish they were a little bit smaller but I'm sure I'll get used to them! Great earrings.
