I wish I could wear this 24-hours a day! It is the most comfortable thing I have ever worn, period. The lace part is a tad bit scratchy-feeling if you rub the outside, but I don't notice anything at all irritating on the inside. I also have the shorter so-called slip version & it is awesome too.I often have issues with getting overheated at nighttime if I wear anything bulky to bed, & yet I can't stand just going to bed in underwear for hating my skin touching itself - this is the perfect solution. It feels so soft and silky & barely there. I really can't rave about it enough! Not only is it the most comfortable thing in the world, it is also very pretty & you feel like a princess with its nice flowy fabric. I think it's also very form-flattering.
