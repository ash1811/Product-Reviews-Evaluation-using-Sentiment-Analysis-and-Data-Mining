This shoe polish thick and leaves a nice shine on the boot. It delivers but I just don't like the smell that it emits. I'm trying to get accustom to it but no luck so far.At least you don't need to worry the smell when the shoes are dried and on your feet. However, you will have to endure it while polishing and shining.
