I love the comfort waistband, but the sizes are strange. Bought large, but they are too big for me. I then bought the medium, and they are a bit too tight. Just not sure what to do. Maybe I should try another brand. I might go with a higher end product. Any ideas?Update: Material is very rough on the skin. Unlike any Hanes I have tried before. Not pleased at all.
