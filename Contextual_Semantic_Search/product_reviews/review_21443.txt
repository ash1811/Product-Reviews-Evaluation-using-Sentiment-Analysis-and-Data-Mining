Let me start by saying that I'm not the kind of person who buys pants online. I'll buy shoes, shirts, dresses, socks and even perfume, but pants are just a bit too hard to fit without trying on. That being said, I figured I'd give these a try because it's hard to find a good cargo pant where I live. I am so happy that I did!These pants a very nicely made, with plenty of pockets and a lot of style! I was very torn size wise, and read the reviews carefully to make my decision. I am an average to slim build, and normally wear an 8 - 10. My biggest problem normally is finding pants that are long enough for my 32&#34; inseam. I figured a medium would work, but since I will use these to garden and work outside (translate into bending, moving and not wanting to be bound) I went with the large. They are perfect! The fit is loose and casual and plenty long enough, but they don't look sloppy. So, if you want something more form fitting, size down. If you want a casual work pant that doesn't bind, size up.I got the pink camo, and I love the way they look. Not exactly sexy, but pretty stylish. I'm on my way now to order an olive pair - I love these pants!
