I purchased this for my niece, so she could keep up with us at the river.  She went hiking, rafting, tubing, etc.  She was able to keep up with us in this shoe.  Flip flops would have been a disaster.  I said they fit as expected, because I think they did, but in hindsight, I think they may have been a bit narrow for her?
