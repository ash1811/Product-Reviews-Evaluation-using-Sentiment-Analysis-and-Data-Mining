They changed the fit and sizing on it.  I liked the way it ran really small.  Especially on the sides.  I am petite and bras always come up too high on the sides so they show with sleeveless tops.  The old model of this bra did not come up so high, in other words, it was as not as &#34;full coverage.&#34;  I remember seeing reviews on places like HerRoom complaining about the small fit of this bra.  Maybe now it works for more people, but not me.
