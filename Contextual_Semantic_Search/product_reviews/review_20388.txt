The cons:  The hem on the top and the pant bottom was unraveling out of the package with a long string attached.  I love the feel of the material and how it fits.  I am large breasted so I am always concerned it the pants will be too big.  There is a nice elastic on them and they fit very nicely.  I am 5' 3&#34; and the length is perfect.  If I had paid more for the pajamas I would be upset with the hem coming out.  But as it is I am just going to mend them before it all comes out and enjoy the great night sleep I have in them.  They do not bunch and I can turn easily.  A little see through so I would be uncomfortable wearing them in front of my son.
