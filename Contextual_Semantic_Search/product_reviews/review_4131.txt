This is a beautiful watch, nicer in person than the picture.  I love the two tone look to wear with gold and silver jewellery.  I agree with other reviews that the second hand is too prominent and gets mistaken for the minute hand, but this is something you get used to after a while, I've been wearing it for about a month now.  it keeps perfect time so far and the face is medium size and suits my wrist (medium to large).  Very sleek and classic looking, can wear to work or going out.
