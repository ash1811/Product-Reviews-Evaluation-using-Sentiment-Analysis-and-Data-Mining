I've been buying Wranglers for years now.  Yes, once in a while I'll try a pair of some other well advertised jeans and they're usually pretty good but Wranglers are just as good (and in some cases better) and Wranglers always seem a bit less costly.. so....why not save a couple of bucks.  Yes they are comfortable and made of good quality.  They are NOT made in China but by our friends to the south...
