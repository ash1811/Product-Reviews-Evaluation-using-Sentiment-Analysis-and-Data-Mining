I liked the functionality especially the countdown timer & the alarms. However, it didn't last. I was just in Mexico & condensation formed under the watch glass on a humid day. I did NOT go scuba diving while I was there. Now, the watch in useless.I would recommend the cheaper Casio which lasted almost 2 years for me until the band broke.
