I wore a pair of these regularly in the warm months for, uh, eight years?  My girlfriend pointed out they were looking a bit worn, so I ordered a new pair to match.  These may be the most durable piece of clothing I've ever owned.  Not exactly the pinnacle of style, but I'm not a runway model, either.
