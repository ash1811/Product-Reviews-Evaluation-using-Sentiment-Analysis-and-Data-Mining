I have tried several types of sports bras, but always come back to the Enell.  Have to admit, they aren't the most attractive but you will not find a better supporting sports bra.  I wear a D cup in a regular bra.  I can run wearing the Enell with no bounce and it makes my run so much more comfortable.  I would tell every women to at least try it.  In support and comfort, you will not be disappointed.
