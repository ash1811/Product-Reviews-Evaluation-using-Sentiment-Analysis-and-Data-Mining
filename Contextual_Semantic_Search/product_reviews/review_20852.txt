This was my son's gift past November or December. Beautiful Angel but past January the chain was broken in five parts like a twig. I take care of all my jewerly and with this necklace especially. I'm very disappointed  because it's not very cheap and I've to buy another chain now. I don't know how many stars gave my son to this purchase because I didn't make know him about this defective chain.
