though these slippers are nice looking and fit properly, they are not all that comfortable, which is the point of wearing slippers. maybe when they are broken in they will be more comfortable, however, having never had to &#34;break in&#34; slippers before, it's the main reason for the 3 stars. they seem to be well made, though the material used for the uppers seems a bit on the cheap side. also, my feet tend to slide around quite a bit on the foot bed. overall, if I had not gotten such a good price on them, I would be returning them. keeping them strictly for their looks and the hopes they will age well.
