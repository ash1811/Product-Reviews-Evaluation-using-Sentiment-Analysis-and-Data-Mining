I was searching for a silver pendant I could wear with various silver earrings. This is IT! I love it...just the right scale and is light. The pendant is slightly concave though, which means the sharp points of the flower edges poke a bit, but I'll get used to that. It's quite shiny, in a good way. Highly recommended!
