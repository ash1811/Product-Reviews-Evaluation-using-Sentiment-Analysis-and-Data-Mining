Although I have had Dickies in the past, the quality of the sewing around the zipper was bad.  After only wearing these to work for the second time, I noticed the stitching was coming apart where the zipper cover was.  It looked as if my zipper was open at the top.  The pants were not small, as a matter of fact I thought a 36" waist would have been more appropriate after I tried on the 38", but decided to keep the 38 in case of shrinkage.  Anyway, I ended up stitching the seam myself, and now all is well, the comfort and easy care of the work pants are fine.
