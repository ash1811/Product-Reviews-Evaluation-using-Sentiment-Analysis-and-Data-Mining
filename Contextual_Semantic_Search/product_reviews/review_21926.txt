These leg warmers are just the ticklet.  I don't move around much & this old house is cold & drafty.  They stay up and keep the chill off my lower legs.  I hand wash them and lay them flat to dry.  They have held their shape & given me no problems.  These are my first leg warmers.  They pull on & peel off easily and have given me no problems.
