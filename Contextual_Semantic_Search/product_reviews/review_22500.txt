I purchased this watch about a month ago. I am very pleased with the purchase and have only two things to comment on.The strap length, it is a bit short and I would say I have average size wrists for a 6'0" guy. That being said I buckle it into the 2nd hole from the end.I would prefer it to be 1 maybe 2 more inside but then you would have that overhang so I have learned to appreciate it.The strap color. In the picture it appears to be a tan tinted olive drab when in fact it is a very full green olive drab. I like it better but yeah it looks a bit different than it does in the picture.All and all it is a quality watch and I am extremely happy with my purchase. I would definetly recommend this watch.
