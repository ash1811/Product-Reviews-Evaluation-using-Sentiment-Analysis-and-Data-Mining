It is so hard to find a demi bra in 38DDD first of all. Second this fits amazing!! It is cute and so comfortable! The bottom does roll under a bit but not bad just if I am lounging on the couch and up and down alot. I am not sure how well its going to hold up over time (I don't think it's going to be more than a year) but totally worth the $$$$$ !!!!!!
