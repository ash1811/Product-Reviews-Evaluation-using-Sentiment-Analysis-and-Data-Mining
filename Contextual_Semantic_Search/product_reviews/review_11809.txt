I was excited to finally get a 'grown-up' pair of sheepskin slippers, but when I got these, slipped my socks off and put them on, I immediately noticed a problem - too much cold air flow around the neck of the slippers and across my ankles.  I thought about putting  a single lace in the top to hold the flaps up and then thought heck no, not for this price.  So back they went, and I ordered a pair of Uggs Classic Mini, hands-down the winner in the warm-boot/slipper contest.
