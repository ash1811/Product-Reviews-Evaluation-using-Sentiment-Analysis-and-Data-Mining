First: it got here quick! It was in it's bag which was in a small box, then that was in a bubble wrapped bag and put in a 12"x12"x5" box of bubble wrap. Lol. It was so big that I couldn't figure out what I had ordered. Got a huge laugh, it was in perfect shape when I got it, not all bent up like a couple reviewers said. Maybe that's why they do this now. It's beautiful! Hardly know it's on, great buy! Might get the earrings too!
