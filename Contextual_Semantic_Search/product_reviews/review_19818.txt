These slippers are very pretty, soft and comfortable.  Because I have a problem with swelling in my feet, I ordered a size X-Large even though I wear a 7-1/2 shoe, and this worked out well.  The only drawback from my perspective is that it is a little challenging to put them on my feet, I can't just slide into them, but that is just me.  They are very cute and would make a great gift.
