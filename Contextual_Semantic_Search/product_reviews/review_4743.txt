I have bought Carhartt merchandise before but never bought their shorts.  I bought these because of the quality of previous jeans I purchased for my husband.  These arrived on time and with perfect packaging.  The fit is perfect, even after several washings.  So far, the color has not faded.  I will buy these again because my husband loves the comfort and fit.
