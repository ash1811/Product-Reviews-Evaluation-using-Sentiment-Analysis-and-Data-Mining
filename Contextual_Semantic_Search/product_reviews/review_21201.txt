If you have not tried these, you must give them a chance! I got my first pair in Hawaii, (I had accidentally packed black flip flops but packed two right feet, duh...) I ran to the hotel gift shop and bought these in desperation, and now have at least 7 pairs of them, They last for years, seriously. They are sooo comfortable, and they come in great colors! One review said they do not hold up in water, it is true that they get wet, but I did not have any horrible time with them like the other reviewer. If I wanted to walk in the water I would probably put on water shoes. They are my go-to flip flops in summer, and they make great gifts!
