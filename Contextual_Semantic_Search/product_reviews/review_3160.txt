The look is stylish and I was looking for a sleeping bra so it needed to be very comfortable.  The only complaint I have is that I actually measured under my breast and the measurement I bought fits a little snug.  If I had it to do again I would buy a size larger.It is comfortable enough to wear around the house or just lounging.  The cups are thin and soft.  If you nipples protrude they will definitively be visible through your clothes.
