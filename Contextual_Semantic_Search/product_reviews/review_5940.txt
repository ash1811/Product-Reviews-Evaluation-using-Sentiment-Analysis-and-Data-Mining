I purchased this armoire based on the positive comments from other buyers. I was very disappointed at the very cheap quality of the drawers. When you pull them out far enough to have a glimse of the items in the back compartments, the drawer just falls out. If you ever want to see items stored towards the back of the drawers you will have to pull the drawer out entirely. Very cheap workmanship. Not worth it. If you are a prospective buyer, I'd go for one of the more expensive and durable models.
