Levi's makes a great pair of loose fitting jeans for big and tall gentlemen who want a slightly more relaxed look to their jeans; and these jeans are a good choice for people like me who are slightly overweight. They just plain give you extra room; and that's great!The denim is nice and thick; and these jeans are extremely durable. The excellent stitching helps make this possible. In fact, these jeans last for years at a time without any fraying--even at the bottoms of the legs. They are made from cotton and they are permanent press. However, I would wash these jeans with similar colors to avoid any color dye bleeding onto white garments in the wash or dryer cycle.Overall, these fine jeans by Levi's easily rival any jeans made by other manufacturers. Make sure you choose the right size and color for you if you're using the pricing and availability chart above on this webpage. If you want a pair of loose fitting jeans, this may be just what you're looking for. I doubt that you'll be disappointed.
