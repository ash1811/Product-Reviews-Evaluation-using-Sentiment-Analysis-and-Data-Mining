Way better than the EMU slippers! I tried the cheaper ones first because that is what i do, but those hurt her feet, now I cant get the UGGS off her.  They go on the minute she gets home. I think she wears them to bed!  The mens ugg scuffs are excellent too, Ive had mine for three years. They are still in great shape! Now I Get them back! LOL
