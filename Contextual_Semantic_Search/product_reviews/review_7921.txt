I did like this bra for the situation i ordered it for. This past June i needed a light weight strapless bra for a cute top (also purchased on amazon) that had spaghetti straps.It worked well in the outdoor setting at the zoo, it was quite warm and the light weight lacey bra helped a lot. but i have to say i spent a great deal of time pulling it back UP. i even went an inch smaller in the bust to give me some more GRIP! and i still had to pull it up. it also didn't have much form around the top of the 'cup' so it felt like it was squashing my breasts..lol not flattering to say the least.over all though it was comfy and aside from those issues it worked out fine for a day at the zoo. i wouldn't however wear it under a nice dress or blouse. i'd need more support.
