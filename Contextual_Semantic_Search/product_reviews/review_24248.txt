I like Bali bras as they seem to fit me the best.  I've been trying different ones as my new favorite had been discontinued by Bali.  This is comfortable, has wider straps so doesn't dig in.  I'm a DDD, so comfort and support is what I'm looking for in a bra.  Concealing is also a plus with the soft taupe color.
