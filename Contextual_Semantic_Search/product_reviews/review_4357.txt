If you have a short rise or are a little butt challenged order a size smaller. I used the sizing guide and these come to my belly button and are a little saggy in the back. You can see a little a line if wearing spandex. Not terribly noticeable. I would not order these again. Now that I have been been doing more comparison shopping, I can do better on price with brands that fit better, like Calvin Klein, etc.
