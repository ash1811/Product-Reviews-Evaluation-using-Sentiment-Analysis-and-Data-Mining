After trying Hanes underwear, I immediately returned to the one and only Jockey French Cut.  I have been wearing this brand and style of underwear for nearly 25 years, as my body has gone through all shapes and sizes -- and they are the best.  They are cut for a full size rear end, which I have always had and still do!  Non-binding, comfortable, fit well.  I love these underwear.
