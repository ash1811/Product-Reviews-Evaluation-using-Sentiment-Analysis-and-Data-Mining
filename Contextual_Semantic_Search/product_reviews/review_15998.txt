I've gotten better knee highs at Walmart, or K-mart for $2.00--  The top band was a little bit larger than most -but for 11 dollars?? No way!! The body of the stocking was flimsy and cheap. No Support at all! -- If they last a day or 2 I'll be shocked. From the description, you'd think they'd have some weight or support. Famous Spanx? Not these  Don't waste your money ladies--these are a very bad deal.
