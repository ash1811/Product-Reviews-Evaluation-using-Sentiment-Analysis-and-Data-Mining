I said it fit's somewhat small - after it was washed and dried it was only slightly on the very verge of being small. Normally mediums leave me a lot of room. This shirt is long from neck to hem, so this would be great for tucking in, but looks just fine if you leave it untucked. Very comfotable, and at a medium-to-thick weight. During Summer it might be too heavy, but elsewise it's great.
