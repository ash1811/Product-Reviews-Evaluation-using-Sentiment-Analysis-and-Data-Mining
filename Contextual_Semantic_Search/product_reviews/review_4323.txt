The only problem is that it says waterproof ? but where ? the nylon straps took a long time to dry which I thought was treated to  resist water, but it didn't...it is however a durable sandal on hikes and ATVing and on a boat, trekking through sand and mud, but the sandal attracts and retains mud, sand and water....
