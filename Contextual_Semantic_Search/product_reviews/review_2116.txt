These aren't fashion leggings. The crotch droops down a little low and, while they fit snug on the legs and butt, they are a little loose around the waist and crotch area.They are, however, great for exercise and workout. I wear them when I dance and I have a great range of flexibility. They are also very comfortable and warm (lycra).
