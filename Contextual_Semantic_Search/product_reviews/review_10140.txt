The shirt has high quality Russell material as you would expect.  The size is correct with plenty of room.  The challenge is that the neck hole is so tight that it fits like a mock turtle and I find it very uncomfortable.  I had to tear the neck to make it tolerable.  The rest of the shirt is great but this is a deal killer.
