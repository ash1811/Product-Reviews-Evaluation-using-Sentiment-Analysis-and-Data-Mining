I bought this to go with an ultrasonic cleaner I was purchasing.  I tried cleaning a ring with and without this, and I can say the ring seemed a lot cleaner after I used this item in the machine (of course, it could have also been because it was the second time through the machine!).  The product doesnt have any kind of odor, and is clear and doesnt stain or tint jewelry items.  I also used it in the machine while I was cleaning my eyeglasses, after rinsing well I have had no bad effects.  The product works as advertised.  You can, of course, always just use dish soap in an ultrasonic machine, and that is probably what I will do for my non-jewelry products such as my eyeglasses and CD's or DVD's. I will continue to use this cleaner for my jewelry for now though.
