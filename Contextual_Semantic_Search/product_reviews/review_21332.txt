Love old style leather shoes & my Thom McCans had seen better days. Tried to purchase the same style again but couldn't track them down so opted for good old Clarks! I thought they looked nice from the pics but these babies are really great up close - Thankfully they were a perfect fit, the leather is beautiful & soft......great shoes......great decision - I'm a happy camper!
