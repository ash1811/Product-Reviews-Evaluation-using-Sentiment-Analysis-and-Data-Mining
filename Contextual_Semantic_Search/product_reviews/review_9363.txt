I love these, super comfortable and look super cute. The one thing is they are SUPER LONG and the three pair I bought are all dirty on the bottom after the FIRST DAY! That was upsetting because now they look gross! They are still comfortable. These are nice for exercising, yoga or tai chi. Sometimes I will even have a lazy day in them around the house. A bit overpriced for what you do get.
