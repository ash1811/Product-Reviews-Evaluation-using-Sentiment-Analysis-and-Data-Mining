I had purchased Thorlo hiking socks before and loved them.  These are very nice too.  I was looking for something that would be more versatile than the white/khaki colored socks and found these.  I wear a size 8.5 ladies shoe (US) and these fit my foot very well.  I plan to order more in the near future.
