I have been a 550 relaxed fit levi wearer for over 15 years. I have had quite a few pairs and they last forever. Recently my favorite pair (over 6 years old) ripped beyond repair. And decided it may be time to get new and a size larger..I was extremely happy that the cut of these pants hasn't changed a little snug in waist and loose in the legs. So now I have 4 new pair that are soooo comfortable and look nice (the black jeans pass as dress pants)I have had no real luck finding womens jeans that fit like this so this message is for women who want a nice, comfortable fitting jean to try this style.. I love my Levis!!!  Colleen
