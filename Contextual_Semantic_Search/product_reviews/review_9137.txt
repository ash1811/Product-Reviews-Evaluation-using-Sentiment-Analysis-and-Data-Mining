There was no surprise when these Levi 511 Jeans arrived two days after ordering them from amazon, maybe, a little for I had selected the 3 to 5 business day option, however, aside from the lightening fast delivery service, I had already bought a pair of these from Macys in Black for $15:00 more. The fact is, if you looking for the ultimate skinny, tight fitting jean, and thats the look your going for, this is your only option, and trust me I know I've done my homework. These 511 Jeans are made with a stretch material, yet denim all the same, how they managed to come up with this I don't know, what i do know is you wont find a tighter looking fit, if thats what your looking for. Also keep in mind, because these 511's do have this stretchable ability, they're not so tight that you cant breath in them, and that is something very important. In all the years I have been wearing nice snug fitting jeans, these are the finest fitting cut, or line I've come across bar none. They also come in Black, which I also own, it's a no brainer for someone going for that kind of look.
