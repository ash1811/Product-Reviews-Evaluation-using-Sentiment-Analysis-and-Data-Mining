Being a LARGE frame guy, it takes me a long time to go to the clothing stores only to find they don't have any Wrangler's in my size and if they do then there is no length that I need and / or price is way to much for the product.So, I have found that that by using the intra-net and Amazon lessen my search and so far I have been happy with the products..I have made 3 separate purchases in a year on buying Wrangler Jeans and have not had to return any..
