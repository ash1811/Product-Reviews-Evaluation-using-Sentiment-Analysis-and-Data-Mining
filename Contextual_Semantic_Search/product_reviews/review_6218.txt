After this winter's polar vortex, sheets & sheets of ice formed everywhere making it near impossible to even walk out of the house. These are amazing & I will never go another winter without a pair! Love love love them!! Easy to put on & even easier to take off. Stay in place nicely. Very easy to walk in them.
