Been looking for this color shirt for a while, because my union requires their constructions workers to wear Safety Green. (We used to wear Roadwork Orange).This is definitely safety green. A neon bright yellow/green.Good quality, the material is mid-weight, and washes well. No shrinkage in the dryer.Good for layering in colder weather, or alone in warmer weather.True to size.
