I HAVE HAD SEVERAL PAIRS OF THESE OVER THE YEARS AND THEY NEVER FAIL TO PLEASE.  I HAVE HAD FOOT PROBLEMS AND WHEN I WEAR THESE THEY ARE PERFECT.  THE SELECTION IN THE STORE IS SOMETIMES LIMITED AND I WEAR A 6.5 WIDE.  THEY USUALLY DON'T CARRY THAT SIZE AND THERE ARE FEW SELECTIONS OF COLOR.  I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER TO BE ABLE TO GET WHAT I WANT ANY TIME.
