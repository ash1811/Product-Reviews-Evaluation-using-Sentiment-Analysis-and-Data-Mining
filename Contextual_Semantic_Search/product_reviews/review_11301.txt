my favorite backpack in years. good solid standard jansport but in an appealing print that makes it work worthy, for a professional who needs a backpack. light, convenient. wish there were two zippers on the second smallest pocket but am living with it. no hidden pocket for a wallet but that is a rarity. outside side mesh pocket really works for water bottles: no dumping out.
