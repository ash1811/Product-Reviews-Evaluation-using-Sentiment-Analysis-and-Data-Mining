I purchased these shoes for a two-week Hawaiian vacation. I was scared of stepping on sharp rocks or jellyfish while on the beach. They worked well on the beach! However, these shoes have since been permanently borrowed by my husband, who wears the same size shoe as me. He has worn them for anything from hiking to fishing to running to the store. I think he likes that they're breathable, versatile, and you're able to get them wet without consequences. You will slide a bit when they're wet, but I took the advice of other reviewers and ordered a half size down - I usually wear 9 and 1/2 and I ordered a 9, which fit well.  For the price, its a quality water shoe, but to be fair its also the first pair I ever owned! I don't think you'll go wrong if you're looking for an inexpensive water shoe for occasional use and order this pair.
