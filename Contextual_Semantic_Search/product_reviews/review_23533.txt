I bought this watch to replace one I have had for a couple of years and broke. I was so happy to find the very same watch here on Amazon.  This watch was and is just perfect for my needs as I wear both silver and gold jewelry.  The size is just right...not too big or too small.  Looks great with jeans or dressing up a bit.
