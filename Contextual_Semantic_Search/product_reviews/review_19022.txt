Where I live, it can get so hot that sometimes I like to wear this watch, rather than my stainless, heavy, Swiss-made Luminox. I appreciate how well this classy Timex has withstood years of use, and it keeps time perfectly. The wristband is comfortable, and I absolutely like the watch-face's bold, clear, easy to read numbers. Enjoy!
