These replace the Ray-Ban Aviators I bought in 1990, but were damaged beyond repair when I accidentally stepped on them a couple of years ago. At that tine, I was unwilling to pay the price to replace them, so I bought counterfeit Ray-Bans instead. The counterfeit glasses looked pretty good until I dropped them, and the glass shattered. I'm glad that didn't happen when I was wearing them! Genuine Ray-Ban glass is shatterproof.So I decided to go back to genuine Ray-Bans. Mine came from Sunglass Express, fulfilled by Amazon, with free shipping. This was the best price I could find online anywhere! The glasses shipped quickly via USPS, and arrived a few days after they were ordered.My original Ray-Bans where made by Bausch & Lomb in the USA, so I was nervous if the quality would suffer now that they are made by Luxottica in Italy. These new glasses match my recollection of my old ones, and I am very happy with their quality.If you are unsure what "L0205" and other product codes mean on Ray-Ban Aviators, go to the official Ray-Ban website. There you can scroll through all the various Aviator models and see the detailed descriptions for each product code.
