At first I had purchased a pair of these because i loved the idea of being able to have a bottle opener with you all the time. I have to say i have the used the amazing bottle opener a total of 0 times. Always forget its there and always had a normal bottle opener with reach. What surprised me most is the comfort and quality of the item. This is actually my second pair. I owned a pair of brown ones for the past few years. The brown pair to this day aside from a little dirt and sand are like new. I have been very impressed. In the past,  I owned Teva's (quality was great but sandal became rock hard in a less than a year, so they are gone) and many off brands that just fell apart. This sandal maybe a bit pricey but like the saying goes, you get what you pay for.
