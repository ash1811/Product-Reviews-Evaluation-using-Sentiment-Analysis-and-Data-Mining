I've only used the Buxton Convertible Billfold  (my last one for over 7 years) as a wallet!  I love the leather and color choices that are available.  You get a great coin pocket with snap closure, insert for your license with removable plastic card pockets with another snap closure, plus your bill compartment. It's a great wallet for a wonderful price!!
