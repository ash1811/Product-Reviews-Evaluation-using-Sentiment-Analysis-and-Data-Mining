My wife is slightly disabled and she used this backpack on a 6 week trek through Europe.  It fits nice in the overhead compartment, lugs up and down stairs between train tracks and maneuvers well on the Paris Subways.  Pehaps it&#8217;s best feature is it forced her to pack light (me too as I had a pack of my own)!  It held up well to the rigors of travel and we&#8217;re going to use our packs again to do a 6 week trek to Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia. We did take care not to drag it up steps as you can only expect the wheels to take so much abuse. If you can learn to pack light, this bag is great!  If it don&#8217;t fit in the backpack or in your small hand carry, then leave something behind.
