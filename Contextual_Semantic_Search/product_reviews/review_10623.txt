I love this shirt and I will be keeping it instead of returning it but just in case you are considering buying this, buy it a size or two larer than you normally wear. Also it is very sheer, there is no underlay at all so you really need to wear a cami or something of the sort under this shirt. Also, ... I love the V neck but where it hits my waist is a little high so I feel like I need to keep pulling it down, I wish it was a bit longer ... but overalll I like it and will wear it sometimes.
