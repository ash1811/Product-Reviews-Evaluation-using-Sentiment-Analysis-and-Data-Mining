The size is not true. I bought a pair of 6 1/2 about two years ago from a different website and they fits perfectly. So I bought the 6 1/2 again. But they are at least two sizes larger. I have to return the shoes. I am not sure what happened. Did they do it on purpose so people think they have small feet or was it a mistake?
