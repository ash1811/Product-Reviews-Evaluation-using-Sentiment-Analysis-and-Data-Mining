These were a great purchase, a little costly but they are worth every penny. The toffee color matches just about everything and you can dress them up or down. So very comfortable, I feel like I'm walking on air! I bought them for a family trip to Disney and was worried my feet would hurt if I didn't invest in some seriously comfortable sandals.. These were just the ticket! Classy, versitile and comfortable, fantastic combination!
