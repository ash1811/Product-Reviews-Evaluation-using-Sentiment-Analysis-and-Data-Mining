I chose this shoe looking to upgrade my wardrobe. Here are a few things you should know:1) Size a half size down from your sneaker size.2) You need to break them in, but it only takes two or three days of wear3) The crepe sole has TERRIBLE traction on anything even remotely wet4) Avoid spilling oily substances (sauces, oil, etc) on them!5) They go well with most anything!Don't regret this purchase whatsoever and I in fact recommend it!
