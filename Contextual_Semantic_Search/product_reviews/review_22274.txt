I have about 10 pair of Sperry Topsider shoes, all size 7.5 but the last few that I've ordered are too big in the heel.When I ordered a size 7, they are too tight.  I think I have ordered and returned about 4 pair in the last 6 months, allbecause of the sizing.  Cute shoes, just no way I could wear them.
