I agree with others who said they needed a larger size. I fit a 9-9.5 and ordered an extra-large. I tried on several pairs of shoes --- athletic shoes and ordinary shoes --- the fit was a little loose but sufficient. You can't jog in them but they will work.I tried to buy pull-on rain boots from every store in town before giving up. The next choice was a pair of dairy boots from Wall Mart.If this review was helpful, please add your vote.
