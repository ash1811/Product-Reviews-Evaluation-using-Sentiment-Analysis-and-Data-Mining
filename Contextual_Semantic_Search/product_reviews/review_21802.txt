It's much smaller than the photo suggests. Can't hold anything for a day trip of any sort, it's just for going out for a few hours really. It's also very feminine looking because of its shape and small size, which I didn't expect based on the photo. Comes in the same type of packaging used for cheap fireworks. Not impressed.
