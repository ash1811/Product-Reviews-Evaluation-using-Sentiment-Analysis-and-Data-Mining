Ordered these Van Skate shoes for my 10-yr-old grandson; they arrived just a couple of days ago. This is his third pair of Vans and I love that they have proved sturdy and always true to size.  The price was great (less than what I saw in retail stores), and they really look good.  He loves them because they are 'awesome!'
