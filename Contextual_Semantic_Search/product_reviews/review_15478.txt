It's a long sleeve onesie, pretty hard to mess it up. Yet, the shape is different from anything I've ever seen. It's as if the shoulders are for a bigger baby but the sleeves are kind of short, like a 3/4 sleeve instead of long sleeve. I love the fabric, stretchy and so soft despite several washes, and it didn't shrink or change into some weirder shape..
