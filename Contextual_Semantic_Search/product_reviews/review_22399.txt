I discovered Reef Ginger flip flops years ago, and will not buy any other flip flop since. The arch support in these plus fabric uppers, makes them comfortable for all day walking in summer, and no irritation between toes. They do squish over time and lose their support, but they usually last a full summer season for me.These are really the best!
