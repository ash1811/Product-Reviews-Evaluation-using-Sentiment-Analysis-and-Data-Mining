As men we don't get a lot of mainline fashion choices. I already own another Seiko watch (gift from my brother) but the deal I got on this one was hard to pass up.  Particularily since I have a lot of affinity for Orange (one of my favorite colors, it is also the color of the branch I am in in the Army(Signal!!)) and already have a fairly massive wrist (I needed all of one link removed to make sure I got a solid fit).  Works great so far (and probably for the rest of my life).  Gotta love the lack of winding.
