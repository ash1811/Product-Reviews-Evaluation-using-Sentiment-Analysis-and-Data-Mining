I have always been a fan of Uggs, although I was a bit saddened when I purchased a new pair of the classic shearling tall boots and found they were now so poorly made, they are not the Uggs of 6 years ago. Alas, I just love my tootsies to be wrapped in warm shearling and needed some snow boots too. I took a chance on these Adirondack Uggs and found them to be just what I wanted. Very warm and water resistant (they may be water proof, I'm not sure) and still stylish. Awesome vibram soles make them a great hike/snow/walk/outdoor-general boot and the shearling folds down to make them just the right amount of stylish. I love wearing these on cold days in my snow gear AND with skinny jeans out running errands. I may never wear my other Uggs again. Get these boots.
