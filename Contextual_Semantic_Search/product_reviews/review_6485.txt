These tights have a super pearlescent sheen, it's not too over the top that I can't wear it to the office. I've had guys comment on my lovely hose, only I know they're ogling my proud ballet legs heehee.They are super opaque, and feel very compression sturdy - which may be too snug for some depending on how you like your fit The seams have lasted my stretching beyond any other brand. They've held up so well at the gusset I've bought myself more in every color.I'm 5'2&#34; and 115 lbs I buy the smallest size (A) they feel very snug I could probably go for the next one up and struggle less with getting them on, but they are comfy for me and never droop through the day.
