I bought this necklace for a pendant I also purchased on Amazon.  It is very shiny and made of quality silver.  Definitely an eye-catcher!HOWEVER, it is not nearly as thick as it appears in the picture.  Which is my fault for not paying attention to the '2mm' on the title!My warning is this: if you're a guy, this necklace is probably a bit too thin to fit your masculinity.And that is entirely based on my personal opinion.  If thin rope necklace is your fad, and you're a man, so be it.Although I bought this chain for myself, since it wasn't thick enough I was able to use it for a pendant I bought my wife. It looks absolutely beautiful on her!
