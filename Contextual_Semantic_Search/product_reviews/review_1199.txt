I thought that these would be kind of like cut-off control top panty hose. They're more like just cut-off regular pantyhose. There was no 'control' at all in the 4 pair I bought, following their sizing charts. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find them too tight, in fact I thought they'd be tighter. Regular firm control briefs are better. Waste of money.
