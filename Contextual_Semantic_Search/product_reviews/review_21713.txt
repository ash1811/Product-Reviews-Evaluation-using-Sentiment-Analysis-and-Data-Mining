I use them as multi-purpose rags while hiking or camping.  I don't wear them, nor do I care if they keep color or look pretty.  The price has gone up a little since the last ones I purchased, so I'd look around.  There are much better around for roughly the same price.PROS:. They cost next to nothing.. They work for wiping sweat, washing up at camp, cleaning equipment, wiping off bug repellent, ect ect.... Oddly durable for the price.. 27" x 27" is massive.CONS:. Super thin... you can literally see through them.. If you care about color, don't get these.  The color bled out with the first wash and they faded like they were a decade old.. The edges began to fray.. but hitting them with a lighter every once in a while extends the life.. Listing is incorrect. They are NOT 100% Cotton.. They are NOT very absorbent.. Only one side of the bandanna is printed.. Very stiff and plastic feeling until it is washed a handful of times.. Made in China
