My husband loves these shorts.  These were recommended by a friend and ever since he bought them, it's all he wears now in the summer.  These shorts are a good length (he hates shorts at or below his knee) and hit about 2" above his knee (he's 5'11"). Some good things - they have a velcro waist which allows for much tightening and losening as needed.  Easy access pockets, huge openings for full access, and each pocket goes the full length of the short so they are much larger pockets then they appear.  Also, pockets are built well such that items do not fall out when sitting.  Each pocket has its own spot of velcro to remain closed.  My husband didn't care much for the velcro on his wallet pocket and it was very easy to remove just the velcro on this one pocket.  These have faded some with washing (definitely not the bright vibrant blue) but again, they've been worn constantly this summer and aren't too faded for something that was probably washed and dried 30 times this summer.  Just remember to close the velcro on the waist before washing or everything in your washer will be stuck to this large piece of velcro.
