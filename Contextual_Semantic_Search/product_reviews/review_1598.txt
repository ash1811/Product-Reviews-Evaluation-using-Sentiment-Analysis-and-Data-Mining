I ordered for my husband and it was a little big so we decided to put it in the dryer to shrink it a bit and that worked.  He is good with the size now.  Carhartt brand is a very good brand but they seem to be made different depending on where you purchase them from.  We were happy with shirt after we shrunk it a little.
