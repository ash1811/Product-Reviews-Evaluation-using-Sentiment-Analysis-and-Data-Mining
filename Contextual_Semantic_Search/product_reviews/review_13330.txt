I have always bought $20 aviators which would eventually break and scratch because I was afraid to spend the money on a good pair and lose them.  My wife finally convinced me to get a pair of Ray-Bans and I will never go back to the gas station sunglasses.  The polarized lens make an incredible difference when  compared to non-polarized lenses.  And because they cost more than my old glasses I actually take care of them.  They make a statement.  If you are interested I suggest that you go to a retail store that sells Ray-Bans and try on the different sizes before buying on Amazon.  I saved 40% over retail by using this trick.Pros:PolarizedClassic styleSolid constructionCons:I am scared to lose such expensive sunglassesBottom line: Once you go polarized you will never go back.  I will definitely buy again if I lose these.
