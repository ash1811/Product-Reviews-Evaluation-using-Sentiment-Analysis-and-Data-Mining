If you buy the correct size in this bra, it works exactly as described, reminding you to hold you posture correctly which then helps with back pain.The cups are cotton and soft, there is a seam down the middle (which is obvious in the photos) but it doesn't show through my tshirts.  The back is a strong stretch material, as expected, to hold your shoulders back.  The fabric reminds me of a very thickly knit swimming suit fabric.The front clasps are sturdy and don't gap (again, if you're wearing the right size).  Over all the bra gives me a nice, slimming contour that is very flattering.  I bought a 36C and I can wear it, but it gets a bit tight at the end of the day so I bought a bigger size to accommodate post surgery swelling and it feels wonderful.  The biggest thing I noticed is I had NO back pain at the end of the day, which I usually do.  I am 5'7 and about 135 lbs, my rib cage measures 31 inches and a 36C fit me but felt too tight in the breast area, a 36D fits perfectly with no gaps or wrinkles.Is it a sexy bra?  No way.  Is it nice looking and does it make you look better in clothes and feel better physically?  It did for me.  Great deal for the price, I will be buying more.
