I had my doubts when I bought these earrings.  I've not had much luck in buying jewelry on line.  I was always disappointed with my purchases--cheap, tinny and badly made.  So when I opened the little velvet bag they came in and pulled them out, I was amazed at the brilliance of the stones and the delicacy and quality of the silver settings.  I will buy another pair as a holiday gift.  No disappointments here . . . I have already worn them several times.
