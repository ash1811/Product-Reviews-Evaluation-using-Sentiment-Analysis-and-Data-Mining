I've never had aviator glasses before. They always remind me of cops. But since moving back to Sunny California, I have been seeing these everywhere. Then I tried on a pair and some guy told me I look like Angie Harmon. So of course I ordered a pair. I love them. Everyone comments on how hot they are. I'm old as dirt, so I will take the "hot" comments whenever I can get them.I am 99% sure the lenses in these are glass, not plastic. They're definitely genuine Ray Bans -- I've owned lots of Ray Bans, just never the aviator style. Oh -- I purchased directly from Amazon LLC. I'm not sure I would trust anyone else.There are three basic sizes. 55mm is for pinheads (sorry, smaller people with smaller heads). 58mm is what I wear and I am the size of a large woman or an average man. And 62mm which is for people with enormous heads that they can barely hold up....or maybe just slightly larger people. I was told that most people wear the 58. Small women wear the 55. And large men take the 62 (it may be 61...it is hard to remember all of this information with my average sized head)Great purchase. Great price. I will be buying more...
