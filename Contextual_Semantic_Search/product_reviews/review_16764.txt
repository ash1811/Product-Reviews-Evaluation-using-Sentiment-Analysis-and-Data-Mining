I was looking for a spring fall jacket. I started looking at the local sports clothing store and everything was in the $100.00 price range. Then I remembered 40 years ago and how I loved my jean jacket.I saw the Wrangler jean jacket and it was what I was looking for.I bought two an XL and XXL. For warmers days when I just need a short sleeve jacket I will use the XL. When it is cooler I will layer a flannel shirt so I needed the XXL. They are true to size after you wash and dry them. If you  try them on before washing you may think they are to large.I dried them on normal temp and all I had to do was iron the collar so it laid flat.
