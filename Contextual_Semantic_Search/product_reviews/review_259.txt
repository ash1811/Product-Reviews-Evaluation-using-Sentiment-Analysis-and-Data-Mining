Man let me tell you, I always wanted a pair of these but I was being cheap and didnt want to spend the money...But as you can see I broke down and went for it.  I searched and searched and I am so glad for Amazon's buyers writing reviews because this is what made me go for it.  I read most all of the reviews to make my determination of size because I made a mistake before because I didn't know to order a size smaller.  If you a female and are buying a pair of Converse you better get a size smaller if the listings say Converse Men.  I Love, Love, Love these dang shoes and I love the fact that now that I know what size to order.  The fit is perfect.
