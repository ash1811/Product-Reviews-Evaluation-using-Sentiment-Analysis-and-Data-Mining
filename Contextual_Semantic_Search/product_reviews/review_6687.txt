My only complaint about these is the same one I have about all overalls and coveralls... they are hot to work in during the summer months.Other than that one complaint, I have nothing bad to say about these overalls at all. They've made it through a year and a half of daily flatbed work and are still going strong. They are cut and snag resistant, have plenty of pockets and are very comfortable to work in (besides being hot).If I could make one improvement on the overalls, it would be to add a Velcro strap on the leg cuffs to make it easy to tighten them over my work boots to keep dust out and keep the cuffs from getting walked on and torn up.
