When I first got these they were fine...but after a few months of almost daily use they have gotten so uncomfortable I can't wear them.  First, the shoe comes up very high on the foot, resting right under the ankle bone.  I was willing to tolerate this although this by itself was a bit uncomfortable.  But oh, the springs in the forefoot area now feel like they are going to poke holes in my feet!  Even placing additional padding over them did not help.  I'll stop wearing them for awhile and maybe try in a few months to see if it was just my feet, but for now they are decomissioned.
