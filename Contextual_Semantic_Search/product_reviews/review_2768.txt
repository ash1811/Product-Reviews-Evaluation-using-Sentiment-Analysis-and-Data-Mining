The watch itself is OK so far.  We like the waterproof feature, and that it's indiglo.  I like the numbers for the minute hand, and I DO like the fact that they don't go up to 60, but rather after the half-past mark begin counting backwards so kids can actually learn what, &#34;twenty to&#34; &#34;quarter to&#34; etc. the hour means instead of only understanding how to read digital time.The band, however, is horrible.  It fastens on with a feed-through buckle system, which doesn't stay fastened.  The metal on the fastener also bothers my daughter as it rubs against her skin.  Also, if the watch gets wet, it's cloth, so it's immediately uncomfortable and can't be quickly dried with a towel.Also, the face is more blurry/cloudier than it appears in the picture, so it's harder to read than it looks like from the pic.My daughter does like the watch, so I'm not going to return it if I can find another watch band for it.
