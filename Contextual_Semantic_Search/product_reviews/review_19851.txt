I've worn these in the past & based on the reviews, I went up a cup size to a C. I always bought a B in the past. I'm glad that I went up to a C, these fit much better. They stay on well, just make sure that you wash them with hot water & soap, let them dry before you put them away in their container. Won't work if you're busty. I would recommend this to anyone!
