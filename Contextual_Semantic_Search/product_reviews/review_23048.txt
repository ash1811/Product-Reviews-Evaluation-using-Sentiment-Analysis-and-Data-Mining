I was sad when I got these because they were way too big, even though I got them in a 37 narrow. I was hoping with the high arch they would fit better, the length is correct, but still too wide, and not able to adjust the buckle any smaller to make them fit correctly. I thought the high arch was going to make a difference but I don';t believe this particular pair had any higher arch than any of my other birkenstocks.  I once owned these years back when I was an RN, in white, and they fit great, right out of the box in a 37 narrow, with just a regular arch. Maybe different colors run different sizes? Too bad because I loved them then, and I was able to wear them at work without any breaking in time.
