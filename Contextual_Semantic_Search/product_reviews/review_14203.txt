I owned a pair of these prior to me buying these, but my dog chewed up the left foot and unfortunately you can't just replace a left foot!  I ended up getting three different colors of the same style because I am so happy with them.  They are comfortable, casual, but you still don't feel like a schmuck in a business casual environment.  You can go socks or no socks (if you go socks, don't go white socks).
