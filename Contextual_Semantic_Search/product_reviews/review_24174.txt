These are very nice, comfortable house slippers in their manufacturing concept.  I do like the slightly raised (firm) sole with the soft padding in the footbed and heel.  These two features give much better comfort and support to the foot, arch, and heel, thus keeping a lot of unneeded pressure off the knees and back when walking and standing--much more than other department store, flatbed or foam-cushioned, house slippers could ever offer. It is also nice to have available exact shoe sizes and the adjustable velcro top strap.  If these slippers were only about these features and at a better price, they definitely would deserve 5 stars!Price, though, brings these slippers down to 4 stars.  While these are better slippers than most house/lounge shoes, they do cost considerably more, and I don't think there is that much more comfort, style, or design that warrants the twice or triple price from other shoes available.The next star demerit is due to, since I'm not a sock person, especially in loungewear and walking around the house and never in warm weather months, I find the 2+ inch long embroidered name tag firmly sewn into the fabric of the footbed of both slippers VERY annoying against bare feet.  It would do Daniel Green much better to use a simple iconic logo in much smaller embroidery and without the irritating nylon tag.  Better yet, either on top or on the side of wrap-top of the slipper.  These aren't fashion statements anyway, so if the name has to be there, why not somewhere it is not so annoying to the actual comfort of the feet these shoes are suppose to provide. Socks do alleviate this annoyance, so if you're one that must wear, like to wear socks these shoes wouldn't be a problem for you in that area.  These do work nice on chilly/cold nights when you want to wear thicker socks as the strap does adjust well.
