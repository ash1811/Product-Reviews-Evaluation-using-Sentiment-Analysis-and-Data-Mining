These shoes are very comfortable and the style I wanted (in size 10.5) I usually wear thick socks so I didn't think the comments I had read about the shoes being boxy would be a problem. I was wrong - they're tight where your foot enters the shoe - big in the toe box and slightly loose in the heel. I put in the thinnest type of Dr. Schols and all is well.
