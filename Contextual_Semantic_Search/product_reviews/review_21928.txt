I wear these around the house and even to bed on my bare legs and I've found the yarn to be rough and scratchy.I'm 5' 2&#34; and I can pull them up a few inches over my knees and still keep them tucked into my slipper booties. The top elastic is a thin band that's sown directly onto the edge without a finished casing. IMO, the photo depiction is accurate.
