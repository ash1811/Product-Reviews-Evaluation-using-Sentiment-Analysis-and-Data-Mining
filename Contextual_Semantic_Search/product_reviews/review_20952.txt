We were scheduled to take a two-week vacation in a rainy area when I ordered these overshoes for my husband.  He had tried several waterproof low boots without liking any of them.  In desperation, I ordered these galoshes (as we called them when we were children).  He was pleased and planned to use them, but the trip was canceled, so we aren't sure if he will really enjoy stomping in puddles in these overshoes, but we are hopeful.
