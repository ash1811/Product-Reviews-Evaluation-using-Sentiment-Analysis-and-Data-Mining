For the person who is hoping for a dark blue or dark green gown, I have the dark blue gown, it was the very first one I bought about 10 years ago and also I have the dark green. Those are two of my favorites and since it is an old color, they are not likely to be reissued. I just thought I would let you know. Sorry.
