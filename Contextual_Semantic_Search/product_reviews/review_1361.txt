This is the 3rd pair of K-Swiss sneakers I have purchased, because I love them so much!!! I love the way they fit on my feet, and how they're so soft and cushiony inside. They are also a very light tennis shoe. My sister-in-law looked at them and thought they'd be really heavy, so I handed her one, and she couldn't believe how light it was!!!
