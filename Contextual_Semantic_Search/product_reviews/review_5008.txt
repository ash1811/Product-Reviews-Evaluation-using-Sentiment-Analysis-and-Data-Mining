I don't know what it is about the boxer brief, but it is definitely my favorite pair in the drawer. They are comfortable and move well with the body. They feel like they are somewhere between compression shorts and cotton boxer briefs, which I really like. Good for working out, hanging out, going to work in, or sleeping in.I accidentally ordered two pairs, but it ended up being ok.They are true to size.Highly recommend.
