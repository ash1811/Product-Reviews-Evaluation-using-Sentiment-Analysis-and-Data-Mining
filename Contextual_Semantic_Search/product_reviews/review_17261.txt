I have been buying this shoe for several years and ordered the same exact model number and it now has a steel shank.  It used to have plastic and be airport friendly, as I am a Pilot. It is made in China.  I bought a pair of Clarks that are much more comfortable.  This shoe is not bad and I do like the looks of it.
