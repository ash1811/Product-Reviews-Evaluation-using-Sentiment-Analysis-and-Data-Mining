Had them a while now, sturdy-I wear them almost daily, beautiful shiny silver w/ sparkly stones that haven't fallen out yet- what more could I want...oh yeah, a great price & easy but secure clasp, lightweight, and unlike others I've bought (even gold), they don't irritate or leave dark marks on my ears! I would definitely re-purchase if I ever needed to!
