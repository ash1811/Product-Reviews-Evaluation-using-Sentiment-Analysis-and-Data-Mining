The boots were delivered quickly and packaged nicely.  Depending on the manufacturer, I will wear a 14W or 15W.  I chose the 15W since I plan to use these for winter snow and will be wearing heavier socks.  They fit nicely, were comfortable out of the box, so much so, I ended up wearing them the rest of the day!  The other reviewers are correct, the leather is soft enough where no &#34;break in&#34; is needed.  They are light compared to other boots I own and more pliable for easy walking.  I am totally happy with these boots and can't wait for the first rainy day to test their water tightness.
