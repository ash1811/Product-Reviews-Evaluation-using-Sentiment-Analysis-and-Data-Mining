I'm writing this for my husband as he is the one that is wearing them, not me. I first had a review fur the first pair he had me order n that is because they aren't made in the US any more now in other locations. Therefore, the quality could be better n I just have to say you just have to hope the making of these sneakers n shoes will try harder to make them as best as possible!That's all I can relate.
