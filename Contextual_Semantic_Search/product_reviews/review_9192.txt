What you see is what you get.  It looks just as good when you get it.  I've had it two months now.  It does go with most pants and shirts.  It smells like leather, very nice.  It's not a formal belt but I use it for semi-formal situations where I just need to look good.  It is relatively narrow at 1 1/4 inches which is perfect.  Most belts are super wide and have a huge belt buckle these days.I don't know why people are complaining about the size of the belt.  My other belts' size relates to the belt length, not your waist size, so you have to order something bigger than your waist.  I have a 29 waist (size 29 pants) and ordered a 32 belt and I use the 2nd from the last belt hole, which is perfect.
