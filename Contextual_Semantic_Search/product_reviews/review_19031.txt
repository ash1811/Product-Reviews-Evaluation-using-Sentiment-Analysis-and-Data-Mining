I enjoy this watch for what it is, a cheaper watch that can be worn for yard work or swimming.  This watch face is very small, and the band width isn't quite 18mm so you can't really change the band out at any point.  I didn't realize how small this watch face was - but it feels and looks significantly smaller than my Timex Easy Reader
