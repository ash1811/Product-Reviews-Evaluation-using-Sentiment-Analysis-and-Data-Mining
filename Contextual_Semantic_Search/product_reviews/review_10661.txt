I liked the color, light weight material and flared legs but the crotch is too low so you have to pull them high up and tie the drawstring tight to keep them from slipping down. I ordered the talls (I am 5'9&#34;) because the regular length would be too short but they are way too long. It's too bad the fit is way off from a normal pair of pull on pants otherwise they would be just what I wanted.
