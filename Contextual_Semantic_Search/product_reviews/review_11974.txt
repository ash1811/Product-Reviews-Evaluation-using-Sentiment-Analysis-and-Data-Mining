I ordered these as a surprise for my hubby because his other Running Shoes are another brand and they are just so bland, too much white on them.  He likes to wear them with his jeans so these look stylish and you can't go wrong with Sketcher tennis shoes because they have a built in arch and since we both have to wear arch supports in all of our other shoes we can wear these without the arch supports because they are so comfortable!Hubby tried them on and loved them!  He said that he did not know that Sketcher made a Tennis Shoe for men and he wished he had found these years ago!  A pat on the back for a wife who know a Great shoe...Sketcher!!!  Now order your Hubby some!
