The anklet really is very beautiful and priced very well.  My only complaint is that the Swarovski crystals, which are NOT as sharp as the ones I incorporate into my hand made jewelry, dig into my ankle.  (I only wear jewelry that I do not have to take off, so the anklet is there all the time.)That said, I think in the summertime, this anklet is going to be gorgeous on my bare ankle.  Now, though, while I am wearing thick socks and boots, the anklet gets pressed into several parts of my ankle, and at the end of the day, my ankle is bruised.
