My wife has been through three of these watches. She loves the functions of the watch for work, but the bands keep breaking. So far, googling hasn't shown a source for replacing the watch bands.It shouldn't be too difficult. The watch body itself just pops right out of the rubbery band. Given the tremendous amount of bands that are breaking, I'm surprised that someone over in China hasn't started making a living from selling replacement bands. But even eBay doesn't have anything.I'm wondering if we can find a craftsman to fabricate an alternative?
