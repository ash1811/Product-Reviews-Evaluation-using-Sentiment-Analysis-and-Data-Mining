I was just looking for a business casual pair of shoes for work.  I have flat feet with a custom insole.  I like that I as able to take out the padding and insert my own insole and place the padding on top.The shoes look good,  they are a bit heavy on my feet.  Can't say I appreciate that much now but I'm sure I will when it gets cold out.All in all it was worth the purchase, they are pretty comfortable
