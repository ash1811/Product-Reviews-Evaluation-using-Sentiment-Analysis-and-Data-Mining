I don't know wear to begin. Thorlo socks fit great, are warm and provide support. They last forever probably because they are Made in the USA! I've never owned better socks and I own all the different weights these come in. By the way, I don't hike much anymore but go out of my way to buy these for work around the house and ranch. Even been known to wear them to bed on colder night!
