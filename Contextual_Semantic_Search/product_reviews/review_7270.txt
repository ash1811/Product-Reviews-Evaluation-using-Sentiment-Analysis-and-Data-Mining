The other reviewers are spot on when they say that the shoe is wide around the top.  It looks very gathered when the elastic is pulled tight enough to keep the shoe on.  My girl is a size 4 and the 5 would be a good fit.  The leather is nice, but the fit is poor.  I will pass on this one the next time we need shoes.
