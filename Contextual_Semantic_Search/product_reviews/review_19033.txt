For the price, I think I got a good deal with this product.  Only one thing worries me.  The band is very stiff out of the box and I can only hope that it will soften with use.  The watch runs well, but out of the box, the face does not glow in the dark even after being in the light for a half hour.  As you can guess, I haven't really used the watch yet but am hopeful that it runs as well as every other Timex I have owned.
