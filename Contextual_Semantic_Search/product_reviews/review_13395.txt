Love these glasses. They are advertised as rose colored lens; actual lens color is rose with slight brown tint. I purchased from Amazon (not 3rd party seller). Glasses arrived in original vendor packaging, with case, cleaning wipe, and official product certification.Several reviewers noted that some Ray-Bans are now made in China; this particular style was made in Italy. Overall very pleased with the purchase.
