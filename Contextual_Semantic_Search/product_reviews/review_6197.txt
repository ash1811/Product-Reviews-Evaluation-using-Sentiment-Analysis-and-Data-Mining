After reading other reviews on this shoe, I did go with a wide instead of a medium width.  My experience in the past with LifeStride shoes is that they do run narrow.  So, the wide width is a perfect medium for me.  These sandals are comfortable, nice looking and easy to put on and take off.  The soles are non-skid and they wipe off readily.  I would have given them a 5 star rating except that the width has to be adjusted up, which the average new customer would not know without reading the product reviews.
