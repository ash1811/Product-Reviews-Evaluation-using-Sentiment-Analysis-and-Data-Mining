I love this camisole, it is perfect to wear under sweaters during cold winter months. The straps don't slip at all, the neck line is low enough to wear under most clothing and the lengh is nice. I find many camisoles are too short, I want something that will tuck into my pants and keep me warm at the same time it isn't so long I have visilble line where it ends. Really comfortable and warm.
