Great pants, I own several pairs! The only Carhartts still made in the USA!I'm not in construction, I wear them as everyday pants.  They hold up great, last for years.  I also love that they don't shrink in the dryer.My only gripe is that the inseam is a tad too long, but that's how all Carhartt pants run for me so I'm used to it.
