~Great bucket hat. I like the texture and softness and it feels light and comfortable. It's great for fishing or for backpacking. The brim is narrow so it will not block a lot of sun, so if that's your goal, you need to go with a wider brim. If you are looking for style and comfort this is the right baby for you.Way to go Amazing-zon!!!~
