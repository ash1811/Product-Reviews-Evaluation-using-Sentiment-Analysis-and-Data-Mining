I'm 5' 6&#34; and 135 lbs. Size 6 fit best. I love the smoothness. I like the brand barely there for undies and their wireless bras. Just very comfy. I don't care if the bf thinks they look like granny panties - they're comfy and good under things that you don't want seam lines to show through and they fit under the bely button, which is comfiest for me.
