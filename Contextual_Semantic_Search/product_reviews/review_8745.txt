I got them as a gift for a family member who is a big Harry Potter fan.  I am a big fan also and now I want a set too!  They are nice looking.  I don't know how they fit because I got them for display only.  They look great and are a lot like what they use in the movies.  They are grea for a Harry Potter fan!
