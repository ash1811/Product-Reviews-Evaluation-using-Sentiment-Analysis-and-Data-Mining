I ruptured a disk several years ago and have worn sandals around the house (hardwood floors) since then.  I read the rave reviews on Birkenstock sandals, so decided to give them a try.  After wearing them for a couple of days, they actually caused my lower back to start hurting and pain down my right leg.  Stopped wearing them for a day and pain went away.  Returned for a refund.  The sole also has very little traction.  When sitting down in a chair and trying to push back, the sandals would slide before I would.  Ordered a pair of CROC sandals and they are way more comfortable.
