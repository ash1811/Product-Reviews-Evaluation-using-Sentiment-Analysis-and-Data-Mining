The Jockey Elance Bikini is closer to a low-waisted brief than what I think of when I hear the word "bikini". The leg openings are low and the back has full coverage. I think they're a nice compromise between a brief and a skimpy bikini.These panties are cool, comfortable, and long-wearing. They hold up well to machine washing. I should note the Elance line runs large on me. You may need to order one size smaller than you would for other brands.
