I should have gotten a size up for the band because it digs in to my skin and it's really hard to get all of the front latches hooked. I have a large chest so it's extra difficult. Once it's on though it does help my posture and minimizes my chest, but it's uncomfortable where it digs in. I would like it much more if I had gotten a bigger size but then I'm not sure how well the support would be. I think it has to be tight to be supportive and so the band doesn't flip up or slide alot.
