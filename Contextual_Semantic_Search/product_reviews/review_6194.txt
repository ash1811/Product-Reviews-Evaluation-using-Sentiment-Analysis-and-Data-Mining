It's been more than a year, and I haven't had a chance to try these out yet, but they certainly look well constructed and seem to do what they were designed to do. The one thing that might be helpful for people to know is that the instructions say to wear these on ice/snow only. Therein lies my problem. I wanted something for walking my dog in the neighborhood on those snowy winter days when some people haven't cleared their sidewalks, the snow melts, ice forms, and it's horrendous. The problem is that some people do completely clear their sidewalks and some don't. Also, the snow trucks clear a lot of the streets. So I might get out there, have them work in some places, and then ruin them when I walk on asphalt or concrete. Just a little FYI.
