Haven't purchased these in years, since my husband stopped working in construction and retired.  He's usually cold, so bought them for sleeping with his flannel pj pants.  Very soft, no label, wash nicely, but I have always purchased them a size larger than needed, and it works well still.  He loves them, and I do find them a little thinner than years ago, but perfect for under a shirt or sleeping.
