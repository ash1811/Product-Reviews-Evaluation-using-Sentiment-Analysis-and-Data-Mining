These slippers meet my needs very well. A previous pair of slippers I owned had a very gummy sole that didn't slip but picked up dirt like a magnet. When they got damp they would leave foot prints every where. These L.B. Evans have a flexible rubber sole that doesn't pick up everythig it touches. I'm very happy with them. They are well built.
