The 50/50 blend offers comfort and washes well.  My husband likes the soft feel of the material better than 100% cotton.  I ordered up one size from a L to XL.  He is 5'10" and likes being able to tuck the shirt into his pants. Unfortunately the shirt does have a tag, I would like it better tagless but unfortunately there is a tag thus I gave 4 stars rather than 5. Good purchase with excellent on time delivery!
