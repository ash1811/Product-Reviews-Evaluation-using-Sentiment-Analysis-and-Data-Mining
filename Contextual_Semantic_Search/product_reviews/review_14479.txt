I bought these for my brother for Christmas. He wears 8.5 W (US) so I bought the 42M (EU) and they fit perfectly. It is a little difficult ordering shoes in European sizes without trying them on, but the sizing scale was accurate. He loves them! They shipped fast and in an official Birkenstock shoe box.
