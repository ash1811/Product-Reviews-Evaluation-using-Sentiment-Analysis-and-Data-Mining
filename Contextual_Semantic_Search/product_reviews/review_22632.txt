When it has came down to Citizen, they definitely have made some excellent watches, time and time again. But nevertheless, there are some pieces that they have made that could have had a bit more to match. This Citizen Eco-Drive piece is alright. But it does display a mixture of both accents and numerals 4, 8, and 12 on the piece. It is alright but honestly it could have had a bit more in its features. It snugs very comfortably around the wrist and is easy to setup on the time. Yet, I did though wish there could have been a little more in its features including illuminated hands that glow in the dark, and a bit more in the feature of the face. Still, you do get a quality watch from Citizen Eco-Drive, but more could have been added here in this solar timepiece.Price: C+Comfort & Setup: C+Overall: C+
