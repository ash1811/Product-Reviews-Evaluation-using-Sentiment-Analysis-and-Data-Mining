When I got these shirts they fit great! After one washing in cold water and air - drying it turned into a different shirt. They got a lot shorter, up to my belt short and the neck got a lot bigger, showing lots of skin in the front and back. Yet some how they stayed wide. They are great if you want a disposable shirt.
