This watch replaces a much more expensive one that I wore for many years.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the watch looks good.  The second hand and light are nice.  The band had to be adjusted, and I had to take it to a watch repair shop for that.  In adjusting the band it is important to know that the the way the latch sits on the wrist requires the adjustment to be made differently on each side of the latch.  It took a few tries, but in my case, seven links on one side and five on the other make the watch sit correctly.
