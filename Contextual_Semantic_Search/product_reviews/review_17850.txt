First, this is a watch that is is good on features.Pros:Bombproof construction and watch band design.2 digital time zones, 1 analog face for 3 total time zone function.It is not too big or small and fits the wrist comfortably so it does not hang off and catch on things like other larger watches do.It has a basic alarm, chrono function, date feature.Cons:No "second" analog hand, I like accuracy in timing my watches down to the second even in analog mode.The analog minute hand gets in the way of the digital clock, chrono, date, and basic function.  The hour hand needs to be shorter / thinner or digital LCD screen lower to clear the hour hand.  Annoying Problem when dealing with accuracy of function features.Overall:  Ok watch, there are better ones out there with clearer features like the newer Casio Military all black versions for the same price.  They have good LCD screens and ease of use operation.The hour hands do not hold illum glow for night use on the analog hands although the function LCD screen illums fine (if not obstructed by the hour hand).
