This is a handy pouch designed to wear under your clothes to protect your valuables.  My advice is to leave valuables at home if possible when traveling overseas.  I did that and had no problems.  A friend had her iPhone stolen when it was set down on the table at a sidewalk cafe.  I wore this at the airport under my clothes.  Don't do that!!  I think I exposed some of my assets trying to remove it to get through security.  LOL!
