These aren't amazing jammers or anything, but they are pretty good and get the job done.My primary complaints are that the edges (knees and waist) have a crummy string in them, which makes it squeeze you a little tighter in a small area than I would like. You can see other people complaining about this in other reviews. It's definitely a bit tight above the knees and on the waist... but for the price, they do their job well.
