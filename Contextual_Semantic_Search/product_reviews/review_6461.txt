These are extremely comfortable and supportive. Since I am in Medical Records, I am on my feet less than half my shift, but these are great when I am walking all over the hospital. Although I wear them only at work, so they stay really white, they are already showing small signs of wear after only a couple of months of wearing them two or three days a week. But that's the case with pretty much everything you buy now; quality (but not cost) has gone down.
