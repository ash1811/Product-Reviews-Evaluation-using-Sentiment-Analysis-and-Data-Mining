I love these shoes for use in the Zumba class.  These shoes make the dance steps flow more easily.  Because of the high arch, the turns and slides are much easier to do.  I like my Capezios and would highly recommend them.  Others that I know in the class have paid almost twice as much for their shoes that are just like mine, except they are black.
