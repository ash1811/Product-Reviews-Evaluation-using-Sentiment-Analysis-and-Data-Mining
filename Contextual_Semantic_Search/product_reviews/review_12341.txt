Fashionable and sensible. You can wear these sandals and walk for a long time and not have your feet or back hurt. I wear a size 8 but the Mephisto 8 is huge, so I ended up getting the 7 (no half sizes in Mephisto, alas.) It takes a day or two to get used to the &#34;toe&#34; separator&#34; but once it's broken in, it's a great shoe. Easy to slip on and off. After having a couple of Mephisto styles, love the Helen and have in several colors. I wear these all summer long. Even if I start out in a dress-up shoe with high heel, I carry the Mephistos to change into. They are not too &#34;orthopedic&#34; looking and they are very comfortable. The shape of your actual foot&#34;molds&#34; to the sole, so after you wear them in, they are like custom made shoes.
