These shoes are quite the top of the line. I have a very small foot and cannot always find shoes for men. So...I buy women's sizes and they fit swell. The Skecher runing shoe is a great fit and it is made well. It looks strong and durable. You won't be sorry if you buy these...men you will not look sissy!
