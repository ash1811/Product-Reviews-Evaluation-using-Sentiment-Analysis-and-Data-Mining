I have a number of Pathfinder/Protrek watches from Casio.  The PAG 80 is an "ABC"(altitude/barometer/compass)watch with a solar battery.  Each "ABC" Casio has similar and different characteristics.  The solar battery is usually a plus.  The readout on this model is very good. It is one of Casio's largest Pathfinder models-this might be of concern--depending upon the size of your wrist. Once the  barometer/thermometer/altimeter are calibrated they give a acceptable degree of accuracy.  Casio does not claim that these are "highly precise" instruments.  The compass can also be calibrated for magnetic declination.I really like the size of the digits in the display.  They are very easy to read "at a glance". This is a great watch for the out-of-doors or for every day usage as well.
