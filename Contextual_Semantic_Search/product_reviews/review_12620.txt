Ordered these for my fianc&eacute;, who is a fencing instructor. He wears them often but claims they are not his favorite Adidas pants, says they are a little lightweight.. I think if you're not too picky or workout in extreme cold... they're just fine . The price is better than a lot of adidas pants so add to that they didn't shrink and the fabric is durable... they are MY favorite addias pants, even if he prefers the "firebird" line.
