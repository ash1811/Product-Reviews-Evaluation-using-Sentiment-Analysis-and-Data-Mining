The pants seem to be acceptably made (the label indicates it was made in Cambodia) - although slightly thinner material than I expected.  The color that I ordered (Blue Collar) is fine and is what I expected.  However, these pants are way too tight on the thighs - especially when sitting down, and it makes the length appear much shorter because of it.  I though about keeping them, but I cannot put up with the tightness at the thighs.  Also, the pockets seem to "bunch up" too much and you must often put your hands in your pockets to keep them down...a major fail, so I'm returning them and will try out the Levi's Men's 560 Comfort Fit Jean instead.
