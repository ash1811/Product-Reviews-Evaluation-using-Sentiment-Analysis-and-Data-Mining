I'm not thrilled with this shoe but it's fine for Zumba.  It leaves a lot of black marks on the floor, but I'm hoping that will stop with use.  I'm a size 9 and bought a 10 based on reviews and it's a bit too big so a 1/2 up would have been better.  Also, (sorry, this is hard to explain) the first time I slipped my heel into the untied left shoe, it pushed the padding that would be cupping the heel/achilles tendon down, within the fabric, and it folded in half.  I can't get it back up so there is a lumpy part at the back of my foot.  I already had danced in them so didn't feel I could return them plus I didn't feel like paying for return shipping so I'm keeping it, but caution others to make sure they hold the back of the shoe firmly, so the foam padding doesn't slide out of place.  I think I have to cut into the fabric to "massage" the padding back in place.  I would have purchased it somewhere else with free return shipping, but they were out of my size.
