Inseam is 78-80CM(30.5-31.5INCHES) and the waist is 84CM(33INCHES)So I choose 33*32.33inches fits me well and 32inches feel a little longer,(1inch longer), but it doesn't matter since it can be rolled up a little and still looks wonderful.I will reduce weight and try to fit 32*32 or 31*32 one year later. LOL.
