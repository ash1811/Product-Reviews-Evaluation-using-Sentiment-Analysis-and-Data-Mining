Nothing bad to say about these shoes. Fit was great, color was spot-on but what I thought would be a cool take on men's wear seemed dated to me. Perhaps it was the finish on the leather or the sole. Either way I sent them back. Hope to find something similar with a bit more pizazz. A gold heel or patent leather...
