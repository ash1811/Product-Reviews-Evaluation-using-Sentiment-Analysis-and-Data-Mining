Bought this to wear around the house and out for quick errands. Fits well enough and looks acceptable to leave the house for grocery store and such. The material, however, is not comfortable for me-it's a bit stiff and scratchy. Plan to launder with fabric softener to see if that improves it. Like the colors. For the price, it's worth having.
