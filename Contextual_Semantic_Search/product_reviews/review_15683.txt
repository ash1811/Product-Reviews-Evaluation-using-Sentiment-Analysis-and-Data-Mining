Really, if I had liked the color I probably woul have kept this bag.  It was kind of old barn red rather than the tomato I was expecting.  That's the problem with compute color.THe bag itself is very well made.  The fabric seems like it would be durable and easy to clean.  THe size is exactly what I wanted to carry a few essential when traveling or grocery shopping.  However,  I am one of the few who still use a Blackberry, and I was not satisfied with the overall fit.  The bag lost it's sleek line with my big phone in it.I did end up with a Baggallini, the Everyday bag.  Check it out on Amazon for the best price.
