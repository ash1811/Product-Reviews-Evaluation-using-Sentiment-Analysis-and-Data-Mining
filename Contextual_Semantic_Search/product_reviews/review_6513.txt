So these tights are tighter than most tights I own and when I take these off, they leave my legs feeling like they've been squeezed to death. My legs are not big (based on the size chart I am on the smaller end of the Small/Medium range) so I think this would be hard to fit larger legs. The waistband is rather tight as well, unlike my other tights. These make me look like I have love handles which I don't. I'll only be wearing these with black leotards since it really shows the lines and love handles when I wear light-colored leotards.
