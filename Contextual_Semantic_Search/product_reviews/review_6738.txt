I just opened this package of socks.  Goldtone Bermuda Combed Cotton socks. Three pair, sz 9-11, color demin.  I like the color, the fit and the feel of them.  I did not expect them to be any thicker than they are because I read the reviews that said not to expect that. I do find them to be a little thicker than the usual cotton socks of this type that I find in the stores.  Overall, first impressions are really good. Except:I am not happy that the socks are only 50% cotton, when I was specifically looking for socks with 80 to 99% cotton content.  The content is 50% cotton, 31% acrylic, 18% nylon, 1% spandex.  To me that reads half biodegradable and half not.  While that may feel good on my feet, it's not good for our planet and all the creatures on it.  I work hard to avoid buying plastic products. So it upsets me a bit that these socks were falsely advertised.  FYI - made in Mexico not the USA. You can buy socks made in the USA.(February 28, 2014). Update:  I contacted Amazon and They refunded my money.  I can also contact customer service to facilitate the purchase to make sure that they are cotton.  They also said that they would check into the problem. I hope they do!  So, so far, a five-star response from Amazon. I will check back to see if Any changes were made.
