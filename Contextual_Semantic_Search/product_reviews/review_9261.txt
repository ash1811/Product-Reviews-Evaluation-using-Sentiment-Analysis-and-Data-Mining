My cute Ballerina (my lovely wife)was complainig she needed new slippers.  Went looking on Amazon as I always do for what we need and want.  Found these Isotoner slippers which fit the bill and more importantly my wife's feet.  Gave them to her for her birthday and she was thrilled.  They are warm and fit well.  They are comfortable to wear accoding to my wife.  Would recommend them, as would my wife, to any "ballerina".
