I've worn Easy Spirit Traveltime in every color they make!  They always fit well and wear like no other shoes.  The only time I put on dress shoes and allow my feet to hurt is when I go to a dress event or out for the evening.  The rest of the time friends, family and coworkers just have to get used to me being comfy in my Easy Spirits!!  Now, many friends and family are wearing them too.
