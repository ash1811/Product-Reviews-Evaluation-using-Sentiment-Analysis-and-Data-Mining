Dockers is a good name associated with quality. These sure do not dissapoint. I had my last pair of these that I bought at a store for fifteen dollars more for a little over three years. They are still wearable but I do have a social job so I needed a new pair. These are great with a pair of jeans for going out or wearing with khakis or slacks for dressing up. They slide right on and the gel filled insole is very comfortable to walk around on for long periods of time. Most of my friends have bought them after seeing them on me. I will buy the Tan color in this style as well so I can have a pair to go with more clothing styles. For the price...the quality and style are top notch! WOULD RECOMMEND them for sure to anyone.
