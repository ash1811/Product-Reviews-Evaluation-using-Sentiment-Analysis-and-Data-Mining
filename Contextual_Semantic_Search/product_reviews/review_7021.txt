These socks are supposed to fit size 10-13.  However, I'm a size 13 and I don't really recommend buying these particular socks if you are a size 12 or 13.  They might be a little bit tight then.However, I do recommend Gold Toe socks, but I recommend buying the regular size 13 socks if you are a size 13.  I bought these smaller stretch socks because they were more more available at the time.Gold Toe socks hold up better than anything else I've ever worn.
