I ordered the woven blue plaid and I'm thrilled with it. It's over 6 feet long, very warm and very pretty. I would purchase from this company again and was surprised at the negative comments. My scarf is soft and looks expensive, Perhaps different colors have different textures/lengths, but the scarf I got was quite nice.
