Durable, well constructed strong material.  Great for heavy duty work.  Both my hubby and son wear these bibs and despite messy, heavy work, these bibs hold up well and protect their skin from the elements whether it is the weather or the job!  This is a must for my men, and each year or so they get new ones.
