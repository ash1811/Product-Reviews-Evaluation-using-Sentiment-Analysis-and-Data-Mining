After an experience with another bra from Amazon and based on other reviews, I decided to order TWO sizes above my usual ...42 C instead of 38 C.  It is still tight, although wearable.  Apart from sizing, I like the quality and support it gives.  Nice wide shoulder straps.  Also very pretty.  I got another one in black and will probably order more.
