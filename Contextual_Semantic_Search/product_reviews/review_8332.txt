While this was a good price and the build quality seemed great for the price, I returned this after a few days. When I got the watch the second hand was off, and it spaced up IN BETWEEN the second/minute marks on the right side of the watch, from 12 to 6. It was not bad from 6 to 9 and hardly at all from 9 to 12. Then, after a few days, it got worse all around and was not the same each pass. In fact, the second hand started to skip, and in some cases fall back a little.  it was VERY choppy and does not "sweep" but "clicks"  Unfortunately the clicking was so bad I could not keep. I would have expected more, but from now on will get better quality, and thus have to pay more. In o way did this compare to my Citizen and would not buy another Invicta. You would be wise to shop around, and Amazon is a great place. This watch looked great, and could have been great, but you will find other choices. In any case, I highly recommend Amazon and will always patronize this company .
