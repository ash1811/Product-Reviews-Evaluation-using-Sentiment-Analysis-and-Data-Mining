I made a Halloween costume, but it soon became apparent that the inside wasn't padded well enough... Ordered these pretty much last-minute, got them the day of the party, and I must say that they certainly did their job! I couldn't even tell I was wearing them, either. After the party, I ended up falling asleep with them on, and even then when I went to take them off the next day, it didn't hurt at all. It pulled just a tiny bit, like pulling off one of those cheap bandaids with really weak adhesive. Also, they hadn't come off at all during the night, and I toss and turn a lot when I sleep, so they seem to last well.I was wearing something with a little bit of padding, so I can't speak for how well they will do underneath something very thin, like whether or not the edges will show.
