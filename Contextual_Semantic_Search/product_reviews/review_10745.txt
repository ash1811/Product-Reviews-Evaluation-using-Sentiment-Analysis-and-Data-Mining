I've owned many pairs of Reef sandals.. these are comfortable to wear, but after a couple of months (I wore them every day), the clear plastic/rubber under the heel started to crack and fall apart.. also, the foam at the front (where your toes are) tends to wear down fairly quick.  As long as you know they only last 2-3 months with regular use, they're just fine.
