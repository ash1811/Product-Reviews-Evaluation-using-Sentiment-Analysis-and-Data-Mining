I have flat feet and consequently finding running shoes with adequate support with cushion is pretty hard. I bought a pair of Asics and added these insoles and VOILA fabulous .I had shoes that were like walking on clouds with the perfect amount of support for my feet. These also made the shoes last a LONG time when usually I burn through running shoes pretty fast because the support dies even though they still look great.  They are worth every penny.
