This is the fifth Buxton of this style I've owned. They are a grab and go item when running errands/shopping. Because I tote my own canvas and insulated shopping bags to the farmers' market and grocery stores, I no longer carry a hand bag/purse. The Buxton clutch is tossed into the shopping bag.As to layout, credit card slots are in perfect location, easy to see and access. I use the checkbook holder for folding money (the little that I carry). There's a zipper compartment for plenty of coin, spare key fob is attached inside, mirror is attached on flap, and there's room for cell phone, lipstick, kleenex, what have you.I have tried other higher end wallets which look good but can't touch the organizational ability of this clutch. I use it  without the easily removable strap.I would be hard pressed to find the quality and convenience at this price anywhere else. I've owned black, beige, brown, navy, and red, and they are all equally attractive (don't look cheesy).
