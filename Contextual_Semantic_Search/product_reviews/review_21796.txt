While too small to hold full size papers or pads, the bag easily fits a standard 6&#34; x 9&#34; steno pad and other folded papers. The small pockets on the front are just a little too short to comfortably hold pens, but you can get them in there at an angle and still velcro the pocket closed. Unlike some reviewers I had no trouble buckling the front strap, although it was tight, and I would prefer a velcro there too.  The strap does have a medal tip to help thread it through the buckle. Shoulder strap is adequate and plenty long enough to carry the bag over your shoulder. Nice military grade fabric and appears well stitched. Quite a nice little bag for the price.
