This is a great watch.  The Seiko Black Monster is legendary in the horology community.  This one has the metal bracelet, which I recommend.  You can get an aftermarket band if you want to change up the appearance, but the metal bracelet is the way this watch is meant to look.  Sure it will pull hairs at first, but that goes away after a few months.Watch seems to keep reasonable time.  When I first got it, it was running about 5 seconds/day fast.  Now it is keeping very accurate time.  I haven't set it for over a month and it's only off by 13 seconds.  Longest I've gone without it stopping is a day and a half (36ish hours).At first the crown was a little scratchy feeling when screwing it down.  It's smoothed out over time.  I find myself constantly checking the crown, but it is always screwed down all the way.This watch is a must-have if you are getting into watch collecting.  What's nice is that it is inexpensive enough to wear without worrying about it.  Still has classy looks even at it's bargain price.
