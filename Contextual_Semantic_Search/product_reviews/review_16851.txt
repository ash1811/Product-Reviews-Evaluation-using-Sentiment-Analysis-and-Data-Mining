I am always on the lookout for comfortable underwear that is not hideous. When I received these they appeared tiny, but they stretch a lot. The nice thing about them is that all the stretch that they give makes them super comfortable and they don't dig in anywhere. However, they are maybe not the best fabric to be wearing all day as they don't seem to breathe at all.
