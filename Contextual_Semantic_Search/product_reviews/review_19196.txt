I read reviews on this and I don't know how anyone could be unhappy. I ordered my chain on the 8th and got it on the 11th only 3 days later with free shipping. It was so fast and it looked really pretty in the picture, but when I opened the box my mouth dropped at out beautiful and shiny the chain was I was very happy with my purchase no complaints at all, and for the price the chain doesn't look cheap it looks very expensive! I hope this is a helpful review for others trying to decide on getting this sterling silver chain or not.
