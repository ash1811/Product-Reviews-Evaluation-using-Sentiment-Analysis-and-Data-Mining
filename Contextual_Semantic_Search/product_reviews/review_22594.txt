I've had this watch for maybe only a few weeks now, and I originally wanted to hold off on writing a review until I had it for quite a while longer, but I like the watch so much that I just have to write one right now. I'm a man with very small wrists and this watch looks great on my wrist. It's the perfect size for me and doesn't dominate my wrist in the slightest. It has large face numbers making the time very easy to read, along with a great day and date feature at the 3 o' clock position.I may have only had the watch for a few weeks, but I'm someone who never takes off their watch, and my hand frequently bumps into things but so far there aren't any scratches or scuffs on the case of the watch. The watch has been just as accurate at the day I set it, which is to be expected of quartz movements. The glow in the dark feature is nice as well, as it allows you to still be able to read the time in the darkness. It lasts for hours too, so you don't have to worry about it fading out on you. So far it's kept glowing throughout the entire night while I was sleeping, and shuts off when the morning sunlight begins peeking through the curtains. The eco-drive technology sounds great and was another reason I wanted to get the watch. I just like the idea of not having to worry about a watch battery, so far it's been great, but I suppose only time will tell just how reliable that feature will be. All in all it's a great simple, effective, and quality watch with a very reasonable price tag.
