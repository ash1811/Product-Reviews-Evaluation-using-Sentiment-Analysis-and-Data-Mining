These socks are a great buy! Well made, soft & comfortable. But I do agree that were a tiny bit thicker than anticipated. So, if what you are really seeking is a thin sock without any band at the top that might be binding to your circulation (because you are diabetic, or because you have thicker calves, or because you simply get hot feet...), then I suggest that you check out the other women's Gold Toe socks that I recently bought: Gold Toe Women's Casual Crew Sock. (The pictures look the same but these others of the same Gold Toe brand are much lighter weight and were terrific too!)
