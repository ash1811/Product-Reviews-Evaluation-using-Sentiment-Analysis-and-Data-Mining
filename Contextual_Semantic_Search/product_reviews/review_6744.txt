I am on a quest to find quality socks in blue.  After purchasing these, the quest continues.  I found them to be less stretchy and much heavier than what I find comfortable.  If you like an athletic sock, you will probably find these to be to your liking.  I don't like a super thin sock, but a really thick sock makes my shoes too tight.  In looking closely at the photos, it appears that the white might not be as heavy as these but I don't need more white socks.  Also, while they don't cut into my legs when they swell, they also are lacking in the elasticity that helps a sock cling to where you place it.  If you stretch them out, they stay out until laundered. At $14 for three pair, I wear them to sleep in when my feet are cold but I will not be buying any more.
