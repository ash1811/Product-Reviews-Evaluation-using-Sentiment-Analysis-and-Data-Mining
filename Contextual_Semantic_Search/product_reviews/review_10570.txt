These jeans are well made - just what I'd expect from Wrangler.  Out here in Oklahoma almost everybody wears jeans and Wranglers are popular.  I bought these and a similar pair of Wranglers (relaxed fit) to compare.  These are a little tighter in the waist than the relaxed fit ones, and perhaps a little less room in the seat, but they fit OK if you don't mind sucking in your gut to put them on.
