Bought these for my 15-year-old son for Valentine's Day.  He had been wanting some &#34;cool&#34; shades.  Read the reviews on the Original Wayfarer.  Saw some unhappy reviews.  Decided to go with the &#34;New Wayfarer.&#34;  Good decision.  They fit him perfectly.  Got the 55mm lens.  Would definitely buy again if he ends up losing these or stepping on them which is a high possibility with a teen.
