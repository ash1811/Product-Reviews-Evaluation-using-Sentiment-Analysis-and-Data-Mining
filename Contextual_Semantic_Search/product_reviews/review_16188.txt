My husband is a mechanic and goes through clothes pretty quickly...until Carhartt.  These sweatshirts stand the test of his profession as well as very frequent washings.  They are warm, have a great fit, and are easy for him to work in.  The first Carhartt sweatshirt we bought several years ago is still going strong while the other sweatshirts are full of holes, have broken zippers, or shrank too much.  They are pricey, but you get what you pay for.  Amazon has the best price especially coupled with the 20% coupon I received off apparel at the time!
