This is a two part review.FIRST: The Shirts are very good quality heavy duty work shirts.  Price for the shirts was good...... HOWEVERSECOND: SELLER "THE FASHION RACK"  OFFERS Very poor shipping timeline-arrived way after it should have, no communication from seller when I emailed prior to ordering to ask about size questions and EXCESSIVE SHIPPING FEES! Seller never contacted me about a delay in shipping.  Additionally, they shipped it all crammed into a too small package leaving all the shirts creased/wrinkled. NOT QUALITY SERVICE! I don't mind paying for shipping if it's packaged well and arrives in good presentable condition, but to over charge for Priority Mail service is inexcusable!This is a Christmas gift so if they do not fit I will be returning for FULL REFUND!When buying this product BEWARE OF SELLER.  I would recommend not buying if they don't take the time to respond to questions prior to purchase.SELLER UPDATE: I had seriously considered revising my recommendation on this seller since they compensated for their gross negligence by refunding shipping and crediting for part of the order.... however, upon reviewing their feedback as recent as December 2, 2011 to January 5 2012 they have not changed their bad habits of shipping poorly, sending damaged or wrong items and then either ignoring emails or overcompensating by giving credits.  So my original recommendation holds.... DO NOT BUY FROM THE FASHION RACK!  I recently ordered more of these shirts direct from Amazon and paid only $16.54 dollars and received FREE shipping to boot!Dickies Men's Long Sleeve Chambray Shirt
