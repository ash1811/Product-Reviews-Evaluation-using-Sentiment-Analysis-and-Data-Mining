Purchased the pink pant and the gray pant with red stripes.  The pink is really ugly.  I bought it because it was on sale for about 60% off.  The gray is less ugly but not particularly attractive.The material is not up to par with the adidas pants of a decade ago.  Then again, most things are not like they were a decade ago.Three stars for the downgrade on quality and the ugly color.Good pants, though, for lounging around the house and being lazy.UPDATE: October 2012: I do a regular wash and dry cycle on these pants.  I've worn them for a while, they are my go to loungers.  Sadly, they shrank in the wash -- lengthwise and widthwise along the waist and hips.  Size up if you get a good deal on this.  I'm taking off another star for the inferior fabric.  I still give it two stars because it's not the end of the world if you anticipate the pants shrinking and you get a good deal on them.
