I love love love these pants! I own several colors of this type of Dickies pants. I love the elastic band in the back, which gives it a bit of a stretch. But I also like that it has a drawstring to adjust the tightness at the waist. I own these pants in a x-small petite size, and the cut is perfect! The length is just right without the back part dragging on the floor (gross). And the cut is flattering. Unlike other brands, where my legs are still swimming in a size x-small. These have enough leg room, yet form nicely to my legs and butt without it being too loose or too tight. I also love the cargo pocket on the right thigh. It allows me to place heavier items if I don't feel like putting them in my scrub top pockets. The material is of good quality. I wash my scrubs after one use, every week, and I reckon these will last for a while. I can't say enough good things about these pants!
