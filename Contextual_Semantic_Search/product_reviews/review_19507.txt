I purchased these for my husband after he blew the heel off his other pair.He told me they broke in really nice over a weekend hiking trip. They are probably the most comfortable shoe he owns as he now wears them just to hit Lowe's! He waded through a bit of water and his feet stayed nice and dry. Highly recommended!
