This ferza al hagat, an Arab cotton coat, is wonderful for those living in extreme temperatures. The inside consists of durma wool extracts with pockets of mutton lined with a synthetic alagnia (a form of cordex). This is highly breathable and makes a fashion statement in any part of the world except Alaska.
