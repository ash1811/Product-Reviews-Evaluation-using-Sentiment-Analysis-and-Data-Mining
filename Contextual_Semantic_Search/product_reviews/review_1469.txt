My son is rough and tough, with an athletic build! We originally purchased his Carhart pants for hunting.  However, he wears them to school, in the snow and for all his outdoor activities. He started something, because a lot of boys are wearing them to school now.  No matter how much dirt he piles on, they aways come clean.
