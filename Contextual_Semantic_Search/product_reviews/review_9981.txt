These shirts are not as heavy as I like.  I have since purchased the Longtail T from Duluth. Now that is a T shirt of high quality.  The price is extremely high, but the quality is excellent and it has the weight that I wanted in a cotton T shirt.  For me, the Russell just didn't come up to that standard.  Not a poor quality, just too light for my taste.
