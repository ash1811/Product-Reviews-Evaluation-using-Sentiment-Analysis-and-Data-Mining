I usually wear a 7.5 in bracelet and this one fits fine.  I didn't want the crystals all the way around so they wouldn't dig into my arm at work.  This one works fine.  I don't care for this kind of clasp but it works.  My daughter was there when this arrived in the mail and has already claimed it for hers.
