UPDATE 5/2/14: After receiving additional colors I found that sleeve lengths vary by about 4 inches from shirt to shirt. But I like them so much I'm leaving the five star rating.Absolutely great sweatshirt. Not too heavy, and roomy for airflow in the summer. Great long sleeves. Love it. Just ordered other colors. Very happy with this shirt!!
