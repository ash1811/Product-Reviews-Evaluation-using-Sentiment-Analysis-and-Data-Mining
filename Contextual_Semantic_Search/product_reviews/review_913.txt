Hanes needs some better quality control these days. The color I ordered, &#34;barely there,&#34; is a very dark color. It is supposed to be so light and transparent that anyone can wear it and appear to have bare legs. Overall, Hanes is a good product and fits well, but it's a hassel to bother with returning things when they don't catch color problems like this.
