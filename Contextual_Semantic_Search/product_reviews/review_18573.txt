Hope this one lasts as long as my other Timex. That version lasted 8 years and I only paid $20. Nice features but I may have to get a more conventional wristband, if available. Reading the instructions really helped navigate thru the unique niceties. One can't really not like this watch for the price ad quality. Again, I hope this one lasts another 8 years.
