i've used these to walk across the brooklyn bridge during a snowstorm, and i felt like i slipped MORE wearing them.  i'm not sure if it's because i used them on snow instead of ice?  they also kept popping off my boot, so i was afraid i'd lose them.  the wire bits aren't sharp, which makes these safe to put on, but lousy grips!
