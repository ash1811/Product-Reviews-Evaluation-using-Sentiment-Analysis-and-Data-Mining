These shoes are so great, my daughter loves them.  They do not feel like cardboard like some others do.  I love the longer laces that allow you to actually tie the shoes tighter if needed.  Great price as well, so of the stores that sell them have such poor quality and they are pretty high priced.  Glad I looked on amazon.  This is the second pair I have ordered.
