Like thousands of other lifetime Levi fans, I got tired of low quality and high prices.  I got real tired of pulling my pants up.  When I read the Levis reviews here I knew it wasn't just me.So I said, it's time to try a pair of Lee jeans.  Today I tried them on.  They fit great.  No missing belt loops.  No flimsy fabric.  Then I road tested them.  I went out to the store and came home.  I didn't need to pull them up even once.  Hoo boy!I'm a believer now.  I'm going to buy more.  At close to half the price of Levis, I can afford it.
