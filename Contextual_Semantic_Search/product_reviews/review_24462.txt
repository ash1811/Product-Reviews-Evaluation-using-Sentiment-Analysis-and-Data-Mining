These are good sandals although I prefer the Reef Cushion Flip Flops (I recommend those instead!) These are also a bit snug and run small. I normally wear a 7.5 but ordered an 8 because I like my flip flops to be a little more roommy. However, even the 8 was snug. I suggest sizing up!Check out their Cushion Sandal instead!
