A not too busy version of a Citizen Chronograph. Yes it's Solar Powered, yes it's got dual time, yes Alarm, yes chronograph. It's also waterproof and has Perpetual Date. My new watch came with the date off so i had too re-set it. The problem is the Directions are out-dated for older Citizen watches, and had to go online to learn pulling the Crown All the way out, and hitting the A button is the way to get to Date settings, and rotating the Crown changes the date. It works perfectly, just make sure the directions for Set-up are correct. LOL
