I bought this for my 10 year old nephew who has recently gotten into camping.  This was the container for his gift of smaller camping items like a canteen, flashlight, etc...  After opening it, he put it over his shoulder immediatly and did not take it off.  He ended up wearing it home several hours later.  I think he would have liked the bag without the contents. This one was certainly a hit.
