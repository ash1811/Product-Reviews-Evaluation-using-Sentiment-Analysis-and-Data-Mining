What can I say, if your satisfied with how under armour works/feels you will not mind paying the higher price.  The design is such that you can pull down the mouth if you want.  Overall it fits very well.  Its also thin enough to fit in a very tiny pocket.  I did notice that when exhaling, my breath tended to vent up and not through the material.  This fogged up my sunglasses which may or may not be a problem for you.
