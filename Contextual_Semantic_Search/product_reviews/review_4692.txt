The waist of these pants is just a slight bit more snug compared to other 33&#34; waist jeans I have purchased.After my Grandpa lost a bunch of weight and his clothes started falling off him I bought him these, they fit fine just a little tight in the waist. A slight bit off on the measurement imo but good quality jeans and look good on a tall skinny guy.
