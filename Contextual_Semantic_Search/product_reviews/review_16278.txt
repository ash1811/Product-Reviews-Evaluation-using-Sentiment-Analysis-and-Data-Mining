I used this on a trip and it was comfortable under jeans or pants.  I used it to hold my passport, extra credit cards and cash to keep them "out of sight".  It did have a way too long waist strap which I easily cut and then melted the ends (used a match and it melts like plastic and then you squish - similar to what you might do with nylon rope) to make sure it didn't fray.  I recommend this for what it is.
