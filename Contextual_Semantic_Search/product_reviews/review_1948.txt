These earrings are just what I was looking for.  I am allergic to some gold, especially white gold, but I have been wearing these almost every day, and I have had no problem.  They are small, just the size I was looking for.  They are also sturdy.  The clasp is strong, and I don't worry about losing them when I wear them.  Thanks for the great product!
