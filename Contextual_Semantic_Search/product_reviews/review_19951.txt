Once I put on my first pair of Acorn slippers I knew I had found the perfect brand for comfort.Later, I found how durable they were, and now, after several years of use they are still my favorite slippers.I received this new pair and am happy to state they are still number one in my book.Acorn gives new meaning to the words, 'Comfort and Joy'! ~ The Boss
