I bought a smaller Rothco bag for carrying around my Kindle Fire 7 HD. It worked fantastic. So, when I saw this larger bag  for a super cheap price, I bought it. I am happy with the purchase. My only problem is the bag is so &#34;freeform&#34; nothing really sits well in it. Like a baby duffle bag or something. And the top is not super secure unless the bag is full. So I carry an old t-shirt inside of it which gives it some structure and gives the clasp something to close against.
