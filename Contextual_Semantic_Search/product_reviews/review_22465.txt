Well it fit right. I have narrow, tiny feet (size 5) and these fit me pretty good. I dont like chunky looking shoes as Im short (5 ft) and they make me look extra short. Nice slim shoes make my legs look longer and leaner and these do the job. Yes, the sole is a lil stiff but they are great nonetheless. I love them and have been wearing them quite a bit! The navy color is pretty sweet too. I wear them with shorts, jeans or even skater dresses or skirts! Anything really!
