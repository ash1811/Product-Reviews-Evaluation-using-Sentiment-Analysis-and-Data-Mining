This is my second pair of Linen/Oat Bluefish shoes in a year - unfortunately, I had that middle-age shoe size change that some of us go through and my feet jumped up a half-size. I ordered these shoes from two different retailers and found that the leather being used now is lighter in color - almost peach color and not the tan/light brown color from before. They are still the same shoe - VERY comfortable very Sperry and I figure that they will break in and darken up over time, but the shoes I received do NOT look like the picture you see online.
