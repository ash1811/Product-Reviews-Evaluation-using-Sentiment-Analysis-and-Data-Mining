I had purchased a pair of these a few years back and still wear them.  Decided it was time for a new pair and purchased other slip ons that were a bit cheaper and was NOT satisfied so I went back to these.  They arrived right on time and they are perfect.  This is a great shoe that is so comfortable and looks nice no matter what you are wearing.  I would not waste my time again by ordering different ones. Easy Spirit Traveltimes are the way to go!!
