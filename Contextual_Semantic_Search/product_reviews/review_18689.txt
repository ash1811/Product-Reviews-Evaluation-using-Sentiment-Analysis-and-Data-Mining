This watch is simple and has a classic style. It is really easy to read the time, it's accurate, and it has a great night light. The ticking sound is quiet and I don't really notice it too much. The only thing about the watch I don't like is the band. After a month, it started looking all nasty and cheap. It's a thin piece of leather and too soft for a watch band. The other timex I own has a much more durable and stiff leather strap that is thicker and has held up much much better.
