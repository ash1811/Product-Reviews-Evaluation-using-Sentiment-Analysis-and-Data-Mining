I knew when I ordered these that they may not be &#34;for me&#34;, since my feet are wider... but I gave it a shot anyway.  They were just too small and narrow.I could have ordered a size bigger to accomodate the width, but then I don't think they would fit as they should.I sent these back, but would still recommend to folks with thin/average feet.
