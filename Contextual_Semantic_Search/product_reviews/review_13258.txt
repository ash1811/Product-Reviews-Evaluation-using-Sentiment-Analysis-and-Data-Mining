Tried this bra on, even purchased one in a hurry, on sale, great comfort, perfect fit, I am a 36DD.Big problem with the straps, they do stay up, but I have to pull them all the way up, till they cannot go any further to get the support, and even that isn't enough....Great for maybe bigger shouldered women, and I am not small shouldered, but,  everyone is built differently..Would not purchase this again, just wearing this one till it "dies", with baggy sweatshirts...Still love my FV bras, and  (1) particular Maidenform, and  LOVE THAT BALI PASSION FOPR COMFORT
