Aside from these being the perfect mix of causual, comfort, and sporty, they are worthy of the pice tag (assuming it's not ATACS or Multicam). That being said, I'm 6 foot & 260. To help compare sizing, I wear Old Navy's classic kahkis to work in a size 38x34 (or 38x32), and these fit a tad snug at the waste but length is dead-on.I'll be buying one in each -minus the ATACS, and I already have them in my Multicam rig.NOTE: these are different than the &#34;combat bdu's&#34; (not like the combat 65/35 bdu's for sale by OpticsPlanet -which are more hardcore and pricey than I need). Just FYI
