I wear a men's 36x29. It's near impossible to find a good pair of jeans that fit right. These Lee jeans are too long. They state they're 29 inches in the inseam, but they're at least a 32. They make my already short legs look a lot shorter.The material isn't as think as other reviewers have stated. That seems to be common to most jeans these days.
