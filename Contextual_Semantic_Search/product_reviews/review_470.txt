I closely studied the strange sizing chart for this bra, and ordered a size 3 a few months ago.  This turned out to be too big, so I ordered a size 2.  The size 2 was way too small!  I am about a 38F; the 3 had too much room while the 2 didn't even fit around me.  This gap in sizing has me confused but maybe when I lose some weight I will decide to try this bra again.
