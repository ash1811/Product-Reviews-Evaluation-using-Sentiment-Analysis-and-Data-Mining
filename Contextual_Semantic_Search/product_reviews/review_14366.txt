Those Thigh-Highs are very tight and the ones that love them probably have very skinny legs. I'm 5'6 and weigh 130 lb. I wear size 27 in jeans and those cut my thighs in 2! I had wet them and loosen them by putting pillows in them to loosen them to wear them without them squeezing my legs! Other than that they look really cute! So ya not worth all this trouble..
