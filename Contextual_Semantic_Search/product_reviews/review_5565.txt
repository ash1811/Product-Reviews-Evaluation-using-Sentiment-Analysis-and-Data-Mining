i have owned several products by under armour and this was one product i never owned. i needed a pair i can wear under my uniform at work and for hunting. i bought a pair of these and they are extremely warm, very light weight and very comfortable. this is just another amazing product by under armour. keep up the good work. just a note: i wear a size 38 pants, the XXL size fits perfectly.
