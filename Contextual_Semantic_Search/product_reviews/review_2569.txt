You get the old red colored can that it used to come in. So -1 star for shipping old cans that don't match the listing photo (and the cap on mine was cracked). Otherwise, 4 stars for a product that worked as described. I sprayed it on a black outdoors jacket and it made it a slightly darker black, but it still looks good.
