I like a good old-fashioned slip. It seems that no one really wears slips anymore unless it's of the extreme-cinching Spanx variety (I use Spanx here like one may say Kleenex instead of Tissue).  I like these affordable and simple slips available from Dixie Belle.  It does run a bit big, I could have sized down but I am still happy. This slip is so comfortable, I could wear it on end.  The material is what you expect out of a slip in this price range but you can wash it a zillion times and it will still look great. Have you ever seen all the slips at a Goodwill or Salvation Army - we are talking same synthetic-last-forever-quality here.I love this slip so much I am tempted to go granny-chic and belt a cardigan around it for a night cap.  Lucky for society,  I am trapped in my house with sleeping children.Did I say multifunctional?  Not only do slips help your dress-attire lay properly they provide a stealth barrier between your expensive silk gown and stink skin.  I also prefer to slink around the house in a slip in the evening instead of some dodgy sweat pants.  Keeping it sophisticated & sexy on a budget.Sizing info - I wear a 36 bra btwn a B/C cup, it was slightly large.  I think I could have swung a 34 but I am comfortable in this.
