I have a go-to drug store brand of opaque black tights. But for navy tights, which I wear to work often in the Winter, I have to look elsewhere. I bought these HUE tights to replace an Anne Klein pair that lasted me all last winter. I think I might like these even better. I haven't gotten a snag yet (knock on wood!) and the control top means they don't slowly work their way down if I'm walking a lot. Occasionally you have to &#34;redistribute&#34; the fabric a little around your knees but these tights are not sheer masquerading as opaque. If you have curvier legs however, remember to size up if you want a totally opaque look. Based on the size chart I should be a size 2, but I ordered a 3 and they're perfect. Thanks to the control top, they're not going to be too big if you just go one size up. I highly recommend these.
