These are the basic waffle or &#34;grid&#34; type thermals and are not heavy weight or &#34;super duty&#34; by any means. If you are planning a trip across the arctic tundra then &#34;buck up&#34; and buy a more expensive type. If however you are like me and just need something a little extra during the winter months to wear under your work pants, then these are just fine indeed. Just don't throw them in the dryer and cook em down a dozen sizes especially if you're kinda tall as they wil shrink up to your elbows.
