I bought a pair for a Kauai and Maui trip last March.  I ended up wearing them everywhere for everything.  I tried them on in a shoe store so I got a perfect fit, which I highly recommend.  I wear a size 10 normally and I have wide feet.  These are 9 1/2 and fit me perfectly.  It is a little bit of effort to put them on and I normally don't cinch them down.  If I'm hiking or need them totally solid for hiking and the like, then I tighten them down.  They are very comfortable either way.  I stopped noticing them at all after a day or two.  Obviously they won't give ankle support, but for day hiking with a day pack they're perfect.  They were just right for Hawaii, which is so humid and muddy.  I was constantly hosing off my shoes.  Throw them in the washing machine and they look new again.  They like any kind of fresh or salt water activity and they are very durable and of course very protective of your toes.  I think they look very good, too.  I put them on over thin nylon socks and then directly into my fins for snorkeling, since my fins have a large foot bed.  Just put on your fins and take off your fins.  It is so convenient.The only complaint I have is that I did notice some foot odor, even though they are synthetic, after two weeks of daily use.  I think my feet are probably less stinky than most people, but given the constant humidity and wet environment in a closed toe shoe, I don't blame the shoes and it's not that bad of a problem.  You can just throw them in the washing machine when they start to smell, too.  I still wear my old super durable and comfortable Teva's for everyday stuff, but for anything else, short of backpacking, I put on my Keen H2's and forget about my feet.
