These socks are amazing.  I'm using them mostly as everyday socks in a colder environment, some hiking, walking and cycling too.  They breathe well, keep my feet warm and dry, and if you are wondering if you really need to spend so much on a pair of socks ... yes.  Not at all like the 3 packs of socks you get at the super stores.
