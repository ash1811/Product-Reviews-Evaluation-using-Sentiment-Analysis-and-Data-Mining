My wife bought these flip flops after receiving great reviews from others wearing them.  She has a wide foot and usually buys wide shoes.  Unfortunately, these were not wide enough.  If you have a regular width foot, they would be fine.  She loved the look and said the felt great other than not wide enough.  My daughter has a pair and loves them.
