I've had the watch for about a month.  I like the styling, though a mix of silver and gold would be better.  The watch is quite heavy, but that is not very noticeable during a busy day.  The bracelet and clasp are sturdy and the clasp does not pop open.The digital numbers are hard to read from about 20 after to about 20 'til because the minute hand is over the numbers.  This is worse when the hour hand is in the same area.  This doesn't prevent you from telling the time but can be annoying.I also own a Timex Ironman Triathlon watch with a plastic band.  I thought the button layout on this watch would be similar, but there is more difference than I expected.  The alarmon this watch is not as loud nor does it beep as frequently.Overall I am happy with the purchase and would do it again.
