This strap gets the job done, but the clasps come undone very easily for me.  And if I do get my bra on without the clasps coming undone, I usually have to do some super-secret-acrobatic trick maneuvers to move the strap to the position I would like it to be.  But honestly, a great solution for a common problem, to that I say &#34;Kudos!&#34;
