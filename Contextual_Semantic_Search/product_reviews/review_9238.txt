I love love love these slippers. My feet get really hot so I don't usually wear socks...even in Wisconsin winters. When I do get a chill I slip these on and they warm my feet just enough. They are comfortable and fit just right not too tight or loose. The bottoms are non-slippery and when I wear them outside the bottoms don't get ruins.
