These are attractive gold studs.  I personally would not want any larger size.  The posts are very thin and the backs are tiny.  I have a little trouble putting them on and worry how durable they will be.  I would not wear these overnight for concern about how they would hold up tossing and turning, but for work, they are pretty and did not bother my sensative ears.
