I am 5'10&#34; tall, about 175lbs and wear a size 12-14. Bra size is 34C. Got the 42 in this slip and while it's a little roomy all around, it works well under my summer weight dresses. Didn't want it to be tight on me, and the material is so light there are no visible wrinkles or bunches through the dress. Probably could have sized down a little, but wasn't worth the return shipping hassle. Hits right above my knee. Measurably improves the overall line of any dress I put on. Plus it's nice to have it to wear while doing hair and make up.
