I wore these around the house and yard, perhaps a couple of hours a day for the past three weeks.  Over the past week they required tightening - I assumed the straps were just stretching. Nope - they were separating from the side of the sole where they are attached. The inside of the straps is a soft, felt-like material. This is glued to the sides of the base. The felt (or whatever it is) is separating - part is still on the glue and part on the strap - but it's split up the middle. So the front 1/2" or so of each strap's front is no longer attached to the base. This happened to both sides of the left sandal and one side on the right sandal. I used hot-melt glue to repair them. Hopefully this works. If not, it's in the trash for these.The overall quality is good and the sandals are comfortable - I just wish the construction quality was better.
