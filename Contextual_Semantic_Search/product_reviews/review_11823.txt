The shoes look good, seem sturdy and are attractive, and at first I raved about how much less likely they might be to fall apart than Sperry Topsiders, which are softer, more pliable and flimsier.  But after wearing these shoes for a good month or so, they haven't loosened up any, and they squeak when I walk, no matter whether I wear them barefoot or with cotton or synthetic socks.  Nothing makes the squeaking stop unless maybe if I walk like a duck.  Maybe I just got the wrong size, I don't know, but I'm probably not going to buy another pair, I will go back to Topsiders.
