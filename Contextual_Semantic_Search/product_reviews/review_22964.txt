I got the black ones. These may be the most comfortable shoes Iv'e ever owned. Very nice to walk in. Aggressive tread design, never slip on the ice or in the mud. When clean these shoes look like dress shoes, though I wear them to clean carpets in. I'm mot sure if they are waterproof but they are water resistant for sure. M sock have never gotten wet when wearing these shoes. They clean up easily and nicely. Great shoes, if you spend a lot of time on your feet you won't be disappointed.
