I kept getting in trouble at Hogwarts because my tie was ratty and stained. Stupid teachers expect us to look nice at all times and my Charms work is somewhat lackadaisical, so I wasn't able to maintain my lovely tie in the manner to school standards. Also, there were a few late nights in the Slytherin dorm room that required certain people to be tied up... but I digress. This tie has kept me out of detention several times!!! Highly recommended. It is also VERY sturdy and stands up to bedpost abuse and teeth, should your victims try to gnaw themselves free. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
