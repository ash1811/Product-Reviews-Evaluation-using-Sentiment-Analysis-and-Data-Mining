It is tough to get a true idea of a watch's quality based on a photo, so I was counting on the Skagen reputation for practical, quality timepieces when I ordered this watch. It arrived today, and I couldn't be happier.I wanted an every-day watch that was feminine without being "girly." Something with style that wouldn't clash with my other jewelry. This watch is all of those things . . .The color is between bronze and copper, and this combined with the square face, rounded hands, tiny diamond accents and mother-of-pearl dial makes me think Art Deco. It's a lovely piece that seems to blend with my skintone. I'm planning on wearing this every day, but I can see how it would also work well for evening. It's one of those "blender" pieces that could coordinate with everything from funky/chunky to elegant and understated.The Skagen latch is initially a challenge -- it's a dual-clasp safety system that is very effective. Reference the enclosed instructions and you'll see it's quick and easy to adjust the band to fit your wrist perfectly -- no jeweler needed.Finally, Amazon's price for this watch is amazing -- around $60. Full retail is twice that.
