This bra that I purchased from Amazon fits great.  Thinking this is a great bra...let's go to a local store and buy a 2nd was an eye-opener.  They didn't seem to be the same bra in that they fit so wildly differently.  I am happy, however, with this Amazon bra--extremely happy because it actually fits!  It doesn't seem scratchy to me at all, and it looks nice.  I can't say how durable it is, but it laundered well and needs to be line dried, which is easy enough.  I got this bra in a 38DD, but wear a 38DDD in Olga and in Wacoal, and both bands there are a little too snug.  The Bali is very comfortable, and I can wear it on the last setting comfortably, giving the bra a potentially long 'life' since I can tighten it as it relaxes.  Really good bra.
