I have bought several pairs recently as Amazon knows but it seems everyone is skimping on the material! Might be fashionable--tighter fit! I prefer my woman in tighter clothing, but for me no. I remember Levi's still made in San Francisco costing @ retailer ~$4.25 @But, that said, dealing w/today--don't mind today's prices but I need to be comfortable for the money. Relaxed fit works for me--maybe not for you. I just wish they made a button-fly in relaxed fit--Awesome!
