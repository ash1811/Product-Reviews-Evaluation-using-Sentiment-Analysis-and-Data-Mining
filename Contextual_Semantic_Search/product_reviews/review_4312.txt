The sandal ordered felt very tight on the sides of the foot. I usually order 1/2 size bigger shoes and these were no exception. The length was just right, but there was pressure on the side, at the widest point of the foot. And I do not have a wide foot, any other shoes I have purchased (sandals, sneakers, dress shoes) had fit OK. Otherwise the sandal appeared very well made. I'm giving it 3 stars just because of the fit, quality is very good. I'm returning these and will see if if the same come in wide sizes.
