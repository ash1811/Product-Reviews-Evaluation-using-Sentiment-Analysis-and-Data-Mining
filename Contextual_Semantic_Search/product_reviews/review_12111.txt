This Dockers Shelter Oxford is true to size length and width, comfortable to wear, attractive leather upper, and great non-slip sole.The dark tan color is a little lighter than pictured, but still dark enough.  All around - a great shoe and great looking!  Wanted to buy it in black, but unfortunately, they didn't offer it in a wide width.
