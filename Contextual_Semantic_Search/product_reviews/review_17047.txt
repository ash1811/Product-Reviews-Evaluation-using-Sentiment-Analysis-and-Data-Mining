It is very cheap, so don't be disappointed when it breaks.  I read a review before I bought it, warning that it would break, so I bought 2.  The tip of my first one broke the first time I used it.  You may be better off paying a bit more and getting a better tool.  If you plan to use it once, this may be good enough.  If you like changing your bands often, look elsewhere.
