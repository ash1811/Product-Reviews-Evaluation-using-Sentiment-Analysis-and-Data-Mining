The watch itself is very nice and I'm pleased with the purchase. I was hoping for a matte/brushed finish steel body which the pictures suggest is the case. But the watch arrived and the case is polished stainless with a mirror finish. That's not ideal but it's still a nice watch that I'll wear regularly.I replaced the band immediately with a black leather strap which I think is much nicer: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024WC7S/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i04?ie=UTF8&psc;=1You'll also probably want a watch band replacement tool if you don't have one and want to do that job yourself: http://www.amazon.com/SE-Spring-Bar-Tool-5in/dp/B005ZEWGSA/ref=sr_1_1?s=watches&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1396286216&sr;=1-1&keywords;=watch+band+replacement+tool
