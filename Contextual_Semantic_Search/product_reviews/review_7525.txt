You can't you wrong if you purchase these earrings, they are just wonderful.  All the pairs have their own unique shape and are set in a very detailed prong setting.  The stones give a brilliant sparkle.  They are bigger than I expected and sit high on your ear.  Perfect size to let everyone see their beauty.I have to admit that the light blue topaz ones are my favorite of all.  They resemble a cut piece of ice with a hint of blue - just beautiful.Another plus is how the earrings are individually boxed.  You can actually give them out as five separate gifts.  If you do happen to purchase this earrings as a gift, I highly recommend that you get a set for yourself.
