Great for summer.  Comfortable  to wear around the house.  Difficult to find slippers for wide feet.  I am normally a 6.5W but ordered the 6.5WW and the slippers fit well.  There is not a lot of support since they are designed to be slippers.  I got these at a sale price and have not worn these slippers long enough to tell if they are worth the MSRP.
