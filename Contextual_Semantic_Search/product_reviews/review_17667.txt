I've been buying Reebok Club C shoes for about 10 years now. I switched which my regular tennis shoes wore out and I couldn't find a pair to replace them. I've never been sorry switching to this product line. Reebock is the only shoe I buy of this style. They last long, wear hard, support and give surpassing comfort if you have to wear them all day or at work. I don't own any other type of tennis shoe.
