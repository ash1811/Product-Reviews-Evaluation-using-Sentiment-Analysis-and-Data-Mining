Great tree. Medium i think barely fits my size 8 but works well to keep the shoe in its original shape. Keeps odors in check with the great smell of cedar and nicely dry. the handle makes it easy to remove. I will buy more especially at that price. Always good to have 2-3 to rotate through the dress shoes.
