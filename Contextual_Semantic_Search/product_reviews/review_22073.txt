These are absolutely the most comfortable and lightweight shoes I have ever worn.  I have these in several colors, and will continue to buy them.  The only thing that I would change is to make the white on the soles the same color as the rest of the shoe, but the only time that has prevented me from buying the shoe is when looking for black shoes to wear as part of a uniform.
