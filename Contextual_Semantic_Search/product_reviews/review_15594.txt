After my last two shirts by &#34;Russell&#34; &#34;pilled&#34; themselves to death, this shirt by Jerzees seems to be a solid sweatshirt, heavy and durable. That being said, the cuffs are loose with very little elastic and won't stay pushed up well. I'll keep on wearing it until I find a good sweatshirt (that doesn't &#34;pill&#34;) with proper cuffs.
