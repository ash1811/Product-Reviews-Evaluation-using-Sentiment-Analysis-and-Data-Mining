I BOUGHT THIS BRA FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO JUST HAD A BABY.  SHE SAYS THAT THIS IS THE BEST BRA EVER.  HAVING TO NURSE A NEWBORN EVERY 2 HRS IS NO PROBLEM WITH THIS BRA BECAUSE ITS VERY VERY COMFORTABLE SHE SAYS AND THAT ITS SOFT AND WASHES EASY. SHE SAYS ITS VERY COOL & LIGHT AND SHE CAN SLEEP WITH IT WITHOUT HURTING HER . SHE SAYS SHE DOSENT FEEL LIKE ITS SQUEEZING HER, AND THAT SHE JUST PULLS DOWN THE PART FOR EASY ACCESS TO FEED THE BABY. SO I AM ORDERING 4 MORE FROM THIS SELLER 2 IN BLK & 2 IN WHITE. SHE CAN'T WAIT TO WEAR THESE AS WELL, SHE ENDED UP THROWING THE OTHERS AWAY BECAUSE SHE WAS SOLD ON THESE. SHE DOES RECCONMEND THIS BRA TO OTHER NEW MOMS.  ALSO, THANKS TO ALL OF YOU WHO WROTE GREAT REVIEWS ABOUT THIS BRA, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HELPED ME BUY THESE FOR MY DAUGHTER.  ALSO , LETS GIVE A BIG HAND TO THIS SELLER FOR FAST SERVICE, AND HAVING PLENTY IN STOCK FOR COLOR AND SIZES, ITS HARD TO FIND THESE DAYS WHAT YOU WANT IN APPAREL BECAUSE OF DISCONTINUATIONS.  ONCE AGAIN, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU FROM MY DAUGHTER AND ME.
