I don't usually wear a narrow width, but had to exchange these for narrows after finding that my foot was swimming in the regular width.  Having said that, I am very satisfied with the shoes.  They are very comfortable for wearing around the house.  Everybody tells me I should not wear these &#34;birth control&#34; shoes elsewhere :-)  Great service from Amazon in the exchange process as always!
