We have 2 of these bags and have had them for about 3 years now.  They have survived several flights without much damage other than normal wear and tear from air travel -- Including checking them with baggage not gate checking the car seats. Overall, it gets the job done.  They are nicely padded as compared to other car seat travel bags.  The straps have some padding but the bag is still a bit awkward to wear as is to be expected.  One bag will hold both the infant seat and the car seat base (Graco Snug ride) OR a larger toddler forward facing car seat (we have Alpha Omega Elite seats).  There is also room to pack extra items like diapers or jackets in the car seat part which gives you extra storage.  The bag will accommodate the height and width of most seats but may not have a lot of extra space to spare on the sides of the bag. I think a tighter fit of the bag around the seat is actually better to reduce shifting of items and damage to the seat.  Works fine if you only have to transport one car seat.  If you have more than one seat to haul you will need to get a bag with wheels in addition to the back pack.  Happy travels.
