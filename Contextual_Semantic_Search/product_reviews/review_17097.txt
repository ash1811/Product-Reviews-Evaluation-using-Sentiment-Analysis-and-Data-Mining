The recipient of this T-shirt said it fits well and really likes it.  The pricing was good and the quality as well.  You can find less expensive brands but anyone that I know who uses Under Armor swears by it.  I decided to get myself 2 for the winter so I can wear it under long-sleeved shirts and sty arm without the bulk.
