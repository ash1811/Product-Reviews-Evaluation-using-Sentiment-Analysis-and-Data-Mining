I recently purchased a fairly expensive pair of dress shoes. Unfortunately, after wearing them twice, the soles on both shoes almost came completely off. I had purchased the shoes online for a discount and was unable to return them. I started researching different adhesives that might help me and discovered SHOE GOO. I was amazed at how well the material worked. I have worn those shoes many times since applying SHOE GOO and have had no more problems with the soles. Just be sure that when you apply the material you allow plenty of time for it to dry (24 hours is ideal). Highly recommended.
