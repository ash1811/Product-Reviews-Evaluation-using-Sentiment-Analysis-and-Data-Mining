My child needed a tote for preK that wasn't too heavy or big.  Hard to find one locally that suited me!  They were all ugly and not cheap or nice and expensive. This fit the bill and works well.  Can be washed and take the beating of a little kid. For the money you can't possibly be disappointed.  Set your expectations accordingly and you will be pleased.
