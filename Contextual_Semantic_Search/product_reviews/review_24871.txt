This wallet is exactly what I wanted.  I didn't want one that zipped around, or had zip pockets for cash.  This has a snap close where you put your paper/coin money, and seems very secure.  It has lots of slots for credit cards, and pockets inside for other items. There's also a place for your removable checkbook.  I chose the red one, which is a nice color, and the leather is really very nice.  Mundi is a good name, and I'm glad they're still around!
