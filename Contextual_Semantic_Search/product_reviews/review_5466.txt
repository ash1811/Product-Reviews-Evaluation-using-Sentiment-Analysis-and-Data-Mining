Just to get things started, I'm kind of an idiot when it comes to things like this. I kept trying to attach my old watch to the main, nylon-webbing portion of the watchband, not realizing that there's a little elastic portion that is properly sized to fit your watch onto. So I swore and raged and hated this watchband for about an hour, then put it down and forgot it for a day or two. Then I looked at some reviews of it here and -- lo and behold -- someone mentioned the elastic part that the watch affixes to. THIS IS CRITICAL FOR GETTING YOUR WATCH ONTO THE BAND.Okay, now on to the band itself. It's comfortable and easier to clean/sanitize than the leather band I was using. The leather band started to smell really sour after about a year or so. When this one started to get a little stinky (after about a month or two), I just dunked it into some rubbing alcohol and presto change-o, it didn't stink anymore. I sweat a lot onto my watch, so the option of cleaning the band properly without damaging it is really important to me.Also, this band molds to fit the size you set it at.  Not permanently, mind you, but it will return to the size you set it for, after a few days of setting it at that size.  In that respect, it's like a leather band.  It doesn't yank the hairs out of your arm like a metal band, and if it ever wore out, I wouldn't feel bad about replacing it cause it was so inexpensive. Also, the little bit of flexibility that the watch has on the elastic holder makes it less likely to snap off or break if I catch it on a backpack strap or anything like that.I'm not saying THIS band in particular is the one you should get. But this class of bands? Perfect solution to a very pragmatic guy like myself. You're not going to turn heads with your fashion sense, but you will have a reliable, comfortable, utilitarian watch band.
