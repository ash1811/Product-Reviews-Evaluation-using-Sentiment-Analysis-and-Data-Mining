These shoes are very comfortable and supportive...I hope Easy Spirit continues to make them !I put these on the very day they came, and my back has been feeling so much better. They are very niceShoes.I checked that they were &#34;somewhat small&#34; due to the fact that I have a pair of Easy Spirit tennis shoes that are size 8,So I ordered these shoes in the same size, but they are just a little snug. Bought a second pair last week in a 8 1/2,Seems to be a better size for me. I can wear them. Oth, but will definitely order the larger size next time.
