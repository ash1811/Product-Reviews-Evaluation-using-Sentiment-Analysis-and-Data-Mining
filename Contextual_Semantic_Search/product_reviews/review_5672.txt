I used this bag alot and was quite rough with it, eventually the stitching starting coming apart because I would carry heavy and sharp edge objects, (books mostly) and it would jump around a lot so I stressed the straps a lot. It's lasted me a long long time and will buy another one because it's so quintessential and the canvas is good quality.On another note for those men who are concerned about being notarized as a, &#34;dude who carries a &#34;man purse&#34; I say whooooo cares! It's not like it's colored pink for goodness sake!
