I don't know what was wrong on this page before, but I took the chance,  got what I expected, and it is great. Pretty, silky, feminine, and comfy to wear with my just-below-the-waist jeans and slacks. No panty-line because of the wide stretch lace band.After buying one to check it out, I came back and bought more.revised review 2/2/2013 - still love them. worth every penny. If you do not order the correct product or size, or especiall y do not have Amazon verified purchase by your review, why give bad ratings? Amazon accepts returns and will refund, credit, or replace, so I tend to think these are non-reviews from people who sell competing products.I have digestive disease. Waistline comfort is difficult to find for me, with a huge scar up beside my bellybutton - I buy V-waistlines and these wonderful scoops half pants. Along with yoga foldover waistline, they solve my comfort problems.
