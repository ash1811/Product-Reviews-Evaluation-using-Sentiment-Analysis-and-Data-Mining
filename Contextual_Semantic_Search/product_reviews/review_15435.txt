ive been wearibg these since i got them and i love them! they are roomy (wide feet) and warm and stay very clean and i can wash them if i want, the sole is not smooth so i dont slide anywhere i even wear them to the pool and store in the evning wheni dont care to take them off. i dont like to waer socks so these are also very nice and warm! PLUS the color is fab to me! like an old loved pair of jeans.
