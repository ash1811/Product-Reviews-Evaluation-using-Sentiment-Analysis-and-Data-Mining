I feel like a princess walking around the house in my GOLDEN SLIPPERS. They are soft and cushiony on my feet,they come is size WW which is what I needed for some house slip ons and is very hard to find. They are worth every penny.Ii am glad I ordered the GOLD. Now I imagine my grand daughters telling me I need to add GLITTER MOD PODGE to them!
