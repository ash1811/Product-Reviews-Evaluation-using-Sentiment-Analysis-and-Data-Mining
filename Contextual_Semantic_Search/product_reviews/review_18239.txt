I ordered these slippers for my brother for Christmas.  I ordered a size 11 in Black.  The slippers shipped super fast.  My brother likes them a lot.  They are warm, comfortable, and true to size.  He especially likes that he can wear them outside due to the rubber sole.  Great slippers for the man who likes to be comfortable, but likes his slippers durable.
