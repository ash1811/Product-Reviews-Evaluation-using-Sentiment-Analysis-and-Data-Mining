In my opinion, these were not cheap by any means and I expected them to last. I used the first pair to reduce slipping on a smooth surface shoe bottom that also made a funny noise when the foot's front hits the floor. This got rid of the sound but it also lasted maybe 3 weeks tops, during which I wore the shoe less than 7 times. I put the second pair right after and this pair lasted even less time, about 4 uses.When they stop working, it feels like you're about to slip in a different way. Needless to say, I was annoyed with the quality. I went to peel the rest of them off and saw the glue melted off. I used these last fall and never walked on any warm surfaces. It was gross and left my shoes with a sticky bottom, which then took forever to remove.
