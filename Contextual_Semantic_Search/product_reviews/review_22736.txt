I am a 5'8&#34; tall woman.  I clarify this because it fits me, lengthwise, just a couple of inches above my ankles.  If you are petite, I do not recommend this robe.  Sure, you could have it shortened, and that is a great option.  But, also, since it is unisex, the shoulders are broader than a woman's robe.  All of that said, I absolutely love this robe.  It is heavy and warm, just what I wanted for winter.  It is also beautiful.  I got the robe in blue and the colors are true to the picture.
