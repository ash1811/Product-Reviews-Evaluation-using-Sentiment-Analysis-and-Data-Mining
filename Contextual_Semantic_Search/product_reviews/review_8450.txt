To be fair, there's nothing really wrong with these slippers. However, I found the quality somewhat subpar. Looks and feels like any cheap pair you can get in Chinatown. For the price, I expected a little better. Looks better in the picture than in reality - very plain, and something that your grandma would wear. Definitely not for a younger person unless you like the frumpy look. My last annoyance was the comfort factor. Now, I'm the type of person who can overlook A LOT as long as it's comfortable. This is not all that comfy as the reviews lead one to believe. The foot bed is hard and inflexible. It also makes loud noises when worn on hard floors, so wearing it around the house can be annoying for others.  So, all in all, I'm going to trash these at the earliest opportunity and get something else.
