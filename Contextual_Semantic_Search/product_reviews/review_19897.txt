I agree with the last reviewer that said the quality of these Perspectives has gone down hill.  This will be my 3rd pair.  The last two have been the best shoes I have ever owned.  Comfortable, look good, and wear well.  This pair out of the box have problems.  They use more cuts of a lower quality leather resulting in more stitching than in the past (I compared the old and new).  The stitching is less accurate in the new pair. The toe stitching is quite off on the right shoe.  Not enough to return, but noticed if looked at closely.  And I had to scrape glue off of the toe of the newest pair.  Never had to do that before.  Time will tell if they hold up as well, but I am concerned.  I hope they take notice of the weak reviews and go back to making great shoes.
