Fit true to size. My husband was a sock wearer. All his socks were wearing out so I bought these because he is not a house-slipper type guy. He loves these! He puts them on everyday when he comes home from work. He says they are so comfortable he forgets he's wearing them! And they look nice enough to run out to the store, without changing! Love 'em!! Highly recommend~
