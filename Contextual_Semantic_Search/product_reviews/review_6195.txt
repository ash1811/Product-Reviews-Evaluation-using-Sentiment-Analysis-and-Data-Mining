I live in Jersey and we have just been hammered with 2 blizzards in less that a week.  I live on a steep hill and I have a dog that needs to go out.Now I would not run down the hill but I walk with confidence.  I am older and I fear falling.  With these shoe cleats I walk with my head high and not stiff.When you go shopping you must take them off; the slick metal will make you fall.What I do is I keep them on a pair of shoes that I can slip on and off easily.  They do not do well on hard floors, carpet is ok. So when I need them to go down the driveway I have them on, I slip them off in the car, I have another pair of plain shoes that I slip on. I go shopping and then when I reach home if there is still ice I slip the other shoes off and slip the cleats on.  It sounds like a lot of work but i would rather do that then fall and wind up in the hospital.These are fantastic.  I bought two pair thinking they would not last, well I was wrong. I never even opened the other pair.
