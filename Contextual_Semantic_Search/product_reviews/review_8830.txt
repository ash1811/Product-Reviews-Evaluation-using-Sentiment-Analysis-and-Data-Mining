For what it's worth this product is fine. I did find it a bit awkward at first given that it was the first time I have ever worn pettipants, but I quickly got accustomed to it. I like them for casual wear especially when a lady needs to be a bit more agile but yet keep things demure. Overall not a bad product. :-) I wish they came a bit shorter though.
