This is my fourth pair of these flip flops. My other pairs are still in great shape. I just saw that Amazon was having a sale and couldn't resist. My new pair feels a bit stiff next to my favorite worn pairs but I'm sure they will soften up. The amazing thing about Reefs is the arch in the footbed. I wish Reefs made shoes too!  And I love the thin straps. The black pairs look 'dressier' with the thin straps.
