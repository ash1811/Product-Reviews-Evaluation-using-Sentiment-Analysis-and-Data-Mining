I had hoped they would shrink a bit to take a lot of the loose out of them.  I like the fabric, configuration a lot.  The distance from crotch to top is to much for my style.  They pull way up like the trousers of the 1940s/50's.  Seems like half way up my chest. That could be re-engineered as well as the very roomy legs.  I'm stocky but not that stocky.  Maybe if I cook these babies in very hot water and bake dry in the dryer on high.Update 2 July, 2014:  Have to admit after working in the woods for over a month this fabric was fantastic for briars and thorny brush not to mention insect and minor snake confrontations.  I liked them enough to buy 3 more in a size that fits better.  They work perfect for brush, woods and jungle applications.  The pockets are fine and wish a way for a machete was there to attach to a leg. They should age very well.
