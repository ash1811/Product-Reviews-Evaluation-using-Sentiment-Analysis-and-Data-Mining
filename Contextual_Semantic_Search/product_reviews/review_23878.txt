I bought these for Christmas presents for a 24 year old guy, 16 year old guy and a 24 year old girl. They all had a screaming fit over them. It was their favorite gift. I got the girl red and the guys black. The girls are a little big even though I bought a smaller size than the guys, so you may want to research that problem. She wont let me send them back because she doesnt want to part with them. They look so cool and old school cool. I got them at least 40 dollars cheaper by getting them through Amazon and I even seen them 80 more dollars on some sites, so they are a bargain. They are packaged perfectly with cleaning rag and tags tucked in an awesome case. The guys case was black and the girls brown. Awesome gift for any age and you will be a hero for giving them.
