I provided the correct size and they sent me two pairs of Wrangler Jeans that had the correct size on the label. But the length was not even close! Now, I have to have them shortened at my expense.I'm really upset about this goof up. Who ever labeled these must be an idiot.My problem is that I'm unable to return the Jeans. I'm 86 yrs. old and no longer drive
