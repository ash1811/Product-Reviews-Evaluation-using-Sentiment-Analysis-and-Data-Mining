I have had this watch for five months and it is perfect for me. Very pretty. I am not very good with jewelry and if it is something expensive it has to fit perfectly and be comfortable and versatile enough stay on no matter what or where - shower, bed, sports. Everything. If I have to take anything off and on, I will lose it, guaranteed. So, this watch is great because the gold, silver and "diamond" facade dresses up or down and looks good with all of my other jewelry. The face is small and doesn't catch on anything. It has been in the shower, lake, pool, tennis court, gym and more with me. As another reviewer mentioned, the band of this watch runs big - I could have worn it on my ankle when it arrived. The jeweler took all of the removable links off. My wrist is smaller than average but not the world's smallest. The only function I would wish for would be a lighted face for nighttime viewing, but other than that, this watch is great and I was happy about the price I paid on Amazon.UPDATE: I have now had this watch for about 2 and a half years. Still has beautiful shine and just the right amount of glitter. As I stated before, I wear it all day, during sports, in the shower, etc. so it has had its share of abuse. I have changed out the battery once at a jewelry store. It still looks great. I notice the price has even gone down since I bought it. This watch has been a great value for me and I would buy another invicta if this one ever gives out.
