Alrighty,long story short,brother in law goes thru jeans FAST as he insists on buying cheapies and as a mechanic thats not a good idea.These are standing up longer than ANY other,alittle bit more in cost but I think they will do well,by now the others he bought would be shredded ripped or the like by now,other than light fading after laundry these are still thick and tough so would recommend these to people who do hard work on a daily basis.
