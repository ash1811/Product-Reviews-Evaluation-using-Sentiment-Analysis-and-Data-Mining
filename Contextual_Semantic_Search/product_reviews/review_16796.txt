This is an excellent work shirt. If you're looking for something study and tough, yet also good-looking and comfortable, this is it. I just got a second one because I love the first one so much.I have two notes. First, the shirt doesn't shrink noticeably; it stays true to size. With washing, it just gets more and more comfortable. So far, my first one has held up well for several months. I wear it most often as a quasi-jacket over a t-shirt when I do yard work (buttoned) or around town in cool weather (unbuttoned). It works great in both cases.Second, be careful on the sizing. I started with a Large but it was a little too large (I'm 5'9 and 160, for reference), but still wearable. Next time I ordered a Medium, but it was just a little bit too small. If you're around my size, then you may be on the fence. Get the Medium if you want it to fit like a dress shirt; or get the Large if you want it to be looser for things like doing outdoor work.  Similarly, if you're between two other sizes, go up for comfort or down for crisp look.
