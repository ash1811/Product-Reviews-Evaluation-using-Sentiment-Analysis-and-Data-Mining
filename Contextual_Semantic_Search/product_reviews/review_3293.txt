I am 5ft4, 125 lbs, and I bought a size small. I think it fits true to size. I like these bike shorts, but I don't love them, because the cotton doesn't really wick sweat away like a poly blend or sport fabric would have. I don't think it breathes very well either; I often feel too warm when I am wearing these. I still think these are good given the low price though.
