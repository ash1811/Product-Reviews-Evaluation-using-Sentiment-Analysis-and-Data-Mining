I have been wearing Reef's since 2004, specifically the Ginger style.  I ordered a new pair of black ones and they are too small.  I don't know why Reef changed the sizing, but I am unhappy.  I have several Ginger Reef flip flops all in size 5 and they fit perfectly... I think a size 6 would be too big, so I am not risking ordering them online.
