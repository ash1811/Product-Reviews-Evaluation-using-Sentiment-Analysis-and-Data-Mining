I have been a huge fan of FRYE for years. The quality is very clear in all of their products. These look and fit perfectly. Once you try on your first pair you will be hooked. The belted harness will feel like it was custom made for your foot. If you wear heavy socks go a half size up. I wear a 6.5 to a 7 in shoes. With these i went with 6.5 & it is a perfect fit. These are very nice shoes and are made to last. Spoil yourself and get these!!
