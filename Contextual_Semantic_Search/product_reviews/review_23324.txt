I have a lower priced sonic jewelry cleaner and have found this solution to work wonders on all my fine jewelry. My gold chain and small hoop earrings just gleam! This is the third bottle I have purchased and I highly recommend it. By the way, the directions call for using three capfuls of the solution added to water. I have found that two are plenty. I will buy this product again.
