These boots were hard for me to tighten enough without feeling like I was doing damage to the bones in the top of my foot, but was too loose if I didn't tighten that tight. Maybe I ordered a half size to large, but that was to account for feet swelling during hikes. Boots felt great on flat surface, but my feet move around too much on ascents/descents.
