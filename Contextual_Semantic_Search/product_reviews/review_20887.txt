Gives rounded shape, significant support. Smooth line, no bumpy frills. Center stays inward, lies flat--good separation.  (I don't care for the uni-breast look.)  The band is a little skimpy, so if you are at the edge, go up one band size.  The cups however fit with full coverage.  Hopefully will be softer after washed.
