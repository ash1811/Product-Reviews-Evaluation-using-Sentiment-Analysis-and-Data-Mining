These pants are huge and very baggy.  The hem is also large, almost like bell bottoms.  They are also not made very well with stray strings sticking out everywhere.  If you are looking for an extremely loose feeling pant with plenty of room, then these will work great for you.  As for me, I like my pants to have a nice cut to them that is flattering.  These are definitely made for big boy's that need some extra room.  I am 6'0 and weigh 185 and fall between a 34 or 36 depending on the make and cut.  I ordered the 36 and I think a 32 would have fit me better.
