If you are looking for the most comfortable and stable of all Birkenstock sandals, great in all kinds of weather and looks good with dressy or sporty clothes, this is the one to buy. Great price and a color that matches summer or winter colors- although a bit lighter than pictured. If you need the arch support to walk all day in comfort, don't hesitate to try Birkenstocks; this is one of many sandals I own and wouldn't trade for anything but maybe my Keens...
