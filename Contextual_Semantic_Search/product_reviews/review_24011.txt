It's made of FRP (Fiberglass-Reinforced Plastic). So, it's a plastic. Supposedly to be of better quality and stronger - but it seems it bends pretty easy.One made with metal would do better.The handle is kinda small and might be difficult to hold it when the wind blows.I would keep it if it was no more than $20.The good thing is that it's small and fits in my jacket's internal pocket.
