I wear a 36D bra and thought the size 38 would fit and perhaps even be too large.  I was very disappointed when I tried on one of the camisoles.  It was tight in the bra area and much too small in the lower skirt.  I am not going to send them back because of shipping costs; I will just give them to a charity.  I liked the fabric because I thought it would not cling to whatever I wore over it.  Frustrating!
