I've had these sandals before and then I lost them. So I bought another pair only to be disappointed that it comes smaller now. I usually wear an 8, so naturally I bought an 8. But when I tried it on, it was too small. I asked for the an exchange and Amazon immediately sent out a bigger size for me. I can't wait to get them now!
