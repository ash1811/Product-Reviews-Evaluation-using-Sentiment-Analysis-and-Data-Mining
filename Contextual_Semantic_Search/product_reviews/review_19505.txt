Their quality seems quite good.  I won't know how they do in snow or wet conditions until I wear them in those conditions. I also won't have an opinion on durability until I've had them for awhile.  I surely would rate them with 5 stars if they prove durable and waterproof. It took two days of wearing them for the uppermost section to become comfortable on my shins. They are so light and comfortable that I don't know I'm wearing them. I wear a size 10 and bought a size 10 and the sizing was accurate for me. Color-choice-wise I do wish that they were available in a solid brown color - I went with the black, and they are very black in color. At this point I would say that they were a very good choice, and over time I may decide that they were a most excellent choice.
