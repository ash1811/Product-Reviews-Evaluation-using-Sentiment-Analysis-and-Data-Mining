I bought this casio watch as a &#34;back-up&#34;, to one I still use.  The only thing that is a deterrent from wearing it everyday, is that in my job I tend to accumulate scratches on the dial face.  Not really anything one can do about that.  I like the casio because it is light, waterproof, and does the same amount of functions that the heavier and bulkier Casios that I have do.
