I have ordered pairs of these infant converse for both my son and my daughter when they were infants. I got so many compliments on them when I took the babies out wearing these shoes. They really made an outfit seem so stylish.The shoes are a very soft material that will be pleasing to your baby. The soles are soft material, as well.  I found that these shoes are really best for pre walkers or indoor use while walking, otherwise they get really filthy because the material of the soles is white canvas type material that really shows dirt. I have thrown them in the washing machine but they don't get all of the stains out from walking and can look really dirty, which detracts from the look of the shoe. So, I liked them best when I just used them on the babies before they hit the walking stage. I also don't think that the bottom of these shoes grips well enough for a walker. If you want a pair of converse for a walker then I recommend getting the hard rubber soled converse which will not show dirt as much, and which grip the ground well.

All in all, they are adorable shoes and the height of baby fashion, and they are comfortable as well. Get a pair and get ready for lots of compliments when your baby wears them!
