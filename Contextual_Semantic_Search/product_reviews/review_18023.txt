These shoes run small. I have an 8C (wide) foot, and I bought a 9C/D (wide) and they were so tight/small that my toes went numb within a few minutes. I worked with them for a full shift, of which I had to remove them several times to let the feeling back into my feet! No arch support at all. If you have narrow flat feet these will probably work for you. I'm sending these back.....I would give 0 stars but I had to give one....
