I bought these stockings because of the price.  They fit OK and the looks are not bad but they did not have that silky feel I was looking for when I bought them.  They seem to be sturdy enough so I don't have any thing bad to say about them just not the silky feel I wanted.The shipping was great I received them within the time I was supposed to and the package was in good shape.
