I ORDERED UP A HALF SIZE LIKE I NORMALLY WOULD WITH A FLAT.  THANKS TO OTHER REVIEWS, I DID NOT GET THE WIDE.  I HAVE A WIDE FOOT, BUT THE MEDIUM WAS FINE.  THEY ARE JUST AS I REMEMBERED WHEN I TOOK BALLET A CENTURY AGO. I PLAN TO WEAR THEM AS A HOUSE SHOE AND WHEN RUNNING QUICK ERRANDS. THE LEATHER IS THIN BUT THAT MADE THEM EASIER TO ADJUST.  NICE FOR THE PRICE.
