In the interest of helping others...I'm 5'6" and 134 lbs (yeah, I know...working on it!). I'm a true 32DD in most brands. My ribcage actually measures at 31.5".First things first: this bra is beautiful, sexy, not the least bit trashy and I have been waiting for it to get marked down (THANKS AMAZON!!!). I purchased it in the black and its lovely. It has a lovely lace overlay and the cups are unlined. The seam you see in the pix is comfortable and doesn't telegraph through to a t-shirt/tank top.  The cups give a nice rounded shape and come up high enough to not have any quad-boob or spillage after I bend over to pick up a wiggly toddler. The straps seem to do a nice job of supporting my 'girls' without cutting into my shoulders. The back has three hooks. The band is soft/not itchy and seems slightly small. I LOVE that the underwire doesn't come up too high. It hits at a very comfortable spot on the sides. For some reason, where the underwire meets in the front REALLY pinches. I really want this bra to work so I'm exchanging it for a 34D in hopes that its sister size will be a GO. Fingers crossed!UPDATE:Ordered the 34D. THe band was more comfortable (perhaps slightly loose?) but the cups gapped on the top. I must be fuller on the bottom.  It made the girls point down and out. Very sad, indeed. Sending it back. It is beautiful...though. Maybe for someone else with a different shape.
