I loved these to begin with, they fit extremely well and hold everything in place well.  After a few months of use they stretched out a ridiculous amount, now they do not hold everything in place at all - they might as well be boxers.  I recommend "Calvin Klein Men's Prostretch Trunk"  they are made of a thicker material that seems to be holding up much better than the "Calvin Klein Men's Micro Modal Trunk".
