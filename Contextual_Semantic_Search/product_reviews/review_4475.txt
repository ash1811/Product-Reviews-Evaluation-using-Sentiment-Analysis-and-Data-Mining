I've worn these shirts for decades and love them. The pocket flaps and collar don't get all rolled up and crappy looking after years of running them through the regular laundry cycle like a lot of cargo pant flaps do.They run large, I wear a XXL t-shirt and a regular XL in these. They are nice and long plus I look way less fat in them.
