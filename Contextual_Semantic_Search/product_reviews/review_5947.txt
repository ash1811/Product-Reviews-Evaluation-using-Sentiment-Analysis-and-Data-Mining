I am so pleased with this product. It is such a smooth fit and feels great. Does not ride up or pinch. This is so nice I'm going to order another one. The only down side to this is you can't wear a low neck top or the lace will show through just a little (like with a deep V-neck) but I don't have many of those. Keeps me warm when I wear under a top.
