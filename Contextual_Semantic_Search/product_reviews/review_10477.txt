I was a bit reluctant to buy jeans online like this, but I do know my size well and so I set out to look for it. Instead of shopping racks of depleted stock in clothing stores, visiting several clothing stores, and fighting the crowds - I shopped on Amazon and got these terrific Wrangler jeans! I was lucky too since they only had a few pair left in my size! I wish I had bought at least two pair. I'd do it again in a heartbeat and never will go without clothing due to my not liking to shop for clothes. Thanks Amazon!!!
