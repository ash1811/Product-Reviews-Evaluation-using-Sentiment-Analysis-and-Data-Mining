I have a 2 yr old and wanted a small backpack to use to lug around his sippy cup, snacks, sunblock, etc so that we arent lugging around his big diaper bag when it's not needed.  I thought this would be cute and my husband wouldn't mind carrying it and eventually maybe even my toddler could carry it.  Well, I didnt read the description well, or it didnt say that the straps were just webbing.  They are not padded at all, so they will be pretty uncomfortable once there is any kind of weight in the bag.  I love that this is a plain, black bag, and made by a trusty brand, but it may not work for us and I am probably sending it back.
