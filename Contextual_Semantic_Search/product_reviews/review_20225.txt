I love my fryes. I got them in dark brown they are lovely. I got my regular size which is sz 10. My feet are a little wide so they fit perfectly. I did not have to break them in they were ready to go from day one. The bottom is slippery at first so watch out. I am still giving them 5 stars because I love them so.
