You can get cheap wool caps here all over NYC but they tend to be the cheapest, in fact, of those manufactured in China or Bangla Desh or wherever...Kangol has done a better job of protecting their quality control no matter where these caps are made.Warm and comfy, generous fit ( in fact, make sure you are really getting exactly the right size, do not order something a little larger because these are true to size and not somewhat smaller as so many Chinese made items are)
