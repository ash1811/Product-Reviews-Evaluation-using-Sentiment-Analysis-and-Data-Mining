Love these boots.  Have this style in about 7 colors.  These are my favorite for work as the grey is a beautiful color and goes with my black work cargo pants.  I brush them clean when they get dusty and they still look good as new.  Very comfortable for all day on my feet and I have a high arch.  Good support.
