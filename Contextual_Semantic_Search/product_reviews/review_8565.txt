comfort and beauty sometimes don't go together but these panties are the best I have been using them for many years and they last a century, lol well I got some from Vanity Fair for 10 years and they haven't lost the elasticity on the waist and legs. Wash after wash they look the same. You will have to throw them out of boringness.
