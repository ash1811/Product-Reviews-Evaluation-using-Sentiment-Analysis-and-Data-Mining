I don't understand why there is so many sizing errors with shoes these days. I measured my foot, heel to toe and it's 11 inches. That means I should get a size 11 shoe, right? Well I ordered these in size 11 and when I FORCED them on, they were so tight I felt like the circulation of my foot would be cut off and my big toe was literally jammed into the end of the shoe. I've decided not to buy reeboks ever again.
