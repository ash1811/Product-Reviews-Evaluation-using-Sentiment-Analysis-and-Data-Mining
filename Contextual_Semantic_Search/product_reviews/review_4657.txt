My boyfriend wears this brand and swears by it.  He's a farmer & wears them out.  These hold up to his daily beatings.  I bought him 3 pairs for Christmas & my brother purchased him 2 more for Christmas also.  They are holding up well.  Amazon sells them at the cheapest price so he's going to purchase the jeans from here instead of going to the outlet stores or outdoor outfitters like he normally does.
