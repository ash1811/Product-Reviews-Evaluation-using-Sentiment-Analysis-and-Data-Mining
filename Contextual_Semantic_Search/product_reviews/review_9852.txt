they are not perfect but they are good for the money.  they fit nicely and are pretty sturdy.  they also have good construction, overall.  my only issue has to do with softness.  the material is not the most comfortable - it's not the type of soft i'm used to.  it's not a big issue and i still wear them but i just couldn't give it 5 stars because of this.
