I have always been a fan of the 501 fit, I wore them exclusively through high school.  Funny that doesn't even really date me, they are a classic.I was very pleased to see that the styling was slightly updated and this turned out to be an even better pair of jeans than I expected.The one downside I found was the button fly.  This didn't bother me soo much when I was younger but now I would much prefer a zipper to dealing with buttons.  Perhaps it is because I generally wear a belt now and it is very difficult to do the buttons up without undoing the belt and top button.
