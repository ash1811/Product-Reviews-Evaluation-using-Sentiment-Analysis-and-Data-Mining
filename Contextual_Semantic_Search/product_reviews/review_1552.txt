I tried buying tee shirts from the big makers, and they all arrived with thin fabric, even the ones that said thick fabric. Carhartt, on the other hand, makes tee shirts like they did 40 years ago, with nice thick fabric that you know will last for years. It's a relief to get a product that is made of really good material. Highly recommended.
