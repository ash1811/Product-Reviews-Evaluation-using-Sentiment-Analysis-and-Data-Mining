First, many here have written reviews, commenting about the size/fit.  I am an honest 36/37 waist (for Wrangler jeans, 36 fits me well, as a guide), and I ordered &#34;Size Large&#34;.  The pants fit very well, with just the proper amount of &#34;looseness&#34; at the waist.  The length appears to be equal to a 32&#34; length, and again the fit &#34;just right&#34;.The fabric is also &#34;just right&#34;, slightly heavier than, say &#34;Dockers Kahki's&#34;, but not as heavy as, say &#34;Wrangler blue jeans&#34;.  I also like the camo pattern, which is exactly as shown in the picture.  Can't say much more, except, I'm seriously considering ordering another pair, but may wait until I wash these several times.  If I see any changes after washing, I will update this review, but at this point, I couldn't be more pleased.
