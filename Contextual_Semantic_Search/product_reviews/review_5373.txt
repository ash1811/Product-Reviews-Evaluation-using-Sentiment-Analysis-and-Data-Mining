I received a lovely pendant necklace several years ago, and wear it everywhere, but my long hair always tangles in the chain and trying to get the hair out usually breaks the chain.  I average buying about 4 new chains a year.  Since purchasing this chain, my hair is not tangled nor ripped out by the links, clothing fiber doesn't catch on it, my pendant does not get stuck on the clasp-in short, this is the worlds most perfect chain!  I cannot tell you how happy I am with this purchase!
