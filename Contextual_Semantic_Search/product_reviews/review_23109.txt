These shades are great for cycling on a cloudy day. They are light, fit snugly, and give off an amber color so they do provide a little shading while protecting your eyes from the wind, especially on a cold day. My only complaint about the product is that these are actually quite big and I've got a large head but that is just me being picky. Aside from that, these are a good pair of affordable sunglasses that I would highly recommend.
