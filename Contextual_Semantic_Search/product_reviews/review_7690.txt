These were an experiment to contrast with the clip suspenders.  Glad I did.  While a belt is needed, I use a belt anyway to keep waistline from gaping.  Now, pants feel as if being held all around and not just at clip suspender attachment points. Tis good.  Well made, good material.  Only minor observation is that if belt is too loose, the rear clip slips away from belt - so tighten the belt a little - but not too much or you lose the comfort of not having a too tight belt in order to hold up heavy jeans.
