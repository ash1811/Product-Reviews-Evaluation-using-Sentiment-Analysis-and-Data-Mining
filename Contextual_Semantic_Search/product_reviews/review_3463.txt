Best bra I've ever bought. Been wearing this brand at least 9 yrs. Also have the spa closure but still like this one best. Bra brands can talk about how they lift & separate but they have nothing on Bali's Double Support. These are wirefree, but they do have a small stay on each side under the arm. Might try other bras but will wear these as long as they make them.
