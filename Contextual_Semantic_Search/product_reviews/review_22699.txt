This is a very pretty anklet. I purchased the 9 inch and it is a little snug but I think that is par for the size. the next size up seemed like it would be too big for me. The chain is silver, it's a little thinner then I thought it would be but not drastically thin, just dainty and feminine. It arrived somewhat fast and well packaged. I would recommend this item and seller.
