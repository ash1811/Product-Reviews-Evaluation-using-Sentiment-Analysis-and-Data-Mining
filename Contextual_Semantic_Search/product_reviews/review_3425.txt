I've worn the Bali Double Support bra since the early 1980s.  Certainly I've bought other brands, and I hadn't bought a Bali in a while.  I was disappointed to find that as I've aged and my body has changed, these bras no longer fit comfortably.  I found a replacement by Bali that is terrific (Comfort Revolution), and I returned this bra, so everything worked out fine.
