This watch is easy to read with an opalescent white face, bold black hands, and numerals in a pleasant font. It goes well with "the band" style watch bands which I prefer for comfort and performance. The indiglo electro luminescent backlight performs flawlessly but I rarely need to use it because the watch is still easy to read in dim light.  Setting the day of the week is a pain as one must move the time until the desired day is reached. Its honestly easier to just wait a few days until the day of the week on the watch is right then set the date and time.
