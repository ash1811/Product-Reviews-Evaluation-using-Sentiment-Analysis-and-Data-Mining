I use this on top of a disposable diaper to keep everything in.  This fits more snugly than the disposables at both the waist and the leg openings to help keep everything out of the pool even with active pool play (the disposables creep down when bouncing the baby in/out of the water while this stays put).  I like the 2-diaper system to make sure that the pool stays clean.
