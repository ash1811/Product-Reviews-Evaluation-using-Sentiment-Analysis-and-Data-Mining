This is my 2nd pair of these.  They are very comfortable and also very supportive.  You can't go wrong.  One caveat to remember is that if you wear ANY shoes frequently (I use these daily) you'd be wise to replace them every 6-9 months.  Why?  Even if they still look great they'll have broken down enough to no longer provide adequate support.  Your feet will thank you.
