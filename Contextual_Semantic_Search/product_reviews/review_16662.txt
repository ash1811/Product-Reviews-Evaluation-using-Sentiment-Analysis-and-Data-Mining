This robe is extremely short. So much so that it's not much of a cover-up. However, it is pretty, and the satin quilted hanger that it comes on is almost as exciting as the garment itself. I would have liked it to be longer. The chemise or babydoll fit me very strangely, and I will not be wearing it. I've worn the robe once or twice, but would get more use out of a longer one. However, it wasn't worth returning because it was so cheap that return shipping would eat up most of the refund.
