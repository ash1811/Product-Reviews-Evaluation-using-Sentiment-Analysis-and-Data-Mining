This is a nice watch at a good price. It has nice details such as being able to set the date separate from the time and the indiglo background. Like all watches for me, way too big of a wrist band. It might fit a man or a lreally large female. I had to take out at least 4-5 links. Not hard to do with $3 tool I bought to do so. My last timex daily watch lasted nearly 20 years!
