I have owned several expensive watches, including a Rolex. They were all fine watches and good timepieces, but for the last 15 years I have been wearing my favorite, almost all the time -- one of the early Seiko Kinetics. Seiko was justifiably proud of that technology development. About five years ago, the capacitor (energy storage) would no longer hold a charge. It cost me about $100 to get a certified watchmaker to replace that part. He additionally replaced seals, cleaned, and added a little lube -- a tune-up, and I've been wearing this watch since. I doubt it gains or loses ten seconds a year -- it's that good. It's still that good -- but I wanted a new watch anyway. I would not have dreamed of picking up anything but another Seiko kinetic after my experience with the first one. It's a sturdy watch without being too gaudy. The company has added refinements you can read about in the product description, but what really attracted me to this one, in addition to Amazon's price, was the fact that it is a perpetual. No need to change the date until the year 2100.  I like that the date is large enough for my aging eyes, and I like that I get a year, month, and time of day indication as well.  I do not dive nor race cars, so Seiko added a couple of little dials someone like me can find useful. Good trick.Great company, good product, and as always I'm very grateful to Amazon for making it available.
