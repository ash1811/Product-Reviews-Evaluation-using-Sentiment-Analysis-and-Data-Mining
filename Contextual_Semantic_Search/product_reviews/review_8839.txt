Really pleased with the fit! Fitted through the bodice with a sturdy lace fabric! My husband thought it was very sexy style. You would want a housecoat with it , it fairly low cut. It's a nice quality nylon that will hold up well as long as you wash with delicate cycle on washing machine! I like Woolite for my nightgowns. So hard to find the ballet style gowns anymore. I love them! Thank You Amazon!
