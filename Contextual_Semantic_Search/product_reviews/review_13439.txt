I went through three wallets similar in style while transitioning to a front pocket wallet. Quality is high.  This is very flexible in the amount of stuff you carry. I will have some weeks where I carry a significant quantity of cash and others where I carry little to none.  I have a few cards I keep in the center pocket and I have no issues with them sliding out.If I had to complain, it would be that my license doesn't sit all the way down in the pocket. It stays securely and it's a nitpick.
