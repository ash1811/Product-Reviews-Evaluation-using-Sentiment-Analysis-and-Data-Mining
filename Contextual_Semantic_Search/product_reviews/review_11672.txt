While I have owned a few pair of Minnitonka moc's over the years I knew the product would be comfortable, and they are.The style of the Thunderbird is great for casual wear and look good with shorts or jeans. There is very little, if any support in this style so be aware of that if you are looking for a walking shoe.My one disappointment was a flaw in one of the shoe. The threading around the top was seperated and with very little effort would have destroyed the entire shoe. I had to send them back. Don't let that be a negative because the shoe itself is well worth the price.
