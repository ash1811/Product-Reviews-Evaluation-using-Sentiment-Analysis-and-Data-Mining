Like the title says this is my second Credit Card holder after my 1st one finally gave up after 5 years of use, actually it was the stitching that came apart not the leather and for the price I don't think 5 years of service is bad for the use I got out of it.  Nice supple leather and enough room for about 10 to 15 credit card or store cards.
