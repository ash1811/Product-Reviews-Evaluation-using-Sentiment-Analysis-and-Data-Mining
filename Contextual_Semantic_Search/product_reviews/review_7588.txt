nice neck chain for the price. I bought a longer length and love the dark color so my husband can hide it (and his cross) under his shirt at work. He never has to take it off. It doesn't show any sign of wear and someone at the beach yesterday asked where he got the chain. Don't expect a big chunky chain. If you are looking for something flashy, this isn't the one for you. This piece is thinner and lays perfectly next to an open collar shirt or under a t-shirt without irritating his skin.The quality of the silver cord is good and sturdy so I don't worry about him catching it on something and having it break.I'm very satisfied and he loves it!
