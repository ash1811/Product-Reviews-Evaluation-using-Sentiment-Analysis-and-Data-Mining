I bought this for Zumba and it is not as supportive as I was hoping for. When it came, the tag said &#34;low impact&#34;. I was expecting something that would prevent bouncing. It is comfortable and I will use it for biking so it's not a complete loss. Just not good for Zumba so the search continues....
