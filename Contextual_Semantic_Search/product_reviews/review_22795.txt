I haven't been a fan of flip flops since 2003 when I wore some on vacation and developed plantar fasciatis and suffered with it for 4 yrs.  My feet are finally better, but I haven't found flip flops that feel comfortable enough to wear for extended periods.  These are great.  Some features I love:  soft feeling of the foot bed, a decent amount of arch support, thong that doesn't rub toes, the cute strappy style.  I imagine they will become even more comfortable with time as my foot molds to the shoe.  They come in a huge variety of colors, and priced at $15 to $20, they are definitely worth it.  I may invest in a few more colors.
