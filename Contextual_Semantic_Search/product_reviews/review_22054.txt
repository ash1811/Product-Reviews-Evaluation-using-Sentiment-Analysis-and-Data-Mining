I've had several pairs of these before and the size 5's are exactly perfect for me.  They are so comfortable and when only size 5 1/2's have been available, I've bought them and that little bit of difference just makes them too long, so I'm always glad to find a place that still sells size 5's because many stores do not.  I'll be back for more!
