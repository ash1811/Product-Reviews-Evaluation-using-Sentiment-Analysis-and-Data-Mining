If you have wide hips with any fat on them, avoid this panty. I am 5' and ~120 and ordered the medium fit. They fit comfortably enough and the fabric was nice, but the string part of the bikini cut my hips into quardants. This is not something I could wear under a slinky dress because it would show. Badly.Oh well. I guess I have a new pair of period pants.
