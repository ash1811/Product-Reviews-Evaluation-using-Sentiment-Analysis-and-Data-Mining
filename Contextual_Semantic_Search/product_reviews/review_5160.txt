This watch has it all. It has actual numbers on the dial as opposed to dots or lines, a date square indicating day of the month, a second hand, and an Indiglo light to see it at night. I like that it is two toned since it goes with gold and silver jewelry. It is an inexpensive watch that looks really nice. The Indigo eventually goes out after a few years but still a good value!
