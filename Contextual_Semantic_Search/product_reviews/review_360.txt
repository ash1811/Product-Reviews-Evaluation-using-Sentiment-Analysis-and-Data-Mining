I had been wearing converse for years I had them in every single color but never an all white pair lol so I ordered them and they just look amazing with anything u wear I usually wear a 5.5 in boys I ordered a 4.5 in men's they fit a little big so for next time I'll ordered a size 4.0 overall I live them shipping only took 2 days I would recommend.
