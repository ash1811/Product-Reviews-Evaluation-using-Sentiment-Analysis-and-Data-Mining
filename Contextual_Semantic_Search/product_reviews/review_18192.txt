Got it as present for my daughter, and she is happy with them, wears them often and also asked to go to school with them, which didn't happen but it means she is comfortable with them, she says they are comfy and warm.The sole looks well built to me, and the sherling fluff adequate. In conclusion, they are a correct pair of slippers, you shoud enjoy them.
