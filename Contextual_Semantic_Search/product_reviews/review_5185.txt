i work with preschoolers, and i was looking for a watch that's durable and waterproof/resistant.  i found this watch at target and loved it.  this watch has been through a lot of wear this year.  from kids tugging on it with all their might to constant hand-washing and to swimming in the bay, this watch has surpassed my test.  i brought this traveling with me and i really liked the duo-time function and three alarm settings which was good as morning and medication reminders.  the date is always visible which is perfect for a person like me who's always asking, "what's today's date?" and the light function was handy in the dark (my kids loved pressing on the button to see the green light during nap time).  i'm not a gadget person, but i really appreciated all the simple day-day functions that's easy to use.  for those who are into sports, there's a timer and many other useful functions.  only the printing on the face is fading, but everything still works after a year of use (i.e. battery, buttons, light, listed functions).  i highly recommend this watch!
