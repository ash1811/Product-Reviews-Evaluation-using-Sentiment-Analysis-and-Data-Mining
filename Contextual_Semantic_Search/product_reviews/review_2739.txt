There is really nothing I can say that hasn't already been said.  I could NOT believe how user friendly the watch is. Setting the time was a jif! I didn't even have to read the instructions.  Yes, I am female and purchased this watch for myself.  I will be using it for day hikes, mountaineering, rollerblading and general fitness.  My boyfriend loved it so much, I will be buying one for him too.  Fantastic watch!
