Bought these for my husband and he loves them.  Wears them for work as well as his long walks.  He says they're like a foot massage, and he's right.  I've been wearing them for over 15 years for tennis and all of my work-out activities.  I wouldn't wear another brand.  He's a size 10 shoe and the L fits him right.  He says his other socks tend to be too tight in the ankle/leg but these retain their comfortable elasticity (yet never slip down) no matter how many washings.
