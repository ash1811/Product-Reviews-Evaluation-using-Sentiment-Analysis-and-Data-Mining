PROS: Slip on design, great arch support, good price.CONS: None, other than hard to find.  They were sold out on zappos.comThese slip on shoes are great for traveling, easy on and off at security.  They provide excellent arch support.  My husband was previously starting to get plantar fasciitis, so good arch support was important.
