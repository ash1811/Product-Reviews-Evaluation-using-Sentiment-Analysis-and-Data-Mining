6 nights in Jamaica, 2 nights in Miami, traveling from Southern California.  5 total flights and no major signs of wear and tear.  I stuffed in a Recaro child seat, and it BARELY fit.  Since car seats are free to check in, make use of all the extra room and stuff it tight so your other bags aren't overweight.  It's been mentioned before, but you WILL look like a fool if you try to carry this thing on your back, not to mention how many people you will know over every time you turn.
