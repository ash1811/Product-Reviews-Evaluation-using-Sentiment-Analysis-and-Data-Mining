Bought these to fit a new pair of nice leather oxfords. They fit true to size without any problem, came with minimal packing just as I like it. Wonderful new cedar smell upon opening the box. Construction seems adequate, and the wood was finished so that it had no rough spots. Fit instantly in the shoes, no effort required for entry or exit. If you are serious about keeping your shoes nice, trees are a necessity.
