Bought this coat for my husband for Christmas & he loved it.  However I bought the medium & he did need the large.  Once we got the large it fit perfectly.  It's extremely cold outside where we live but not when you have this coat on.  I'm even jealous that he has such a fantastic coat that will last him for decades to come.  Best purchase for him in a long time.
