I was happy to see this style of gown that is almost impossible to find in a store.  I had several that were identical to this made by Vanity Fair years ago.  They were the best gowns ever.  This one by Shadowline is a close second.  It's comfortable and lasts a few years before fading.  I have the sapphire color which is not see-through.  The lighter colors are see-through.  It's made in Mexico.
