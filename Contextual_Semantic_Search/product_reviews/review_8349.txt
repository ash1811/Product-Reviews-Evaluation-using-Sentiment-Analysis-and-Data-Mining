First when I got it (really quickly by the way) I couldn't figure out how to wear it...the wires for the underwire were on the outside of the bra?  Huh?  Yeah, super weird...plus the sizing was totally wrong.  I had to go to a store and buy one, this just didn't do it at all.  Gave it to a friend, maybe they can use it!
