This has been my favorite bra for years.  However, over the past couple of years, Playtex has made the straps longer than ever.  I have wide/big shoulders, and I still have to make the straps as tight as they will go.  I really need the straps to be even a little shorter than that.  Plus, they seem to "untighten" when putting on the bra.  Other than that, the support is much better than any other bra I have tried.
