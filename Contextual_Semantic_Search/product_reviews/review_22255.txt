But, they still look okay...fawn looks mossey actually.  And Fusion Apparel delivered me mediums, not wides as I had ordered, but I did not want to go through the hassle of a return because I needed them immediately....to get on a boat!  I imagine they will stretch out, but careful when ordering from Fusion Apparel...sorry FA, but you messed up.  So, I actually have to take time to put them on rather than just sliding into them...oh well.
