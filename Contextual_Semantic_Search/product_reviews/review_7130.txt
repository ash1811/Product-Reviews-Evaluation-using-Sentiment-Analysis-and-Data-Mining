When I first started running, a couple friends took me to a running-shoe store and helped select a pair of Nike running shoes to suit my needs. At first, I just wore a standard pair of mid-calf athletic socks with them, but it wasn't long before I noted that most other runners were wearing anklets. So, I went back and got a couple pairs of anklets and I could easily see why; the anklets were lighter and more comfortable. Plus, they looked better. Somewhere along the line I started wearing runners' anklets with my conventional shoes and I liked the anklets much better than the standard mid-calf sock. It looked a little funny wearing white socks, but when I looked around at enough stores I found that anklets came in other colors, notably, grey, blue and black. I opted for the grey and black and I used them for running also but most of the time I ran with whites.In any case, I've been wearing anklets now for a couple decades instead of regular socks. Oh sure, some people probably think it looks a little weird but the anklets are so much more comfortable that I just could never go back to conventional socks except for very limited ultra-dressy occasions. My wife has reluctantly gone along with my little eccentricity, but has purged the white anklets from my collection so I can't go out in public with them on. OK, I can live with it.The problem then becomes, where do I get enough grey and black anklets in-as-much as they are not nearly as common as the white variety. It takes a bit of looking and when I find them, I buy (usually in three- or six-packs). There are at least a half-dozen brands but the latest I've found is Gold Toe. They're excellent and fit very well. I especially like them in that they don't have a logo on the side such as Nike or Adidas. I like wearing anklets. They're comfortable, long lasting and nice looking. Who cares what anyone else might think about it?Gary Peterson
