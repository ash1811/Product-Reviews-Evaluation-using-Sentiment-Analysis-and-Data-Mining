I have an old Kipling bag that is almost identical to this bag for the past 15 years. I ordered this as a replacement because the old one has finally worn out from heavy use over the years at the corners and at where the handle-strap is sewn to the body of the bag.Most of the features of this new bag are well thought-out improvements to my old bag. The organizer sections (pda, cellphone, pens) in the large front zippered section, The 2 zippered pockets (one for 3-1-1 toiletry ziplock, the other for inflatable pillow, pashmina, ipod etc) and of course the trolley-sleeve in tha back that enables this bag to be slipped over trolley handles for convenience. My old bag just had one large wide pocket in the front, no organizer sections and no trolley sleeve.The one thing they did add, that I don't like is that the entire bag is lightly padded, presumably to help it keep its shape when partly full. This padding adds weight and bulk to this bag. It weighs-in at 2-lbs! My old bag was just 1-lb. Ordinarily this wouldn't make that much of a difference, except that this is meant to be a travel bag and discount carriers and intra-Europe flights have a weight limit of 5-kg/11-bs. With a laptop weighing 3-4 lbs, add the weight of the 3-1-1 bag and you don't have much to work with.I love the updates (except for the padding) and the new colors it now comes in (they used to only make bags in their basic colors: navy, red, black) and have used this bag as an overly large handbag/tote bag, an overnighter, a weekender, a gym bag, a diaper bag and of course as my carryon. This size can just squeeze by as a personal or 2nd bag on trans-Atlantic/Pacific flights on the larger planes.If they only removed the padding and went back to the removable semi-firm bottom panel, I would give it 5 stars.
