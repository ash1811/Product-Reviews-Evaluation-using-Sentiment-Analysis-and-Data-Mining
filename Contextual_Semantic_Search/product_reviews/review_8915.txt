Call me old fashioned.  My mother had the most beautiful navy lounger robe that was 100% cotton velour.  I looked everywhere for the exact same robe.  I have had robes that are belted.  The belts always come undone and the robe falls this way and that.  I have had fleece robes that zip or snap.  One hot flash and you are madly trying to rip it off (easy to do with the snapped robes, but they are also problematic because the snaps either pull when you are being active) or pop.  When I saw this robe I decided to give it a try.  It looks very much like my mother's beautiful robe and I am very happy.  It is a bit shiny and the fabric is not cotton, so it isn't my perfect robe.  However, the style is the perfect style and the price is not outrageous.  The robe is warm enough without being a hot flash maker.  The size is true to form, the zipper allows you to be a bit warmer or to get a little more coolness and air flow. At the same time it hangs nicely, and remains a pretty addition for morning or evening wear. If you don't care what you actually wear while IN bed, this is robe is great to make you look better in the am. I would love to see this manufacturer to make the robe in a natural fabric, but one that has the same weight and feel, but without the shininess.  Even a Rayon or some other fabric would work better if it weren't so shiny.  But, that is my one complaint.
