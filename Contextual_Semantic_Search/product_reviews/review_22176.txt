I THINK A BRA IS A DIFFICULT ITEM TO BUY EVEN IN THE STORES.  YOU NEVER REALLY KNOW TILL YOU HAVE WORN IT FOR A DAY.  ONCE YOU FIND THE RIGHT BRA YOU GO BACK AND THEY DON'T CARRY IT ANYMORE AND YOU STARTTHE SEARCH AGAIN AND BUY SEVERAL HOPEING THAT IT WILL BE THE RIGHT ONE.  I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I COULD LOOK FOR A SPECIFIC BRA AND FIND IT.  I LOVE THIS BRA IT IS SO COMFORTABLE AND THE FACT THAT IT IS COTTON IS PERFECT SINCE I LIVE IN AN AREA THAT CAN BE HOT AND HUMID AT TIMES.
