I love Uggs. So do my girls. They're cozy, comfortable, and warm. They're adorable with the proper attire. They're so durable. If you're looking for disposable boots, these are not ideal. But if you're looking for boots to invest a little $$ in that will stand up to winter weather (use good judgement - they're not that indestructible), you can't go wrong with Uggs classics.I highly - highly - highly recommend purchasing the protectant spray and cleaner. They come in a pre-packaged tin, I believe. Don't wear them until you've protected them. Just follow the directions - they're super easy - you can't go wrong.Enjoy!
