This is a thick, well made shirt. The fabric is warm enough in cold weather but breathes in warmer weather so it doesn't feel too hot or stuffy like other thick shirts. The large really is a large, it is long in length, and holds up after washing in warm water without shrinking. The pocket is an added bonus.
