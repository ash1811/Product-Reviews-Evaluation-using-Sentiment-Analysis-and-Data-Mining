Far more durable than cheaper, non-dance versions.  The non-fishnet footbed is too small to cover my whole foot (size 6.5 to 7), so it feels a bit like standing on seams.  It's definitely tolerable, though.  Another plus is that they act like a compression garment where they're sucking you in a bit.  As another rater noted, they do leave fishnet imprints on your skin after you've been wearing them a long time.  The Suntan color wasn't available when I purchased mine.  I bought the Caramel, which was actually too light for my skin (fairly tan Asian skin).  Hope that's helpful for someone trying to figure out which color to purchase.
