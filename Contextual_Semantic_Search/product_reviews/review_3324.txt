I bought a 36D and it's fits great. I was cooncerned that because its lace it might not fit well cus of my size and I bought a lace bra recently that just made my breasts super pointy. But this is def not the same. I would recommend and buy this product again. I only selected 4 stars cause I jus got it today and it has not stood the test of time yet.
