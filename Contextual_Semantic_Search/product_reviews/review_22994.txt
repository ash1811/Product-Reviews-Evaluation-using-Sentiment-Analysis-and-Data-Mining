I usually buy Nike and that was my intent, but Amazon`s selection did not have what I wanted. So I looked to Rockport as I have bought them in the past. The only problem I saw was the last time years ago when I bought them last they took a long time to break in. But the price was right and went ahead and bought them. They arrived on time and I planned to spend a long time getting them broken in but low and behold they were comfortable right out of the box! I like their quality and fit but the one downside is the shoe strings were dirty for some reason, my only complaint.
