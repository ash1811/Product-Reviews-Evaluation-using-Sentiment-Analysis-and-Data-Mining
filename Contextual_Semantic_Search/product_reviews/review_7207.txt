I have had UUGs in the past so I knew what to expect. These boots are of great quality, style and comfort. These are authentic UGGs not some Walmart brand knockoffs!! I got the boots a day before they were supposed to arrive! Although I rarely wear my UUGs outside of the house because I want them to stay clean I recommend getting a care kit for them its worth it and it saves your boots! TRUE SIZE I wear a size 12 and that's what i ordered and i still have a little wiggle room in them! LOVE THESE BOOTS! I also got them cheaper then what stores were selling them for.
