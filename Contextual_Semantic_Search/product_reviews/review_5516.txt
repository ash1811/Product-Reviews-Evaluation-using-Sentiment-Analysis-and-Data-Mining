The pants are waaaaay to long.  I should have ordered one, maybe 2 sizez shorter.  I have 10 pairs of pants in my closet, all are 40x32 or 42x32, and not one of them is too long.  I ordered a 42x32 here, and I feel like its a 34 or 36 length.  The first day I wore them I safety pinned 2 inches off the bottom and they still scraped the ground when I walked.  I will have to hem these somehow, but at least the pants were too long (and fixable) instead of too short (essentially useless).  Also the pants are kinda thin and they dont seem like they will last, but we shall see.  I like that they arent too thick so they can breath, but im skeptical of getting more than a year or two of use out of them.All in all, they are very comfortable and the pockets and stitching seem secure enough.  If they were more true to their size I would give a 5 outta 5, but due to the additional hem work that will be needed, they lose a star.  I would buy these again, but remember they run big.  Order 1 pair 1 size shorter, then reevaluate, before you go ordering 5 pairs all too long.
