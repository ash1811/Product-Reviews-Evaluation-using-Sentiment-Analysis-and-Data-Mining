The shirt arrived quickly enough and it was the color I wanted but the armholes were way to big. The cut was not what I expected. The chest area was a little to tight but the belly area was too large. Had I ordered a large it would not have worked either. I weight about 177 and I am 5'9&#34;. I have worn it some.
