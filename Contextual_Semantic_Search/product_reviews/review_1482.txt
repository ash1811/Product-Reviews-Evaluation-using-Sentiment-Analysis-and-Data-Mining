These are good, quality pants perfect for outdoor hiking. They hold up to snags on vegetation and stay dry pretty easily. I did have some difficulty with maneuverability, but I am demand so this may be attributed to the fact that these pants are tailored for men. They have worked well for me and have good pockets and warmth.
