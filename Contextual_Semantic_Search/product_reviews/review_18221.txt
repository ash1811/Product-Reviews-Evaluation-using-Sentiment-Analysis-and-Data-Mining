I read a few reviews prior to ordering and ordered a half size larger so the slippers fit well. They are very warm, but definately not an ideal house slipper for extended wear. Not a lot of cushion or support and they are quite stiff. Because of the interior material and snug fit, socks cannot be worn with these either.
