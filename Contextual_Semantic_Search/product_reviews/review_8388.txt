Pros:Mid-weight,good texture (slick.)Warm but not too warmCons:Fit is too shortneck is too short (pulls down, doesn't fold down as a true turtleneck)raglan front is skimpy for wide shoulders.Summary: not good for XL sized women, more for narrow shouldered, smaller busts. This is typical of athletic wear for women; if you are tall and large, the fit is usually off.
