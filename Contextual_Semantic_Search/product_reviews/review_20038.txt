With two slots on each side for credit cards and/or ID and a center slot in the middle for folded bills, this is a fairly handy little "wallet". I'm not your average purse-toting type gal, but I also don't like the butch feeling that comes with carrying a big wallet. This is a perfect solution - it is very thin, comfortable, and attractive for the price. I ordered two (black and brown) and the brown one started to split down the center seam after a little use, so I'll have to baby it some, but for the price this is still a steal.
