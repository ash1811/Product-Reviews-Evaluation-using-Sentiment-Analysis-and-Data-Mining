I love this bra! It has replaced the lacey additions I affectionately call &#34;Vickie's&#34; (the female version a a dickie). I no longer worry about sharing too much of myself when I wear a v-neck shirt or lower cut blouse. This bra actually accentuates some of my tops and makes them look better. I own several of these bras in different colors.
