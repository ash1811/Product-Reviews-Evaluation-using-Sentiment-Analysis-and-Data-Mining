I have spent so much money trying to find a truly comfortable bra: supportive, breathable and doesn't feel like you're wearing armor.  I purchased this bra because the price was reasonable and it even looked kinda pretty...what a nice surprise that it fit perfectly (no tugging or adjusting while wearing) and was so comfortable with it's all-cotton construction.  It felt like it had been made just for me.  Great support and separation.  There is no "stretch" factor in this bra, again it is all cotton so wash carefully to avoid shrinking. The only negatives would be that straps do not adjust and I don't think it's available in any other color but white. I found the sizing to be true.
