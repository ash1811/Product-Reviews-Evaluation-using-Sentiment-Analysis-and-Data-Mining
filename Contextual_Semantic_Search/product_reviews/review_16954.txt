Be certain when you order that you are the size you claim you are... there is not much &#34;wiggle&#34; room in these jeans, and they are extremely lightweight when compared to the Levi's 517 bootcut jeans. As they are both similar in price, you feel as though you get &#34;more for your money&#34; with the 517's.
