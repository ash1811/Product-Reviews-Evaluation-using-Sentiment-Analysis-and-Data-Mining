I am very happy with the quality and apparent sturdiness of my new Rainkist umbrella. However, I am a little disappointed with the automatic mechanism.  My old umbrella that bit the dust in a massive windstorm was automatic, so I wanted another one with that same feature. My disappointment came when I found that the umbrella does not auto-close as well as auto-open. My husband has an umbrella that also closes with the push of a button just as it opens with the push of a button. Since this was not exactly a cheap umbrella, I really expected that it would open both ways. This should have been explained in the description of the item.
