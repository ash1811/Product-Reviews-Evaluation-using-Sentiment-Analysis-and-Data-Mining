First off, this bag is too large to fit in the overhead bin on airplanes. That is the first thing that disappointed me.Second, the bag is very fragile. After the 1st time I checked it a few zippers broke off and the strap on the inside broke.Third, Did I mention it doesn't fit in the overhead bin...? It is so irritating. You are able to go through security then check it at the counter, but seriously don't advertise as a carry on when it cannot be carried on.I would not recommend this to a friend...
