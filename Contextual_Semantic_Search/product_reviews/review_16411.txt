I love to dance for exercise, but my living room is carpeted.  This causes a problem especially when I need to move my feet sideways.  These shoes are perfect.  They are not too slippery, but they move when you need to move them.  I read the reviews thatsaid that you need to order one size up from your regular shoes.  I did that, and the shoes fit perfectly!  I receivedthese today and have already used them for 2 hrs of dancing.  I am so pleased with these shoes that I am thinking of tryingZumba!
