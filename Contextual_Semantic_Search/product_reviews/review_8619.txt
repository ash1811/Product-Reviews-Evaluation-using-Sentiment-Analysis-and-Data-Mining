I first found these underwear when I was 14.  Now at 23, I still have my originals and many new ones.  They last forever!  For awhile I couldn't find them anywhere and recently decided to look again and was delighted to see they're back and with lots of new colors.  I am very picky about my underwear and these are the best I've ever worn.  They last a long time (as long as you don't mind little elastic strings on the band), comfortable, will stay in place, super cute.  They don't really shrink in the wash either, though I never put mine in the dryer to keep them lasting longer, but you could and they'd survive.  What more could you ask for?  These are great!
