I have always bought the Pro cotton but they were unavailable this year in long sleeve.  I disagree that they are wide.  I am 5'10", 155, a runner, so hardly a big guy.  The large fits me just fine but then I have always liked my shirts a little big.No neck tags but kind of a weird sleeve logo. A friend thought I had dipped the sleeve in something at dinner the other night.501 jeans and this long sleeved tee.  Almost stylish my wife tells me. At least as stylish as I'll ever get, I think she means.I wear them everywhere. I wish these didn't have the logo on the sleeve, though.
