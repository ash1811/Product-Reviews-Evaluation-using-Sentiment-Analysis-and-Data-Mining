These are not super heavy duty boots but they are nice for the money. I bought them for my son to use with a cosplay costume but he loves them and will wear them other times I'm sure. Just received them so I can't speak for the longevity of the boot. I will say .... buy at least 1, better yet 2 sizes smaller than you wear!!!! I originally ordered a size 6 ... they were so big they fit my husband who wears a 9! I sent them back and ordered a size 4 which is still slightly big but fit fine for my growing son. I also ordered a size 5 just in case and they fit my daughter (who also loves them) who normally wears a size 7 - 7 1/2.
