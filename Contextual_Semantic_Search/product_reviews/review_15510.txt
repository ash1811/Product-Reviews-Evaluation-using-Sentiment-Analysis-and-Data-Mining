These are the nicest onesies out there I think.  The cotton is extreme soft, the fit is roomy and not tight, the construction on them is excellent.  I highly recommend this brand.  I do machine embroidery and they embroider out beautifully as well.  I can't say enough good about these - you'll enjoy them and so will your baby.
