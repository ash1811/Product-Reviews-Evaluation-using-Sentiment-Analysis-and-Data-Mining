Even though my feet aren't wide (that's what shoe salespeople tell me), I bought the 'W' size and I'm very pleased with the fit.The shoes are very comfortable and I didn't have to break them in.I bought the Nubuck (looks like brushed leather) which gives them a more casual look and the shoes can be worn with jeans, khakis or just about anything but a 3 piece suit.  Sometimes I want to go out with jeans but don't want to look like a slob with sneakers and these shoes are perfect.
