I had an older version of this bag in high school and it lasted through several years. I purchased this one for a recent trip with my kiddos. I loved having all the extra pockets and sections to seperate their stuff. Zippers are of good quality and open/close easily. Love the pattern on this one. Pads are very padded for comfort and nylon is very sturdy.
