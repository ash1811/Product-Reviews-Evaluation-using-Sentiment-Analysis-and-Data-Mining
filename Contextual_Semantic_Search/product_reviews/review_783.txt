This bra has no padding.  It is stiff and a wee bit scratchy until washed with Woolite or similar cold water soap.It is a minimizer.  And it works.  For those tops that are tight. This works!MY BALI INDULGENCE 34 DD AND 36 DD.  I CAN SLEEP IN.  This is not sleeping comfort.  This is for minimizing.The price is super.  My other Bali, and Olga bras cost $55.00 to $60.00 dollars.
