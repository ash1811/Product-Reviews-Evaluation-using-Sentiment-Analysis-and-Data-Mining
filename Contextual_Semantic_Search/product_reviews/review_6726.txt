I was looking for a dark brown pair of opaque hose and these fit the bill perfectly. The material is soft and smooth and seems well made. They seemed like they would last. What struck me the most about these is how comfortable they are. I wore them all day while out shopping and there was no pulling, tugging, adjusting or otherwise fiddling with them required. They were not itchy which is a big deal to me. I would definitely recommend these.
