As walking shoes go...these are very comfortable. I don't usually buy shoes without trying them on. I own a couple of other pairs of Easy Spirit brand shoes and like them as well. They are true to size . I am pleased with my purchase. The only negative was I couldn't get the color I wanted as they were sold out online.
