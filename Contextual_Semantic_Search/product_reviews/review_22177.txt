It is not padded at all. I'm at a age where I can't go to the bathroom without any padding. And I have a large size-40C. I was excited at first but then saw the flimsy breast cups. I looked up on Amazon for pads that fit into the cup but they all have to be sewn in and it's too much of a hassle. It would be a good bra with 4 stars if it had padding. Having a problem finding cotton bra's with padding. Oh well I will keep up the search.......
