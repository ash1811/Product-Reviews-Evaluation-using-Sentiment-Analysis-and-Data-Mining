When I first got these in the mail I thought they would not last a week; they are very light. However, they've been the most comfortable flip flops I've ever had! Their lightness makes them easy to walk in, and they contour my feet very well. Since I live in Tucson I've worn these almost every day for the past six months and they still look great.UPDATE: I've had these a year now, still wearing them almost every day, and they are STILL going strong! The treads have worn off the bottom so I no longer wear them when it's raining, but usually it's the straps that break on a flip flop. But the straps on these gems are still fully intact (besides a bit of fuzz on the fabric)!
