i was  gonna pick up some nike acg, for some reason fed ex shipped the package back, they never came to my house and drop them off, and the money was refunded, i came accross these and i decided i wanna give these a try, shoes are very very comfrontable, acg like to say they often remind me of the hi tek boot from way in the day, i must say they are very good shoes, my only only problem you wil have is the the two hooks on the boots, your gonna have to tie very right to keep the laces from loosen a lot, but you will get the hang of it.
