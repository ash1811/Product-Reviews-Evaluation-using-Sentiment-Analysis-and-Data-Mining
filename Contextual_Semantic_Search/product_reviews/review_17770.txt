This is the second one that I have bought.  This is about the only thin digital watch out there despite lots of looking.  It's not fancy but the watch has a very easy to see dial.  The water seal works perfectly -- do not remove the watch for swimming.  The only reason that I needed a new one is that after years of daily wear, I had scratched it up a bit.
