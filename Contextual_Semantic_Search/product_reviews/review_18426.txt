They're a "tiny bit" too big. If I wear long johns under them (in South Carolina in the middle of summer), they Navy ones fit fine. Good quality. Wish the size on the label were the truth. It ain't! Bought one navy, khaki, and light colored pants. The Navy almost fits. the Khaki is at least an inch (or two) to large in the waist, the Light ones were so not the label size they've already gone to the recycling bin. I cut the wrong size tag out of them. Considering only one of three came close to the stated size, makes one pair of dockers cost about $150.
