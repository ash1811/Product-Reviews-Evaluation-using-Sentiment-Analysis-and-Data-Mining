boy did i need this, with all the jewelry i have been buying..i had a good size jewelry chest, but it is overflowing and i thought this would do the job..at least i can keep my jewelry organized and see what i have..in the chest i have i opened a box and forgot i even had that pair of earrings, lol..and it will be easier to get ready and out the door..just pick this one and this one and done..also this piece is very pretty and dainty and not to big..so it fit very nicely in my bedroom..i like the painted flowers on the armoire..and that both doors open on the side..i should have plenty of room for everything!!  very nice piece, happy with purchase.
