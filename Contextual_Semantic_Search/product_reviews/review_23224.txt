The cleaner itself is pretty good and has almost no smell.  However, the brush is too small, with weak bristles and falls to the bottom of the jar (it doesn't slide into the basket like the Connoisseurs brand). Essentially, the brush is useless. Second, the basket it small and doesn't hold the jewelry well.Despite the issues, for the price this cleaner is worthwhile.  Most jewelry cleaners run $7-8 a jar or more, while this was less than $6.  And for that price, I'm willing to use an old toothbrush and fish rings out of the bottom.  Recommended.
