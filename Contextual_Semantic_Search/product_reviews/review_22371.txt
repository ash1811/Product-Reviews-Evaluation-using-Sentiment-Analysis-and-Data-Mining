I wear a size 10, and these are the exact length of my foot, so there's not much room. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but something to consider.Personally, I think that these are slightly overpriced for what they are, but much like anything else, you're paying for the brand name rather than quality.I've also noticed that the material is rubbing off on the bottom of my foot giving me black heels.Overall, they're good flip flops that should last a long time.
