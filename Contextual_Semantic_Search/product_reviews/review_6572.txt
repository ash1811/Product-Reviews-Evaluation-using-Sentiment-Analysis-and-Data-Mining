Theses boots came from Amazon within the time stated.  They are very cute, quite warm, but definitely run small.  I wear an 8-8 1/2 with socks, and I'm comfortable in these boots in a 9 -without- socks.  I've had them all of one day, and maybe they'll stretch out some.  I can see how the elastic and/or the buttons would be a weak point - they seem a little dicey.  If (for instance) you have boot cut jeans (wider at the ankle) and want to tuck them, the elastic has to stretch to go over the button which is just sewn on with regular thread.  I don't feel any discomfort from seams, and the lining is luxurious.  I wish there were an arch and a more rugged sole.  I think these are more fashion-oriented than they are functional, but they are warm.
