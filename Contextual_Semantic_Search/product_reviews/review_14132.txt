I bought these jeans a size up because I used to wear Riders in the same style as a teen and remembered that they ran small.  I just got them today and tried them on to find that the sizing is still TOO small!  The fabric, while labeled &#34;stretch,&#34; has absolutely no give and the elastic is very tight.  I immediately requested a refund and I'm thankful that I have Prime because the return shipping is free.  I was really hoping these would work but I am not pleased at all.
