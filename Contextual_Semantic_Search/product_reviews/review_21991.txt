I recently got a short, &#34;sassy&#34; haircut and wanted a choker that would accentuate it and draw attention to my neck. This was the best fit for what I was looking for. It is soft, adjustable (By about an inch via &#34;snaps&#34;) and attractive and I have had many compliments on it already. Looks great with a flirty dress or even a t-shirt and jeans to add a little something. I couldn't be happier with my purchase and I've been wearing it almost constantly since I received it!
