In general this has been an excellent watch. I particularly like the atomic timekeeping feature, which even works to adjust for daylight savings time.I have, however, experienced a couple of difficulties. The first is that the solar battery occasionally dies if you've been indoors for a period of days. This can be unnerving as the watch appears to have failed altogether, but putting the watch under a lamp or in the sunlight usually brings it back to life. Second, the hands are not always easy to read. They tend to blend in a bit too well with the background.On the other hand, I have not found some of the negatives reported by others to be true. For instance, the watch's light works quite well, and those reporting that it is poor just are not telling the truth.While the calendar dial is very small, it turned out to be much easier to read than I had expected. The watch is also, in my opinion, very stylish, to the extent that I have bought two of them.
