I have to admit I was somewhat reluctant to pay the dollars I did for these Ray-Ban New Wayfarer sunglasses, but I am glad I did.  First of all, Amazon offered a discounted price and then there is the rest.  The glasses are polarized and the optical clarity of these lenses is astounding.  I didn't know what I was missing.  I can see more details and the blue gradient lenses are very useful.  The glasses are comfortable and fit my face just right.  They come in both 52 and 55 mm lens diameter and I chose 55 mm because I have a larger head.  The design of the New Wayfayer fits the average face better and the sunglasses are very attractive.  The best thing about these sunglasses is the optics.  You have to see it to believe it.  Definitely order the polarized model.
