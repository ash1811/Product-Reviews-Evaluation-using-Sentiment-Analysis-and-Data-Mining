I love these jeans and only buy Lee Dungaree. They fit me well and have lasted me for a few years in the past. I have had issues with belt loops pulling off and the back pockets developing holes on the corners. This pair already feels like one of the back loops is getting weak and I just got them. If this quality issue keeps up then I will have to find another brand.
