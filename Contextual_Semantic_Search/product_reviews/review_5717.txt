I love this semi-sheer feminine gown with it's lovely details.  It's comfortable and elegant.  But it is too sheer to wear in front of anyone other than your husband or boyfriend.  Miss Elaine is now one of my favorite nightgown designers because they have products that are very frilly, flirty and feminine.  I ordered the large and it is a bit long for me, I'm 5 foot 4.  Other than that it fits fine and a medium would have been fine too.  sb
