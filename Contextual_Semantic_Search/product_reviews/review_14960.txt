When this T-shirt arrived, I looked very closely at it in different types of lighting to make sure I was seeing the color correctly. This was NOT a deep navy shirt from what I saw. The shirt look straight black with no tinge of blue that I could see or notice. I sent the shirt back and decided not to get a replacement because I didn't want to waste time waiting for another shirt and still get a black t-shirt. The material of the shirt was okay, but I just didn't want a black shirt.
