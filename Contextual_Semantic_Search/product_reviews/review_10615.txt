Received this watch today , 2 days after order . Great shipping  Amazon !However , if you are a man with at least average size , this watch will be too small for you .Description showed the watch at 37mm ( 3,7cm) , it must count the whole face and border of the watch .Very hard to see the date , if you are mid-life man without a 20/20 vision ,you can just forget it .Everything else are just about right for a $15 watchI gave it to 8 year old son and it looked OK on his wrist .Definitely , positively NOT a men's watch !
