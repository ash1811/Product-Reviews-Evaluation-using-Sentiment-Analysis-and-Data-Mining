I got these a number larger than I normally get, because I have a very high wrist, and wasn't sure it would fit. They feel small in size, so the fit was perfect. They are very soft, and very warm, but I feel like I "fall down" to the floor in them, which is why I am only giving 4*. I also feel that they at times don't manage to warm my feet if they are already cold, which is a problem. But if I wear them all day, my feet are warm and snugly. I don't regret this purchase, and would recommend them to others.
