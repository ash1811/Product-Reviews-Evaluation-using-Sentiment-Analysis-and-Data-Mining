These are fantastic and I am looking for another pair now! I have worn the first pair in sun (with no socks) and rain (with no leaks through the sole). I've even worn them in slush & snow (with more protection than expected with the open top). They provide year-round protection and comfort and the shoes still look very new. The leather on the top looks brand new, in fact.But it's the sole that matters. These are the best-fitting shoes I have worn in years. They fit perfectly and every step is cushioned in all the right places.I am only looking for another pair because I have finally worn them down after the several years of walking in them. The shoes themselves are still in great condition otherwise.I highly recommend them for everywhere from church to travel to commuting to work. You won't have to change your shoes to look great OR be comfortable.
