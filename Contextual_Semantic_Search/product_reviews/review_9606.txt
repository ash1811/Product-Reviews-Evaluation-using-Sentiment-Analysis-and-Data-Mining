What i expected . Weight is good and also the fabric !  Copper rivets are good . It is a good form .Size is good. Europeans should order a waist smaller than traditional accustomed.A (as i bought a week before) little article picture without zoom shows like a shining sky blue- a rare color- if it's the case.But the surface is very mat this exterior influence a near-to-perfect jean underbid. The offer- picture could be made better.The brand sign is dark with a dark brand name to appear in an unfavourable light - has not deserved this. Good product & Producer can be proud of itself and must not hide - a little shiny golden brown brand sign with darker contrast readable Wrangler would be the point on the i .Style/Price/Performance is fair (and much classes better than in europe), would by again .In a shiny sky blue would be this a unique characteristic- never seen such picture again.
