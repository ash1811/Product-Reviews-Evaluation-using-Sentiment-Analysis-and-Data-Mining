The fatigues came quickly.  The service is excellent.  Ended up buying most popular colors.  I am 32w 30L.  I actually bought some in small and medium. The medium fits baggy on me but doesnt look too bad.  They are long thou.  But they tie at the bottom.  The small is more &#34;fitted&#34; and fits snub.  With my hands in the pockets they feel a little tight. But look great my wife says.  :)
