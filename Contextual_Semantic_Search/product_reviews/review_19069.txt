Overall I'm very very happy with this purchase.  This is my second seiko and I like this one much better then the sne107.Pros :Great looking ( much better than pics )Lume is solid : lasts me slightly over 3 hoursGood bezel ratchetingWell finished face and lume markers with good quality look and feelScrew down crown ( of course on a divers )200m water resitant : ISO certifiedAutomatic timing - 6 seconds per day ( very pleased with this )Braclet is very comfortableGood day and date window visabilityCool crown placementCons :End links hollow but to be expected in this rangeNo divers extensionNo warrenty from SeikoSecond hand lume on the wrong end ( personal preference )Not hacking ( second hand runs when setting the time )For this price range it's a no brainer !! Get this watch , it has every thing you need. Looks sharp, has good weight and very comfortable. A lot of people are not happy with the jubilee braclet but it's not awful and I actual like it. I'm glad I went jubilee over the generic rubber band. I'll end up getting a super oyster soon but the braclet now is more than fine. Time keeping is very accurate thus far at -6 seconds per day and I'd rather it be slightly slow for a non hacking as it's better to move a minute hand forward then backwards. Could you spend more on a watch ? Sure thousands more if you want but this has the look and all the functions you need and is ISO certified. If asked if I'd recommend , 100% I would. Shipping was reasonable ( speed wise ) came well packed and with official seiko watch box and manual. Watch was purchased from e watch. Did some research and looks like my watch was made last year.  I suggest you always purchase through amazon directly or fufilled by amazon as you are pretty much guaranteed a quality worry free expirence.
