Not much you can say about a pair of shorts expect that these are very high quality and seem like they'll stand up to a lot of abuse.  They look great, feel great, and the price was right.  I think most people think of "Dickies" as a company you get work wear from, but don't be afraid to wear these around the house, because I promise you won't be disappointed.
