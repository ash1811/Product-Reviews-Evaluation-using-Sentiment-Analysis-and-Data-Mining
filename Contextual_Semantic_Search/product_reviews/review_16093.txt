Watching Rich Steves on TV has made me paranoid about pickpockets.  Maybe in Bulgaria but for the parts of France and the UK where I traveled this was not needed.I feel a little weird when I did wear this thing under my shirt but it makes sense to have your passport and other valuables on your person.  When's the last time I trusted a hotel room safe?  I might also point out that I was able to tell when someone else was wearing it under their clothing, it imprints clearly.  When I saw one, I felt like saying to them, "You read Rick Steves don't you?"
