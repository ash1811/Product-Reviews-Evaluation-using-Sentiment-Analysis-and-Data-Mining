After years of trying to teach my (now 8-year old) daughter to tell time, this watch was the thing that did the trick. It's got a pink hour hand, which matches with the pink hours printed on the watch face, and a purple minute hand, which matches with the 0-60 minutes printed on the watch face. She just matches them up (pink hour hand goes with pink numbers, purple minute hand goes with purple numbers) and she knows the time.It's perfectly sized for little wrists- the band is elastic with a little metal slider that allows for the watchband to be made smaller or bigger- and can be slid on and off. It's also water resistant, so my daughter can wear it in the pool and in the shower with no worries.Thank you, Timex, for finally answering the question &#34;what time is it *now*?&#34;
