PROS:It's kinda baggy which I love, the cuts on the back make it a perfect match for a hot summer day. The fabric is pretty awesome since it's neither hot nor cold.CONS:It kinda snags on everything so if you have pets better watch out because this attracts everything (specially hair) like there's no tomorrow.Bottom line it is an excellent shirt, I simply love it.
