Timex use to be a great company not so now. I have ordered several watches and all have quit working. I ordered this watch with several items that came in one box. Had company  put the box up Christmas items opened it today to check out my items and the clock was running. No plastic strip to keep it off. Last time I will ever buy a Timex and we love buying watches. I think everyone should start buying quality watches not cheap ones.
