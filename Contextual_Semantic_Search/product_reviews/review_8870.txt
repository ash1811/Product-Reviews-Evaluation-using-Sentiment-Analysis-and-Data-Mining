This is a nice light weight robe. I've had mine for two seasons now and thinking of re-ordering it. The fabric is very light weight so you can't expect it to last more than a few seasons with regular use. But for the low price it is worth it. Plus size summer robes are almost impossible to find anywhere. National is a great site to order from. They have fast delivery and a nice little catalog that they will send to you too.
