I love the gown, very feminine, soft, flowing, etc. However, it is extremely sheer. I ordered ivory, this may not beso important with darker colors, but this gown leaves nothing to the imagination. It cannot be worn in front of children, parents etc unless you wear a robe over it or full slip under it. particularly the bodice, it is lace with zero lining.
