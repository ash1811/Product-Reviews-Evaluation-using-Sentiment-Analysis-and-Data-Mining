5 Stars for Comfort and Price.  10 dollars for 6 pairs of socks is a fantastic price that can hardly be beat.  Good quality socks and as comfortable as some high priced socks I think.  I wear a size 13 shoe and I got the 6-12 size, and they couldn't be more right in size.  If you wear a 13 and lower get the size I did, but anything higher than the 13 I suggest the tall size.  If your looking for good cheap socks, get these you won't regret it.
