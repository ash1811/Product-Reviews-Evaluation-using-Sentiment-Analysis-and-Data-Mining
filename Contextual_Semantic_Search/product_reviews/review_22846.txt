I bought this for my 10 yr old daughter who has VERY skinny narrow feet and it fit perfectly.  I have no Idea how an average adult foot would fit in this shoe.  We ordered size 6' blue color and length was true to size, blue was vibrant and the strap were thick, high quality.  Much better than the traditional flip flops.
