My son is 1.5 years old with a huge foot.  I buy most of his shoes at the Stride Rite store in town so I can have his foot measured.  He had just been fitted for an 8w sneaker in the store when I spied these online.  After reading the reviews, I ordered a 1/2 size up.  They fit well and are comfortable for him to spend the day in.  I really like that even as a sandle they are basically closed toe since he is forever running into things or dropping toys on his feet.  They are also nice enough that he can wear them to church on Sundays.  Will definitely be buying this style again next summer.
