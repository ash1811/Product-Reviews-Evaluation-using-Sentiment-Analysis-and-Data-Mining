I've tried a lot of these &#34;performance underwear&#34; and I can say without a doubt that ExOfficio makes the best bar none. I've had to wear these for 24 hours straight while running around and in the field with no problems. I bought a second pair these were so good. My only complaint is that I wish they were cheaper $10-$15 per pair and I would only own these, they are that comfortable.
