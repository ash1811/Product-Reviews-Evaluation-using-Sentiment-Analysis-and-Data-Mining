It's a very delicate little cross, so if you're into "big" jewelry you won't like this. I love it. It's small, delicate, simple and pretty. I've gotten a number of compliments on it. I wear it quite a bit, and I've had it since last Christmas and have never had problems with the clasp or the chain. It seems to me to be a very sturdy chain and a good necklace. I love it, quite personally. I found the chain to be a nice length, but I can see where some might want it just a hair longer.In my opinion, this is a good buy. You are getting a beautiful little necklace for the money.
