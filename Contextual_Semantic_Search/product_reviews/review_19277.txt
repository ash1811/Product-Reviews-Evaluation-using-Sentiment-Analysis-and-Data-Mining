I have barely used these yet, so I can't speak to their effectiveness - I'm giving them 4 stars just because that seems to fit others.  I'll  update this once I am able to test them out some more.But I just picked up a 3-pack of these at Walmart for $7.50 (they're not plain white though - they're boys colors - blues).  So unless you're looking for plain white I'm not sure why these are &#34;hard to find in retail stores&#34; as the description states...they aren't - they're right next to the toddler underwear...for 1/2 the price than what these are.
