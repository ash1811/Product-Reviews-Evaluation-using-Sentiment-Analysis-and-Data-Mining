I am 5'5" and about 160 lbs. I got the size Queen 1 because of the reviews saying to get a size up since they cut into your thigh. I am wearing these with a garter belt under a dress so I needed them to fit comfortably. I got nude, and I am very pale and the color works. They aren't too shiny either. This size is supposed to fit up to 225 lbs and 5'6" and they fit pretty well on my thigh but the lace band sits pretty low. It starts just a few inches above my knee, so keep that in mind. You will need adjustable garter straps and a knee length dress. I can't wait to try these on with my garter and dress!
