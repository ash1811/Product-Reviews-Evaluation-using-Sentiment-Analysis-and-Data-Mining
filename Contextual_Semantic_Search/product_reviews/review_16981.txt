I remember hip huggers and bell bottom jeans way back when. These are very close. They sit slightly above the hips and the slightly flared bottoms does a good job of covering  my hiking boots. The price I paid for these were also very good as for some reason they were alot more on the Levi's website. Shipping was very fast.
