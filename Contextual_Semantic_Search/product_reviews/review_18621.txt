This is a great watch. I wanted an expansion band because I have occasion to take my watch off and put it on several times a day. After reading one of the reviews, I hoped it did not have a &#34;pinchy&#34; feel to it. Maybe it was made expressly for my wrist, I hardly know I'm wearing it. Very comfortable and always in the right place when I need to look at it, no sliding around. The design is perfect. I can wear it for dressy or with jeans. It is indeed easy to read, except for the tiny little date window. It is just what I was looking for. Accurate and nice looking. I am very happy with it. I highly recommend it.
