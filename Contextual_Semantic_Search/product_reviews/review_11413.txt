I have a couple of other jansport backpacks, so I was very surprised by the quality of this bag.  The canvas is very thin, not what I expected.  Also, this bag is tiny, way smaller than I thought it would be.  Actually it seems like the sort of thing that would come with a baby doll.  :) I'll keep it though and try it out.
