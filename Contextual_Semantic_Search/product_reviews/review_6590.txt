So here's the deal...these have got to be the best boots ever.  I have heel spurs so I have to be careful about what I put on my feet.  Although, as expected, they hurt after a while, all I have to do is my leg stretches and all is right with the world again.  These boots are comfortable, warm, cozy, fuzzy, you name it.  I forgot I had them on at one point during a 16hr shift.  They feel like walking on a furry floor.  That's as best I can describe them.  I wear Birkenstock for the most part and AVIA because of the spurs.  These boots fit great and with the extra leg stretches, feel great too.  Trust me.  I've gone through many shoes/boots to find what works for me, spending ridiculous amounts of money to do it and been sorely disappointed in the process over the years.  I'm taking them to get fitted for an orthotic as soon as the holidays are over.  Remember what I said earlier, it's NOT THE BOOT that hurts, it's my feet that are messed up.  For the person without bad feet, you'll quickly fall in love with these boots.  I'm wearing them already without the orthotic and I LOVE THESE BOOTS!!!  Both of my feet have spurs but only the right one reminds me in these boots.  Usually BOTH feet will feel as though someone is stabbing me with a serated edged knife in any shoe/boot except Birkenstock and AVIA after about an hour.  I had these boots on for about 6 hrs before the right foot started to scream.  Even then, the pain was so minimal, I kept waiting for the REAL pain to hit...got up, did my stretches for about 30 seconds and POOF, the pain was gone.  The left one never did hurt nor was it uncomfortable.  I wore two pairs of sweatsocks with the boots just in case they didn't live up to what others have posted about them being warm.  I catch the bus.  I live in Michigan.  By the time I got to work, I took one pair of socks off.  No problem.  Wore them home in colder temps.  No problem.  Thank a bunch BEARPAW rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
