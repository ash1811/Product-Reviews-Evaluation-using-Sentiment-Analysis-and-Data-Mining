Initially considered sending back because though it fits well when bag is hanging in back, more awkward when carrying on the side. Sometimes you don't want it hanging on your back when riding the subway. The bottle holder on the side is too small to be useful. Like the zipped compartment on the handle to hold my MetroCard when I was in NYC. More like a small cross-body backpack. Put my water bottle in the large compartment so it could fit upright and put my other stuff in the smaller pocket to protect from getting wet.
