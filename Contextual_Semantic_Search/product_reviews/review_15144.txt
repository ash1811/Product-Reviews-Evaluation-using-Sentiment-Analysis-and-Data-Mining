My husband loves these sweats. The fit and length fit him perfectly. He's about 5'10&#34; with a 29&#34; pant length. The reason that it did not get a 5 is because the string broke the first time that he put them on, without pulling on the string. Nevertheless, because they have pocktets, fit him perfectly in the waist (about 44&#34;) and length. He loves them and bought a nylon replacement string to re-string them. I wish that there was a larger color selection. Navy is what I bought for him.
