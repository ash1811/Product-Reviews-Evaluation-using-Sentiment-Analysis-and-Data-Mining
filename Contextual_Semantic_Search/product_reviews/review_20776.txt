My hubby wears a size 10.5. shoe and likes low socks and that is all I buy.  I purchased these and he showed me that when he pulled the sock over his foot, it did not stretch enough to cover his heel.  At first I thought maybe I had ordered women's sized socks by mistake but I checked and saw that I did not.  These run way too small for men whose shoe size is above 10.5 despite the description.  If these fit a man's foot, perhaps he wears a size 9 shoe.These are thick, nicely made socks but if you can't wear them, then they are useless socks.
