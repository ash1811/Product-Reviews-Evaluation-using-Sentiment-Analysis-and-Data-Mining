I'm 5'0&#34; and 130-140lbs, but I have larger thighs than typical for my height and weight. It makes purchasing and wearing thigh highs difficult and often unappealing. However, these are great. They are a bit too long, since this specific E/F size is meant for much taller customers, but its not as though the nylons are wrinkling and bunching all over, so you can't notice it. They fit great and the material on the band makes them stay up (and if you're untoned, will bunch your thighs a bit in the clinginess to stay up)
