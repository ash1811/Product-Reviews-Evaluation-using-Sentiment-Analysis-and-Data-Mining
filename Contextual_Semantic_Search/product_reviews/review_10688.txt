I've worn these for years now as a vet tech, and love them. Finally, a scrub pant that is tall enough and looks a little stylish.  I normally wear a XLT, and have probably 6 pairs of these. Well, this pair is way too big. Since I've worn them for so long, I didn't even bother to try them on, just tossed them in the wash, put them on and off to work. I can wear them, but they are really baggy. Quality is also a little less than my other pairs. I can actually see through these.  Not happy with the quality control. I highly recommend trying them on before you wear or wash them.
