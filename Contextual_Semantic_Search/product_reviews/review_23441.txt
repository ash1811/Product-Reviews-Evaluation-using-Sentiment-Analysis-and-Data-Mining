I bought a smaller version of this bag at a local retail store and love it. When I upgraded my phone, the cell was a lot bigger than the compartment on the smaller phone. I decided it was time to upgrade, I couldn't find the bag in retail stores, but found it online. Amazon as usual had the best price, so I hemmed and hawed over it and finally decided to get it. I love this bag!!!! I can fit everything in this bag - cell, water bottle, kindle, wallet, tissue packs, pens, iPod, candy, and I could probably the kitchen sink if I had too! Here hee Love this bag!!!!!!
