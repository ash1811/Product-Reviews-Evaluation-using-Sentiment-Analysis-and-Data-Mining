I loved the look of the shoe and the overall fit was very nice, but it has poor arch support. It also felt like there was not much &#34;give&#34; in the soles. It felt like I was walking in dress shoes. With athletic styles, usually there is a bit of bounce in the soles. Also, it felt like I was standing flat. I need a bit of lift in the heel because of heel spurs/plantar fasciitis. I sent these back.
