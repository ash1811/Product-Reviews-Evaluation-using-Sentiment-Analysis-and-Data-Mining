I love the wash and the fit on these jeans. I was on a mission to find a good solid pair of jeans and I didn' t mind spending some money either. I look at Tru Religion, Seven, etc. all the swanky brands at Nordstroms.I liked these jeans better than the higher end brands.The fit is perfect, they look like they will last a long time and they are not that pricey to boot.
