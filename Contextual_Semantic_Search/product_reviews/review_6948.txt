I bought several pairs of these socks for my son-in-law for Christmas, a man whose needs are unknown to me.  I figured, &#34;Men always need socks,&#34; and I was right.  He was sooooo appreciative of this small gift, telling me that almost all of his socks have holes in them and he had planned to buy some for himself but, now, he won't have to!
