This is my second pair.  The first pair were damaged, the Rayban box they came in was damaged, but not the outside box.  I returned them and am still awaiting my refund.Immediately after returning these I ordered a second pair and they had the same defect, (nose pads/fit couldn't adjust/loose sloppy fit) so I took them to two local opticians and was told the same thing.  They pointed out issues normally associated with pirated items, such as the screws holding in the stems were of different colors/length, polarization not strong, glue residue where it should never be, different box than the model the glasses came in, damage in the glasses and inside boxes but the outside shipping boxes were undamaged and clean.
