This apron is beautifully made, has great coverage, and the pocket is very handy. I like the fact that the ties are made of the same material as the body of the apron. The color is lovely.For me, there is one problem, though. I live in a warm, humid, climate. I tend to be warm myself. I find that even with the a/c on, the apron seems to add a lot more warmth than the &#34;cheapie&#34; aprons that I usually pick up at the flea market.As a result, I find that I can only use this apron comfortably in the cooler weather.
