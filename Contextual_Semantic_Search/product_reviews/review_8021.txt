I could not adapt to not having the digital watch showing the day and the date. I needed it at work; I retired at 73. I still need it when I am not working. You lose conception of time when you are retired; and have to go to cable TV or the computer if you co not have the digital watch.This is a good looking watch though for either men or women for casual wear.
