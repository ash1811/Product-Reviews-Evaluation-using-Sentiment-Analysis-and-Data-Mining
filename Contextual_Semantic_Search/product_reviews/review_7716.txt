These in my book are not cheap. But they seem like they will not last very long. It seems like you have to really hike them up a lot in order to hold up your  pants. It's almost like there is either too much stretch in them or they stretch too easily. The leather seems to be a little on the thin side. I have had other suspenders where the leather that hooks on the buttons actually ripped apart and I had to go to a leather shoe repair shop and have a bunch made out of some REAL leather. Nice and thick leather. The parts I had made are holding up extremely well.
