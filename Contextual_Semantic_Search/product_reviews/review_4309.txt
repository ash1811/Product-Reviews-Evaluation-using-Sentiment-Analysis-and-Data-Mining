The summers tend to be very hot where we live so this shoe provides good ventilation but still protects the feet.  My husband recently went to the cool coast and forgot to pack other shoes.  Good thing he was wearing his Keen's because these shoes went everywhere with him for five days. He even wore them with socks one day. Yikes! Good thing the kids weren't there to poke fun :)
