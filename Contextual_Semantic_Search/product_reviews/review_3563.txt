I bought these socks for my husband when he was having some issues with swelling in his legs. That has been resolved, but he still wears them. He says they are very comfortable to wear in his boots and his feet seem less tired at the end of the day. I thought they were pretty pricey when I bought them a year ago, but the price has steadily gone up; don't know how long I'll keep buying them.
