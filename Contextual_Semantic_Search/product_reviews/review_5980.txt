I purchased this bra because I needed a plunge push-up for a wedding I was in and the original bra I had purchased online would not arrive on time.  This bra was the only bra I could find that fit my criteria of a 44D, black, plunge, push-up, that would arrive in time for the wedding.The fit was not great.  My everyday bras are 44D and they fit perfectly.  This bra was too small around.  I could get it closed but the fat under my arms was pushed out very predominantly and this was not going to work.  Since I was in a time crunch I just went to a local store and purchased a bra extender to solve that problem (this store doesn't carry my size and is why I didn't purchase a bra here).  After that, no more bulge.  The cup size was fine, but this bra was definitely not the most comfortable.  The straps were constantly slipping off my shoulders.  I had to cinch them so tight just to get them to stay up, that you could see the indent on my shoulders through my dress.  This bra just lacked the overall comfort I'm used to.The push-up aspect wasn't bad.  This was my first push-up bra.  I didn't need a ton of cleavage I just needed some extra lift because my dress was very low cut.  So it worked fine for what I needed.Also, at first the straps kept coming out of the clasps holding them on.  They don't close and just slip on and off.  Eventually I was able to get this to stop, thankfully.If I hadn't already worn this bra I would return it.  In a pinch I would purchase this again, but if given more time, I would look for a more comfortable bra.
