This is a good looking watch; I have recieved several compliments.  The watch is not outrageously large, as are some on the market.  I selected this as I got tired of having to pay for batteries and then loosing the water-resistance.On a slightly lower note, this is a replacement for an identical watch which was unacceptably inaccurate. ( lost a full minute every day )  I contacted Invicta for warranty service and was quite put off at their response.  Not only would I have to pay to ship the watch to them (expected), but they wanted me to include a $28 MONEYORDER to pay for return shipping.  When I questioned the excessive shipping cost, I was told, " Well, that covers the INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING to the factory.  And, the repair could take up to 90 DAYS"  In other words, they had no Stateside repair facility!  So, I would have to pay about 2/3 of my purchase price and wait 3 months to get a factory-defective watch repaired. UNACCEPTABLE!At this point, I contacted Amazon and they took care of me, quickly and effectively.  I LOVE AMAZON !
