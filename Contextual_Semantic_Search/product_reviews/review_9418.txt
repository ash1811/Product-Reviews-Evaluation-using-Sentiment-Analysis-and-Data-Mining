These are excellent swim shorts. I swim everyday and these are awesome. Yes, they are thin however they are so comfortable. I bought three (red, heavy and light blue). They were delivered quickly to Singapore and the ordering process was very easy. I really like these shorts. they are lined which is really cool and they actually look awesome on me. I'm a competitive swimmer and these are great. Limited drag and great for laps. The navy and light blue ones tend to fade a little after a while, however, I think it makes them look more awesome. My friends comment on how cool they look on and where I got them from. I keep it a secret - ;-) Buy these shorts. you won't be disappointed. These shorts could be worn by all ages and body types. Me - I'm slim and swim everyday. well worth the money, comfort and awesomeness!!!
