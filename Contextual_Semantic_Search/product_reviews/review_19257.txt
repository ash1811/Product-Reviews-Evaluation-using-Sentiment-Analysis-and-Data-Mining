Love these pants.  These are "winter weight" material (fall, winter, or early spring - but not summer).  Very comfortable.  Love the deep pockets.  I am 5'3", 113 lbs., size 4/6.  I ordered these in medium.  It was the right choice for me.  They fit great.  Not too tight.  I probably could have gotten into a small, but am certain a small would have been too tight for my liking in the butt and especially the waist (2" waistband is pretty thick).  They have a generous length, which I like.  I wear them just below my natural waist (an inch below my belly button) and the length is perfect with shoes on, but still fine with socks around the house.  The colors are deep, bold and bright, as shown in the pictures.  I'm very pleased and would recommend these ... but recommend that you round up when it comes to the size unless you like them very fitted.
