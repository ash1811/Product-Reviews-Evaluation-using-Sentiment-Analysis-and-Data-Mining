The fabric's not that comfortable.They're a bit ugly. They look significantly better in the Amazon pic than they do in real life.The shape isn't that great - the lower butt part is pretty high so it doesn't cover my whole butt. The pouch doesn't seem more useful than the regular opening other underwear have.
