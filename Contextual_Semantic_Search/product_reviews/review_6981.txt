As another review stated, these are Man Socks! Thick enough to keep you warm and comfortable, yet thin enough to go comfortably into every pair of shoes I own. They are tough and well made, and they slip onto my feet like... well, like foot gloves. I feel my chest swell and my facial hair grow the minute these bad boys make it onto my feet. I could go out and wrestle a grizzly bear, and thanks to these socks I could run away in comfort. If Rambo ever had the need to wear socks, these would be it.
