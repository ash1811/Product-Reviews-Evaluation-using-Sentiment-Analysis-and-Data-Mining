they looked good but weren't nearly as comfortable as i was expecting. i ended up returning them. shoes need to be comfortable! i expected better after reading the reviews, so i was disappointed. if you want a comfortable shoe, i'd go with the sketcher go-walks. they  are super comfortable. great price, too.
