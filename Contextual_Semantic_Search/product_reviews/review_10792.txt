I've had this pair for over 6 years now, and I've worn them quite often.  They're to the point now where I'm wearing through the tread on the bottom, so I'm looking to replace them.  I definitely got my money's worth out of them though.  Breaking them in so that they really form to your feet can take a while, but once they do they're quite comfortable.Most people cringe when they associate the idea of opening a bottle with the bottom of your shoe, but it doesn't really bother me.  I just wipe the neck of the bottle with my shirt afterwards and I've never had a problem.
