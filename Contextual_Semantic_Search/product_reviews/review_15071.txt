It came exactly when expected, definetly not an xlarge, wish it would have been a little bigger, but still fits. Color isn't great, I ordered black and grey thinking it would be a decent looking grey, but its a crappy faded grey and even the black sleeves are faded, its just and all around cheap looking cotton shirt you'd get from somewhere like Walmart. Won't be ordering again.
