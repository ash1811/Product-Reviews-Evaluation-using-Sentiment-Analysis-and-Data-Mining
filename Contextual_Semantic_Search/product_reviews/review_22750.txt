if you want to stand out and not have the usual or not so tactical color scheme, this is for you. this fits me great, it is not too loose and not too tight. as a child i used to wear one that came with my rambo t-shirt and me being nostalgic of the past and goofy, i wanted to relive that moment and yet change it up a bit since i'm older. the colors from the image on here match what it is in real life so do not expect a bright purple but slightly toned down.
