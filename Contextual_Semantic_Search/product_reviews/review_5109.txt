When I ordered this  assumed it was for women's shoes. I should have noted that the reviews that I read werewritten by males so the pair that I received is a bit larger than I expected.  However, I have some Clarks thatthese trees will fit and I will keep them.  They are well made: the smell is wonderful, for me.
