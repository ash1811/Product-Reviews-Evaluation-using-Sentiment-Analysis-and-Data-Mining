Pros:-look professional despite being sneakers-have stayed very white despite heavy use at work-easy to wipe down if body fluids get on them-very comfortable to stand and walk/run around in all day at work-good arch and ankle support-no laces is GREAT for hospital work because nothing drags on the ground and risks contamination-fit is as expectedCons:-are a little clunky, not super &#34;fashionable&#34; (I wouldn't wear them anywhere except at work)
