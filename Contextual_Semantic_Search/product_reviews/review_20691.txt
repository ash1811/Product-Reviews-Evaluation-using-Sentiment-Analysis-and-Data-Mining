I am a professional and like to have just a bit of heel to go with my suits.  Not high because I am on my feet much of the day, but just a little bit.  I also want the shoe to look professional and not flashy or draw attention to the shoe itself.  Shoes should not be a distraction in my business.  I have worn Trotters for years - paying quite a bit at Nordstrom's for them.  When I saw these at a lower price, I wondered if quality would suffer.  They seem to be the same shoes as the ones at Nordstroms.  I just needed the double wide version.  I bought both wide and double wide and kept the double.
