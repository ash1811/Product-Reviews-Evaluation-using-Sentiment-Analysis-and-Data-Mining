I have had several zip around clutch wallets and it is the style I prefer.  The color is not fire engine red just a nice red color.  The leather is medium soft with a nice feel to it.  Love all the card holding spots and the area for a check book is easily used for something else. The snap closure is handy and keeps everything in place, you can access your money without having to open the clutch,  just  open the zippered area. Having a zipper change pocket on the side is so handy or you can use the zipper pocket in the zip around.  When all filled I still found this Buxton clutch to be fairly slim.  I'm very pleased with this clutch and would buy it again.
