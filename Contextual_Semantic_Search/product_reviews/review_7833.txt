I looked high and low to find THE perfect tank for my husband.  He absolutely loves these and says they are so soft.  They are nice and long.  We just bought another pack of these.  We washed them following the instructions and they did shrink a tiny bit, but that is expected with cotton.  My husband is 6' tall and weighs about 290 pounds and we ordered the x-large.  Hope that helps!
