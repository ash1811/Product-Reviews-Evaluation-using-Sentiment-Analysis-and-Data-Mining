I own "many"  Invicta watches and this one is my favorite {until I buy another Invicta}.  I simply love these watches.  The workmanship is awesome and with exception of MY breaking a band (link - not on this watch), everyone has been exceptional in quality and performance. The "9212 speedway" was a surprise and trust me there is no way the photo comes close to doing this chronometer justice.  The size is perfect and it is great for work or church.  If you are looking for a great product, exceptionall quality and a company standing behind what they make.  Welcome to the Invicta Family.
