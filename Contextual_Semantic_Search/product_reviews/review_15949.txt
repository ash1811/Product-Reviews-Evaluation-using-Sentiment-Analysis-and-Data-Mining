I have been wearing Thorlo Thick Cushioned and Reinforced Running and Sports socks since the late 60's. I first wore them for tennis, then racquetball for a total of 37 years. I'd buy six pair, then a dozen pair at a time, and mark them so that they got even wear. (Originally, you could get Thorlos with colored bands at the top - blue, red, grey, and plain.) In the last 5 years that I played - and played 6 days a week - any one pair of socks would last a month to 6 weeks maximum. It would not have been so bad, but they did not wear through where the reinforced heel was, but through the toe and at the ball of the foot. Whether the problem with the ball of the foot was left or right, I don't know. Both socks wore through in both places.I wrote to Thorlo when I had "stored up" 30 pair of socks and, since I ordered direct for the last 10 years, they sent me three free pair. Unfortunately, they had no reinforcement, and they ran within two weeks of wearing them. Just catch them on a toe nail or part of the shoe, and they ran. Comfortable, but they didn't last even when I just walked in them.My solution - when I was still playing racquetball - was to wear two pair at the same time. Even then, some just had to be discarded when there were holes three inches around on the soles.Last year, I switched to Nikes at half the cost. I have had no trouble whatsoever with the Nikes and though they're not as soft as Thorlo, at least I'm getting my money's worth. (A little softener in the water does nicely.) I just got six pair for $16.65. So, while I'm sorry to report that Thorlos are no longer what they used to be, I'm fairly confident that after 35+ years, I'm giving them a fair and accurate review.
