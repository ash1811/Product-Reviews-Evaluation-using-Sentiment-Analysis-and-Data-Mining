PLAYTEX WOMEN'S 18-HOUR ORIGINAL COMFORT STRAP BRA #4693 has been around a LONG time.  When a product has been around for a long time -- and especially if it comes in many colors -- one knows it is a GOOD product, whatever it is.  It doesn't pay manufacturers to make a product in lots of colours if it won't sell!This bra IS good.  It is comfortable and is easy to "twist".  That is, its easy, for people like me, who like a back-fastening bra, but just can't reach the back, to first put the hooks in the front, then twist the closed hooks around to the back.  Smooth process, easily done.The lift is fine.  The fit is fine.  The price isn't bad either.However, this bra comes equipped with "stretch-ever" elastic, on the bottom, sides, and back of this bra.  It's a kind of a super stretch-lace -- very pretty and very thick. And, sadly, it eventually stretches TOO much....After about three years of wearing this bra 8 hours a day, (365 x 8 x 3 = 8760),something very STRANGE happens to the "stretch ever" elastic.  It changes form!It no longer appears to be "stretchy lace", but instead, a grey kind of stickyrubber appears were the white, (in white bras), stretch-lace used to be.  The lace design is still there -- but it now contrasts with the grey, rubber-like backing.This backing almost feels like silly putty, and is malleable between your fingers.Three years is a good life-span for any bra.  It's just this very unpleasant "surprise" of a greyish-rubberized semi-goo, suddenly appearing rightbeneaath the pretty flower-lace of my bra that really threw me for a loop, the first time it happened, many years ago.But, hey, the bra fits, it feels great, and it's price is good.  And It lasts approximately three years, before the "change" occurs, and the "grey monster" suddenly appears.  Just be aware of this fact, and you won't be as shocked as I was.This bra is still my favourite!
