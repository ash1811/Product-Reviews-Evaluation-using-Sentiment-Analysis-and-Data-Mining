I ordered a large...it fits!  The material is comfortable...waiting to see if it's as durable as my other Carhartt t-shirts. Some of my other t-shirts are extra large and they fit just as wells as this large shirt.......I have plenty of carhart shirts and t-shirts....sizing continues to be hit or miss.
