I based my purchase of these Easy Spirit Traveltime Slip-on based on the 1059 average of five-star reviews (of course I didn't read them all  :)) but boy, were the reviewers right!  As soon as they arrived I took them out of the box and slipped them right on and they fit perfectly like a shoe I had had for a year.  Totally true to size and width.  Most times I wait until I own an item for a bit before I write a review but with this little shoe &#34;miracle&#34; I couldn't wait to give them 5 stars!
