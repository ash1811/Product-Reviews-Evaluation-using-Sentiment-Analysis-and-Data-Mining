I wore these slippers daily because I live with fibromyalgia and do not get outside much. After 3 months they have completely flattened, stretched out and the heels wore down. I thought they might last longer than 3 months. I weigh about 135 lbs. so I don't think weight is a factor. Very DisappointedLowered my rating even more when I noticed the stiching came lose today. I have another pair of Isotoner Clog slippers that were a gift and they only lasted 3 months. I will be writing to Isotoner for what that's worth.
