I've been wearing Doc Marten books for years and have not found a better boot for every day type wear. Other boots tend to be too hiking oriented or not 'boss' enough (like the slip on dress boots that seem to be a bit popular right now).Although I decry the fact that Dr. Marten's are now made in China, what can you do? If they were still made in England, they would probably cost upwards of US $300. I guess we win because we can buy them for just about $80. and while I feel the quality isn't quite as good as when they were made in England, the cheaper price makes up for it. But this is the reason I'm not giving them a full 5 stars-I feel a bit of their specialness and cach&eacute; has been lost by them being outsourced to China.I had the greasy finish ones previously and while the leather was initially a lot softer and more comfy, they didn't hold up as well. Mine developed a weird discoloration after a while and it wasn't my fault, I didn't do anything wrong. Also the the die rubbed off on my white socks which was annoying. I feel the smooth finish ones are more durable and they don't exhibit the same problems.In all, I can recommnend this pair of boots, especially for the price. They will never go out of style and should provide you years of usage. They look equally as good with a pair of jeans or with a suit. Penn Jillette of magician duo Penn and Teller swears by these boots and wears that on stage every night. I've also seen many other performers wearing them on stage from Michael Stipe, Bono, Pattie Smith, Depeche mode and Iggy Pop. I think they are ubiquitous-comfortable, durable, and look good under practically any circumstance. I can go from a job interview to working on my car without having to change shoes.
