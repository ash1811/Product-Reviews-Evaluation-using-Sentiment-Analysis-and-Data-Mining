For the price, I think this is a fine costume. No more cheaply made than the next Halloween costume but because it's so simple, you can't really tell. It was a hit at the party I attended (I went with someone dressed in a priest costume made by the same company - great couples' idea)! It would earn an extra star if it came with the cross. I had to buy one for another ten bucks at the last minute.
