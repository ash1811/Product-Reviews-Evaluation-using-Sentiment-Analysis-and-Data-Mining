Nice normal rubber boots, not too plasticky or flimsy.I wear a size 12, but I have a wide forefoot and a lot of shoes just hurt my forefoot unless I go a size bigger, in which case my heel slides out. But my chukkas, Merrill's (too tight), Allen Edmonds, and Patagonia shoes are all size 12. (My hiking boots Are 12.5 or 13.)So I thought 12 would be a good fit for these runner boots, but my foot doesn't quite lock in. They fit well enough to handle some muddy tasks in the yard, but I wouldn't want to walk around in them all day for fear of blisters.
