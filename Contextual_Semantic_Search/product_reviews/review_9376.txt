These are great quality for the price. They are far superior to many of the sweatpant type things that I have bought before. They fit is more flattering, and the leg is a slight boot cut, but is not tapered at the end. The fabric is very soft and breatheable. The top of the pant is a double-layered fabric panel, that can be folded down to a comfortable length. The only issue I have here is that the back is a little too low when sitting. I really don't think you could get more for your money here.
