I bought this for my 5 year old boy a few months ago and wanted to wait for a little while before I write a review.  The novelty wears out so quickly for most 5 year olds... I really wanted to see how it holds up quality-wise and whether it my son is interested in it weeks later.  Well, this is a winner for us!  My little boy has worn it almost every day since I purchased it for him and he even slept in in it for a few nights!  We get text messages from NASA about the ISS crossing of our sky and we watch it whenever possible.  My little boy puts his astronaut suit and salutes the ISS for the few minutes that we can see it clearly in orbit! :-)  This suit has been washed at least a dozen times since I bought it and it held up just fine, - still looks like new from the dryer!  So far it has not stained or torn anywhere... well made and gets lots of compliments (of course it could be because we practically wear it everywhere we go and at least one person is bound to comment on it!).  If your child loves everything about space this suit is a must have for him/her!  I highly recommend it!
