Love this scarf.  Will probably buy more in different colors.  Was caught in a cold, wet and windy storm and put this on my head and around my neck and it saved me!  Dried nicely to wear again. It is not 100% pashima though.  It is 70% pashima and 30% silk, which is fine by me, though the description should be changed (if it hasn't been already).
