I wore these socks all winter, and just decided to order some more for next year just in case (I hope not) they become unavailable.  I have worn Thorlo socks for years and swear by them.  My last favorite (white women's &#34;walking socks&#34;) were discontinued. I hope these don't go that same way!! But having said that, I trust Thorlo to keep coming out with new designs that are just as great.
