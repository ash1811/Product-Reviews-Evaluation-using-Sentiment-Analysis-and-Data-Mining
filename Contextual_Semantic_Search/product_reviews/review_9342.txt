These shoes go with everything and you can't beat Enzo Angiolini shoes for style and fit as well as good wear.  I sometimes wear an 8M (US) in other brands but in the Angiolini shoes I wear a 7.5M (US).  I was so happy to see this style is still made as I had a pair of them years ago.  Congratulations Enzo Angiolini for sticking with a style and fit that works year after year!  Amazon's price for these shoes is a good buy as well.
