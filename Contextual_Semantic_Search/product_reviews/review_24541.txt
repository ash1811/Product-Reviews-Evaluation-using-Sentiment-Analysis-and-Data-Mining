Stride Rite's Austin athletic shoe is a well made and versatile shoe.The quality of the leather is nice, and the stitching is strong throughout the shoe. It has a heavy dute sole that should wear well for quite a while, even for an active child.The shoe itself is heavy, not like an ultra light sneaker (which most kids probably don't wear anyway).Note - there is little padding on the inside of the shoe, which may or may not make a difference depending on your child's foot.This shoe comes in W & XW sizes.Another great thing about this shoe is that it's gender neutral, so a boy or girl could wear it.I love Stride Rite's quality and versatility in the Austin athletic shoe.I won't buy this style again, because honestly, I ordered one in every size. With the sales/discounts it was about $13 per pair, and I can easily sell used pairs for this much at the consignment shop.
