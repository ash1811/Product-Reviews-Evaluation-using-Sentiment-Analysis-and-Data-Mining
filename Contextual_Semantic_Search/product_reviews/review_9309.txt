The pants are extremely comfortable, good quality material and warm in winter. The first time I wore it, I didn't want take it off as it is a very comfortable type material, soft and warm. It does pick up lint but after each wash looks like new. My dogs have jumped on me with muddy paws but the stains came out with the first wash. My only critisism would be the placement of the pockets, would look more flattering in front than on the side (similar to Classic Metro style). Also, the back pockets are faux. I have ordered two more pairs, one in same colour and the other in black.
