I was hoping for more arch support for my high arches, but the footbed seemed fairly flat to me. However, if you have flat feet, this amount of arch support is probably fine (I would call it minimal, but I suppose it is all a matter of perspective).  Otherwise, the shoes seemed well made and comfortable and they easily accommodated my wide feet and narrow heels.
