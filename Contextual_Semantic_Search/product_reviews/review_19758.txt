This slipper appeared to be so soft and supple.  Absentmindedly, I forgot it was an Isotoner product. Isotoner makes very thick soles which are perfect for walking outside if needed (it did advertise Clog). But I wanted the other slippers (I lost one but then found it after I got these, ha, ha.) I still use them on occasion.
