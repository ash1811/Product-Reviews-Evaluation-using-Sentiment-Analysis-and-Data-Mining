This watch replaced my "Helbros" watch of similar size and build.  The Invicta watch cost $10 more but feels like hundreds more.  The watch fills my need for stainless diver look.  It has a good feel and looks like a quality piece.The ratcheting ring is slippery, not particularly functional.  Looks shiny and polished- in contrast to other diver watches with brushed finishes this one stands out.  Band has row of polished links- has a bit of bling-ness to it.I am very hard on my watches, this one has survived several drops to hard floors.  These usually finish off watches that are not engineered well.
