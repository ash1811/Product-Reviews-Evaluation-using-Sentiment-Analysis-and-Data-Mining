Tried them on and they fit fine, the fabric is good weight and length was good for me.  I am pretty standard size 10.  I went to put my hand in the pocket and it was only 3 inches deep, token pockets in the front and no rear pockets.  There are fake placket and no pockets!  They went back, did not mind paying for shipping to get rid of these.
