Big student backpack wider on top than superbreak.  We love both... And like many Jansports they hold up to the wear.  Other reviews (and I agree) state that the zipper does get stuck on the backpack itself... which is difficult to fix but is fixable.  no other backpack for the price holds up to my teens high school honors books and binders which can be quick heavy.Also not that the shoulder straps are more padded, durable than the superbreak jansport.  Both do there job.The photo isn't as pretty as in person.... Daughter was very pleased.
