I'M ON MY THIRD PAIR OF KEEN TARGHEE HIKING SHOES AND THEY HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE VERY BEST MID-WEIGHT HIKING SHOES I'VE EVER OWNED. SUPURB,COMFORTABLE FIT RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX WITH PLENTY OF TOE ROOM AND A VERY SUPPORTIVE FOOT BED AND HEEL COUNTER. THE SHANK IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO FOR A GOOD PUSH OFF BUT STRONG ENOUGH TO PROTECT AGINST THE SHARPEST OF ROCKS AND SCREE ON THE TRAIL. IT FEELS LIKE YOU HAVE AN UP-ARMORED HUMVEE ON YOUR FEET. SUPPORTIVE, CUSHIONED AND PROTECTED. THE WRAP UP TOE BUMPER IS A NICE FEATURE. THESE ARE MY FAVORITE LOW RISE HIING SHOE. I'VE WORN THEM OVER MANY MILES OF VERY ROUGH TERRAIN AND NEVER ANY SORE FEET. A WINNER......
