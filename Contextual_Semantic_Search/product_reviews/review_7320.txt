My 3 year old daughter has rather wide feet her size 9 ballet shoes were getting too short and they had always been a bit snug in the width, leaving an elastic impression over her foot for an hour after class.  When it was time to move to a 10 for length, I decided to go wide (W), hoping they would offer just a little extra give.  They are a LOT more wide than the standard shoe.  The shoe itself is almost 1 inch wider and then the elastic band has a HUGE amount of strapping.  These are for extremely wide feet, not just little flintstone feet like my daughter has.  She has always worn wide shoes, like Striderite WIDES, Crocs, etc. but these are too wide.  They might work for some, but I would not order these without trying on.  The other standard (non-wide) 9's fit okay, so I didn't think trying on was necessary.  I was wrong.  The difference in 1 shoes size and W, feels like about 3 sizes too big.
