This billfold is made of soft leather yet manages to feel very sturdy and "together" with a good no-nonsense design. While it's true that the pockets feel a bit too small for cards at first, the leather is pliable and will eventually mold itself to the size you need, allowing things to fit snugly inside the billfold without falling out while providing easy access to the cards you use most.All in all it's a trim, elegant billfold.
