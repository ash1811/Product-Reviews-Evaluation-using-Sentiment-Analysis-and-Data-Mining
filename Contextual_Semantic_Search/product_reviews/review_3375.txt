I have these exciting undies in pink. The simple waistband doesn't tell everyone I am wearing nylon panties when it peeks over my slacks. The gentle but snug leg elastic keeps me inside the panties (no fallout) and the full seat offers good coverage. This style runs somewhat large in the cut of the fabric. That is a good thing for a mature gent as there is extra slippery nylon fabric in front to hold and caress all day long ! The slinky nylon stretches to support most any happy wearer. I would recommend these 'feel good' panties for any man.
