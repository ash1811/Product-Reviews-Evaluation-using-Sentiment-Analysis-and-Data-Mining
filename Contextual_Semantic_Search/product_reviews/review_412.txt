When buying Converse brand shoes be sure to buy them a size smaller than what you would normally wear with most other brands. Converse uses a different measuring system than other major brands (which makes no sense to me), which is why you should order about a size smaller for males or females. I ordered a female size 7.5 for someone who normally wears a 8.5 in women, and it fit well. Hope this helps!
