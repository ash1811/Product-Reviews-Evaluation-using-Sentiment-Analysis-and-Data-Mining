I think Wigwam socks are uniformly comfortable and well made. They are reasonably priced, and I appreciate that they are made in the USA. These socks are very comfortable, especially around the toes, a troublesome spot for many socks, they don't slip (yet don't feel constricting,) and dry out quickly. They are also treated with something called FreshGuard which is said to eliminate odors. I use these as daily wear general purpose socks and I run in them a lot as well. They aren't as cushioned as some socks I have worn, but do have a cushioned sole that is, for me, more than adequate for running. I think these socks are a compelling value, and I plan to buy more.
