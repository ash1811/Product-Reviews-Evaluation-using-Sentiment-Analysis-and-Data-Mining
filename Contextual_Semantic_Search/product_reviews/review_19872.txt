I was wary of buying boots online but am happy to say that these boots fit true to size. They are a bit loose in the ankle as stated in other reviews but after a couple of days getting broken in they seems to fit better. These are comfy, well made boots and I am happy with my purchase (they look great with both jeans and skirts)!
