Make sure you order two sizes up from the current speedo size that you wear.  These are intended to be a couples sizes bigger.  Everyone complaining about the legs being to tight I don't understand what the problem is.  I used to swim competitively years ago and we all trained with a drag suit.  It was suppose to be a little tight around your' legs.  You always ordered a good 2 sizes larger.  I wear a 32 and ordered a 36 for my drag suit.  Fits like a dream.  This should add to your' overall fitness overtime.  It isn't going to be a miracle wonder and make you drop tons of time when you go to race but, it will add some drag/resistance to your' swim and will help get your' arms more &#34;toned&#34;/strengthened.
