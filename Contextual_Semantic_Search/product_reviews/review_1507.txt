It's like the old saying "if you buy cheap, you buy twice" Carhart is quality no other way to put it.  Just last night I ordered 2 more pairs of work pants and I know I will not be disappointed. I have this same shirt purchased 7 years ago and even though they show some wear are still doing the job each time I put them on.
