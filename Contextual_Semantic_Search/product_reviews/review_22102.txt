The shoe fits nicely but will need to have an elastic strap added so I can do my walking in them.  I had hoped they would stay on without it, but better safe than sorry.  I didn't want to have to get shoes that tied so I could just slip them on and go.  Manufacturers might think about adding an elastic strap, maybe one that could be removed.  Still, nice shoes.
