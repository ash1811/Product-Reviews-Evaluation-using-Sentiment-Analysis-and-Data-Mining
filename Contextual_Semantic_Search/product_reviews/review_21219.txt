I have several pair of Sanuk board walkers but this was my first pair of flip flops. after wearing these i hate my other flip flops. these are so comfortable; i hate wearing shoes in general but i wear these all year! (even when it's snowing-I've been wearing them around the house) I would recommend you buy at least 2 pair- you will need a neutral color because you will want to wear them with every outfit!
