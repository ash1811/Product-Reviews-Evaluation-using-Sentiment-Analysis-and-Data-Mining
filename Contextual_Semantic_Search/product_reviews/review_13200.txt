This bra is attractive, comfortable and provides good coverage, especially for a mature figure.  The best part for me is that, unlike a lot of modern bras, the cups are not made of molded foam, so the bra does not add any bulk to your bustline (a problem for me with most other bras.  If there's extra bulk, I can't button my blouses).  The cups are fabric, more traditional in style but do the job nicely.  The side bands are side and help with bra bulge.  Good support, comfortable straps.  A little more traditional, but all the good things about a traditional bra, and prettier.  I bought two more to cover all my wardrobe needs.
