I purchased this for Christmas for my husband.  It was one of three Invictas that I bought for him.  We were both very pleased with it.  He absolutely LOVES it.  It's a substantial watch.  Feels and looks very expensive.  Can't beat the price!  So, buy this watch with confidence...I highly recommend it.
