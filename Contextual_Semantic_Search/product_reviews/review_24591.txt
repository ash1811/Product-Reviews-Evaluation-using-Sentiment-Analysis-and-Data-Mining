I have been home bound for a month post surgery and have worn these slippers the entire time.  Being in February 2014 it has been a brutally cold month, and these slippers handle any and all breezes with ease.  These do have memory foam in them, but isn't their best feature, although comfy.The best feature of these are the ingress and egress factor, absolutely stunning!  These can literally be jumped into, making these perfect for those that are mobility limited.Have not tried to clean these yet, however I do not see that being a stumbling block, they aren't waterproof but have been able to handle the light duty snow I have as well.
