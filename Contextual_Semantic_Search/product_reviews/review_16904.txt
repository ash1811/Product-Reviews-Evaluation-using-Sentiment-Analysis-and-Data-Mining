I need a large bra, and this is the only brand I've ever found that holds up! Literally and figuratively, lol. Glamorise is well made and lasts a long time. This particular bra is very comfortable to wear all day, stays in place and keeps everything in its place. I will definitely continue to purchase these bras. Absolutely no complaints.
