Very sweet bra and is a perfect fit.  I'm a 38D and the fit was right on.  Not too tight, yet no excess material anywhere.  The straps are very narrow and very feminine.  My only worry is that they aren't going to hold up over time.  It's a beautiful little accessory.  I bought one in almost every color.
