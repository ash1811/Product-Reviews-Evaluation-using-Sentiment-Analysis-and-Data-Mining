This is my second pair (first purchased in a Sanuk store in Honolulu). It sounds totally cheesy, but they ARE like walking on clouds, marshmallows, yoga mats (duh!), memory foam pillows...well, you get the point. I was a non-flip-flop wearer, because I hated things between my toes, but I tried these on, on a whim, and, well, you forget the toe thingie is there. I'm recommending to all my SoCal buddies. They're not blingy, but they ARE good for very long walks without aching tootsies.One thing, though -- when they get wet, they are NOT happy. They soak up water and take a long time to dry out. I have successfully washed my first pair, however, and they dried fine and cleaned up nicely (this one is not kind to shoes).
