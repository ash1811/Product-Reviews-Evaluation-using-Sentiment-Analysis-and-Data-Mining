This is a good pack.  Seems sturdy and is clearly larger than your average Jansport, yet smaller than a full-on camping pack.  Great in-between size.  I use it for gym clothes and other gear.Only drawback is the waist strap is utterly pointless.  It's way too high and provides no support whatsoever.  A case of lazy design.  Otherwise, it would have been 5 stars.
