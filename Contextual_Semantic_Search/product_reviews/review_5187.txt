I think 5 Stars describes a watch so perfect that I hesitate with the highest rating! I would certainly give this watch 4.5 Stars for it fits, works and looks very nice on my mother's wrist. She has become quite the devoted swimmer at 82 and before she had this other ugly watch with large display and very cheap looking (probably because we got it for free with one of those magazine deals!). I bought it as a gift but knew better of the many uses she would find for it in the coming year. The bottom line? She likes it, looks good wearing it and for $5 Dollars we have extended the warranty (if anything goes wrong she gets a replacement) for an additional 4 years from Timex (information included on the very large paper that came with the watch instructions). She is happy and when Big Mama is happy all is well in my world. Timex is reliable and the price quite appealing. 4.5 Stars for  the Timex Women's Ironman Triathlon Sleek 50/100 Watch #T59201 (What a Title for such a cute little thing!).
