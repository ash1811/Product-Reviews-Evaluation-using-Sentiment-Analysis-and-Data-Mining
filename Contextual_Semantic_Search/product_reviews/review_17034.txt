My TAG Aquaracer has been too tight for ages and I never got around to taking it in to a jeweler to have a link added.  After years of paying for link changes in my watches, I bought this.  It took me only a few minutes to add an additional link.  You will need a pair of needle nose pliers to finish removing the pin and small hammer to put the pin back in.  Also, be careful the "exiting" side of the pin will clear the slot in the end.  I did bend my first pin because of this.  Not a big deal, just be cognizant of this and you'll be fine.  Well worth such a small price.  The quality seems good as well.  Recommended.
