Having left my small umbrella in the grocery basket, I was looking for a replacement.Based on the reviews I purchased this product. It was the size I wanted and the price seemed reasonable. I put it in my car and I have yet to use it so I can't comment on how well it works except to say the automatic oprning mechanism seems to work fine. The umbrella also looked well made. I am happy with my purchase.
