I am a 32 D which is very hard to find.  This style/brand carried my size and upon arriving I noticed the fit is fabulous.  I bought one in every color.  No funny bumps or bulges under shirts, no itchy fabric, no fluff and puff pads, just very natural and beautiful.  Very supportive, I highly recommend this product.  The price is unbelievably low for the high quality.
