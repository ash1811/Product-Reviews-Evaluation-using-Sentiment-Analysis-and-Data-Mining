I am really, really, really picky about flip flops. My favorite pair always seems to get discontinued, and I tend to wear them into the ground, because I can't face the thought of hunting down new ones that I'll like as much. These were my second or third try, and I adore them. They're fast to put on, the arch support feels good, and they seem to match everything. The straps fit a little bit tighter than most, which feels unusual at first, but is actually really comfortable- they chafe your toes on long walks or smack loudly against the ground the way some do. I've been wearing them almost daily for several months.
