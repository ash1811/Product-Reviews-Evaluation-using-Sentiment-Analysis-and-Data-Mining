It's amazing how hard it is to find pantyhose that aren't control top.  So I am very happy with these.  Everything else about them is great.  I also like that they have a reinforced toe to last a bit longer.  Like all pantyhose they don't last forever, but hey, they're pantyhose.  My go-to color is travel buff - totally neutral.  For dressier occasions I use the barely black color.  These are very sheer and look great.
