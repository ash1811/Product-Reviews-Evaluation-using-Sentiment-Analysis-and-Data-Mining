Wrangler makes a great pair of loose fitting jeans for gentlemen who want a slightly more relaxed look to their jeans; and these jeans are also a good choice for people like me who are slightly overweight. They just plain give you extra room; and that's great!The denim is nice and thick; and these jeans are extremely durable. They last for years at a time without any troubles or fraying at the bottoms of the legs. They are permanent press although I would wash these jeans with similar colors to avoid any color dye bleeding onto white garments in the wash or dryer cycle.The only disappointment for me is that these jeans do sit a bit low, just as Amazon says they do. I find that I am pulling them up a bit more often that I would like to pull them up, even with a belt I wish they would stay higher up. Of course, this is a minor disappointment because you can just pull up your jeans in the blink of an eye; although it is slightly embarrassing in public. I will take off a star for this because I want to be sure people take note that these jeans are lower at the waist.Overall, these fine jeans by Wrangler easily rival any jeans made by other manufacturers. Make sure you choose the right size and color for you if you're using the charts above on this webpage. If you want a pair of loose fitting jeans, this may be just what you're looking for--if you choose to buy these jeans I doubt that you'll be disappointed.Wear `em in good health!  SMILE
