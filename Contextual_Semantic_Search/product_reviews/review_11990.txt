These shoes are the best shoes I have bought in a long time! Fit is great, they are so incredibly comfortable, and lightweight with good traction! I needed some walking shoes that could hold up to the winter ice and snow, and these are perfect for my needs! I read the reviews from others who purchased these shoes who have health problems that affect their legs, which I relate to, and am glad I followed their recommendation of these shoes! I would give them more than five stars if I could.
