Good value for the money.  Of course durability is the best test, but I'll update that in a year.Great fit for me (XL).  Length is good and fits well through the shoulders.  Washed up very nicely on the 'out of the bag' initial wash.  Based on a bad experience with similar sweatshirts in the past, I used the lowest dryer setting to eliminate the possibility of shrinkage.  With imported clothing, it's really hard to know what is set and what is not.Definitely recommend this sweatshirt to anyone looking for low price and decent quality.
