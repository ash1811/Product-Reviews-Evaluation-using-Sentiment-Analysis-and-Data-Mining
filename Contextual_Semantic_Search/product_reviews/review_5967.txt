I just got them and they are actually lighter than I expected.  It was like slipping a glove on.  They feel great.I will start breaking them in tomorrow, but It is not going to take a lot of time.  They are super.  I have a wide foot with a high instep.  No problems there.  I have had Vasque and a couple others.  I love my Vasque from 1972, but they seemed to have slipped in the styling and manufacturing.  These look rugged and feel like slippers.  We'll see in the next couple of days.
