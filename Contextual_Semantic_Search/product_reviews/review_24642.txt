These slippers make a fantastic gift. When I bought them to replace a loved-one's worn out pair, I received lots of praise and unsolicited compliments on how comfortable and great they feel on your feet. Indeed. I wish I had bought a pair for myself, but my current pair are still in OK condition. Maybe someday.
