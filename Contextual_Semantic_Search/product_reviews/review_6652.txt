I'm a big fan of these socks, but wouldn't class them as 'no-show'. They don't seem that much shorter then my other UA standard anklet socks.They are, however, very well made. My only other observation is that they are probably slightly warmer then standard sports socks. Although this might suit you in colder climates, it may not be your cup of tea.Cheers,JFE
