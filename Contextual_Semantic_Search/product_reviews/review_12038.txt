The shoes arrived true to size.  Very little padding on the interior make these shoes fine for working at a desk all day but they would not be appropriate for someone who had to do a lot of walking (outside sales).  The shoes were reasonably priced and are constructed as such.  No frills but work as a functional dress shoe.
