I have problem feet and have a job that keeps me on my feet all day.  The Spira Women's Classic shoe was comfortable when I first put it on and remained comfortable the entire time I was working.  There is a seam close to where my bunions are and so far have not presented a problem.  I will more than likely buy another pair.
