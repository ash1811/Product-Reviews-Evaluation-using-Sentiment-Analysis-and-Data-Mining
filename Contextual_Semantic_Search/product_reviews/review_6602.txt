I love these tights. They're nice and thick, go on easily and you don't feel like you'll run them just by adjusting them a bit while wearing. One issue I did have was the waistband. It is a little snug, but at the suggestion of another reviewer, I just cut a little slit in it and it fit much better. My stomach is not big by any means either, so I do think that Danskin could loosen the waist up a bit and it would fit more comfortably.
