I purchased these shoes for my husband in the gunsmoke brown color. They are very nice looking shoes. My husband says they fit him perfectly and are extremely comfortable to wear.  In fact, he likes them so much that he will hardly take them off.  I'm planning to order him another pair in a different color soon.
