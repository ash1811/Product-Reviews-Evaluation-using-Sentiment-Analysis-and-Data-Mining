I loved the shape of the cups on this bra. Very natural but not too &#34;flat&#34; looking. Helps give a little shape without changing the shape of your breasts.I really wanted to like this bra, but the wires really really poked me. The bra also seemed a little cheap as the materials weren't as nice as I had hoped. I still would have kept it, but I sent it back because the wires hurt me.
