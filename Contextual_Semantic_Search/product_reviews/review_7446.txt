I love them but that can just be me, so I would start by what I think people might dislike. They are VERY big so a 6-9 is really more like a 12. Also, once you wash them they become kind of saggy and the fitted part in the ankle looses its fit. HOWEVER, I love them because they are nice, they do not fade, they match everything, since they are so big my baby can use them for a long time. Also, they are very light (not bulky). I love that they are ONE plain color, no bows, hearts, princess stuff, and so forth. you can combine them with many things. I also liked the price.What I do so my baby does not trip because they are long is to fold them and use them kind of like capris. they look really cute! Like she was ready to go to the beach.
