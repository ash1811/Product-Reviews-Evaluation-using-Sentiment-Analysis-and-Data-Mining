I have been wearing this bra for years.  I don't go in for glamour but for practicality, and it is certainly practical.  It is dependably well-fitting and comfortable.  I do find that these bras last longer when hand washed, as advised.  Amazon's price is a fair one, and usually less than that of department stores.
