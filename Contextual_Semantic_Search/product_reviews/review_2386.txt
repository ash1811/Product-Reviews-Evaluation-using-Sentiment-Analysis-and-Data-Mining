I purchased this watch on Amazon five years ago, and it still looks great, and works well. The band is alot less likely to snag arm hairs than the link bands out there, and it is very light and thin. I can wear it hiking, to dinners, to meetings, or event riding a motorcycle, as it is thin enough to fit under a suit cuff, or a motorcycle glove cuff.This is Skagen at its' simplest and best.
