Hanes makes an excellent "Authentic Tagless Pocket Tee" shirt for guys. I love to wear these tee shirts in summer; and of course they're every bit as good for warm days in spring and fall. The fabric is easy on your skin; it doesn't scratch or itch and if you want it extra soft all you need to do is add fabric softener to the wash when you wash it.Moreover, these shirts last a lot longer than I thought they would. Given the low price I simply assumed that one season would be about the limit of what I could get out of these shirts. Nope! Even the stitching is much better than I expected. Happily, I was wrong--these shirts last two or even three seasons with the proper care.And the "proper care" isn't too difficult, either. Just wash in any permanent press cycle. Again, just add in some fabric softener whenever you want the shirt to be extra soft; this is especially good for guys with extra sensitive skin.Last but not least, the shirt pocket comes in handy. Sometimes when I drive or go around doing my errands, I can just put a few things into the pocket for easy access. Things shouldn't fall out as you drive or walk around and that's a nice plus. You can also put a pen or two into the pocket if you wish.Overall, I really can't think of anything negative to say about this product. It can even be worn as an undershirt in colder weather. I must have about seven or eight of them right now; and I'll be buying more in the future.
