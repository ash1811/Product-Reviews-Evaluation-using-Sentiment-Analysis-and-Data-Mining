These pants fit as loose as expected in the seat, crotch, and legs.  They are very comforable.  However, the denim is quite thin, which isn't necessarily a bad thing for comfort but may be for durability.  They feel a little more like dress pants when on than like jeans!I would buy them again if they wear well.Update 1/23/14:I took the jeans down to 1 star, if I could go negative I would. These jeans wear horribly. They are a few months old and they are falling apart. Belt loops have fallen off. The coin pocket area of both pair I purchased is ripped. To address these issues, I have not worn them for any kind of manual labor work. Normal office work, and I have never used the coin pocket.  Levis quality has went down the drain. I absolutely will never again buy Levis products. That is $80 wasted on two pair.Run, don't walk away from this product.
