This is the second pair of Evans' slippers I've bought from Amazon.  The first pair were "Opera Slippers", and they were okay, but didn't last long.  These "Chicopee" slippers are a similar design.  They are very light weight, soft-soled, without a lot of padding, and no fleece, or fur lining. My feet get very warm in shoes & socks, but are usually cold in flip flops, so I buy light weight slippers to wear around the house. I'm still wearing these slippers, despite the fact that the upper seam, just behind the big toe on one of them, split open within 2 weeks.  I won't be buying any more of the Evans products.  I thought these were too expensive, but I have a narrow foot, and can't find shoes/slippers in retail stores.  I really love shopping through Amazon, but unless they start carrying another line, I'll have to buy my slippers elsewhere.
