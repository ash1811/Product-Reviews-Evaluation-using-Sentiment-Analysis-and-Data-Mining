I purchased this book bag for my daughter who is in nursing school.  She loves it.  Has lots of room for all her books and other compartments to organize all her other "essentials!"  Had a Jansport in college and it made it all the way through.  Good quality and durable.  Would definitely recommend.  Why buy several book bags when you just need to purchase one good one!
