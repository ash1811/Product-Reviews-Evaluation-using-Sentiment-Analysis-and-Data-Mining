I have bad balance due to variety of back problems. Yaktrax give excellent traction in all icy conditions.  They also add mental confidence, so I am less jittery in the icy conditions.They are pretty stretchy and fit on variety of my boots which vary in size by 1 size.  They are sturdy, I have used them for several winters - no rusting, no breaking, still work as good as new.  I recommend this product.
