Don't expect the thick, long lasting quality that you would have expected from Lee 20 years ago.  If you wear these just once every few months for going to the bars, you're probably ok.  But if you intend to wear these daily as part of your working wardrobe - buy something else like Dickies or Carhartt... or really anything but Lee.  My lifestyle is that I wear jeans as daily wear to go shopping and to do chores around the house.  I'm not rough on my clothes, but I don't feel I should have to change them just because I decide to leave the pavement now and then.I bought 4 pairs of these at one time while on sale ($11/per pair) and they have all ripped at the rear pocket.  Inspecting the material, the pocket is well stitched, however the material itself has ripped at the seat of the pants, exposing your underwear.  I've put no unusual strain on the pockets and simply only put the occasional papers or hankerchief in it.  The tear isn't usually bad at first, but degrades over time.  The last pair ended up splitting halfway down my leg while I was out car shopping... I had to finish signing the sales paperwork with my butt exposed.  Thanks Lee....
