I generally go to DXL and wear Harbor Bay shirts and wear 5XLT and can now wear 4XLT comfortably.  That being said I ordered both a 5XLT and 4XLT figuring for the cheap price these are going for that if they did run small that I could wear the bigger one and would soon be able to wear the 4XL.  The 5XL was even a tad bit tight.  Wearable and a little shorter than I'm used to but it's not a tall shirt either.  Just a heads up in case you shop elsewhere and are looking here expect them to be a little smaller than you may be used to, but the price is very nice compared to others.
