I already own this particular Shining Image jewelry box in brown, so this was my second buy. It arrived with some of the leather scratched, even though it looked like I was the first one opening the box. This particular color pink also looked pretty bad in person. The quality of this box seemed lesser than the brown one I own.I returned this pink case for a refund without a problem.  Got another brown Shining Image jewelry case and it's fine!
