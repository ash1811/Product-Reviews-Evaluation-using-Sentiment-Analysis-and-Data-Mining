This is a great looking watch and very comfortable.  When I bought it, I added a replacement watch band to my shopping cart because I just *knew* I wouldn't like the band on this watch.  I was wrong - I love the band on this watch and plan to keep it.  Like some people already stated, the band is a bit stiff when putting on the watch, but once it is on it's very comfortable.  The dial has an expensive look to it.  The movement is quartz, so of course it's super accurate.
