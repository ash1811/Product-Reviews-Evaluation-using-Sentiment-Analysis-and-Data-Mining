This backpack is HUGE! I was in the market for a bigger backpack because my old backpack's zipper broke from overstuffing. I was delighted to see that I could fit everything in it from my old backpack and still had room for much, much more. I love the design on the backpack, and the colors and I love the lifetime warranty that comes with these backpacks.
