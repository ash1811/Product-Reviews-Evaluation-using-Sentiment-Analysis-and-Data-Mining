After years of trying different brands and suffering from endless wedgies, these are absolutely the only underwear I'll ever buy again.  They are incredibly comfortable, and unless your pants are skin-tight, they really don't show a panty line; the elastic around legs and hip is so thin.  That thin elastic, plus the right amount of stretch and shape in the derriere means they also don't ride up.  The hip brief is my favorite style; they hit below the waist so don't look like granny panties (and I'm a granny!), but not as low cut as a bikini.  They are nearly perfect in every way; I just wish they made a few more colors and cuter patterns but I can live with that given the comfort level!
