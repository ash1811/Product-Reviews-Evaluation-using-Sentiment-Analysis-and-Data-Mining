This bra is so secure and hides some stuff too in the back. The bands on the shoulders are wide and don't hurt.  I love this bra so much that I purchased more of them and wear them as a regular bra. The only thing is sometimes I have to come out of them because of blouses with low cleavage or open shoulders.
