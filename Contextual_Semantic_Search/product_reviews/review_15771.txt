While Thorlos with Thin cushioning are my running favorites, these here may be the second (I have tried most of the running-specific socks/brands around in the last couple of years).If you need thick cushioning (and have a slight extra space in your running shoes for that), buy these, if not, by the thin-cushion Thorlos.
