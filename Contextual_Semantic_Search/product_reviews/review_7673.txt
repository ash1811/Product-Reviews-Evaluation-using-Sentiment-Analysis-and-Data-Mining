Those suspenders are both affordable and sturdy. I wear them while doing yard work around the house and they are comfortable to be worn for several hours at a time. The strap lengths stay true when locked in and the belt clips occasionally pop out but that isn't the end of the world. I am very happy with these suspenders and I have even purchased a couple of pairs for friends and relatives.
