Doesn't even come up to and cover my belly button.  I thought I would try a "high cut" brief because I usually wear theVanity Fair Women's Perfectly Yours Lace Nouveau Brief #13001of which I have several pair in black and white.  I like the feel of silky nylon but this is not it; this is stretchy elastic and clothes would stick to it.  I can't recommend these Hi-Cut Briefs because they are so small and do not cover my navel.  I am disappointed that Vanity Fair would offer "dime store" underwear.Update 3-5-13:  I gave these to my best friend who wears a size 5 or 6 panty.  She is delighted with my "high price" taste.
