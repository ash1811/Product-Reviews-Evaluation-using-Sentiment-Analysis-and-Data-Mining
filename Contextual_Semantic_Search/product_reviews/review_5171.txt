I bought this watch for my wife who needed a new one. She was pleased with the "Indiglo" feature---the dial lights up with electroluminescent coating --I guess like the fire flies glowing with the same mechanism. I found this watch in Macy's among the usual bunch of Timex pieces, kept on open counters.The watch is nicely designed and does not look cheap like many other less expensive Timex pieces found in several stores.The dial is elegant . The only limitation is that the date window is very tiny and is hard for reading. The metal band is convenient and should last a long time. I presume that Timex uses Chinese quartz movements and should be suitable for a watch for daily use in this price range--that is less than $50.
