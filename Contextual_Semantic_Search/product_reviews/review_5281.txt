They're great pants, retro and comfy. Except, I guess XL means waist is "39 IN. to 43 IN" which amazon description does not say, of course.I wanted to give it a shot because they look nice and not pricey, I don't know if they screwed it up or just order yourself medium or large even though your thinking you want roomy pants. Otherwise great material and  shape.
