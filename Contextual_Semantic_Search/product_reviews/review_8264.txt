This watch is a nice looking watch if you want something dressy.  The lume is nothing like it is on my 8926 OB.  It keeps accurate time and is waterproof to 660 feet.  For the money it is a good buy.  I give it three stars because the lume on the face is weak and doesn't last all night like it does on my 8926 OB.  But it is a great alternative to wearing the watch it is a copy of (Rolex Daytona) and you don't need a bodyguard!!!  It is not a true chronograph but it does have the look without the expense.  I like it and am actually thinking of purchasing another.
