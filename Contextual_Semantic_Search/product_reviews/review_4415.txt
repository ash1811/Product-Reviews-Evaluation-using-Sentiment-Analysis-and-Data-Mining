I bought the watch to wear while doing field work as an amateur radio operator.  Often times are conveyed in military time.  The military numbers are big enough to read.  While the military time numbers where secondary on other watches.The watch is very light weight and looks good.  But the band is really cheap plastic that is too small.  I have a normal size wrist.  But for the price, you can't go wrong.
