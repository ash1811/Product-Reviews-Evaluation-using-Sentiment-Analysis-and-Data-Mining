Every time I read about swim diapers, I read that they aren't meant to absorb, just to contain solids. Since I want to be able to put my kids in their swimsuits *before* we get to the pool, rather than AT the pool (or beach), this was a problem. The disposable swim diapers don't hold any urine at all. I was a bit skeptical when I read that this one would absorb, but looking at the diaper, it's obvious. And it works, too - we took my daughter to the beach, and she was terrified of the ocean - she wouldn't go near it. But we had her in this diaper and her swimsuit for about an hour, while she played in the sand. The diaper was wet when we came back, but her suit was dry - no leaks. Of course, it probably isn't as absorbent as a regular diaper, but compared to other swim diapers, I'm pretty impressed.
