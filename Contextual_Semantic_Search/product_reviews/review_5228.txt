I loved a wallet I had bought a few years back but the zipper for closing it broke. So I spent quite a bit of time looking for another one similar to it, to no avail.  When I decided to look on Amazon, I  chose this one  because it met my 'checklist' for what I needed in a wallet - enough 'slots' for credit cards, a visible place for my ID, a full size compartment to put bills in, and a place for coins. Furthermore, it's really a nice looking wallet for the price. Time will tell how long it will last!
