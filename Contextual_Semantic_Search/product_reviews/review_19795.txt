Living in the northeast we have crazy weather!  Some days can be in the 20's and then the next in the 50's so I need something to keep my feet warm but not too warm that they sweat!  I also can wear them with socks on the super chilly days and they keep my socks from getting wet when doing the dishes!  I bought the perriwinkle and the color is as the pic showed !  Very pretty!  Every other pair I owned lasted at least 2 winters, wearing them every day and washing them a ton!  They are super soft and stay on my foot without being too tight!  I wear a size 7 and the medium fit perfectly!
