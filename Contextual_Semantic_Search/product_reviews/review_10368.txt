Since giving this set to my 7 year-old nephew for Christmas, he is rarely without it.  He's seen all of the Harry Potter movies (and his mom is reading him all of the books), so he knows what the scarf is supposed to look like - this set fit the bill!  As far as quality, his mom reports that the set washes well, which is a definite plus!
