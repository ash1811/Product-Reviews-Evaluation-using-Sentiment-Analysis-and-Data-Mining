This is a well cut, well made shirt with vibrant colors and quality workmanship.  If they are washed in cold water, fluffed in the dryer for 5 minutes, then hung to dry...they do not need ironing.  They do run small, so I recommend buying one size up for a good fit.  I have ordered several different styles for my husband and he loves them all.  Highly recommend!
