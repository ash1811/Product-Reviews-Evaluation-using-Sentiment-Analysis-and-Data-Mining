These are quality sandals.  I originally ordered size 10s, but they were too big.  Returned those without a hitch, and ordered 9s.  These fit much better.  The velcro straps make for easy adjustment.  Nice thick soles and solid construction.  I've taken up hiking/backpacking and got these for camp shoes; I suspect these'll serve for a good long time.
