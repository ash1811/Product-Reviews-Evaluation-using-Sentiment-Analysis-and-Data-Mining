There are many things I do love about the purse - the size is perfect. The inside pocket is a nice size. However the upper flap that has slots for your credit cards  is exposed to the outer edge. After using this purse for a couple weeks and taking my debit card in and out, the slot became loose and my debit card slid out into the unknown and was lost. That is a major design flaw. For that reason alone, I cannot give this purse a higher rating.
