We read that this slipper runs a little small so we ordered a size up and it fits perfectly. My husband loves these and refuses to take them off.  We purchased similar styles in the past but the soles would wear out or the lining would shed and thin very quickly.  He says they are very comfortable and his favorite pair so far.  For this price is definitely worth the purchase.
