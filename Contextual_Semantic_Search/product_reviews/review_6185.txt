Living in a ski resort town, we have snow and ice for 5 months of the year.  After two very serious falls this winter even when wearing my chunky soled winter boots I decided it was time to invest in some Yaktrax.  They go on fairly easy, and come off even more easily (but you will get hands dirty with whatever ice and dirt is on the bottom of your shoes).  I wear a size 9 and the small fit my shoes perfectly.  I also bought a medium for boyfriend (and also works on my bigger size 10 boots), but we have yet to try that set.  They did a great job for walking down our hilly street in slushy, icy snow.  This coming week we have another ice storm on the way, so will probably get a chance to test them on solid black ice surfaces that run from our frost door to our parking spot spaces down a steep hill.  Will update once they get the true test.
