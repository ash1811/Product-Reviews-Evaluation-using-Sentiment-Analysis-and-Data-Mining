I didn't expect much when I purchased this. i have a 34&#34; waist and purchased the size small because I wanted the tightest fit possible. It is a lightweight material with A LOT of stretch, and it closes with a large velcro strip. If I make it tight, my waist shrinks to approx 29&#34; and I can still breathe! It is a short torso and will roll/crease if you bend. It reaches from the bottom of my ribs to the top of my hips and causes skin to spill out around it on either side- if it were about 2 inches longer on each end, that wouldn't be a problem at all! The velcro strip is also obvious under tight clothing. I would recommend this to wear under a loose hoodie or sweater. If you are looking for something to wear daily or for longer than a month or so, I would suggest investing in something higher quality.
