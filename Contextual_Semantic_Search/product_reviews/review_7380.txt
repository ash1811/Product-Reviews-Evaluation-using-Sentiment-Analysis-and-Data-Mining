It's a nice simple shirt, and for its affordable price I ordered them in four colors: black, dark heather, navy blue, and green.There are some issues in sizing. Some reviewers complained that these shirts run small and wide. I can say that the first shirt I bought (which was black) is indeed small lengthwise, but that the other three fits fine for me. I would experiment with one first, and make sure that the seller has a generous return policy.
