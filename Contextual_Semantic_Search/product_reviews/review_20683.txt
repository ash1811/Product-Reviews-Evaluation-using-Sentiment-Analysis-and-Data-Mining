It's so nice to be able to slip on a really comfy pair of shoes without stockings......finally! Softwalks does make a comfortable shoe. The egg crate footbed is remarkable! I purchased these in black about a year and a half ago. I have trouble getting shoes that are right for my small feet. Mary Jane's are a wonderful option for me. These do not look like old lady shoes. They're really cute with jeans and I'm able to wear them for a long time with no problem. I recently ordered the navy because I was afraid I'd wear out the black pair, the color's are very close and also look great with jeans. I've also worn the black pair with a skirt and a dress, looked great! These are great, comfy shoes. Now if they only made them in other colors!
