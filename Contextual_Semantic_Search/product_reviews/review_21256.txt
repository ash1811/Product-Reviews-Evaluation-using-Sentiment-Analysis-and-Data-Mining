These are moderately priced and comfortable flips.  The yoga mat material is a little questionable in terms of comfort, in that it's rubbery feeling and conducive to sweating.  It's squishy, so squishy that it doesn't offer much resistance when I put my weight down to take a step.  It feels as though there should be a stronger layer under the top layer of squishy fun.Also, these run a little narrow.  I typically wear a 7 1/2 or an 8, depending on the brand, I got these in an 8 and they fit snugly.Overall, 3 stars because they aren't super expensive, seem well made and fairly durable, but the yoga mat material isn't at all absorbent and a bit too squishy.
