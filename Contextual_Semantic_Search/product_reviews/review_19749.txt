I needed slippers because I have Fibromyalgia and spend most days indoors. Although I have bought Isotoner slippers within the past year and knew they would wear out within a month, I bought these anyway. During the first week they fit snug and with each passing day spread out more and more.Now after wearing daily, and I do not walk around alot, they are uncomfortable with lumps inside instead of a cushion they started out with. Will have to save my pennies to buy a quality pair of slippers but honestly don't think I should have to pay $50.00 for slippers. Oh Isotoner or whoever you are owned by now - what have you done?P.S.  folks - same thing happened with the Dearfoam slippers I bought. Poor quality from those too. My slipper quest continues!
