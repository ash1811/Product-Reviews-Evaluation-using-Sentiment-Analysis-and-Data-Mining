Great jeans but beware that these will fade more quickly (or at least they did in my case) than most other dyes of these jeans.I wear 32x36 and am a pretty slender fellow, so finding jeans that I can wear can be quite the difficulty. Levi's 511s are my go to choice though, as they are long-lasting and well fitting.
