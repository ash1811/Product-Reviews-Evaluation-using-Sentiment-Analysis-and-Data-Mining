My wardrobe is 501's. I fashion all my accoutrements around them. When I have to dress up I can use black 501's for the opera or kaki with a white shirt for the office. However I have always chosen my work environment for its fashion taste in stone washed 501's. Do not tell anyone but I take mine to the cleaners and have them dry-cleaned and pressed (no starch), just crisp and casual at the same time; it is an old habit from my military days. Come to think of it the military used button fly's also.I can see the problem of purchasing online vs. store bought is that they use obscure words as "rigid" in place of gage (or oz.) Not one did they mention the tab color which is Levi's way of sorting the Mercedes quality version from their Yugo (lighter weight but still from Levi) version. And yes they are subject to globalization which in this day and age is a "no no"; and there is no way to tell without looking at the label. Well enough of this negative stuff.An advantage of on line is getting those obscure colors and exact size (saving a tad in tailoring). Also saving gasoline (sort of an expensive commodity now days) and time. Not to mention there is some sort of psychological thrill in placing and receiving the order. It is sort of a mini-Christmas.
