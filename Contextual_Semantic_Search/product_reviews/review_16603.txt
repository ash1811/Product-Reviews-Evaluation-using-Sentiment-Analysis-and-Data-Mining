The RIGGS WORKWEAR pants are very well made and will offer the user a long time of wear and comfort.The one item I can live with but was a bit disappointed in was the size.  I always buy my wrangler jeans in a 42 as after a wash or two they fit comfortably loose.  These RIGGS were a bit tight at the first try on.  I hope they do not shrink as they will become (for me) uncomfortably snug.
