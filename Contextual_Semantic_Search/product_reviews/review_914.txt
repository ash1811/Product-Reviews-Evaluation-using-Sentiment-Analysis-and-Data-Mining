I got these nylons for a party in winter. The &#34;Jet&#34; color is a nice light black, not opaque like tights but definitely noticeable. I prefer nylons that have some color so it's clear I intend for my legs to be an unnatural color, and not just strangely tan or bandage-pale.I'm 5'5&#34; and 125lb, and the size A/B fit perfectly. They were comfortable all night.
