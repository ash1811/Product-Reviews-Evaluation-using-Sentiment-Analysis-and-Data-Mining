I've been wearing Rainbows for over 10 years now and I'm on my 3rd pair.  I can't describe how much I love them.  While they are a bit of a pain to break in, they tend to do so quickly and they're worth the pain in the end.  I echo the other sentiments about not ordering up a size because they do in fact stretch.  The arch supports for these are phenomenal.  I wore out my first pair after 5 years of daily use 9 months out of the year.  Since then I've been able to afford replacing them  after 3 years (although they definitely could last longer if needed).  All in all, Rainbows are a high-quality product that I would highly recommend to anyone.
