I have been wearing Hanes Silk reflections hosiery for over ten years now and do not purchase anything else.  I love the silky feel of Silk Reflections against my skin and they look and fit great.  They are very durable and last me for many wearings.  I caught my leg on the corner of a table one time and it cut my leg pretty bad but did not run my stockings.  These thigh highs are a great alternative to pantyhose and they stay up well, and the great thing is when you do get a run you only have to throw away the one stocking.
