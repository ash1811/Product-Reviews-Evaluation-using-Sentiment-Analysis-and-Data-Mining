I am very happy with my purchase, ie, Vanity Fair Womens my Favortie Illumination string bikini panty. I had been purchasing ilusion panties, here on amazon. But, they upped their prices quite a bit. I decided to try these and I can't believe how comfortable they are. The style is very nice to wear under low-slung jeans, which is why I liked them. Buying panties online can be dicey, sometimes, they just aren't what they are supposed to be. But, these are great, and then some. Plus, they were super saver, where if I spend $25 shipping is free. I like free. I will likely purchase more in the future. Happy new customer!
