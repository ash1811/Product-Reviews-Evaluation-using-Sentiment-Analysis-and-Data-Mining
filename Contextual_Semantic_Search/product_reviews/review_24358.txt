WHEN MY FIANCE GOT THIS ONE HE WAS VERY PLEASED. HE WORE A LEATHER ONE I BOUGHT HIM FOR CHRISTMAS EVERY DAY AND HE WAS WORRIED IT WOULD BE TO HOT FOR SUMMER. BUT THESE LAST FEW DAYS HE'S WORE THIS CAP AND IS IN LOVE WITH IT. ITS DRESSIER THEN A BASEBALL HAT AND A LITTLE BIT MORE MATURE BUT PROVIDES THE SAME COVERAGE THOUGH. THE MATERIAL IS STURDY WITHOUT BEING THICK OR HEAVY SO IT'S BREATHABLE. I RECOMEND THIS CAP FOR THOSE WHO DONT WANT TO HEAR ITS TO HOT FOR A HAT AND SUNBURNED SCALPS THIS SUMMER.
