I bought these jeans for my husband.  He likes the jeans and feels like they are well made and durable.  They wash well and fit well too.  they seem a little longer than the 32 inch length I thought I ordered but other than that, they are the best.  I will buy more of this brand in the future!  The pockets are good and made with a dark and sturdy material.  I would highly recommend these jeans to others who are looking for durability.
