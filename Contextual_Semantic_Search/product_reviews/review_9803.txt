Five-stars for the Decaf Coffee for $20-$25 (my favorite pair of business casual pants - VERY well made) but four-stars for Pumice Beige for $25-$40 (ironic that you get less for more) and only three-stars for thin material in the Olive. The different colors are in fact different pants. This could be why there are such differing reviews here. In general, however, these are good buys (you get what you pay for). For example, theSavane Men's Pleated Deep Dye Twill Pantcosts a bit more and delivers a bit more. Then,Haggar Men's Mynx Gabardine Hidden Expandable Waist Pleat Front Dress Pantcosts about the same but has worn better. With my attraction to cheap, I've bought four of these. I've gotten at least 50 wears out of each pair and that seems fair for the price. These are a good buy.
