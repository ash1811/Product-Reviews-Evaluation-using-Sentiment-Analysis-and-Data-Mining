ok, so the bra fits nice, minor inconvenience with the straps.  If you aren't looking to lift them up as high as an underwire - than this is for you.  While this is great weekends I would prefer one that lifts and separates more.  However, for the price it will do just fine.1.24.12 - I put this through the wash after one wearing and now the bottom elastic keeps rolling up causing painful marks.  did it shrink?
