As a shoe buyer in Carmel Ca. decades ago I discovered this company. I bought and sold more Sebago's than I dreamed out of three stores. Yes as with most boat shoes there is a break in period for any boat shoe or I would be worried about holding up in the conditions for which they were designed for. I still have two pairs made by Sebago from 1980 ?  When it was two men from Maine (father and son) making great shoes. My boat shoes have seen plenty of salt water, sand, and sun I would buy this brand over its competitors any day. You can take them to a cobbler to have them &#34;broken in&#34;  Hope this helps.
