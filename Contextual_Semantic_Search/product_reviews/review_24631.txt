Pretty good slippers, and the outdoor sole works very well.  You can definitely get away with occasionally wearing these outside in the snow to get your morning paper.  The lining is a synthetic material, so you should realize that daily wearing with no socks will lead to bacteria growth and odors.  My next pair of slippers is definitely going to be a real lambskin slipper with real wool inside, as real wool naturally fights bacteria and odors.
