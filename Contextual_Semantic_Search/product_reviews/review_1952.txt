I rated it a 2 because the picture is grossly inaccurate!!!  This earring is so small and very appropriate for a little girl.  I had to return it.  I believe the product is of very good quality however the picture makes it look like its for an adult- when you get the earring - you will be very disappointed.  For a girl 6 and under - yes however for an adult - no
