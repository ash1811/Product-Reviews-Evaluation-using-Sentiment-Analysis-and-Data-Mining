These are nice jeans.  They're not crazy-expensive, designer, "premium-denim," but they feel good and feel quite durable.  As others mentioned, washing only once changes these jeans from off-the-shelf stiff denim to quite-wearable, comfortable jeans.  The length is maybe just a hair long based on sizes, but not by much.  Zipper feels good, pockets are slightly tight but not an issue at all.  I would recommend these, especially for the price.
