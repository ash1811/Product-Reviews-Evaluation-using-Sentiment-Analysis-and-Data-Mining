I have to say up front that the picture used in the Speedway collection is not the current 2007 Invicta models. By looking at the photograph, the watch apears to have a bezel with a recessed portion at the outside of the 2-4 clock portion of the watch. The two models I've purchase have a smooth bezel all the way around and look just like the ones do in the 2007 Invicta sales catalogue. This must be an older model and the photo has not been updated. Not a big deal, but I like seeing exactly what I purchase. It could make some buyers feel they have been misled.Invicta's watches rarely disapoint. The Speedway collection is nothing short of a stunning looking watch. It actually glitters on your arm.That said, there are a couple of drawbacks to the chronograph. It's accurate to one-second. There are fifth-of-a-second hash marks along the watch, but the chronograph hand only stops on the seconds. I've got two of these watches, the 9211 and the 9554, both are great looking but aren't super accurate chronographs. It's a Japanese movement 21-jewel automatic, and that's a great, quality movement, but maybe the Swiss movements are more precise. I don't know, but you can't expect to get a $5,000 watch for just $120, plus shipping.There are issues with the crown on the Invicta. The crown serves multiple purposes. It winds the watch up if it is stopped, and is used to change the time and date. But it is delicate and easy to strip out. It's hard to tell if the crown has been moved into the first or second position and if you use too much force, like I did on my 9554, you'll find that you will be having the watch repaired.All in all, this is another great looking watch and decent timepiece that has a functional chronometer.Well worth the price. I imagine it would make a nice gift to somebody also.
