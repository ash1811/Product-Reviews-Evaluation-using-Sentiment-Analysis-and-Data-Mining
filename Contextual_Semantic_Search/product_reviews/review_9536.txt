I didn't buy these from Amazon but directly from Hanes and, for the first time in decades, I was disappointed in their product. The cloth is so thin, so low count threads per square inch that you feel as if they'll rip off. Poorly constructed, single line stitching at all importan places such as the hem on the legs and the closure give the impression that any hard wearing will do them in. Also, and this may not be important but...I was shaving while wearing them and spilled water on them; They became almost see through. I'll say this, they're white, they're partly cotton and they're boxers and, yes, they were made by Hanes but for those of us who are used to a heavier weight cloth that promises longer wear, this is a major disappointment.
