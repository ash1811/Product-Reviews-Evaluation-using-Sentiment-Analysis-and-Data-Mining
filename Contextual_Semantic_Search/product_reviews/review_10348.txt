The chest and stomach fit true to size. The sleeves were a little to long. I decided to keep them as IO was the only one to notice this. I was happy to find these on Amazon, I have forun pants that I have a hard time getting off of the shelf in the stores. It is great to be able to shop at home and know you are getting the correct size and quality.
