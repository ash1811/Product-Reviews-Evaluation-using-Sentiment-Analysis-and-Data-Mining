This is one of the main reasons I started buying Playtex 18 Hours bras. They are extremely comfortable, the Airform is cool in summer and warm in winter. I never have the problem of the straps slipping down my shoulders or having to reach in and pull them up. (The straps!).Wonderful feeling and fit is great. Watch for a sale, but remember...you get what you pay for!
