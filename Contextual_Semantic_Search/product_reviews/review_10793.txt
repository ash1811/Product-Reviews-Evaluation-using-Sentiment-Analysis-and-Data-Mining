I must admit that I've never been much of a flip flop person. I have had my previous pair of flip flops for 3-4 years and had not worn another pair until receiving theses.  While my previous pair was of similar quality, I did not ever imagine just how much a flip flop's design could affect how they stick to your feet while walking.  The heal is cushioned and raised to make for less "flipping and flopping" while walking.  They are lightweight and simply stick to my feet better than any other pair I've owned.  I ordered two other brands offerings as well and found them to be my favorite out of the box.  Some may prefer a simpler pair of Reefs over these, but I think these are great.  There is a bottle opener.  At around $55 a pair, these are some of the more expensive flip flops available, but I think the price is well worth it.PROS-Lightweight-great design-cushion-quality-bottle openerCONS-price?
