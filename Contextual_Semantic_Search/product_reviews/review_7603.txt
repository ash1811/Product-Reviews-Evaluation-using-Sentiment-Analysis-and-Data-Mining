My brother picked up these shoes from the post office and when he dropped off the box he said, "it feels like you've got a box of air". That's just what they feel like on your feet. These shoes are awesome, fit the way they're supposed to, and make my honking size 10 feet look like tiny, cute size sixes (well, to me, anyhow).I love that I can just slip into these of and an and that the heel is low enough that I can wear them out in the yard doing chores without risking falling and breaking my keister. I'd like to buy these in different colors and will do after I've worn them for a while and make sure they hold up to the hard way I use shoes.
