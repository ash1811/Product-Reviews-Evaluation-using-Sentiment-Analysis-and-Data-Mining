These Rockports have a straight last, which I personally much prefer over a curved last because of the type of arch support I find to be the most comfortable when wearing a pair of shoes for a long stretch (like when going to the Fair and walking all day).  They tend toward sizing a tad small, so if you're in between, go for a 1/2 size up, and being able to get an 11-N is a luxury for me. I broke them in (yes, they're not wear-ready right of the box) by wearing them around the house for a few days.  Since they've softened up, they have been my choice of foot wear over my old white tennies and my NB walking shoes. I have other Rocs and my feet love 'em.  I'm not worried about the nice clean look--they'll get spills and dirt with time.  I could use any of several products to keep them pristine looking (Scotchguard is good), but I'd rather they aged naturally. Great shoes. Great price at Amazon (I put them on my Wish List and then just waited for the price to plummet).
