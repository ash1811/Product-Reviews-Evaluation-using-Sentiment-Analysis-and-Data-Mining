I have bought Leg Avenue tights and knee high stockings before in the past, but never thigh highs. I was afraid they wouldn't stay up on my legs, but to be quiet honest they held up great. There is a small elastic band made into the top which grips on to your skin. After a full night of wearing them, I had no problems with them sliding down or having to pull them up.They ARE thin, so be careful to not snag them on anything or pull on them real tight (causing runs). To be honest, though .. that applies to almost all tights/stocking. Take care of them and be easy, they'll last longer.There is no &#34;foot&#34; in them, so you don't have to worry about the size not fitting you right. I am 5'7&#34;, wearing a size 8 in shoes, and they went all the way up on my thighs. I could have pulled them up higher, but if I was going to do that then I would have been better off buying tights.They look great, feel soft, and fit like a glove. I plan on ordering the other colors to match a few bustier sets I had bought. They don't look to bad paired with the right skirt, either.
