i bought these boots for my girlfriend these are the second pair of Bearpaw boots i have got her the first in a different style and from a different retail outlet, these i bought from a compony on amazon and when i reciever them they seem to be made cheaply, she loves them and wore them all winter, but i think they are made poorly.
