I bought these to wear on a trip.  I wore them around the house first, and they seemed to be fine, but while traveling it quickly became apparent that both my feet were pronating in these shoes to the point I could barely walk in them.  On top of that, no matter how tight I strapped them, the back was too wide and my heels moved around in them.  I ordered 9 medium, which is my true size. I am returning them.
