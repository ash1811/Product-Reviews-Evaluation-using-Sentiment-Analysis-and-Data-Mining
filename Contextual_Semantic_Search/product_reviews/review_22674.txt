I have been using this product for over 6 months and I have found it more then adequate for the money spent on it. I am happy to say that because others of the same nature cost more then what I spent on this set. I endorse this tool set with confidence. I added this part after some more thoughts. It is important that when using this that you understand most gaskets last only a few years so order some extras for yourself to have and also the goo/sealant for the threads is a must. with out these other ingredients your watch will not be as water resistant as it was. I hope this helps...Namaste'
