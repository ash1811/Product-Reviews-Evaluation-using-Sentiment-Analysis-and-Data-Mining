Levi 511 Slim Fit Jeans, Size 33x34It is very difficult to find 33 waist, 34 inseam jeans in stores, let alone jeans that are cut in a fashionable way and affordable. Enter the Levi 511's. I have two pairs of Levi 514s, which are slim straight fit jeans. Although nice, the 514s are too baggy around the ankles in my humble opinion. The 511s looked like they would rectify this problem, and they do. Except they can be rather tight at the ankle which makes it more snug if you have big feet like me (Size US 12) and are trying to slip them through.The Midnight Oil color was hard to discern online, but in real life they are a very very very dark blue that is almost black. I liked this color because it came with a black leather patch at the back and dark grey stitching. The sizing is spot on, I always buy 1 or 2 sizes larger than my actual waist measurement because this gives me comfort room in the butt and groin area which is important for men.Overall: 5/5 stars. Great price, more modern style but definitely not ultra-tight "skinny jeans". If you desire a bit more room at the ankles, look at the 514s but the 511s are not ultra tight.
