If you are looking for a high quality and durable, yet lightweight polo, this is the polo for you. I had several of these shirts on my last deployment to the sand and I can tell you that they stood up to the heat, dirt, abuse, and washings in the field. Pen slot in the left sleeve is VERY handy - but I didn't use it as much as I thought I would. Nice to have nonetheless.
