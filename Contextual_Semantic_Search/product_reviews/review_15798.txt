If you wear a size 11 lady's shoe, Large may be on the small/short side.  It's supposed to accommodate up to 11.5, but I'm sure that's not possible.  I'll be able to use them, but I anticipate that they will ride down my heel, like other reviewers have noted.  I have another pair of Thorlo socks, I love them, but these are different, not quite right in the fit.  Definitely going to avoid putting these in the dryer.
