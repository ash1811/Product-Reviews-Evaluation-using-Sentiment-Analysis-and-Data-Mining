Let me start off with saying I'm normally a Justin boots girl.  One of my friends bought a pair of Ariat Fatbaby boots, and I thought they were so adorable. After some debating I strayed from my Justin's and got a pair of the Fatbaby 2's in the bomber brown.  The color is fabulous, and the soft pink stitching is gorgeous. They will be cute wether you are wearing them with jeans, dresses, or shorts. I'm a size 7&1/2, and they fit well. The left boot was a little bit more snug when I first put them on, but after wearing them for about an hour it adjusted.  Now, while they are cute boots to wear out, I personally wouldn't ride in them. I can see why some riding classes don't allow Fatbabys. Because they are fat they might be a little difficult to fit in the stirrups for me. So my final opinion is that my Ariats are my going out boots, but Justin's will always be my riding boots.
