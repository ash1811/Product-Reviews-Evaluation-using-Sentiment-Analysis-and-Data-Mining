I just received these jeans last week and as of right now I am impressed. The quality of the denim is impressive (feels strong and thicker than other jeans I own). Out of the bag these jeans fit very well. The inseam is a little long but certainly wearable and I am expecting that as I wash them more and more they will shrink somewhat. If they do... great. If they don't... they are only about a half to 1 inch longer than tailored jeans that I own and will continue to be wearable. I ordered my pair in "Shadow Black" and they look great. I've washed them only once and after that initial wash I noticed no fading whatsoever (washed in cold with pants turned inside out). I realize that there will eventually be some fading, but I am hoping it will be kept to a minimum and not for some time to come.UPDATE: January 01, 2014 - Jeans just came out of the washer & Dryer and a frayed tare has appeared along the belt line seam in the back of the pants. I am giving Wrangler the benefit of the doubt and assuming that I was that one person in a thousand who got a bad pair. I have put a replacement order in and will see if this new pair last longer than a month. I'll write again in a few months to let you know.
