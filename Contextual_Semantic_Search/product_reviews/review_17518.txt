These are great go-to flats.  I got the copper metallic color and they are fun but not too flashy. They are kind of a rose gold shade. Very pretty. These have a little cushion, so unlike some flats that are TOO flat, these are just right. I can walk around all day in these, no problem. I definitely foresee acquiring more colors in my future...
