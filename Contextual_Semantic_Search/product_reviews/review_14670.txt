I loved these.  Still have them, very durable.  Warm.  These were better than the bomber jacket as those got a little funny in the material.  These are a great color, I was hesitant to buy them really due to the color, but they match everything.  They run a size larger. I am an 8, purchased a 7, so when I go back for another pair, it will be another 7.  It was a cold winter, and I found these easy transition slippers to shoes to go out and in. I felt these were a good deal and a great choice all the way around!  I like the non contrast also.
