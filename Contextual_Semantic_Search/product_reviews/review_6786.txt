I used to buy only polo or calvin klein socks which were about twice the price of gold toe. I saw gold toe on sale at Macy's 3 for $18 and decided to try them out.Most important to me is they feel nice on my feet, some dress socks are a polyester blend and feel scratchy on my feet. Not Gold Toes, they are soft and are not too tight which adds to the comfort. Finally they are thin which is important to me as most of my dress shoes are tight.Durability is also a plus, I have never had a pair unravel or rip. They also breathe well and release moisture better than most brands.
