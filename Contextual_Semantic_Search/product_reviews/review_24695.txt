We wear a lot of  sandals, (flip-flops)  pretty much year round in our family and everyone wears only Reef brand. We have all tried other brands, but none last or compare to  the Reef. I know they say flip-flops are not good for the feet, but we have found wearing Reef sandals is the exception. They have the needed support and walking around on them all day, doesn't leave us with sore or tired feet.We wear them out, and this pair is to replace an older pair, that has seen its last day.
