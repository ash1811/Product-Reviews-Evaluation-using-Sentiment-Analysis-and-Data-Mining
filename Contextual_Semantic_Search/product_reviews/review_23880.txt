I wanted the longer ones and didn't realize I bought these kinds. Definitely try them on at stores before ordering online to see which compliment your face more. Although I wanted the longer ones, maybe with my small face they would have overpowered my face. These are a more compact kind. The glossy finish is nice, these are the real deal. I got them for a great price and now I like them.
