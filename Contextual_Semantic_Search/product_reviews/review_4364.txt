My wife bought a pair of these panties a few years ago just to try something new. She was so impressed at how comfortable they were that she asked me to try them on. I now own 24 pair of them! These are, without a doubt, the most comfortable underwear I have ever worn! They are stretchy, light, cool and they don't pinch, bind or ride up. I would suggest that you wash these on gentle cycle and hang dry them. They will last much longer!My only question is why doesn't Jockey make anything like this for their male customers? 0-0-0
