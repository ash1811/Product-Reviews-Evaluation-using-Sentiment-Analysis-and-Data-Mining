I love, love, love this bra. I so desperately needed some new bras. I had one comfortable one left, but the other day it finally bit the dust while in the dryer.I found these playtex ones on amazon, anddecided to give them a try. I wear a 42D, so Lift,support and comfort are of the utmostimportance to me. This bra met all of thoseneeds. It is pretty also (in my opinion) .It gives a very slight pointed look some retrobras may have, but i personally dont care, i aminto rockabilly and retro everything, so this wasnot an issue for me, actually a plus.I was looking for comfort and S U P P O R T :)This bra exceeded my expectations.At first glance out of the package, i thought, &#34;ohcrudd, these cups look too big.&#34;So i tried it on right away, and it fit perfectly.So glad i finally found another comfortable,rockin bra. I will order a few more in the nearfuture....oh yeah, the straps stay put as well, so im not walking around pulling up bra straps in front of everyone.. no one wants to  see that, lol .
