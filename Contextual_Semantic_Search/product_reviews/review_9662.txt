These jeans represent excellent value for money.  They are basically an upmarket version of the famous Wrangler Men's Cowboy Cut Jeans but with better quality denim and a better colour.  They are well made, feel great, and have a normal zip not a button fly.  The leg is slightly on the long side, which suits me fine, but the waist is true to size and the seat perfectly fits my small behind.  Jeans like these would be priced well over $100 a pair in Australia so I'm coming back for more!
