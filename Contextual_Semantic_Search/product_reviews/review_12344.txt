I wear US Size 10 which I thought was Euro Size 41. Not with this shoe. I needed Size 11. I already own a pair of Birkenstock Gizeh, so I thought these might be a bit more comfortable, and they do feel super soft and cushy. But I don't care for the look as much. My foot just looked too long in them. Plus, there was a very strong chemical smell.
