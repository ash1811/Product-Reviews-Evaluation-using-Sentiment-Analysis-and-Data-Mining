As many people have mentioned, these are nice and long, which makes me happy (hey, I've got long legs). However, the tops are pretty narrow considering the length of the stockings, and that pretty lace didn't stand a chance against my 24&#34; thighs. :( As I joke, I made my very lithe 6'3&#34; boyfriend try them on, and they fit him perfectly. Hmph. They're really pretty, but I guess we'll have to save them for a drag party or something.
