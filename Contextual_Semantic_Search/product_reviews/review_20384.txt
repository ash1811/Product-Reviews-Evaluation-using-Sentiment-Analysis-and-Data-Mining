I bought two pair of these to wear after my c-section.  They were perfect! The waist is high so they didn't rub on my stitches/scar and the button-up top made breastfeeding access easy.  I wore these almost every day for the first couple months. I still wear them because they are so comfortable and lightweight for hot summer nights.  They wash well in the washer.  I highly recommend these.
