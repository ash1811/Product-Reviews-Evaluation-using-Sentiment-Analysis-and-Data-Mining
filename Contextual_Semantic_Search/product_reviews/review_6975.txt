He wanted something like this as a boot sock as he often wears cowboy style boots. These worked perfectly, exactly the correct weight. They wash well and do not seem to be developing the stress areas his previous boot socks did despite not being padded in certain areas. I have noticed he tends to chose these to use over other socks he has.
