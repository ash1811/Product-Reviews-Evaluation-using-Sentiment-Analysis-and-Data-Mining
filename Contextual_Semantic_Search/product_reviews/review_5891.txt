It's hard to find bras in my size (32FF/G) that don't cost a fortune, so I was really pleased to get this one! It's a very basic everyday bra, but it holds everything up and in place. The cups are just a taaaaad big on me (slight wrinkle on the upper slope) but going down a size would definitely be too small, so I'm happy.
