Sometimes when you buy a nice pair of dress shoes, they'll throw in a pair of wood shoe trees. I have a few from Men's Wearhouse that were comped, but I needed a few more pair so I purchased these Woodlore's off Amazon.They are well-made and the rope loops are a nice feature to assist in removing the tree from the shoe. My only complaint would be that the trees came very dusty with cedar dust/saw dust, and I needed to really rub them down with a sock before sticking them in my dress shoes. Still, it's a minor issue. These are real cedar, made in the U.S.A., and are less than 1/10th the cost of a new pair of dress shoes (which is what you'll need if you don't take good care of your dress shoes) so I'm happy with the product overall.
