I wear these saraongs over my bathing suit all summer ~ I love them! I needed a new, solid color one and I chose the eggshell color. The only thing I have to say is that the color in the photo is much darker (which is what I wanted)...the one I received was very, very pale, similar in color. Just a lot lighter. It's fine...it will do; just wish the color was closer to the photo.The material is soft and appears that it will be super comfy. Ties easily...it would be cool to have the "ties" that they sell, but they are certainly not necessary. It's relatively thin material, so I wouldn't recommend it as a dress as some of the photos show. You might be able to double it up and work it as a top of some sort; I'll use it for my bathing suits:)
