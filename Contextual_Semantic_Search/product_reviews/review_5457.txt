Fits the Databank (I have the DB300) as advertised.  Only thing I don't like (thus minus one star) is the buckle is silver instead of black.  Nice pliable material, not stiff.  Good spacing between holes in the band where the buckle fits.Update:  After wearing this a few weeks, my arm had an allergic reaction to 'something'.  I quit wearing the watch and the reaction went away.  Started wearing the watch again and had same reaction.  Repeated this scenario one more time.  Replaced watchband with a genuine Casio band and haven't had any problems since.  Therefore, if you experience itching or swelling or redness, the band might be the problem.
