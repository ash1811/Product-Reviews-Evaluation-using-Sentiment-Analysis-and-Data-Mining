I got these as a Christmas present for my boyfriend so he'd have something that would be a cross between a casual and a dress shoe. They fit well and were more comfortable than his beat-up sneakers. They are very well-made and after 8 months of wearing them, he still loves them and they look brand-new. I would definitely buy them again!
