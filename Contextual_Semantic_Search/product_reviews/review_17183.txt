Slippers are the most cushiony slippers. I'm sorta glad I got the same size as my shoe, size 8,  but it is a tad long. If I went smaller to actually fit the length of my foot, the height of the instep would have been impossibly tight. As it is with the longer foot bed, it's still tighter than I'm used to in a slipper. NO arch support that I feel - I have high arches with plantar fasciitis. This slipper meets the requirement of not going barefoot but doesn't help my arch.
