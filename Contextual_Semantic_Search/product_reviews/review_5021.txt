it feels weird at first but i got use to it quickly. as soon as it came i just hand washed it since everyone on review said it drys fast but i thought it took 1 whole day to dry. if thats quick dry then i guess so.(i dont do laundry ;p) would buy more but cost too much and plus i only wear it when i go camping or hiking
