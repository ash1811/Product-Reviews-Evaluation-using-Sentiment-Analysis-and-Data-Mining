I have inserted a picture in the customer picture area so you can see what I am talking about. http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B0008G282E/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_allWhen I was younger, I used to love Lee jeans because they were comfortable and lasted a long time, so I bought two pair of these.  Unfortunately, the quality is not what it used to be.  Both pair ripped at the rear right pocket where I keep my wallet...one in 3 months, the other in 4.  These are a bit expensive to be replacing every 3 to 4 months. I would guess it is a result of using lighter weight denim, but until I see evidence to convince me to try again, I will no longer purchase Lee jeans.Buy these if you do not carry a wallet in your rear pocket.  Do not buy them if you do as they will rip very quickly.
