After looking at the local cheapo stores like Whale-mart, Tar-gut, Infamous feetwear, etc, I wasn't sure I could get a quality pair of casual slip ons, everything the mentioned junk shops plus a few others sold were absolute garbage. I thought it would be risky buying shoes on-line, but what kind of fool am I?Amazon just plain rocks, and these Sperry top siders are just plain first class, top quality shoes. These are also made in China, but the quality is surprisingly good. Fit is good, support insoles, and these look good, too. I believe I have become a Sperry customer......
