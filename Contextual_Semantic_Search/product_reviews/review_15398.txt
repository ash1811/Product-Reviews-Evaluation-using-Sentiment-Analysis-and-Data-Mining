It took a really long time for this product to come in that I almost forgot about it to be honest. I ordered three of them, a blue, black and grey and honestly, I love the grey one the most! It goes with almost every and all outfits you wear and it is REALLY warm. I really do love it a lot. It is really big so you can put it over like shawl if you wish.You can wear it to fancy dinners or even for everyday enjoyment.
