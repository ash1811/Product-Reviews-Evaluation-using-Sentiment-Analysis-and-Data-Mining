These shirts are exactly what I expected.  They are well made and the piping on the edges of the sleeves and the collar make them a little more distinctive than the average polo shirt.  I take a large and the large shirts I ordered fit perfectly.  After several washings they have only shrunk a tiny bit.  They don't need ironing if you take them directly out of the dryer and hang them up.  The price is great and I will likely order some more in the near future.  They arrived quickly and in great shape.  Definitely recommend.
