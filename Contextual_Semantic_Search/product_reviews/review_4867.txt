You may have a collection of underwear in your drawer, but with a pair of these, you'll open it, and these will be your number ONE choice. You'll be searching for these every time. Once you wear a pair, there's nothing that will take care of your "region" like these. Barely any sweat down there even on the hottest days, and this is coming from a man who works outside, and has for 16 years, 42 weeks a year, in the sun and heat, next to a 165 degree piece of metal. I have experienced chafe, many times BAD- this made me go out and search for the right pair of boxers. I don't enjoy briefs, nor boxer briefs, I like to hang LOOSE. I do own several pair of UA boxers, then I found by default in a retail store, exofficio boxers, they DOG UA's boxers. Softer, better "cut", slightly shorter, must say here for my waist size 33 I wear a MED, not a large like UA's. Make sure you get the right size (see the sizing charts). Fresh out of the package instantly wearable, you'll be blown away at how they feel in your hands when you squeeze them... the softest thing I have just about very felt. I'm a BIG fan for life, don't know if there'll ever be something superior to these boxers, and don't know how they'd ever get a rating below five stars. Grab 'em you'll freakin LOVE them, and while you're at it, get your lady some give-n-go boy shorts, HOTNESS too (you better take care of her as well if you want peace on the home front)!
