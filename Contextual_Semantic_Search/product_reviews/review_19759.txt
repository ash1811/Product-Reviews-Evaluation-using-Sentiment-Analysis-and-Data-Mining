Not only did these slippers not fit, after wearing just a short time the insole padding goes flat.  Not up to Isotoner's reputation sorry to say.  I wear a 9.5 by the way and these were large even after washing in HOT water trying to shrink them some.  I will wash again and give to my granddaughter.  Sorry but I had to replace with something else.
