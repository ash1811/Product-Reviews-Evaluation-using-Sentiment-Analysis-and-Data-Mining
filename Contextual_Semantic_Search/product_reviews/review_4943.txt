As I'll say with the other colors I've purchased... I'll never buy other underwear again. Great comfort, breathability, and say goodbye to riding-up. When buying more the second time, I did accidentally get some boxers as well (instead of boxer briefs) and aside from the comfort, they as well have the same old annoying ride-up problem. Boxer briefs for life!
