Got these 'Flip flops' as a replacement to probably one of the most comfortable pair I've had for about 6 years ~  and I must say.... these new ones are MILES ahead.  The contour on the sandal give great arch support, and the banding on the top is very comfortable.  The sandal fits a on the small size as I am normally an 8.5 W in shoe size, and so I got a size 9 M to fit.  But my heel sits right on the edge at the back of the sandal, and I suspect if I was a true 9, i'd have my heel hanging over the back..... so word to the wise, get a half size up (or since they don't make half sizes, get a full size up).  And yes, my foot is pushed all the way forward (the thong is right there between the toes....)Otherwise, a very very comfortable sandal.  Im not calling these 'flip flops' anymore, because they fit so well, that they don't make the flip flop sound anymore when I walk....
