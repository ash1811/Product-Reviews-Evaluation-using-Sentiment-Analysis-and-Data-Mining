My feet are not excessively wide, but they're wide in the one spot that few shoes can accommodate: the toes. So often shoes that fit nicely everywhere else pinch my toes. But these are great--no pinching, no matter how long I wear them. Hooray! My only complaint: why do shoe manufacturers think that people with wide feet don't want to wear colors? These seem to be available only in black or (perfectly glaring) white, while other Skechers come in lots of colors. Wide-footed people of the world, unite! We want colors! We want colors!
