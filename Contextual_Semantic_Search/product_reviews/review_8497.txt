I wear skirts most days at the office and don't like how stockings and pantyhose wear out and develop runs so fast, so I thought I'd try these pantyhose. They are very stretchy and comfortable and feel like I'm wearing tights. They aren't as sheer as my other stockings, but they still good and if they last a long while it's worth them not looking as fine and sheer.I'll update my review at a later date to relate how they are wearing.
