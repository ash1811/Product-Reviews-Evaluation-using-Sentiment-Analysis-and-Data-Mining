Purchased this shirt at a Walmart for $3.00 on closeout.. I wear 2x long sleeve t's. Purchased a 3x ,it was huge until laundering once(cold water). It is now a large at best.It's now short, wide and the sleeves are short..If it shrinks anymore it will be to small for me.So buy big,way big.Of course you will then get a very large waist also.
