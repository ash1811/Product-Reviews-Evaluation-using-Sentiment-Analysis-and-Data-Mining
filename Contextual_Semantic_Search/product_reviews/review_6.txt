Bought this as a backup to the regular ballet outfit my daughter has to wear. So far, she's using it to play out her Cinderella dreams but I am sure we'll be able to use it for a recital sometime soon. The quality is just fine for the price we paid. I was not expecting a designer skirt for this price and got exactly what I paid for.
