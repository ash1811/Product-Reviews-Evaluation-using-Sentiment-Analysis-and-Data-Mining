The fabric itself is durable and comfortable. And the look is classic. I love it. This will definitely last a lonnnnnnnng time.  The only draw back is the sizing.  It is so big.  I bought a medium even though I usually wear a large but I think I should have bought a small.  Even with the liner (sold separately) it is still huge. I kept it because me and my husband can both share it.  But in the event he claims this one, I'm buying a small or maybe an extra small if they have it.So in case anyone reading this doesn't get the point, buy 2 sizes DOWN from what you normally wear!!!
