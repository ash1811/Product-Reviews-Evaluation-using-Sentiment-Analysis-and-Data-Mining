These pants are definitely not Carhearts.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Mine came with a small thread tear in mine and it looks like that is the spot where it is going to open up and form a hole.  Also the fit is off. They hang way too low from the crotch and look like the pants my father used to wear 40 years ago.I will not be wearing these very often.  Definitely not for work.Bill
