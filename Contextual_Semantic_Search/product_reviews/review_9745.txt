I'm rehabbing from a running injury and needed something else to do apart from cycling when it's too cold or raining outside. I decided to try out swimming. This is my first pair of tight swimming shorts. I wear a size 34, and I ordered a size 34. Fits perfectly. No reason to upsize or downsize. I've worn them multiple times for laps in the pool at my college recreation center and I couldn't be happier. Now I just need to get a second pair. Totally pleased with the product so far.
