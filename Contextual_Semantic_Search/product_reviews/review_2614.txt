Living in Chicago I have worn these almost everyday this winter since I got them. They are nice and thin and even jeans slide over them and you don't feel like the Michelin man. I do wash them in a lingerie bag to prevent snagging and have had no shrinkage. They really keep me warm, nothing like silk far better than the Cuddleduds.
