For me, these are a great pair of Levi's 569 jeans.Dark Chipped color has been one of my favorites for a very long time.  Great thing I've noticed when I've washed these jeans has been the retaining of the indigo color.  Very minimal fading after washing numerous times.The only thing I wonder is the negative or low marks of this particular style of jeans.  I'm a firm believer that every person's body is made differently and when it comes to jeans, they're going to fit each person differently.  I agree, the word "Loose" might be a bit decieving to those who are expecting these to be pretty loose.  I guess this depends on your interpretation.
