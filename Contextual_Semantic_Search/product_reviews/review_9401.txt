I purchased a new pair of boots while vacationing in Nashville, TN... when I put them on, we were on carpet, and I didn't realize how slippery they were on the bottom.. I couldn't wear these, because it was super slippery on the bottom.. I purchased these sole stopperz and now I wear my boots all the time, they have worked GREAT for me.. THANKS!!
