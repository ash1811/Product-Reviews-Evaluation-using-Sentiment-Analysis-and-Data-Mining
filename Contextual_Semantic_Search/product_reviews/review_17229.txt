For years I've been buying these dual layer longjohns to protect me from the Wisconsin winters. They're just right for my purposes. Not to heavy, not to light. That said, these are old-school Technology. The inner layer is cotton and the outer is a cotton/wool blend, so they're probably not the best choice for heavy activity and sweating, but they're the best for normal activities and moderately cold weather.
