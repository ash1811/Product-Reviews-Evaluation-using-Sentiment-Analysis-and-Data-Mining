This is got to be my 5th or 6th pair of these shoes...they are great for those kinds of jobs where you have to be dressed decently and you have to walk a lot...They repel water well, I don't have to worry if I have to walk a mile in the rain...the thick soles protect my feet and it's an excellent, all around shoe...you could wear this to a BBQ, a wedding, a funeral, or out to the movies...it fits everywhere.
