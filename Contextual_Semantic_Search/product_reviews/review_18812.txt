I had never heard of these shoes.  I just happened to run by them while browsing for shoes here on amazon.  the ratings were great and is a super cute shoe so we gave it a shot! needless to say, these will be a continued purchase at our house.  I came back and bought my husband a pair too.  we all love them.  very comfy, true to size, and very well made.  well worth the money.
