These things are great ! They are lighter than other similar boots I have had in the past. I have had them for about 2 months and I still wear them everyday.I would say that they are about .5 size bigger than what they say they are. All of my other boots are 11 and they fit great, these are a little big. I solved this by adding in a thicker insert.Update 8-7-12I have been wearing these boots for a long time now and they still feel comfortable and have held up well. The only thing that is showing sign of wear are the top of the toes. I tend to kick things allot so they are damaged from my actions. Everything else looks almost new still and I have worn these things all over the place. If these ever wear out i'm buying another pair.
