Well, if you're willing to do some modifications, this costume may fit your bill. And unless you're wanting to look like a pirate street walker, some modifications are necessary. I didn't want my belly hanging out so I used a long black camisole underneath, and I swapped out the flimsy, see-through, cut-up-to-there skirt for a skirt of my own. Also, this costume does run small, so be aware of that.
