The shirt is great! For the price you can't ask for more! For me though I found it a bit too short. If I move too much a little stomach will show :( I ordered XL and I really don't think it's XL...seems a bit small. I ordered the same shirt from another brand and it's twice the size as this one. I haven't dried it in the dryer so I don't know if it'll shrink... I'm not going to try :)
