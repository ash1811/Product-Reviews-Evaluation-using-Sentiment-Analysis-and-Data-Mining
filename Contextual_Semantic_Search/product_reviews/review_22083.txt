I saw these shoes on the feet of someone in a waiting room.  I really liked the casual, comfy look of them...so I was brave enough to ask the woman what kind of shoe they were.  She told me they were an Easy Spirit shoe and that they were available at Macy's.  I checked Macy's online and did not find them.  Then...I checked Amazon and there they were...AND they qualified for Amazon Prime.  Figured I'd give them a chance.  When they came a few days ago, I slipped my feet into them and they've only been OFF my feet when I'm in bed!!  These are seriously the most lightweight, comfortable &#34;sneaker&#34; type shoe I've ever owned!  I ordered a 7 1/2 B (Medium) and they are just right (some 7 1/2's can run a little tight on my foot).  There is plenty of room in the toe and, although they are a &#34;slip-on&#34;, there is a low backing around the back that kind of &#34;cups&#34; your heel so it doesn't slip out while you're walking.  I will definitely be buying more pairs (they come in different colors!).
