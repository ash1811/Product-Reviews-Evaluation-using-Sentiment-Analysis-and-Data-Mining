When I first got my tights, I loved them. I loved them so much that I ordered two more pairs after trying them on. However, the very first day of wearing them out for a mere hour, I got a large run in the tights. I feel that my money was wasted. Be gentle with these if you choose to buy them. They look and feel great however.
