These socks are truly great. They are amazingly warm and comfy, no itching at all. You can wear them around the house or outdoors, although they are perhaps too hot for near-freezing temperatures if you wear winter boots - they are designed for much colder weather. My only question mark is how long they are going to last - they don't look that great after a few washes, but it may mean little in terms of durability.
