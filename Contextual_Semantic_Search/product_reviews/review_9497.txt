This is a very heavy and solid shirt. It fits slightly bigger than other shirts so I'd suggest ordering a half size down. It is really thick. I can see myself using it as a jacket in the winter time. That is not negative feedback though. I like it and plan to use it a lot in the winter. I recommend the shirt but just know you won't be able to put it on until sometime after December.
