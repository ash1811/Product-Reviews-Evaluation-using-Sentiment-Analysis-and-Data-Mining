The shoe runs very slightly longer and a smidge wider than my other grasshoppers and must be worn with socks.  However, it is very comfortable and the slightly higher heel makes walking easier. These will be my favorite shoe for the fall and I wish they still made them but in other colors. The fact that these only come in 11M indicates to me that they are no longer making them and these were the left overs maybe.
