When I first put these on they were great.  The fit was spot on in every direction.  After one washing with a very low dry cycle, they lost about 1.5&#34; in length!  So I had to return them to Amazon and get a pair of 514s.  This is the second pair of 511s in this color that shrunk way beyond expectations.
