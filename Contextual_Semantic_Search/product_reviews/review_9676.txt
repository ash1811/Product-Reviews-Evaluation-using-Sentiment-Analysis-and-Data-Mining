I'm very happy with this nightgown cover-up!!! That said, it is not exactly what I thought. This isn't a reflection on the company, I should have been more careful reading the description and reviews. I will be keeping this item as a splurge because it's so very pretty and I love it so much. I was, however, looking for something that would cover my short nightgown thoroughly so that when we have overnight guests I could have something pretty and yet modest in case I get caught making the coffee when our guests wake and come out to the living area of the house. I may be able to do that, not sure yet how comfortable I feel about it. I will almost for sure be able to if I am wearing a long nightgown.Things I LOVE about this gown.1. The purple color is stunning, seems true to the picture for me.2. The sleeves are tapered and stretchy so I'm able to push them up to wash my hands or wash dishes.3. The fit is perfect and flattering to my shapely but overly hippy figure.4. It's possibly modest enough for my purpose as it is not overly sheer through and my night gown is not low cut. I am pretty conservative.5. Love the length, not too long for my 5'4", possibly too short for women over 5'5" or so.Things I don't like:1. It's a tiny bit too sheer for me.2. Slightly too low cut3. DOES NOT BUTTON ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM (I am using caps to bring this to others who are considering this purchase).
