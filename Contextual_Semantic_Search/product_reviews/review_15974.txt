These are so comfortable that a crowbar may be required to pry my wife out of these socks.  At this point, I've given up on the idea. They fit perfectly, providing great cushioning, conform well to each foot, and provide the padding needed to walk at an exercise pace. Great socks- as usual, Thorlo gives the competition a good socking.
