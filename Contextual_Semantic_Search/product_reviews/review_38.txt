I have had this product for a while to evaluate because I have so enjoyed the format and the refresher course. I have 7 years of high school and college French but like so many Americans, I never learned to speak or aurally interpret native speech properly. I found the visual and sound exercises extremely helpful and enjoyable. I have been through the entire course multiple times and found that I was able to put a DVD on "French" and actually understand much of what being said. I'm not sure I'd learn formal French grammar this way but I don't think that is the point of the course.I was disappointed that I could not get the speech recognition microphone function to work despite many weeks of attempts, use of customer service and other techie help. My computer is quite up to the task and so was I but I was never able to get that working. Even so, the parts of the course I was able to access were very enjoyable and enhanced my French skills. Merci!Based upon this experience, I'd definitely consider buying the next course if I could be assured the voice recognition piece would work.
