Over the decades I've acquired a few black paisley bandanas -- they're useful in all sorts of ways, from an improvised table to a tourniquet to headwear to a scarf to filter air in a sandstorm -- really an essential item, right up there with a pair of sunglasses and a hat. You want one on hand when you travel anywhere, and maybe more than one. These seem well-made and big, and the printing is good, but the design is not smooth polished, and some of the design elements are bizarre IMHO. If you don't pay attention to it, you won't be bothered by it. I paid attention to it. Not the best bandana design I've ever seen by a good measure. They'll do for what I have in mind, but I think I'll keep my eye out for another few black paisley bandanas with a better design... And the thing is, all they had to do is design one quarter of the area, the other area are flipped or reflected.. The design looks good small, but at real-world 22x22 inch size, not so much.---I really dislike these. Into the trash they go. The design is not all there, and what there is doesn't please me. Ugly stuff -- clueless. Not what you want.
