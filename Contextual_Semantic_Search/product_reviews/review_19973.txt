I bought these as a Christmas gift for my mom about 3 years ago.  She was pretty rough on them and wore them around the house the majority of the year and they still lasted her the 3 years before I bought her this second pair.  She said they're like wearing slippers with the tougher bottoms, but they still feel like socks overall.  She loves them.
