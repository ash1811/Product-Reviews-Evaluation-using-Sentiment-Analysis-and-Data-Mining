This is a replacement of my previous watch.  The last one was also a Skagen.  It was the slightly smaller model--which I think has an advantage size-wise, but is missing the date function and seems to be less popular.  I've long been a fan of Skagen watches.  My last one actually got run-over!  It still looks pretty good (band is a little warped) but its not working any longer.
