I have a daughter with hard to fit feet. The 9.5 wides were just the trick. She finds these shoes comfortable, and a perfect fit for her size 9.5 wide foot. Just what she needed. I thought about going up a size, and am glad I did not. These are for my 12 year old daughter who needed them for a play. I would get them again.
