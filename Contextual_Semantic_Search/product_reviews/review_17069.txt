Had a pair of these in the original vans (not &#34;off the wall&#34;) and they lasted me three years of hard wear and stood up for a few cleanings. Got this pair new, was shipped US Mail first off so my shoes were sitting next to the box for anyone to grab. Second thing is the quality isn't anything near the older vans, the nose part of the shoe's sole didn't get enough adhesive and within minutes started to bubble. Not impressed, and will try something else next time. Though I had a friend tell me I can order the custom vans and get original quality, I'm just not that interested anymore. If 50 bucks won't buy good skate shoes with Vans i'm sure it will somewhere else.
