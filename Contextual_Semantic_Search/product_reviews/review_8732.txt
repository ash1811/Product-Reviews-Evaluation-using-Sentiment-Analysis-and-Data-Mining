this is a great mid sized watch! for the price i paid, i got quite a bit of quality as well.  i'm fairly rough on my watches and have found that divers tend to take my abuse well and keep on working.  for a budget minded person that wants quality you cant go wrong with this watch.  it has a well known seiko momevent in it, ( can't think of it at the current moment) also this watch has been in the shower, pool, hot tub and everywhere else with me and still works fine. ( i do realize that heat isn't something i should expose it to but thats why i bought a diver)on a side note, this is an automatic movement and it does lose some time.  since i received my watch in sept, i have noticed that it will lose about 3 minutes a week.  which isn't bad at all since if i wanted accurate time i would've bought a quartz watch.  some people have said this watch is luck of the draw with others being a run away train losing time.power reserve last about 36hrs or so, haven't exactly timed itthe rubber strap is pretty ugly but helps keep the weight down (i have enough stainless watches)if you want to enter the world of watches, this is a perfect piece to start with
