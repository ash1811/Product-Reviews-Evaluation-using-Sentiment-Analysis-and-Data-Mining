Pretty nice pants.  The design is authentic.  BUT, the fabric is standard commercial, NOT the rip-stop/banded cloth used in field BDU's: at least, not the ones I'm familiar with.  Nonetheless, they fit as expected according to their sizing chart, and the outward design matches the field BDU's of old.I am a &#34;pockets&#34; kind of fellow who feels lost without lots of places to store things.  This design is what I need for everyday wear.  As with GI clothing when you first get them, there are LOTS of ropes (threads) hanging.  Make sure to go over both the inside and the outside of the garment to burn them down BEFORE washing.  After the first wash, go over it again and burn any other loose ones.  Pay special attention to the stitching along the pockets inside and the buttons.  This will save you a lot of trouble later and extend the life of the garment.As far as sizing, it is as advertised.  I'm 6'2&#34;, 220 lbs, with a 39&#34; waist and a 32&#34; inseam.  I got the XL size, and they're perfect, the side straps take in any looseness.  The inseam on them is 33&#34;, but with boots/shoes on, they wear just right without dragging.
