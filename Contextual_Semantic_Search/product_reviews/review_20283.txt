This is a nice totebag, perfect size for lugging lunch, folders, books, water bottle, extra shoes, etc. to work. I went with a very safe color (gray), but I love that it's available in so many. The side pockets are a nice bonus. I'm not sure I'd travel with it, since the top is completely open, but for hauling stuff to and from work, it's perfect. Great value!
