At a 36G I didnt think that it would ever be possible for me to take a Zumba class or run on the treadmill without knocking myself out.  LOL!  THANK YOU GOD FOR THIS SPORTS BRA!  My "girls" stay in place throughout a full workout.  I loved this so much that I bought 2 more! :)  ****Warning: the band size runs SMALL! Make sure you order one band size up from your actual size.  I had to order a 38G.****
