I got this to replace a worn old L.L. Bean bag. I chose it because I loved the color and because Jansport has a good reputation. Unfortunately, within ten minutes of trying it out, I knew I had to return it. (And I never return things). The straps were extremely uncomfortable. Even with nothing in the backpack, they were noticeably less comfortable than my old bag's straps, and with a heavy book in the bag, they were downright painful. I didn't realize how much I rely on a curved strap for weight distribution when carrying heavy loads. This bag's straps are straight, padded but narrow, and not smartly placed. There is also no padding along the back, so if you are carrying anything hard or pointed (like a book), you can feel every pokey corner. There was no reinforcement in the bottom, and the material felt thin and flimsy. I'm doubtful this bag would stand up to much hard use. I returned this and got a North Face Vault, which I'm happy with.
