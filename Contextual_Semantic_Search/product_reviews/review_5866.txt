---------------- 8 Jul 2013 -----------------It appears as though the shirts being sold are not the ones I purchased/reviewed.  Another reviewer left a comment below, which I've copied and put here."The last bullet point says "Fiber Content: Fabric: 100% Open-end Cotton" so these are not 50/50 t-shirts as of July 7, 2013."If indeed these are now 100% cotton, that's a real shame...  Let's hope they change them back.  If you do order them, please confirm the material content in the comments for all to benefit.  Thanks!------------- Original Review ---------------I have to laugh at myself, writing a review for a T-Shirt of all things, but I gotta tell you, this is no ordinary T-shirt!  A year ago I bought one of these shirts in a local store and fell completely in love with it.  It's now a year later, I love it just the same, and I can't find them anywhere, except Amazon (thank God!)  The one I have just happens to have a silkscreen on it, and after a year of constant use (for work) the silkscreen still looks great.  When you compare this shirt to a 100% cotton shirt, these wear MUCH lighter & cooler, even though it says "heavyweight."  Don't let that scare you as it's not "heavy" at all.  With constant washing over the last year, the Hanes shirt has kept its color, unlike my 100% cotton shirts of the same age which have faded much faster.  Also, if you tend to perspire, these shirts will wick away the moisture more quickly and will not show it nearly as much as a 100% cotton shirt would.  Also nice is that they don't shrink or wrinkle.  I wish I had known about these shirts years ago...  Don't kick yourself years down the road when you buy one of these shirts by accident and wonder where its been all your life (like I did), get it now and enjoy it.
