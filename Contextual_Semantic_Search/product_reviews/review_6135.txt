Saw a similar shoe in White House Black Market in the Spring, but didn't buy it.  When I went back, the shoe was gone, but that's alright ... it was over $100 there ...  Saw this shoe on line for less than half the price, and it was Bandolino, a great brand.  Got the shoe in time to take on an AK cruise, and I'm in love ...  Shoe is very comfortable and well worth the money.  I would highly recommend this shoe to anyone who is looking for a classic look and comfortable shoe!
