One size is way too big, the next size is too small. There is no happy medium for sizing these things. My 8 1/2 wide foot found no happy compromise. The sheepskin felt really nice though, so I gave it 3 stars. Oh, and labels say that only the sheepskin is from Australia, but the slipper itself is made, well, you know where! ;)
