The first pair we ordered had a difference in sizing, but thanks to Amazon's Prime return policy,we shipped it back at no cost to us and they had already sent us a replacement meanwhile.He says they are comfortable, easy to put on and off, and I don't think he has worn any ofhis other shoes since I gave him these for Christmas a month ago.That's the review I was hoping for from him. . .
