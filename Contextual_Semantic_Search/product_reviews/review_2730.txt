I like the Timex for travel. It is inconspicuous and not flashy and it has an easy to read dial in any light and it has an alarm. I don't believe in going to a country and wearing a watch that obviously cost as much as the locals earn in a year. It is not smart and it is not kind and it definitely would end up costing me more when I negotiate for any goods or services which are often on a sliding scale with foreigners charged 3-4x as much. I would rather pay 2x what the locals are charged and recommend leaving your bling at home. It is also 4 times as accurate as a Rolex or similar anachronistic timepiece that people seem to crave for status alone, so if you do need a watch for navigation without a GPS or for when the GPS packs it in, a digital watch is the way to go.When I need to get up and leave for the airport or some other time critical destination I do not like to rely on hotel alarm clocks or wakeup calls. I carry a travel alarm but I also like having the Timex available as a backup alarm.Battery life is exceptional and I have gone three years without replacing the battery. I do not use the light function much which may be part of the reason for the long battery life. With its white dial and analog display I do not need the light the way I would with a digital display.
