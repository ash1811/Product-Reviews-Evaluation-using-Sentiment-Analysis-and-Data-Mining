MY HUSBAND WORKS AS A CUSTODIAN 4 A NYC PUBLIC SCHOOL SO I WASNT LOOKING 4 REALLY WELL MADE EXPENSIVE SWEATSHIRT. BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT, ..ITS GONNA GET DIRTY, GREASY, PAINT SPLATTERED + TORN IN NO TIME. I DID GET EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING 4 THOUGH. A NICE BASIC SWEATSHIRT THAT WASHES & DRIES WITHOUT SHRINKING OR FADING COLORS 4 A REALLY GREAT PRICE. THEY ARRIVED QUICKLY, IN PERFECT CONDITION & I WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN.
