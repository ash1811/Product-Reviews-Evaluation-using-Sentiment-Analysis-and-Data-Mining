It took more than 2 weeks to ship from the seller and arrived well after the original estimated ship date. Then, much too small. I bought Medium, which is what I wear all the time. I am a true 34 in waist, not a gut hanging over the belt 34. and these were at least a size to small. Also, there is NO pouch. The front is flat and even if they were the right size, I believe they would be very uncomfortable. The supplier accepted my return (I paid the postage) USPS First class mail  using the supplied return label and put the RMA document inside the package as required. After 10 days and hearing nothing back about the return, I contacted the seller via email through the AMAZON website and was informed that they had received my returned items and would expedite the process. Another 4 or 5 days I received a credit to my AMAZON account for the initial amount but not the return postage. BOTTOM line, it took 5 weeks and $2.41 to receive and return a product that did not fit.
