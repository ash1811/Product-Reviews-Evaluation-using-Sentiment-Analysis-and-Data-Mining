It's my fault entirely because I order a relaxed fit that looks all puffy and just awful on my husband.  I returned them and are the Classic Regular Fit in a 38x32- same size.  I washed and dried them and they shrunk enough that they looked real good on him for about one hour before he had to wear a belt to hold them up.  It turns out that I found an old pair of 36x32 that are perfect and he is wearing them this weekend.  I also found a stack of 34x32 that he will never be able to wear again and will go directly to a church thrift store along with about 20 shirts that are almost new but too small.The Relaxed Fit was TOO relaxed and was returned for the Classic Regular Fit.
