Columbia makes an awesome pair of "Half Moon" shorts for guys who want a remarkably comfortable pair of shorts. Mine fit easily and I agree with the reviewer who writes that these are so comfortable you just might forget you have them on! You can't get any better than that.I don't fish but I do wear these on hot days when I am walking a lot; and these are going to come in very handy when I slowly but surely begin hiking for exercise, too. I won't want heavy shorts when I begin hiking.The stitching is very well done and I like the way they made the pockets--really good. The front pockets couldn't have been designed better and the back pocket lets me carry even more. The inseam is just about right for a guy my height (5' 7"). Of course, other guys--including taller guys--may want to continue looking for shorts that have a longer inseam.These are 100% cotton but of course you can wash them easily in the regular washer and dryer. They require no special care.I highly recommend these shorts; they are very well made and they should last years. The only limitation I can think of is that some guys may want a longer inseam; but otherwise these are terrific.
