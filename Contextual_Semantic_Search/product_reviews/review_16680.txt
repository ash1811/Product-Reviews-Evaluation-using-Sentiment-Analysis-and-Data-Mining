I wasn't expecting much as it was not expensive, but it's truly gorgeous. It came well packaged with a beautiful satin padded hanger. Everything was well put together. Love this and will be buying another color! True to size, I am 5ft 7, 130lbs and I purchased a small which fit well. It is a little short so don't wear it around your grandpa, unless of course you're into that sort of thing.
