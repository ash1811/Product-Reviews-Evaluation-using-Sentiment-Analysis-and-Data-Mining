I would have given this product five stars, but over a not-so-long timeframe, it has stretched to the point that it is not attractive to use.  It still does its job just fine, but the excess belt won't stay in the belt loops.  I bought a large and have since re-purchased a medium....which starts out being almost too small....but wear it a few times and it fits great.
