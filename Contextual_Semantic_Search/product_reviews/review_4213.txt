Fits well. Looks nice under tee shirts. I am a bit busty and this bra is supportive and comfortable. I am not a big fan of the T-back/sports bra styling.  I generally don't like that much material across my back, but in this case it works.  Straps are set wide enough that they don't cut into my neck like some T-backs can do.
