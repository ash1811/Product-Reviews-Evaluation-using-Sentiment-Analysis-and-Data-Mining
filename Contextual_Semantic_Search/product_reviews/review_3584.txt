Our family loves hiking.  We all have an appropriate pair of these socks.  Living in a very hot climate, these socks do get a little warm.  However, price and quality make these socks a worthwhile purchase.I've even been known to wear these as my work socks.  As someone who works in a school and is on his feet most of the day, these socks are both confortable and stylish enough for daily wear.I would like to be able to compare them against another brand which claims to be cooler.
