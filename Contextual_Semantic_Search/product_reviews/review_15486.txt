These say "3 months", but I have a long boy who's 6 months who still can't wear these. The neck is HUGE and can be pulled down and off his body, while the length is too short. Thought maybe they would shrink because they're cotton, instead they just stretch in the neck.*Update! I kept these bodysuits thinking baby would grow into them, which was a mistake. Baby is now a year old and still can't wear these "3 month" bodysuits. The opening for the head will fit a 5 year old, the suit will always be too short, and the leg openings will also fit a 5 year old. I can't imagine any baby proportioned to fit in these, they are just junk!
