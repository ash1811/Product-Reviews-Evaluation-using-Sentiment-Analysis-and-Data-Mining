I've had this chain for about three or four weeks now and while it looked great when I got it- I've noticed some tarnishing already on it. I do wear it daily, but I think it should last more than a month without looking dull and dingy....It is, however, strong enough to hold up to the rather large charm and locket that I have on it.EDIT: It's been a little over a month since I bought this and it broke yesterday. No real reason at all- just broke. Now I'll have to try to find a new chain, hopefully one that will last more than one freaking month....
