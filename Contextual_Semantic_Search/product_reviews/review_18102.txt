The soles have a great grip on tiled and smooth cement floors, even when wet.  Because of the thickness of the soles, they are a heavier shoe, but became unnoticeable after a few wears.  After 6 months of wear, they still have a &#34;hardly worn&#34; look to them.My only minor criticism- the tongue is a bit shorter than I would like, it barely comes up past the shoelaces.
