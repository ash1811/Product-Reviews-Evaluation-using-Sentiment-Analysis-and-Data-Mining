I gave this as a gift to a friend who has been wearing the same Seiko watch every day for 15 years.  She needed a bigger face to be able to see the numbers, but has a very small wrist. She LOVES it and has made the switch. The face is big enought for her 55 year old eyes, but not overwhelming on her small wrist. She had four links removed at the jewelers, and thinks she may go back and have one more removed, but is already wearing it every day.  The only problem/complaint I have is that the watch was already running when we got it. I complained to Amazon but to no avail - they stated basically that's how it comes from the distributor. I feel that is NOT an acceptable answer. There is no reason to spend this much on a watch and to not have it arrive with the battery pull tab intact on the stem. This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.
