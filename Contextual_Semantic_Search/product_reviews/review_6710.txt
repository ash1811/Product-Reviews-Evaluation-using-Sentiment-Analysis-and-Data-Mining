I'm not a fan of boots that go up to the calf, so I bought this item (first in Espresso; then later in Black) in order to pair with my booties (Martinez Valero Felicia) so that I could wear my skirts in winter without freezing.  I'm pleased with the fit and the price, and I received this item in less than a week, although I chose FREE shipping.
