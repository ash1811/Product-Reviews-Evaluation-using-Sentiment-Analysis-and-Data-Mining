Excellent product. Well-made, true-to-size and extremely comfortable. They're good to sleep in (which is what I bought them for) although perhaps a tad too supportive for that purpose (I don't really mind). Also great for lounging around and even a run to the grocery store! So glad I found this product. I wish the 36C-D-DD would come back in stock so I can buy more!
