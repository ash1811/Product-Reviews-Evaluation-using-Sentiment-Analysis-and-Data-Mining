Very roomy in the toe area - kinda duck foot looking - more room than I need. The sock material is pretty utilitarian looking. OK but I would not buy them again - a bit too high school gym class looking for me. Also, I don't need all that elastic for my socks to stay up. When I think of the name,Gold Toe, I think of the better style of my husband's socks.
