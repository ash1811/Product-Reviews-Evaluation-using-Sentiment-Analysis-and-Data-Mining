This gown is true to size and is very comfortable to wear.  I like to move around when I sleep and this gown does bunch up a little when I sleep.  The material is a fairly lightweight so it is comfortable to sleep in while not getting too hot.  The straps do not dig in on the shoulders.  This gown will definitely get used fairly regularly.  I recommend getting the robe as well as it is thin and maybe a little see thru in bright lights.
