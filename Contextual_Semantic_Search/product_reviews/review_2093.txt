Not that the adult goggles are huge, but this case barely fits a youth size. Well made, simple construction. Not a hard case. I keep my son's spare pair of goggles in this case on the side of his backpack where they won't get smashed. I would buy another one if I needed to, but the speedo case is a better buy I believe.
