This is an excellent watch overall and I give it 5/5 stars. Although the price is a touch high compared to Casio models, it works well and seems to be pretty tough. In general, I prefer Casio, but I do like the large display and durability this Timex Ironman offers. I've had it for several years and it performs well. I also like the fact that it has normal band lugs (something Casio often strays from) which enable me to apply various aftermarket bands. This is nice, since I'm not a huge fan of the typical rubber bands on most digitalis. Anyway, it's solid and works well.
