These are very nice pants, they look and feel great. BUT they are very large in the leg, running straight down from the thigh with no taper - "elephant leg". I am 6'1" tall, just under 200lbs and reasonably HWP. I could probably almost fit both legs in one pant. I don't think washing and drying would have made much difference. These are perfect for people who do a lot of bending, kneeling and squating. Amazon took them back graciously but I regretted having to return them.
