I have made purchases for the right bra for a long time.  The first time I tried this on, I knew it was for me.  I am the type to NEVER sleep in a bra because it's uncomfortable.  This bra doesn't bother me at all and I can sleep in it with no problems.  I highly recommend you give this a try... you won't be disappointed.
