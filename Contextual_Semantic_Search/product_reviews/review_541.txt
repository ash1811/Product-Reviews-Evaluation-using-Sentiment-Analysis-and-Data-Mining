The wallet has served me well for the short time I have owned it, however, the stitching holding the picture ID window in place has become loose,  is unraveling and is about 30% detached.  It appears the window will become unattached shortly. This unraveling is no doubt a result of having to produce ID several times a week while shopping.  A simple fix would be reinforced stitching in that most used area of the wallet where wear-and-tear are greatest.
