I walked two days under the rain with these socks, and they are great!  Even when feet were soaking wet, they did not feel like they were, and the socks did not stick to the skin like regular cotton socks.When dry, they give you a nice padding, and keep your feet cool, these are power buys for someone intending to put miles on a pair of boots!  They dry relatively quickly.
