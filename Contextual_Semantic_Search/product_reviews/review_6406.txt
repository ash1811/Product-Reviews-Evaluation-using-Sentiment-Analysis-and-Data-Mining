It was received in 3 days! It is a nice warm sweat shirt. I thought I was ordering a women's shirt but from the length of the arm and body believe it a man's. It is a medium. Next time I will order a small.It washed well and stayed in shape. I am 5-3 and small boned so the shirt is a tad too big. Quality of shirt is good.
