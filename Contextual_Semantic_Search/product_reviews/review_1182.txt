I am a fairly thin person with a little extra weight in the upper thigh area and was hoping these could minimize the look under dresses or more fitted pants, but unfortunately they didn't seem to do anything for me.  They were very tight and hard to get on, and once I did I still had the same lumps and bumps.  Very dissapointed.
