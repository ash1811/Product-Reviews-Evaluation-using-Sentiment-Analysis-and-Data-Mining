Well, what can I say.  They are the panties I always buy.  Afterall, they are just a fundamental, necessary thing.  However, there are panties, and then there are panties.  These fit well, launder nicely, and last for a fairly long time.  And I am not gentle with them.  I use a little bleach and hot water to wash them, then toss them into the dryer (on medium setting).  They hold up to the unslaught very well.  Eventually the elastic waist begins to wear out, that is become slightly less elastic.  However, by then the panties ought to be replaced anyway.  Good basic product, worth the money.  Bargain panties are not a bargain.  They often don't fit well, or the fabric is odd.  These are the best, highly recommend.  I am not sure they deserve five stars, as they are a bit pricey.  However, you get what you pay for, and these are very nice.
