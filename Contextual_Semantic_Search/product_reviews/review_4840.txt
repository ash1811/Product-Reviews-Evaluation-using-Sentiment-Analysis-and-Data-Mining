I usually get the boxer brief version but ordered these by accident. Given the mesh like material which has little structure or shape I personally found these a bit too free flowing. The fabric bunched in weird ways and even though I ordered the right size it just seemed like a lot of fabric to fit into standard straight leg Levis. Maybe current boxer wearers will find these suitable, but it didn't work out for me.
