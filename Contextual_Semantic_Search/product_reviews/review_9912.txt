I just needed a couple of new "around the house / yard" shirts that are comfortable enough that I don't prefer to just go without. The last XXX-Large tank top I got ended up sliding on like a body stocking, not even close to a XXX-Large. For $5 I figured I've give this one a try. The  size is correct and it fits nicely. I've already put it through the washer and a hot dryer and it did not shrink so I give it high marks for that. The only drawback that I have is a pet peeve of mine. When I'm working outside, I'm usually sweating and any shirt that rides up on my neck in the front irritates the front of my neck, hence the reason, I'm looking for a tank top. So maybe it's my body shape of the shirt but this one rides up so that the neckline is all the way up to my neck. Sitting down or standing up and walking around does not make much of a difference, I have to keep pulling the front down to keep it off my neck. All in all, you can't beat the deal for this shirt. I recommend this product.
