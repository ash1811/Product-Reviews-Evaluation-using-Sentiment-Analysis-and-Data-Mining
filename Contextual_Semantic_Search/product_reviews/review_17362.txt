As far as I'm concerned, there is no other bag.  This is IT.  I have 3 already and have just ordered 2 more. Had been unable to find these in a store anymore so I went to trusty Amazon.  I like the Medium size which is 19" tall.  Lots of pockets inside and outside. I always know where everything is no matter how many times I change purses.  My black one must be l5 years old and is still in good condition. I've used it the most but have used the light blue a lot too.  The red that I have is just not large enough. I think it's 15" tall. I can use it but it's a tight squeeze to fit everything in so I just ordered it in the 19 inch. NOTE: Be warned, this bag says it is a medium but it is 17 inches tall.  When I see what stores are charging for crummy little handbags I see that this is a very good bargain as they last forever.  I've just this morning thrown out every other handbag I have - sent to a Mission give away store.  You can carry this bag loaded all day and never feel any pressure on your shoulder.
