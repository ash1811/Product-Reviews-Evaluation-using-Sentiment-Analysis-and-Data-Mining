These shoes are the best. I bought a red pair eight years ago and although they are beginning to show some wear, they are still going strong. So I decided to get the next pair, and they are exactly like the first pair but I got a new fabulous color. Bougainvillea aka periwinkle:) Awesome. Fit perfect! I am very impressed Keen is controlling quality so well for all these years.
