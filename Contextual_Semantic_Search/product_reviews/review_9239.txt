I used to wear Isotoner slippers all the time, and then they slipped off my radar screen for some reason.  When I suddenly remembered them, I knew that if ANYONE would have them, it was Amazon; and of course they did and at a great price!  This particular pair has extra padding and a more &#34;shoe-like&#34; sole.  I washed them IN THE WASHING MACHINE and dried them IN THE DRYER over the weekend, and they look like new!
