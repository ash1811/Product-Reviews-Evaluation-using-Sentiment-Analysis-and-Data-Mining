These are my second pair after having the same pair for almost 5 years.  I wanted flip flops that had a hard sole so I would stop slipping when it was wet.  These are amazing.  The criss cross straps are very comfortable.  The foot bed shapes to your foot and then there's the strong sole to give you plenty of traction.  These are great everyday flip flops and totally worth the price.
