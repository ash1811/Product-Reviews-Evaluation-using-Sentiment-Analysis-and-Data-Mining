Great toy, our son (4) is obsessed with pirates lately and he carries this chest around and has even slept with it. I worried he would think it was too small but it's just right for him to carry around....because he carries it and therefore drops it and rolls it over he asked his Dad to glue the secret stash board in place...the flag is hanging on his wall..
