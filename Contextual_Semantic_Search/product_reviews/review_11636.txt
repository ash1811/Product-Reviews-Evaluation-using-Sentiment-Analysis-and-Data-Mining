These leggings are longer than most, which I appreciate. They are softer than most, which I appreciate. Besides that they are pretty costly for what they are They are fairly thin, which I find disappointing. At $30 a pair I won't be buying more. I'm 5'5 @ 150lbs. and a large was perfect so I would say they are true to size. I would recommend them if you can afford the cost for leggings that are already nearly see thru on arrival.
