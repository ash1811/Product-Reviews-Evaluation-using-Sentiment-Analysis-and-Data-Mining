I have always bought the Playtex 18 Hour bras because I believed in the advertising that said they were comfortable.  Unfortunately I was never satisfied.  It was pure happenstance that I was in a store that sold this bra and I bought it because the aisle was clogged going to the Playtex bras.  I tried the bra on when I got home and was ecstatic with how comfortable it was.  I am very top heavy and most bras dig into my shoulders and the underwires are just plain uncomfortable.  I wore it for the entire next day with absolutely no discomfort in the straps or the underwires.  In fact, this bra is so soft that it almost feels like a second skin.  I decided right then that I needed more of these Bali bras and bought 2 more from Amazon.  If you are the type of the person who cannot wait to get out of their bra at the end of the day, I encourage you to try this bra.  I believe you will be pleasantly surprised with the fit and feel of the fabric.  I will never buy a Playtex bra again.
