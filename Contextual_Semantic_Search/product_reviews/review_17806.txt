Nicely sized and fairly comfortable watch.  Bargain price for essential digital features.The band is somewhat uncomfortable, stiff at leather junctures with rough edges.The dark face is the problem, plus goofy face &#34;decorations&#34; that are not useful but are meant to look high tech and cool.Too bad Casio, please stick to features, comfort over looks.
