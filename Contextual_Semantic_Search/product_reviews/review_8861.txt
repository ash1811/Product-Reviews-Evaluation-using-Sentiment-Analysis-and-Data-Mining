This isn't your &#34;granny's favorite flannel nightgown&#34;.  This is pure romance.  The fabric is sheer and silky to the touch and the lace bodice is soft without being scratchy.  I wanted this gown more for those special kind of moments and it completely fits the bill.  The look on my &#34;cowboy's face&#34; when I put it on was worth every cent.  I bought it a size larger than I needed so that the skirt would be fuller and more draped.  This makes the top rather loose on me, but the overall look is still beautiful.  I highly recommend this gown to anyone looking for a little more &#34;heat&#34;.
