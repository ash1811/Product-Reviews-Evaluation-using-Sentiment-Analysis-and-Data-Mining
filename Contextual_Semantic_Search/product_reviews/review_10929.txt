These look good in pictures, but do not look so great in person.to make matters worse, they are not very comfortable.They remind me of those shoes that you rent at the tuxedo shop before a wedding or prom or something.Not comfortable.Shiny, but not comfortable.These are especially bad if you are actually going to be using them. Walking in them, wearing them day in and day out.They are stiff, uncomfortable, hard, and they don't seem like they will wear in very well.
