My daughter needed this for a sorority event (Lord knows).  She sent me the link to order for her, at least she said please this time,  Before I ordered I read the reviews and noticed many saying the dress was tight through the hips.I called her and mentioned that to her, and asked that she review her size,  Of course that was an INSULT.Anyway, when I did not hear back I ordered her original request size.  The pico-second I hit the buy button the phone rang and she said OK, get the bigger size.  Amazon was great about cancelling the first order.Just got an email yesterday, &#34;The dress arrived, thank you.  It is HUGE.  I think I can use safety pins to fix it.  I know I should have gotten the smaller size.&#34;  Talk about a poke in the eye, when I bought her the damn dress!So, it sometimes sucks to be the dad and I am not sure this dress is as small as some think!
