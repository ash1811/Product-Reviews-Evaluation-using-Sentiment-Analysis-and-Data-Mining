Heavier than regular T shirts, they wear well. Nice for cooler temps. I don't see any other companies making a shirt like this.UPDATE-Compared to shirts I bought last year, the fabric Carthartt uses is lighter weight. Not a lot, but noticeable. I've been noticing this with other Carthartt products ( Jeans and Lined Shirts). I know that you have to compete, but making a less durable/lower quality product is going to drive longtime customers away.
