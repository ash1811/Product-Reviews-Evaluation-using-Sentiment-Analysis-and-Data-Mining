I am finally getting the point, want t-shirts that dont shrink after 2 washes, then pay just a little more.  I am used to buying XL shirts counting on the shrink factor.  But was told these would be good as large and they are.  couple washed in so far, no shrinking.  they feel a little different at the front of the shoulder, but nothing I worry about.  I've worn these both as under-shirts and as primary shirt and they look good and work nice for both.
