My husband LOVES these jeans. They are a GREAT FIT, especially in the seat. The legs aren't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette. I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE. They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of "dress jeans" as well as versatile. We are ordering more. Ladies, get him these jeans!
