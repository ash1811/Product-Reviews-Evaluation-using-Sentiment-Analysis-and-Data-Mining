These are my second pair.  First pair, I have been wearing for 5 years and while they haven't worn out they are looking a little bit ratty.  They are an around the house/yard shoe.  These are my new about town summer shoe.  Fit is perfect and very, very comfortable for my chronic achilles tendinitis.  Love these shoes........
