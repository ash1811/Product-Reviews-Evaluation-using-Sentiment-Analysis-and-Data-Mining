I bought several of these kind of shirts but for some reason, this color, even after 1 wash in cold water, and low dried in the dryer, it always fade near the collar. I bought a second one and the same thing happened.I would not buy this color again. The other color seems to stay put although one of the lighter green shirt is now experience the color fade as this one.
