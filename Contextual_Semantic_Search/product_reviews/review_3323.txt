I have always bought this bra because it doesn't make my breast look pointy, it is smooth under the cloths, no seams, offers great support and lasts a long time.  The only reason I didn't give it a five star is because something has changed with the strap design as it is digging where it didn't use to... Maybe I'm just getting fat????
