This is the standard playtex bra I have been buying for years with the exception it is no longer made in the USA.  There is a difference in quality depending upon where it is manufactured but compared to other bras I have tried, it is still one of the best especially for larger sizes.  The straps are nice as they don't "cut" into my shoulders. Very nice support for being a wireless bra which after numerous bad experiences I try not to buy anymore.A plus for me as I am very short the straps adjust up and stay where I put them.  Many of the other bras I have tried adjust down and end up being to long to put the girls where they should be.Over a certain size they give you 4 hooks which is really nice and cuts down on the band shifting.The only down side is I refer to this bra as my "lunch room lady bra."  It is sturdy, dependable and gets the job done but lacks frills.Held up well to washing and line drying (repeated drying in a dryer does not work well with these)
