I bought this for my elder mother, who wanted a LONG nightgown. Turns out it was a little too long for her :-)  and I hand hemmed it. Not a big deal. she is very particular about the length of her gowns. Quite a pretty gown, nice color, nice neckline and coverage....only wish the fabric was not so thin!
