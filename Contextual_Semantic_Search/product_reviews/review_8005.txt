I don't feel right about dinging this bra because these are such a personal item and what I hate another may love, but I found this bra to be stiff and uncomfortable and the cups were a bit larger than as sized. (Extra fabric in a D.) It felt too big too exercize in. Maybe it would soften up after washing but I didn't like it enough to keep it and try. I hate most bras- but I also got the Anita Momentum in this order and that one was much softer, supportive, breathed well and felt true to size.
