Ordered 1 blue and 1 gray based on previous Jerzees shirt. These two did not disappoint. Fit is just what I expected. Material is very good fabric. Hopefully I will not have to test the SpotShield treatment for a very long while. I recommend these Jerzees to anyone who is looking for a nice shirt at a very reasonable price.
