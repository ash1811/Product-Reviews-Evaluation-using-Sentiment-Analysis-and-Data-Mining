This camisole is the best one I have ever worn. The fit is perfect. I am very long waisted and it is not too short - it goes about 2 inches below my waist so tops have a smooth transition to pants.  This would not be too long for a short or regular waisted person. I would advise going to their website for sizing since it is different from the standard Amazon sizing.
