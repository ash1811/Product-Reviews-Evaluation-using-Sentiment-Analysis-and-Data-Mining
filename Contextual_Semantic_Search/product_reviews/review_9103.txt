I see a lot of people talk about these jeans, or skinny jeans in general, and say that they only look good on skinny guys, or more particularly, that they only fit skinny guys. Not true here. I'm by no means fat but I'm bot skinny either. I thought these might fit extremely tight, push my gut up, and make getting my keys or phone out of my pocket near impossible. I was wrong. They are very form fitting, but they don't look like "jeggings" or some spandex jeans which I think looks ridiculous. They have a little stretch which makes the waste nice and the pockets easily useable. This also keeps them from being constricting, as they're very comfortable and easy to get around in.  Jeans stretch a little and form to you as you wear them. I can squeeze into a 36 in normal jeans, and after they stretch out they fit snug. So I tend to buy 38's in normal jeans which fit snug, then after stretching out are a little loose. Based on the reviews here saying to go up a size in waste, I stuck with the 38. They fit perfect.Keep in mind if you're not skinny and going to wear these jeans, you need to dress appropriately. If you're in good shape you don't have to worry at all, but if you could lose a few pounds you might need to choose what you wear wisely. You can't wear that really slim t-shirt  you normally wear with looser fitting jeans, because these jeans will make you look pudgier in the mid section. So wear a regular t-shirt or button down, and you'll be good to go.I enjoy these a lot, especially for the price. I just bought another pair.
