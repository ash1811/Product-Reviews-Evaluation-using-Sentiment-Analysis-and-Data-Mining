This is obviously a quality product.  But the space for your foot looks almost like an after-thought.  Like so much work went into the lower design that they forgot what body part this goes on.I got a full size larger than I normally wear, both in length and width, because my feet sweat a lot and I want to wear a couple of socks.  No room.  As it is, I will have to wear a pair of thin socks to get these to on.  Not what I hoped for.
