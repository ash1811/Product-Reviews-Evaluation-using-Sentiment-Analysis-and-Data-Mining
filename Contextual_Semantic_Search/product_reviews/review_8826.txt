Okay so these look like some 1950 girdle inspired grandma panties, but I have large thighs and in the summer, if I'm wearing a skirt or pants with a low-set crotch, I get bad chaffing. These help out a ton! So if your significant other wants to give you a hard time about these bloomer things, by all means give them the what for!
