This watch is perfect as a casual dress watch.  I like the slim profile, and the blue dial really seems to attract your eye.  I get random compliments on it all the time.  The clasp is a little suspect, and the only negative about the watch.  Its easy to not hook it up properly, and it could fall off if your not carefull.
