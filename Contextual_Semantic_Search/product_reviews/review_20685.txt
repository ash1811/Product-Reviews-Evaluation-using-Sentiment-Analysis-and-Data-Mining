No need to write a long review on these jeans. QUALITY. SUPER (as advertised) FIT. MAKES ME FEEL GREAT.  And, I still feel this way after 6+ washes!  I will buy more!  The best ego feature -- no &#34;stretchies&#34; on the side waistband that make me feel like a blue-haired retiree. (Have I just insulted half of my peers?). Ah, heck. The jeans just make me feel younger.
