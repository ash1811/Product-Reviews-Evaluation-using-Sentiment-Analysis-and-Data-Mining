Jerzees will be my choice in the future.  No pockets is what I have been looking for and did not know anybody made them.  For me, pockets in sweats are not necessary and never could find sweats without pockets.  These also wash up nicely and are so warm and comfortable.  I just wish they also came with open bottoms instead of elasticized bottoms.  Well, maybe next time I buy Jerzees 8 oz sweatpants, they will have open bottoms.
