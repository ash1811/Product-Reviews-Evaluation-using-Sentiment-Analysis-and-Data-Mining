We travel every 2-3 weeks via air and the first time we traveled the airline nearly ruined my car seat with grease and grime.  I purchased this to protect it the next time and it has been FABULOUS. Obviously the car seat still gets tossed around by the airline, but the bag is slightly padded and it completely covers the car seat so it's protected against grime.
