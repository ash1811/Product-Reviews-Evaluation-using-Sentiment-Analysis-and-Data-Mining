I have several Ameribags.  I have had neck problems for years and carrying a normal purse just isn't an option. Ameribags are awesome. The leather is much heavier than the nylon version but it is so luxurious I'm willing to deal with the extra weight. The leather is so supple!  The arctic white is a gorgeous color. I was pleasantly surprised that it isn't a bright white. It is more of a dusky white which I think makes it much more wearable. The extra small size will carry a lot. I can even fit my iPad mini in it with its case.  I also have the small size in the sand colored  leather which is gorgeous as well but just a bit bigger than I prefer.
