I purchased these in XL because some reviews suggested that they were a little bit on the short side. My pants size is 32x32. They are plenty long in the leg, not loose at all in the waist, and plenty of room for me in between,Caution: If you have satin sheets on your bed and you are wearing these pajamas, you could slide right out of bed.
