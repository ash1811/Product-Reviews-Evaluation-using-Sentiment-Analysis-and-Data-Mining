I have discovered that over the years the Birkenstock M width has become wider.So I order a N in this style and loved the look and fit.Feeling I'd discovered a great solution to clunky Birkenstock look I ordered this pair...in the same N width and they are too narrow ~So apparently not all N's are the same, even in the same exact sandal style:  Arizona.Disappointing for sure.
