Purchased these flippers after I wore holes in my other ones. They were so comfortable I didn't want to buy new ones only to be disappointed. But these shoes did anything but disappoint.They have a thick sole on them so you can walk on rocks or gravel and not feel a thing. The straps on the feet are made of two materials; the top is really soft and feels a little like micro-suede even though its not and the bottom is just braided/woven polyester type material. It's stitched together and makes a very comfortable wear.My only two complaints:1) The bottom seems a little slippery on some surfaces, mainly rocks.2) I got some blisters my first hike in these.These both became apparent on a 4 mile hike through the Greenbelt in Austin. I slid a little on the rocks and got a blister on the inside of my left foot from the strap.These issues are not something that I wouldn't expect anyway from new flippers so I'm still in love with these.Also, when it came time to clean (they're tan so dirt does show on them in the form of dirty foot prints) I just used a pumice stone gently on the entire shoe. Didn't take the design off the bottom, but gently is the key word there.Enjoy!
