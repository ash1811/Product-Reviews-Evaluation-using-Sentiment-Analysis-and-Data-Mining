I'm a merrell shoe wearer and this wore great for about a week then got very loose on my feet.im a diabetic and have to wear a great shoe.And merrell is a great shoe.i got in touch with customer service at merrell and she replaced these with a new pair,without all the trouble we have to go though with the big box retail stores.thank you AMAZON and MERRELL for great products and customer service .I do recommend these shoes
