These shoes are great! I ordered them to replace my Toms, which had holes by my toes. These seem much sturdier, and they are purported to last years.I ordered them a full size smaller than I usually order, and I'm glad I did. It took a couple weeks of serious breaking-in, but after some wear and some rain, they fit perfectly now.If you order a size down, expect them to be incredibly tight out of the box. They started out pretty stiff, but they've been breaking in well.
