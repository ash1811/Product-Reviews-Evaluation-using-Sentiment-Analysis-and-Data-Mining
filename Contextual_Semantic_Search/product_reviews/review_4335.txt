Bought a half size larger than usual, as recommended on both Amazon and Keen, and it fits perfectly. Keens fit is more comfortable and I can wear them longer, in and out of water, than any other brand. Look nice. I expect them to last. So far, no funky smell like you get with some water sandals, but I haven't had them very long.
