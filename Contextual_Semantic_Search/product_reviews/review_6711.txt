I got these size 2 herb colored tights.  They fit very well and are so very comfortable!  I am 5' 5&#34; tall and weigh 134 pounds.  These were just right for me.  I like these Hue opaque tights for summer as they are lighter weight and more feminine and the thicker tights.  I love the way that they feel too.  They feel cool and warm at the same time.  Strange, but true.
