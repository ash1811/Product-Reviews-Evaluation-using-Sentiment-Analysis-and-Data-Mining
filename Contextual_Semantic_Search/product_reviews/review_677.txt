I have been buying Shadowline night gowns for years. They took the place of the Vanity Fair ones I use to be able to find. With this recent purchase I noticed that the fabric IS a lighter weight compared to my other Shadlowline gowns. Maybe the company is trying to cut down on their cost and therefore using lighter weight fabric. Either way I love the color and am happy with it. If they go any lighter in the fabric weight I will NOT buy anymore.
