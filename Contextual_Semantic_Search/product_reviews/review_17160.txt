I normally wear an 8&1/2 so I'm sorta' in the middle, but these 8-9 slippers are huge on me.  I just wish Acorn would bring them out in single sizes as I'm not sure a smaller one would work with these.  The slippers themselves don't have a lot of support but they're okay for schlepping around in but not for all day on your feet.
