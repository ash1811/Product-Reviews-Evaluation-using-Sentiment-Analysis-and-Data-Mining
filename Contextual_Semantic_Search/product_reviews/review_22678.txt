This is a decent tool and a very low price.  It's obviously not a high-precision device, but used carefully can get the job done.  I stress "carefully".  If the tool is not adjusted to exactly fit your watch's cover plate, you're almost certainly risking serious scratches on the cover.The unit I received was only "OK" Both of the adjustments worked smoothly, but one of the pin sockets did not contain a detent ball, so that pin was loose and wobbly.  One of the other detent balls was stuck and I had to move it with a screwdriver before the pin could be fully inserted.  I put a couple of layers of transparent tape on the pin base and that cured the "loose pin" problem.However, the wood case is very nice. :-)
