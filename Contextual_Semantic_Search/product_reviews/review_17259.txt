I purchased these and they were a little too big.  I normally wear a size 12 in Nike Shoes so if that gives you some sort of an idea.  I also did not like the gel inserts.  I am a larger man 250+ and I felt like the princess and the pea.  I guess if you already have that much weight pushing down on your feet its not a good thing to have something under them that they are not use to.
