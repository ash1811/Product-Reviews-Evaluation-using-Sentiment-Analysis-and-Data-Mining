I purchase these to use as sleep shirts -- yes, I'm a woman, but these are SOOooo comfortable, and hold up well to washing.I usually order 3-4 sizes larger than my normal size to allow for comfort -- they don't bind, and they're long enough to cover what needs to be covered.  I also like that there are so many choices in colors, too.The quality is great -- I have absolutely NO complaints at all.  Very happy with this.
