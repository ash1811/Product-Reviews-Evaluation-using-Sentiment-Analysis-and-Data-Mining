These pants are great. Color is true and doesn't run in the wash. They are roomy and fit comfortably. I haven't the need to wear a size larger as some other reviewers have mentioned. They fit as they should. Inseam fits true as well. The cargo pockets are generously sized and good for carrying pretty much anything. I find that it is easier to work in these pants than jeans, especially in warmer weather, due to the lighter weight and better range of motion that they allow. I would definitely buy another pair.
