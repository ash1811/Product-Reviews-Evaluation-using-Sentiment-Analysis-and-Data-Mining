I like these shoes and they are very comfortable; however, the uppers are starting to crack, because they are plastic.  There are a few spots on the uppers that are leather: underneath the emblem, but these are small.  Still, $71, which is what I paid, is not too high for these fine shoes.  I just wish the seller had been more honest.  They won't last like the leather K-Swiss.
