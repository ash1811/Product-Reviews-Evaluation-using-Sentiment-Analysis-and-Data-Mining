This cap fits me perfectly and was a godsend during a recent rainy and blustery day. And it goes perfectly with my wool overcoat. There was nothing I wanted to know before my purchase because I had a cap like this before but I lost it on a plane and I badly wanted another cap like this but was too lazy to get one until now. Now my wife will kill me if I lose this cap.....
