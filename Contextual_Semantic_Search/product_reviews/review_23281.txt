I live in Tallahassee, which is the unexpected rainstorm capital of the sunshine state-so having an umbrella on hand at all times is essential. This umbrella is ideal for carrying around (it fits into the small side pocket of my Swiss Gear backpack perfectly) because of its small size. Unlike many other small umbrellas it is reasonably robust and provides a fair amount of coverage.
