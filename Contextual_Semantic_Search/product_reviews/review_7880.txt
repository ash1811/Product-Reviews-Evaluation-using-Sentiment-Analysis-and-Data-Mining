I wanted a fleece jacket with the start of fall season. I bought one at Sears at $ 50 and when I came home my wife asked my why I spend $50 :). I went to Amazon and found this one for $ 30 and as always got it in 2 days. I am very pleased with the color, texture and overall design/stitching of the jacket. The zipper on the packets is very helpful to hold my ipod when I am travelling in the bus.
