I purchased the X-Lander Military version of this watch (all black, rubber strap).  I've scraped it across several hard objects, and it has yet to show scratches.  I love the compass and reverse display.  You have to be careful when setting up the watch, as it is easy to change the factory defaults on the barometer.  The elevation data seems to change constantly with barometric pressure, but I'm assuming that this is always the case with this type of instrument as its not tied to GPS.  My chief complaint is that the buckle is hard to unfasten (acutally, the tab that holds the end of the strap in place).
