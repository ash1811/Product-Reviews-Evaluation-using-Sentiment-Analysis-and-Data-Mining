I am a 38DDD and this is the best sports bra I have ever owned. I was so tired of looking for a bra that fit and provided adequate support.  I stumbled across this one from a recommendation on Oprah.  Finally, something advertised on TV that actually works.  This is my fourth time to purchase this bra and I will never try anything else unless it's free.  I play several softball games per week, year around and these bras hold up well for a couple of years of weekly washing and wearing.  If you are a large busted woman this WILL be the last brand of sports bra you ever buy.
