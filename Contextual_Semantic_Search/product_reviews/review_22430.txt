..models seiko ever made! Gets lots of attention and has fantastic lume, fit/ finish. Despite the title &#34;orange monster&#34; it is not that big... Fits and looks good on my small wrist. Ss metal band is a tank... Very heavy and way over the top. I would suggest ordering it with the ss band and then getting some of the seiko oem rubber straps which make the watch look right and feel lighter! Accurate, solid super cult watch.
