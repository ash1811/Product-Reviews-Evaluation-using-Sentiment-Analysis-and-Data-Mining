I bought two pairs and after 18 months, I have noticed that the soles on both pairs have disintegrated. The sole turns to a tacky rubber.  It is a chemical reaction.  At first I thought that I may have stepped into some acid, but after reading many reviews, I knew that it is a problem caused by manufacture ECCO. After reporting the problem, Ecco has sent me two 50% discount certificates.  These can be redeemed only in their online store and can not be applied to any discounted shoe.  An insult to an injury.  Never again.
