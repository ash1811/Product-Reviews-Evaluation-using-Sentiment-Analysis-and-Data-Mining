Bought one pair and they fit my son good, went to button them and they were missing the snap.  So we sent them back and ordered another pair just like it and they came back fine.  Good fabric, good body to the fabric and fit runs a tad bit big but I don't think you want &#34;skinny pants&#34; being an EMT.  Good length, seems true to size.
