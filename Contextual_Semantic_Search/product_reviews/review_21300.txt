I bought these shoes at Macy's for about $80 in June 2010. I was in the process of moving to start a new job and on day 1 I couldn't find my work shoes. I ran to Macy's on my way in, tried these on and fell in love. I usually have a wife foot and these fit me perfectly. Not only that they felt like I was walking on clouds.My favorite part is the design. The top flap covers an elastic under it. This enables the shoe to fit perfectly whether I am wearing a thin or thick sock. When I walk it moves with me. It really makes it so comfortable, so you don't have to worry about it tearing up your feet like some dress shoes do.We are 4 months shy of 4 years and I am still wearing them. The SAME pair. These have held up like a dream. They are starting to show their wear and the inside is starting to rip. But I have worn these to work every day for the past 4 years, so what else would I expect?
