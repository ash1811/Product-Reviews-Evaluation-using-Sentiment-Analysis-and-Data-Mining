I purchased these tights to wear under my pants at work when it is cold. They provide an excellent layer of warmth and are very comfortable to wear. These tights also seem to be very durable. They glide well under your trousers. Some tights I have tried in the past cling to the fabric of my pants, whichs make them uncomfortable to wear.
