I'm glad I invested in this to help with my postpartum belly. It really holds you in well-good for me because who knows how long my belly will look like a war zone. I gained 40 pounds during my pregnancy, mostly in my belly, and my pre-pregnancy size large fit me about 2 weeks postpartum. I used a cheaper belly support immediately after birth. This one has never rolled up on me whether sitting or standing. The quality is great and I'll probably even wear it when I get back to what I used to be. I love it.
