I got these to go along with the Brown Northfield's I already own..I can use them for good casual since nobody really dresses up anymore..do they? The only issue is my wife who doesn't think that Lug Soles are appropriate, but I'll deal with that....good quality leather which for me translates into out-of the-box comfort!
