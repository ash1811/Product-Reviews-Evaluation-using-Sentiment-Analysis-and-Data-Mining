These boots look great with jeans or khakis, and I've gotten a lot of compliments on them.  My only issue is with the sole wearing very quickly.  I've had them for about a month and the sole is already showing significant wear on the heel.  I tend to walk over 3 miles a day at work on tile floors, and I was surprised at how quickly the crepe sole was wearing out.  However, they look great and are very comfortable after breaking them in.  I'd only recommend these boots for lazy days when you're not moving around a lot since I figured the sole would only last another 4 months at work.
