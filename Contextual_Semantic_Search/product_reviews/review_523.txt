The Buxton Clutch carries the needed items a person must have when entering the world outside the home!  Yep, it carries them all and is easy to carry itself.  For me, there is plenty of room for credit cards, ATM cards, a special place for your driver's license, etc., plus paper money and even a coin purse.What more could you ask for?
