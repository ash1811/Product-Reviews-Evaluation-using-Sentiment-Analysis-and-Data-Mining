This product is not lined. It's made of a thicker material then what I've come to expect from most unlined bra's, but it's not the same. If you want a lined bra then don't get this one. Also I&#34;m a 34E. I read that the band runs large so to order a band smaller and cup larger. I figured that if the band runs large then I'd just go down a cup size and keep it a 34. Well I'm not very full and the top of the bra was super wrinkly. I tried on a few t-shirts and you could see the wrinkles (and my nipples) through the t-shirt.
