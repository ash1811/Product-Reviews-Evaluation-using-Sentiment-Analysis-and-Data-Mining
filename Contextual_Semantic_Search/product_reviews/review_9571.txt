What can you say bad about Wranglers?  They are the quintensential American Jean brand.  This particular cut fits like a glove and moves nicely with my every step.  They tend to hold their wash longer than the competition most likely because they are made of heavier, cotton denim.  For anyone with normal sized thighs, these fit well;  not as tight as some but still generous enough not to pinch.Definately worth trying a pair.
