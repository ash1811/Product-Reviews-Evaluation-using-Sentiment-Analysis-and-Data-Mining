my husband has a hard time finding shoes that fit him well.  he has a hard time walking and had found a pair of Columbia's several years ago.  they wore like iron and after six+ years, they finally wore out.  I was able to find another pair just like the ones he wore out and I bought two pair.  These are usually hard to find in December but Amazon came through and I was able to &#34;stock up&#34;.
