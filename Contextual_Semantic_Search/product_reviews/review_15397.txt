I purchased this with the thought that it would be great for travel - can double as a light-weight &#34;blanket&#34; on the airplane and be a scarf or wrap when in cold hotel ballrooms.  The product works perfectly for that.  If you're looking for something for real warmth on it's own, you'll need something that is more heavy-weight, but for my purpose, it works quite well.
