I normally wear boxer shorts, but decided to try the cotton version of these when I saw them on sale.  I liked the fit of the underwear and when I decided to get a second pair, I opted for the micro modal trunks and I am very glad that I did.  I agree with the other reviewers that these are probably the most comfortable pair of underwear that I have ever owned.  The underwear fits and looks great.I travel a lot and I always wear a pair of the Micro Modal Trunks on the long haul flights.  Plus the soft, light material air dries quickly which is a bonus if you have to do laundry on the road.However, I do have some gripes.  The first pair of these underwear that I received started falling apart after the first wash.  I used the gentle cycle and air dried the underwear, but the seams began to unravel.  Kudos to Amazon for quickly replacing the defective pair.  The other gripe that I have is that the Calvin Klein name which is printed on the waistband does not line up properly at the seam on the back of the underwear.  Instead of reading "Calvin Klein" it reads "Calvin Cal inKlein".  I know that this is trivial, but when you pay so much for a single pair of underwear and for the Calvin Klein name, you would expect them to get the logo correct.  The quality issues prevent these from getting 5 stars.In summary, simply an amazingly comfortable pair of underwear.  If it wasn't for the price, I would own only pairs of this underwear.
