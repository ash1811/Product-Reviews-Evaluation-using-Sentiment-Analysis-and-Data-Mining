Used this with a Maclaren umbrella stroller which folds such that wheels are on either end. We used extra diapers to pad the non-padded end. The stroller survived well enough (gate checked, but one of the straps ripped partially away from the bag when we picked it up after the inaugural flight. Unfortunately, this bag appears to be be of the better options.
