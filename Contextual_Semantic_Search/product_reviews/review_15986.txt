I love to hike and run but I have a lot of foot problems.  These keep my feet cool and BLISTER FREE !  They stay up without cutting off my circulation and feeling too tight.  They are soft and not itchy.  They  prevent my rain boots from rubbing my heel and upper foot.  No seams to rub on my toes.  It seems like a lot of money to spend on socks, but they let me stay active and do the things I like, so they are worth every penny.
