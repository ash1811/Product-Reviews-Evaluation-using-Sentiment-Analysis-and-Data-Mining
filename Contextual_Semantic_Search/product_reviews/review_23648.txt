I had these in a dark red patent. They were oh-so-cute. Comfortable fit, nice insole, just perfect ... or so I thought.The extra pleather across the toe, plus the buckles are problematic. Although they feel good on and standing, they are torture after walking for any length of time. The extra pleather binds the foot when walking and the buckle digs into the foot. If these were leather, not synthetic, they might give a bit.They might work for some but definitely walk in these a bit for making a decision. I wish I did. I purchased based on comfort and fit, not walkability. As a result, my shoes ended up in the charity pile.
