Gf was always saying that her bra hurt her, or that they didn't fit her right.  The few she liked to wear for comfort reasons didn't do anything for support.  It was kinda like wearing something just to wear it. So I got her something new for christmas and she loves this bra.  The only problem is that now she is going to want to get a bunch more.
