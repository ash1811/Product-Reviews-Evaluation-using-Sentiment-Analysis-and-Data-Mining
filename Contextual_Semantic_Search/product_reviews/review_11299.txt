I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she really loves it. She is currently in College and needed a good bookbag to keep all her books and notebooks in. She has a lot so I needed to get something with lots of storage. This bookbag has a ton of storage, and holds all her books very well. She loves the color and she says it is very comfortable to wear. I am very pleased with my purchase.
