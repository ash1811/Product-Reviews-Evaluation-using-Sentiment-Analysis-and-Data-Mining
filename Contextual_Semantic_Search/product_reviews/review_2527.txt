I got these for my feet in the winter. I have poor circulation, so my toes go numb when its cold out. These have helped out a lot. They keep me warm and dry.I use them for hunting as well, and they work great for that, they stay comfortable all day. I wish more socks felt like this but were cooler for the summer timeThey are also holding up very well, still look/feel brand new after a full year!
