I understand that you have to have a seam somewhere in a garment, and it probably would make clothes look worse on the hip, but the seam going over the tummy looks horrible on garments, that you want your tummy hidden. Maybe it is just my pair, but you can totally see the seam over the tummy. I want that area to be smooth. Grrrrrr.
