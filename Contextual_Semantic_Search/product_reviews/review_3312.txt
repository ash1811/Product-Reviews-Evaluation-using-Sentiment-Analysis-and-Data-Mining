When I found this bra on Amazon, I realized that I purchased this model several years ago and liked it very much.  I wore that bra out and it still never fell apart, it only looked worn out.  This bra has not changed. It is very comfortable and shapes you beautifully without any padding at all. In fact I think that this looks more natural than some of the &#34;T-shirt bras&#34; on the market.  I do not like padding in any bra because I do not want to look larger than I am built. The cups in this bra are very supportive. There is stretch lace in the cups and back, which makes it nice that there is no stretch in the straps. This is a perfect balance. If there were stretch straps and stretch lace, your figure would sag.  There is a reason why some bras do not have stretchy straps.  Stretchy straps does not necessarily mean discomfort. The underwire is very supportive, which takes much of the weight off the shoulders.  The straps are firm but soft, easily adjustable, and stay that way. I own bras which cost over $100 so the low cost of this bra had nothing to do with this purchase. You will look uplifted in a tight fitting blouse, which will give you a longer and sleeker looking torso. Pure and simple.
