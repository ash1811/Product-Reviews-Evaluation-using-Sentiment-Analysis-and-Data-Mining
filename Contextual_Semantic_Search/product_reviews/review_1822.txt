I love my Rockport walkers!  This purchase was to replace my old pairs (brown and black) that had lasted me for years.  I walk 3.25 miles to work, five days a week (and have been walking to work for almost 20 years now...what can I say, I love to walk) so a good pair of walking shoes make a lot of difference.  These Rockports are the best walking shoes I have ever owned.  (My last ones lasted for years.)  They are tough and aren't affected by rain or bad weather.  (I just brush them off when I get home and let them air out overnight.)  They are light and comfortable and the fit is great.  There is no "breaking in" period like with most shoes (no blisters, pinching or tight spots), and they feel as comfortable as running shoes.  The style for these pairs is more casual office, but that fits my office.  They are a little higher in price than what I would have like to have paid...but they are worth the price.  I would recommend these to anyone who walks alot.
