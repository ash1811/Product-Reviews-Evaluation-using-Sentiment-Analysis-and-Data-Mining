Bring back the better quality materials and better fit.  I agree with recent reviews: the material is a brittle, non breathable materials. Vinyl--but not even any semblance of breathability or a material that will move with foot.  These are listed as sneakers for aerobics. No!They would kill your feet.  I am very disappointed, as I've used Reebok's Princess for walking and exercise for a long, long time. I'd gladly pay more for a better product. Returning same day I received them. Very disappointing, as these used to be a great product.
