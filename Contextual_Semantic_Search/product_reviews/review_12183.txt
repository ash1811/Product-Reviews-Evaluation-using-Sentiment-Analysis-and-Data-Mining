I got these boots 1 months ago and refused to wear them due to them being so hard. These boots are literally harming my feet. I am hurting every night when I come home and you can see where they are harming my feet,they won't bend at all. Breaking them in isn't the answer, I have tried everything. If the seller could have stated if these boots had any give to them would have been helpful. Really wish they had been like the old ones.
