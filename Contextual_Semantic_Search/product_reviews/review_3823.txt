I just love this Wacoal bra.  It is very comfortable and fits great.  Very supportive and doesn't feel like I am wearing a bra.  I love the smooth fabric on the cup and the wide band in the back.  Also the shoulder straps stay put and don't dig in. Purchased one of these bras earlier and since it is a great bra, I am ordering two more.
