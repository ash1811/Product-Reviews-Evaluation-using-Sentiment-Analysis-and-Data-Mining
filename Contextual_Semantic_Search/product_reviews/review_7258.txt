I started dancing again after 14 years, and could not find my old ballet shoes. I ordered these, WHAT A MISTAKE.The first pair I ordered a 1/2 size up from my normal shoe size, mistakenly listening to other reviewers. DO NOT BUY UP IN THESE SHOES! I REPEAT! DO NOT BUY LARGE IN THESE SHOES. Besides being too large, they were an awful fit. I thought returning them and ordering again would solve the problem. The new size (my normal shoe size) arrived and the fit was just as awful. It was normal fitting in the heel, tight fitting in the toe, and extremely gappy in the arch area. Plus the toe seemed EXTRA long. They were so loose in the arch that I would not feel comfortable doing spins or jumps in them, as I can see the shoe getting twisted, slipping, or tripping me. WORST fit ever!The problem with both pairs I ordered were the same. Gappy arch, tight in the LONG toes, etc. I am returning this shoe again and will be trying a different brand. Capezio used to be good dancewear, I guess a lot can change in 14 years...
