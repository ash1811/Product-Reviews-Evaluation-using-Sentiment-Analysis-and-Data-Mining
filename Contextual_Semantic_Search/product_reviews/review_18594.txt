These seem very durable, but they are rubbing against my small toes. I'm hoping once they stretch out, the problem gets solved. Have been wearing these to work for at least three weeks and they are still rubbing my toes. May have to take them to shoe repair shop to see if they can be stretched out. Would not purchase these boots again.
