This is a very good shoe.  While a little heavier than other shoes, it provides me with the best fit.  I did try the Wide version, and wow, WIDE is very WIDE in this shoe.  So, I went back to the 9.5M.  It's a tiny bit too narrow on one foot but it fits pretty true to  my size.  I was going to ding 1-star for the one narrow foot, but to be honest, that's likely my one foot being a little larger than the other.I purchased this black version, but had a black and brown version purchased from a Dept. store years ago.  I typically wear this shoe to the office every day, with jeans or dress pants; sometimes out on the town as well.I still have the Brown after 4-5 years.  Yeah, OK...I realize that I probably should have replaced it well before 4-5 years, but while the insole might have had less support than the day I bought it, after 4-5 years for each of the shoes (black and brown), they clearly last a long time even if worn almost every weekday for years.I recommend this shoe and would purchase again.
