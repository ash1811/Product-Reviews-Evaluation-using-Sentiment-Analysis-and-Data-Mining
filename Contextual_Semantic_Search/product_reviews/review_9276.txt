Isotoner has not disappointed in keeping for quality slippers for daily use.  These are well made, comfortable, feel soft and warm.  Have become used to the tough/hard soled bottoms [liked the old soft, quiet &#34;leather&#34; better]. These are great for in-house, keep your feet warm and a nice color too.  A bit small but the next larger size for me fall off too easily.  I'm a fan!
