These are great looking boots. I wear 9 1/2 shoes.  Because of the reviews I decided to order the 9's. The length was fine. I have Plantar Fasciitis so I used inserts. I read reviews where people who wore medium width had to have the boots stretched. I thought since I wear a AA width they would work fine for me. I could hardly get my foot in the boot. They are VERY narrow. Since I have feet issues anyway I didn't want to pay the price for the boots, try to have them stretched and they still not fit properly so I decided to return them. Disappointing because I loved the looks of them and they looked well made.
