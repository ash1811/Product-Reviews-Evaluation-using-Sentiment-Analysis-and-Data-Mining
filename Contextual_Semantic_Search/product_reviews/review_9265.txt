I was confused about what size to purchase, so here's my two cents now that I've got mine. I have feet of average width and usually take US size 8, but may go up half a size in some closed-toe shoes. If you're like me, I suggest going with the Large, which fit me great. According to the info printed on the Large sole, it will take US 8 - 9, Eur 39 - 40 or UK 6 - 7. The fit is rather like that of low-cut socks with super-thick soles - I'd call it a snug hug - and there is some room for give and take, though if you're anything above US 9, I think you'd be better off with the next size up.I won't belabour the point about the comfort, which is most certainly there. I will add, though, that these are the very essence of the once-trendy definition of cute - ugly but adorable. An air of sophistication these will not lend, but they are perfect for pottering around the house on a day that ends with mashed potatoes and hot chocolate.
