I bought this for a cruise to Alaska.  The rest of my family bought much more expensive North Face fleeces (2x/3x the price of this one), and I see no difference.  Since it was a late Summer cruise, the only coat I brought was this fleece and a Columbia heavy windbreaker to layer over it.  The combination was perfect and has become my new winter jacket combo.
