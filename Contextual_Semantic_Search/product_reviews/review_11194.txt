I'm glad that I got these a whole size bigger so they are wide enough. I will also be wearing a thin sock with this because my pinkie toe seems to rub. I like the hard toe protection and the tread on these. I preferred the color black but they were out of stock. After getting the green color my husband said the green shows up real well so I can be seen better when walking on the street. Should last me many miles.............
