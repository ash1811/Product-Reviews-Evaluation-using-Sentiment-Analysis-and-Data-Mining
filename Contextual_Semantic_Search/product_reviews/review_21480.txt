This is a really great shoe but it wasn't quite what my husband was looking for.  He wanted something a bit more casual, like a comfy driving moccasin.  This leather is beautiful but it's stiff and not soft like he hoped for.  We ultimately found something similar with more of a glove-like leather and that suits his needs/style better.
