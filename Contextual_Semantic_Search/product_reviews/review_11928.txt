I like it for my workouts. Only two things bothered me some~~ the tongue slipped down constantly and the arch support wasn't as good as I need because I stand on my feet a lot as a substitute teacher! Otherwise, I liked the style and I was asked where I got them and what brand they were! I have another pair of Skechers that are more comfortable.
