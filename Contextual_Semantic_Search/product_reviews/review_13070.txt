Quality made bra, fits ok.  NOT at all like the picture though.  Maybe my breasts are just old and saggy?  lol  The band just rides up under my breasts (size 40B) and imagine the rest.  If you're looking for a bra that fits ok and doesn't hide nipples through clothing, then this one would do.  I'm too old and modest, so I'll just wear this around the house and for gardening.....;)
