When I was a kid, I loved new white socks for my new sneakers. All they needed to be were new when I was that age. As I've grown older, the socks available at most places have grown thinner (and don't tell me it's my weight, or because I've grown bigger!). And the material is not very comfortable. So I tried these based on descriptions and reviews here.Amazon always comes through for me! The Reviewers do a good job steering you correctly, if you use a bit of caution and common-sense. These are very nice just-the-right-thickness socks! If you prefer a crews sock, these are worth every penny.
