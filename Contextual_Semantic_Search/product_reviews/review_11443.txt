This corset in addition to a few more helped me get back my pre pregnancy body after having twins. I would put this one over a compression garment and continued to go down in sizes until I reached small. Eventually I no longer needed a corset (I'm size 1 now). Highly recommend, however if you have a lot of fat on your back it will spill over
