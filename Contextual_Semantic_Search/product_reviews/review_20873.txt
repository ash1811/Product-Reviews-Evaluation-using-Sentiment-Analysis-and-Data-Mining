I wouldn't call this fabric "microfiber", it's more of a nylon swimsuit material.  I was hoping for something with a bit more coverage in the rear...maybe if you don't have so much "junk in the trunk" they would fit you better.  I doubt going up in size would help since the fit seemed good width-wise, just not long enough.  I also did NOT like the seam in front that kept riding up in a most uncomfortable way.  Next time I will look for something that is tagless, as this is not.
