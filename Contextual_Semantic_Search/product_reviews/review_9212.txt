The shoe is very comfortable.  I ordered 8.5 wide based on the other reviews that the shoe runs large.  I have owned dress shoes that are size 8.5 or 9 depending on the brand.  This particular Santa Barbara Loafer runs a little large. The wide width did offer plenty of room for my feet.  In fact, I think a regular 8.5 medium would have fit well.  The heels with Nike air technology is very comfortable and soft on the step.  However the sides were high cutting into my ankles making the shoes uncomfortable with each step.  Additionally, the 'window' clear openings on the heels rendered the shoes less than formal.  They would work with jeans but for the office they were too casual for my liking.  Amazon's return policy is great.
