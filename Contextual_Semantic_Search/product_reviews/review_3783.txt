Taller sizes are increasingly difficult to find locally.  Bob's Stores, for example, stolcks a couple of pairs, and they fly off the shelves.  I have been buying these from Amazon for a couple of years, now.  They fit well, are in good condition, and you can snag them for a good price if you watch and wait.
