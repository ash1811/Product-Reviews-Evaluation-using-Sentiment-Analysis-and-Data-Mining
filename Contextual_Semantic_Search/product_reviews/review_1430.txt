I started wearing these Thorlo Thick Cushion Hiking Socks a few years ago based on reviews and I am delighted. Since their sizing is more specific, the socks fit perfectly, not too big like most. There's no extra material bunching in my shoes. These are now the only socks I buy and wear them year round. They are not cheap but they last an amazingly long time. Worth the price! (But I did stock up during a sale!)
