I bought this primarily to wear when I'm kinda dressed, but not leaving the house; it's so comfortable that I've slept in it, and woken up none the worse for wear. I'm a 38D, and I can't say this offers the kind of support I prefer for outside wear. However, it looks very nice, and gives very good support and excellent separation; it's perfect for wearing when I can't be bothered with an underwire. I also love the front closure. It's really easy to close and doesn't chafe at all while I'm wearing the bra.In short, this is the first "leisure bra" I've ever worn that doesn't leave me with a single sagging mono-bazoom. It's not cheap, but I'm going to get another one, because this ratio of comfort to support is hard to come by.
