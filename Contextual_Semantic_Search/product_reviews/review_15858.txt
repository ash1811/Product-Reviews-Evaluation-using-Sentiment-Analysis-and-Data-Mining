The fabric is comfortable and great if you need to keep our feet warm.  I work part of my day in a cold warehouse so I need heavy socks to keep my feet warm. I also needed warm socks that would allow my foot to  fit comfortably within my sneaker.  Some cold-weather socks are very bulky, made of itchy wool or old and tired looking after washing.  These socks washed well. I wish that the sock was longer, however.
