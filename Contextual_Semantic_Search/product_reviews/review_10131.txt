Russell brand makes a great sturdy tshirt, while still being soft and comfortable. This cardinal red shirt has nice strong color, not too red, more a maroon or burgundy, that holds up well wash after wash. This brand does not skimp on material, like some less expensive shirts, making them plenty room and long. If you catch them on sale, be sure to stock up - men love these shirts.
