I have been looking for a bra that I could wear with a backless dress for a very long time. However, finding an adhesive bra or a strapless/backless bra that will support a 38DD/36DDD chest is near impossible. This bra is comfortable, and provides enough support. I am considering purchasing another one just in case I need a backup.
