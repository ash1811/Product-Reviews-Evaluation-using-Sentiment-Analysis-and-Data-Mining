I'm really not a "pink" person, so I was a little worried about that, but the picture was so cute that I got them.  I'm a size 12 and the large fit me perfectly.  They are made of a very durable fabric and having all the pockets is great - especially for going on walks.  I wore these to work (on a casual Friday in the Legal department of a pharmaceuticals company) and I must have gotten a dozen or more compliments on them from both men and women.  My big joke was to say thank you, but they really shouldn't be able to see me.  ;)  A great buy for the price and made very well.
