I ordered these as an anniversary present for my husband, after I heard him comment that his others were wearing out; he had really gotten his money's worth out of those.  I had to remind him of the usual two-week breaking in, and that was o.k.  They did seem just a tad longer than the others, but otherwise fit great.  Amazon's price was also better than any site also, so that encouraged me to go ahead and get them before a possible price increase.
