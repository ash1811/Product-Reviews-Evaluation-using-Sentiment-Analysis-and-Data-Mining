I ordered one size bigger in the waist then what I normally wear and they are still on the tight side. They feel somewhat like skinny jeans. I have ones that are a different color, and they fit much better. Not sure why the Dune color was tighter. Otherwise I like the pants, but for me, since I wan't be wearing them much, it was kind of a waste for me.I don't like giving bad reviews, but this is just my honest experience.
