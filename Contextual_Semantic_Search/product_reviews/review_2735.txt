It has a good strong alarm, and the three alarms with daily/weekday/weekend options are very handy. Also not a huge watch, very well-sized for smaller arms like mine. I had one for a couple of years that finally go too scratched up. I replaced it with another, and after one diop in the pool the crystal completely fogged up. So much for the 100 mete, good for anything up to and including snorkel diving!
