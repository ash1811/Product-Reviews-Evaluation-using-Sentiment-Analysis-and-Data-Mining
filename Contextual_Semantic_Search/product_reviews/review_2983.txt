This jacket arrrived fast and in perfect condition. It's not a very thick jacket but made of good quality. Perfect with layering a long sleeve and hoodie on underneath. Love that I could find it in a tall size!! Would say it's perfect for cold temps just not snowboarding or anything like that :) Great work coat as you can actually move around in this one compared to the normally bulky carhartt jackets.
