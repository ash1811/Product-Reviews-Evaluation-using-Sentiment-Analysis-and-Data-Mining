Just as other reviews have said, order at least a half size smaller!  They run big!  They are a bit heavy but not bad enough to not buy them.  Haven't wore them yet to see how they hold up but they look to be constructed pretty well.  Pretty pleased with the purchase of these boots for my son for EMT school...
