I was a bit skeptical about paying this much for underwear.  But these guys are fantastic.  Very durable synthetic material, but actually quite soft.  I can tell already they will be perfect for very hot and humid climates.  Comfortable waistband.  You do get what you pay for, and they will obviously last a very long time if you take care of them.
