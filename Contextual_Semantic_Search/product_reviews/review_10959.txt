I bought this hat to keep the sun off the top of my head, neck and face. It does just that with the wide brims. I burn easily and wore this hat but forgot my sunscreen and got only a light burn. The air flow this hat is great and I found it comfortable even in 102 degree heat, very different from a baseball cap. My only complaint is the under chin drawstring was tied very sloppy and I don't have it tied quite right yet.For a low cost hat it is a winner I'd recommend and buy again.
