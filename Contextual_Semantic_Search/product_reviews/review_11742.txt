The deerskin moccasins are glove soft, and fit perfectly on my averaged size feet.  The nubby bottom gives you a good grip, and is very flexible.  I put them on the first day and they are so comfortable, there is no break-in time needed. I don't care for the bows, so I tie the lace into a knot on the front, then cut the laces off so they are just short of hitting the ground.  Gives a simple look and you don't have to keep retying the bow.
