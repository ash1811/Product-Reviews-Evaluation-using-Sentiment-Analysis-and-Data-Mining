I have a hard time finding a bra in my size, it works fine around but the cups are usally too large and bag out as is the case here.  I know a good bra fit can be done because I've had bra's in the past that fit very well.  Somehow things are not being manufactured as they once were and this bra ended up as were others - in my donation bin.  Too bad really, wasted my money and am continuing to have no choice but to wear the old bra's.
