Very pretty decorative jewelry armoire.Plenty of places to store all your jewelry.Easy to assemble(not much assembly required). Fast shipping.Keep an eye out though for lower prices on this item,I found they ranged from $300.00 to as low as $150.00.I originally bought it through some one else,their price was higher & they were taking for ever to ship.I cancelled that order & bought it cheaper with FREE shipping aswell.So shop around you can get same product cheaper.
