Ok so I see all the horrible reviews on here but my guy does like the shirts we received.  I'm always in search of the perfect white under shirt for him as he complains they end up stretching out either in the neck or the body, or they shrink up even tho I wash them in cold or luke warm and don't over dry them.  So for us this is a good buy so far since I haven't heard him complain yet.  He's been wearing these everyday for a year now.  I wish I knew what brand these unhappy reviewers are buying next!  Of course I'd like to try something else if it's better than this.  Feel free to email me about a better white shirt if you know of one.  8)UPDATE:  Someone gave me an 'unhelpful' vote on this but no one has offered up any suggestions on where to buy a better deal.  I have though.  Lately I have been purchasing white undershirts for my husband at Macy's.  Same brand, but 2-pack instead of 3.  The shirts there are much thicker but of course they are also more expensive.  I buy the tall so that they will be long enough for him.
