These slippers are not Terry lined, they are fleece lined.  I have purchased them before for my husband and wanted fleece, so when the picture looked like fleece inside I took a chance and it was.  He has worn a pair of these for the past 15 years or so.  I keep replacing them with new ones.  He loves them. They have a nice sole and cushioned inside.
