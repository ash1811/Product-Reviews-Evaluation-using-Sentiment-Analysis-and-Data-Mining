It's ok, not really what I expected, possibly I was wrong but it's just a bag with mesh sides. Nothing fancy just a bag with mesh, would be great if you were carrying flippers or a bunch of bulky stuff.Go with the Speedo bag, it is by far the best bag around and also will hold most of the stuff you'd put in here.
