A family member requested SmartWool Socks this past Christmas.  She told me how fantastic they are so I tried a pair and wow, they are amazing.  I like thin socks but in the winter thin synthetic socks aren't warm enough.  Ski socks I used to wear when skiing are thick and itchy. These are thin, yet warm and they don't itch!  (I'm a person who finds wool very irritating usually)  I wash my SmartWool socks  in lukewarm water by hand and hang dry because they are wool.  One needs less pairs that way (I got along with just two pairs that way for a while) and I think they hold up much better.  Now all the members of our family have SmartWool socks.
