I was looking for a nice comfortable dress shoe that can be worn as casual wear also and this is the shoe.  The flex material near the shoe laces is a nice touch.  It allows the shoe to flex while walking therefore keeping it from digging into the top part of the foot.  Nice looking shoe and goes great with khakis.  I really have nothing bad to say about these shoes, I am think about getting them in black.
