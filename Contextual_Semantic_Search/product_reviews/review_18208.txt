I needed some indoor only footwear because of the new flooring in the house. Most reviewers here seem to really like them. Like others have mentioned, they run small. I am a 13 so I ordered a 14 and they fit perfectly. They're real cozy almost too cozy for summer months. They're very comfortable and handsome looking. Can't comment on durability yet. I've had them only for a week.
