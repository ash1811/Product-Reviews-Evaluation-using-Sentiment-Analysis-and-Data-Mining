Thinner than the old Carhartts I grew up with but it is every bit as durable and it is so warm I have to wait until I am on my way out to put it on or I will start to sweat.Anyone that complains about this being too stiff is just being silly. This coat will last for decades. It is built to last, quality snaps, stitching, material, and a zipper the size of my thumb with tracks not much smaller. If you complain about stiffness you might as well say &#34;I'm so upset my jacket has a 20 years of heavy use lifespan&#34;. If it is that big of a deal to you then just put it in a laundry bag with some shoes and coldwash it. After a few washes the shoes should have broken it in nicely.Under the sleeves it has some stretchy cuffs to keep the cold air from going up your arm which is wonderful.The pockets are very deep and clearly designed not to lose your stuff and be able to reach in them with gloves on.The coat is also just big enough to accommodate myself with a hoodie, shirt, and underarmor on. Most coats fail to take into account it is winter and in cold areas you need to wear layers but not this one!The cons:The hood (www.amazon.com/dp/B002QG0EEI ) is sold separately and does not come attached. While the snaps are Carhartt last forever quality the fact remains it could possibly come off one day. The good news is a tailor will sew it on for you very creaply. I suggest going with a double stitched pattern like:______________XXXXXXXXXXXX-------------------------The flap over the zipper is Velcro. While it is great Velcro that stuff doesn't last forever and it will wear out one day. Once again very cheap to have a tailor put some strong snaps on the Velcro Pads.I like my coats to run a little long so if I lift my arms reaching for stuff it still covers my torso. As this is a work coat I feel that is a reasonable demand to expect this coat to meet.Overall: Wonderful coat and it only has a few issues, most of which are very easy to fix.
