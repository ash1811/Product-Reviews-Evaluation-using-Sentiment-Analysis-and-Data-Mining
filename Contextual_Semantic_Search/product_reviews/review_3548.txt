I'm so careful when putting these on as I put a run in one pair the first time I put them on.  I noticed that on a second wearing, these hose really soften up, and feel really wonderful on my legs.  I can easily wear them all day with no problems.  No sagging whatsoever, even after wearing for 8+ hours.
