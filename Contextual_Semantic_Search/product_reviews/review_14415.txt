I have been wearing Timex Ironman watches of various models for well over 30 years.  I have owned almost dozens of them, and have never been too disappointed.  This watch is no exception.  It is simple, durable, intuitive, and a great complement to my lifestyle and activities.  The only exceptions to my positive impression from this watch are these:This is the second Ironman with Flix that I've tried.  The feature doesn't impress me much on either of them.  Even if you can master the motion to make it work consistently, it is easier to just push the button for me.  For some people, it might be a life-saver, but I can do without it.This is the first watch I've had where they show how much memory is available when I go to the Chronograph.  For some people this might be useful and important, but to me, it just makes me wait an extra second before allowing me to use the Chronograph.  I wish they showed this information in a different way, if it is even needed to be displayed.I don't know why holding the reset button after using the Countdown Timer should be required.  I think that it should automatically reset after the alarm goes off.  It isn't like getting to zero is some significant data that I want to be sure not to loose.  Having to hold a button down for several seconds to reset the timer is pointless and annoying.The only thing really new on this watch from the previous Ironman watches I've had is the Interval Timer.  I love this addition, but for interval work, but also because it allows me to have a second Countdown time set up in the watch.  32 minutes and 2 minutes are the two main times I use, and having two timers allows me to leave one of these times in each timer without having to set the time back and forth.Overall I recommend this watch. It is comfortable, durable, and effective.  I love it and think that you will like it too.  As for my list of complaints, hopefully Timex will address these, so the next version of this watch will be even better.
