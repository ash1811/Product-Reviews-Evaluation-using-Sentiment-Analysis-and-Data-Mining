Bought these dogs for an extended adventure to Europe. Fit from the first time they hit the feet and no break in necessary. More then I normally drop for shoes but these were worth every penny.  Walked a bunch everyday with some off-roading included and they never missed a step. VERY WELL MADE and COMFORTABLE.
