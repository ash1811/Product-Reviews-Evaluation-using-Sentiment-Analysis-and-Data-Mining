I wear these as my &#34;nice&#34; jeans.  I am 5'10&#34; 165 lb the 32&#34;x32&#34; fits me well, and have always had pretty big legs since I run and lift, I have a problem finding jeans that fit well.  The regular fit is usually too tight, the loose fits are usually too sloppy, this is just right.  I am a 31&#34; inseam so I bought the 32&#34; and roll the bottom up 1&#34;.  I will stick with the 550 now that I know they fit so much better than all the others.  The wash goes well with a collar shirt for a dressy-casual look.
