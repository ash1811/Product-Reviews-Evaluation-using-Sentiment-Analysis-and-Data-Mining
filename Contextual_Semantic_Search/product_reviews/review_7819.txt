I bought the 3-pack of black v-neck CK's via Amazon in May'09.  I purchased men's size "Medium" based on the fact that I bought the same 3-pack last year in size "Large" and the fit was bigger than I wanted.  I am 5'10", 195lbs and usually wear a size "Large" in most men's tops.In terms of sizing I was looking for a fit that is slightly snug versus too baggy (as the Larges were for me) so now that I have the size Mediums they are working out much better for my preference (especially since I've noticed they also tend to stretch out a bit over time).  Bad news is I have 6 of these tshirts clogging up my dresser drawers now, good news is since I have the Medium and Large sizes I can gain a few pounds and I'm still good to go (beer me).I do agree with some other reviewers that CK tshirts do tend to be thin material and they aren't your typical stand alone t-shirt you can show off about town.  They are good tshirts under another piece of clothing, as pajama top, or working around the yard.  I actually like the fact that CK v-necks are thin because they are very comfortable to wear for incognito usage.Style-wise a good looking t-shirt with nice looking v-neck shape.Overall: 4 out of 5 stars. High marks for looks and comfort for my intended usage, minus 1 star for the slightly strange sizing causing inventory buildup in my dresser drawers.I hope you found my review helpful.
