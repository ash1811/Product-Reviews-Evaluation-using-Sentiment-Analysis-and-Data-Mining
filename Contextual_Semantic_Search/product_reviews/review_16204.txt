This comes a little large, which I like because it means I can lift my arms without it pulling up and exposing my midsection to the cold.Quality is the usual carhartt quality and with the heavy stitching on this I expect it to last a good while.Very thick fabric, wore this today instead of a winter coat and was 100% comfortable.The pocket is massive and easily accessible with gloves on.I can't think of any cons for this product, it is by far the best hoodie I have ever owned and I have no improvements I can think of to make for it. Completely satisfied.
