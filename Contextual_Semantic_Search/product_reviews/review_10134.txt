Some of the inside seams at the armpits had kind of a "rats nest" of the thread used to sew the garment together.  The sewing has held up OK over several washings, but maybe they should ease off on the workers a bit and let them finish their work better.  Overall, the t-shirt is comfortable and made with good material.
