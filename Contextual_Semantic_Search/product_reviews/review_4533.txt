Nice jeans here, just a bit snug. If I avoid drying them they should last me a long time. I don't know how a size bigger would have fit, but I kinda wish I'd have ordered a 38 rather than the 36 that is my size.I'm back. After a couple months these jeans fit great and didn't shrink in the dryer. Just new jean syndrome, just needed breaking in. I'll be buying more.
