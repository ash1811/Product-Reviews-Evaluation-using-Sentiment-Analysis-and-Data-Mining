I agree with several of the posts that said these pants are cut large.  Despite the fact they are labeled &#34;regular&#34; fit they seem more akin to a &#34;relaxed&#34; fit.  They are very roomy in the waist and thighs.  In addition they are very long (and I am tall, often troubled with pants that are too short).  I was going to return them, but I decided to wash them and see if they would shrink.  They didn't.
