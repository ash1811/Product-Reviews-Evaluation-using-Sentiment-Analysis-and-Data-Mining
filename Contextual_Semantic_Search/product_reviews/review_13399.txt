I loved these frames when they arrived, but they overwhelmed my face! I ended up returning the 62mm frames and going for the 58mm which worked out better for me, but I love the color combo I got (arista gold and smoke pink mirror lenses) - perfect for summer!Even though I exchanged these, I was very happy with the purchase and the service!
