This is the classic Original Fit pre-washed indigo. The fit was perfect and the quality top-notch. Amazon is NOT selling seconds. There is minimal shrinkage to the length of the pant, which is okay because it still has enough length to break at the shoe. There is no better looking jean.Beware price comparisons with other styles of Wrangler that are not pre-washed and shrink overall. Their shrinkage is why they are priced lower.I have lost 25 pounds and have gone through 3 sizes so far and have been satisfied with each size.I hope this review helps.
