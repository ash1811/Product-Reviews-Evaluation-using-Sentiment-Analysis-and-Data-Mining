Watch does not glow at night,it only glows if you hold a flashlight directly on it then remove.It seems to work fine i have not tested it underwater and do not plan to after reading a few other reviews,you get what you pay for and pay for what you get.I thought it was exactly like my old military style watch but it is not.
