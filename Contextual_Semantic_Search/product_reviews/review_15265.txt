I got 3 of these to wear under things. Nice and thick which I like. Will keep me warm, not something you could wear in the summer or you'd get too hot, but that's what short sleeves are for. They were a good price and seem better made than something you get from Old Navy. They fit just right before I washed them, but I just pulled them out of the dryer and they look like they shrunk. I haven't tried them on to see if they still fit. Next time I'd probably order a large just because I like things with a little room (I'm a size 4-6).
