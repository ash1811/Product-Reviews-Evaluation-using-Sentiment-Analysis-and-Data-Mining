My boyfriend has to wear a &#34;uniform&#34; that includes a Khaki pant and matching shirt.  He goes up & down ladders all day and lifts heavy items and these pants are durable.  They do not wear out in the thighs nor do they slide lower when he bends down (think plumbers butt -  NOT).  They are also the full cut in the thighs which gives him the room to move around easier. Would definitely buy again!
