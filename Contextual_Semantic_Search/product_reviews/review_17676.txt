I love these shoes.  I ordered these and the size I ordered fit as expected.  I work at a nursing facility and am on my feet the entire day.  These shoes are so light and comfortable to wear.  They are durable and long lasting to.  The best shoe I have bought in a while. I will be purchasing again and would recommend this shoe to others.  .  They make a good working and every day shoe.
