I go through a lot of tights and these ones have lasted the longest!  They fit great and the color I got (lagoon) is awesome!  I get a lot of compliments on the color.  I have a dog and she likes to jump on me so I get a lot of runs in my tights and I have to throw them out!  These tights have stood up to my dog's claws numerous times and they still look good!
