The product did fit a hair bit bigger than exspected but thats my fault for ordering a pair of shoes a half a size bigger than I normally wear.  Even so I love these shoes they are very comfortable. I bought them for use in the gym. Best pair of shoes for lifting in my opinion. Opposed to all these toe shoe people that have to or should wash them after every use. Stylin with my fuctional green kicks while I watch the bar bow from the massive weight I just ripped off the floor. (well massive weight for me). On a side note if you require walking any distance over irregular shaped gravel, covered in moon dust I suggest walking to the gym in your normal shoes. Feel every pebble from being spoiled from wearing shoes all the time.
