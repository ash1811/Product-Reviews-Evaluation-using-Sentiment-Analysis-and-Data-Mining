This organizer works well for us. We traveled frequently in the last year and we enjoy all of the many pockets. Small items fit in the upper 4 pockets. Slightly larger items in the next three. We put our toothbrushes and toothpaste in the next compartment; and the larger items in the bottom two pockets (his and hers). Upon arrival at our hotel, we just hang it in the bathroom and have access to all our toiletries.
