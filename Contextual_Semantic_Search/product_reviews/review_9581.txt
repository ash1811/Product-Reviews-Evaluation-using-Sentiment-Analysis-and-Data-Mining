I can't believe I have lived this long without owning a pair or Wranglers!I wear cowboy boots often and I was worried about the length because I like 1 stack and 1 stack only on my boot. I hate when jeans look baggy and I have 3-4 stacks, I guess its just a style thing. Anyway, my boots have a riding heel and a spur ledge, usually I would go up 1-2 inches depending on the jean. So usually I wear a 30 length and with jeans like Eddie Baur I need a 31 inch because the 30 is too short with the riding heel. Follow?Anyway, since these have a boot cut I stayed with the 30 inch length and they literally fit perfectly. I will definitely order another pair when or if I wear these out because I practically wear them every day. I even wear them to work on my ranch and after 3 months they still look brand new, just be sure to turn them inside out before you wash them.The best part, my girlfriend says my but looks good in them. Can't put a price on jeans that get a little honey on the biscuits!
