I've got a lot of old Dockers and they all have worn well. Unfortunately just like me over the the years they have all gotten a little shopworn. All the old ones have a plain front. Since I'm older now and my face has gotten a little pleated I figured this cut will match my face better. Casual yet moderately dressy. I like them a lot.
