This is my third pair. Each one that I have had lasted me close to two years of virtually every day use. I know it is time for a new pair when the inside lining wears through and the knobs on the sole are worn down to the surrounding material and even disappearing. Often, models of shoes are discontinued (probably for fashion reasons) after a year or two. Glad to see that these continue to be produced unchanged. I hope this post doesn't jinx that!
