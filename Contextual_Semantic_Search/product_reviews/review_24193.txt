This is basically a economical hat that is of good value.  The reviewers who say that this is small are partially correct, the circumference is perfectly adjustable, but the actual volume of the cap's dome is a bit shallow, meaning if you have an elongated cranium, the cap may sit on the tipy top of your head, however, you would probably need a really large noggin to notice.The color will be lighter than the picture (I have the Brown/Stone) and the brown is much lighter than picture on here.The hat is not structured, as clearly stated in the description, so it is floppy and won't look rigid like the pictures.  Overall, the quality, texture and price are great and the shipping was really fast.
