These are nice looking, comfortable, and budget-friendly slippers.  They are surprisingly plush and the design is pleasing and nicely rendered. The sole seems grippy enough, but is clearly not meant for anything more than casual use. They do seem to run a bit small and I am hoping they stretch a bit while my daughter has them in camp with her.
