I've been thinking of getting a good pair of waterproof boots for some time. Saw these Timberland White Ledge boots and decided to give them a try. I've owned Timberland Boots for quit a few years. My last pair kind of "bought the farm" and I needed a new pair. These look like just what I've been looking for. We'll have to see how well they work in the cold winters I have here. I'm sure they'll be fine.
