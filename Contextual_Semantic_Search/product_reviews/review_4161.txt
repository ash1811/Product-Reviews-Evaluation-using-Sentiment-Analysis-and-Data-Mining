This bra is comfortable and gives nice support but my boobs look so pointed!  Its a shape I have never had a problem with in any other bra.  They look fine from the front but when I turn sideways they look like a torpedo. That said, I still wear it because it is so supportive (I am a 30F) and comfortable.  If it gave me a more natural shape I'd give it 5 stars.
