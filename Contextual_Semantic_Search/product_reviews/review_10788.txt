They are best described as an extension of your feet. These are awesome shoes for everyday use or even when just taking the trash out. The best part about these sandals is that the toe strap doesn't irritate your feet between the toe and second toe like others do. I walked across the Walnut Street Bridge in Chattanooga back and forth a few times, and can just say for 12 year old sandals, they are superb for walking and don't hold sweat at all. I swear by them. I do not think they are the best looking. I personally prefer the newOakley Hypercoil LX Men's Sandal Casual Footwear - Chocolate / Size 10.0, but would not purchase them because the toe strap looks like it would irritate your skin after a far walk on a hot day. Overall, a very rugged shoe that will last you a good 10 years.
