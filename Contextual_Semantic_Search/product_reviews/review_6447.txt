I ordered two shirts. Both arrived over packaged and took two days for overnight shipping.After reading some reviews, I expected something like a Tshirt with a mock turtleneck. The shirt is thicker than a Tshirt. I find it similar to a very thin sweat shirt without that fuzzy stuff on the inside. I am pleased with the quality.I should have listened to other reviewers when they discussed size issues. I ordered a medium and this thing is huge. I washed it in hot water, dried twice with superhot air and it is still way too big. After washing and drying, I held the shirt next to one of my medium Hanes' longsleeve pullovers. The shoulder points of the turtleneck were approx 21.5 inches compared to the Hanes at 18 inches. I did not measure before washing.Three stars were deducted for the Shrek sizing.
