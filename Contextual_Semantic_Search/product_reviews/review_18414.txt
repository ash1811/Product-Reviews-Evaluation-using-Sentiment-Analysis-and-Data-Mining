Going to visit my niece and her kids. The boys are age 3 and 4 and love pirates and superheros.We, the aunts, had gotten into Geocaching so decided our week with the boys would be about treasure hunting.So the first treasure they found were these chests. Since previous reviewer stated that her kids would try to hold them under their arms and one dropped and broke, We bolted little door handles on the top. Also since they are so close in age I had name tags made up and screwed/glued to each. I went to party city and purchase little magnifying glasses, flashlights, more doubloons. Found little Diego gloves at Aces and from Amazon ordered some treasure maps. I drew some Geocaching sites on the maps and placed all this stuff in these chests. I showed them the secret department andtold them they could keep their secrets in them for years to come. The younger immediately put his doubloons in there.We had a great week hunting for treasures, they played with their chests everyday, couldn't wait to show their mom and dad.
