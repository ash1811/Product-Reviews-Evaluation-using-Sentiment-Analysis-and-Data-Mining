Although the cups of my 32D fit, the back measurment is not right.  The bra will only fit around my back in the very last hook, which means that when the back stretches, the bra becomes useless because there's no where to go with the hooks.  It should have been made to fit on the very first hooks, so that I could always move in if I needed to.
