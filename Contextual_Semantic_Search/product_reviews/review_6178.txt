I was so happy when my Yaktrax walker traction device came in the mail today, I immediately put them on (carefully) to run some errands, it's pretty icy here in Maine. Within 5 minutes, both of them had slipped off and I lost one. I was pretty happy with the Yaktrax Pro Ice Walkers that I used last winter but they were hard to put on. These  lighter Traction Device Walkers were much easier to put on and clearly easy to remove, much too easy! I can't even return them as I now only have one. I am going back to the Pro Ice Walkers, the velcro trap keeps them on my shoes where they belong. I do not recommend these lighter weight ones without the strap, they sure didn't last long!
