I love the initial comfort of these shoes when I first put my feet in them. They feel like the most cushiony pair of slippers. However, when I stand in them or walk, my ankles pronate inward. There is absolutely no support for someone who has this problem. I have very high arches and this is probably why my feet pronate. Beware of this shoe if you have this problem. My feet ache bad after walking in these for a while.
