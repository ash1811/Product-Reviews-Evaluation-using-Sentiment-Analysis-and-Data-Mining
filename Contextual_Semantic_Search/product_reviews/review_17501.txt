Boots are good for the price. They're stiff at 1st, but I had no problems wearing them all day the 1st day. They're sized correctly. I like the color of these and I also like the fact that they are not insulated and do not have steel toes. I bought these because I have another pair of Caterpillar shoes that are the same color.
