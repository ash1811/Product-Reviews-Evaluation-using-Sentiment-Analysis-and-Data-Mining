I've bought this brand of bra off and on over the years, but have noticed that the bras that come in white are about 1 1/2&#34; longer in the back.  I don't know why there is this discrepancy but the white bras are perfect.  The black bras can be used and fit fine, but you need to purchase a bra extender to place on the hooks at the back.  If it weren't for that, these bras would be in the trash.  This is a good bra in that it is not skimpy, but manufacturer needs to correct the defect in the black bras.  I'm hoping they are not making the white bras shorter and only the black bras are are affected.
