Definitely worth the money as I found that most shoe stores only carry the narrow and medium size shoes.  Having a shoe that is available in both wide and extra wide is very helpful in that I can buy a shoe that doesn't pinch my feet.  I also buy the extra wide so I can wear light socks in the winter time.  Very nice product and I will possibly be purchasing more of them.  I bought the black and light brown and am very satisfied with both.
