I purchased two pairs of this style in different accent colors.  The one pair is still in its box in the closet and I wear this &#34;multi-color&#34; all the time.  It's difficult to see but the &#34;multi-color&#34; means that the sole and side stripe are a dark navy blue on white leather but the fabric loops for the laces are a dark green.  I have neuropathy in my feet so I look for the most supporting comfortable shoes I can find.  I've always been a fan of Easy Spirit, I've purchased several over the years.  This pair that I'm reviewing is the result of my satisfaction with the first pair of &#34;multi-colored&#34; shoes in that they are the third pair of this design....I wouldn't want to need another pair and have them no longer available.  In fact, now I'm tempted to buy yet another pair.  A person cannot be too cautious about some things.
