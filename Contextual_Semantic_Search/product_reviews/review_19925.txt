This particular pair I purchased as a Christmas gift for a friend, but I already own three - that's right, three - pairs and I absolutely love them.  I have very sensitive feet as well as edema and  these slippers are really a blessing.  They are so warm and comfortable and accommodate the swelling I experience.  I machine wash and then air dry them (it takes about 3-4 days to air-dry them, but I live in a damp climate).  I would recommend that if you have edema like I do you size up, but anyone else I'm sure would be true to size.  I really recommend these.  And the ocelot print is adorable!
