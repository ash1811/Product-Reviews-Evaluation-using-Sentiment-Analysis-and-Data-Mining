I purchased this watch on September 27th and received on the 30th. The watch is very light and well balanced. It just feels like a tough watch. The material is very dense. Setup is fairly straight forward and a breeze to do. It is water resistant(seeing as to how the first thing i did was toss it into my pool). also a very bright back light which is crystal clear to read. Now to clear up a few things.1. The resin textured ribs on the back. Yes, they were a little irritating for the first few hour i wore it because i tried to get a feel for the watch and moved it around my wrist. After a few hours i stopped noticing them and by the end of the night I forgot i had the watch on completely.2. The buttons. Yes, the buttons are more difficult to push I agree. But i like that. This is supposed to be a tough watch. Not a little toy. The buttons have to be able to withstand a beating and water. I am sure once broken in they will be a bit easier to press.Overall a great watch for an outstanding price. I got it for $60.I look forward to owning more g shocks in the future :)
