I've been wearing these for about 8 years.  Through all my weight fluctuations they help my jeans, skirts and shorts look better.  Initially they are a bit awkward to get on, but read and follow the directions patiently and you'll get them on. It gets easier each time. One reason they get easier to put on is because your butt leaves it's impression so it's always easy too know where the back side is.
