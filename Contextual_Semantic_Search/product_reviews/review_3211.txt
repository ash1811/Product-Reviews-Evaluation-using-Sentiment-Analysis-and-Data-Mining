Wacoal is one of my go-to manufacturers of undergarments. I have worn their bras for many years. Spending more money for bras is one of the best places to indulge because this is something most women wear most of their lives. I sometimes will forgo comfort for design, but why do that when you don't need to? Wacoal bras are made beautifully. They have great staying power and look great under clothing. I have many models, but I bought this one specifically to wear under compression tops like spandex tanks, T-shirts etc. This bra really keeps you in place. What I especially like about Wacoal is that they don't just make a model in every size. They modify the bra depending on the support needed. That is why they have larger back straps and more hooks for larger busted women. It is all about support. I can depend on the fact that if I get my size and style, I will happy with the fit. I like the models that have side stays. This bra has an underwire that goes all the way around the bust, underneath and side. Wacoal is wonderful!
