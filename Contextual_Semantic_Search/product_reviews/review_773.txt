After becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the uniboob look of my current minimizer bra, I decided to purchase the Bali Flower Underwire.  This bra does provide good support, but alas, digressing from the uniboob to the torpedo look was not my goal when I bought it.  I have given the bra three stars for this very reason.
