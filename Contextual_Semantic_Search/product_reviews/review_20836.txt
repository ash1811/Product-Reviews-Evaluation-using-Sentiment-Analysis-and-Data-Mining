Very long. Fabric is soft and comfortable to wear. The top of the leg warmers are a bit tight, so I don't pull them all the way up as pictured. The sit more half thigh on me, however they are still comfortable. The stirrup-ed material is durable I have worn and washed the leg warmers 10+ times and they are still in good shape.
