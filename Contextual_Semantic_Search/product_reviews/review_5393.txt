I ordered some old fashioned suspenders, the kind construction workers use to hold up heavy tool belts.  2 inches wide and made with heavy duty metal hardware.  I also ordered a small set of make-up brushes for my daughter.  I ordered them with free shipping through prime.  What I did not expect when I ordered these on a week day evening was rhat they would be delivered in less than 24 hours...free of charge! (with my prime membership).  GREAT service from Amazon and ace hardware direct.
