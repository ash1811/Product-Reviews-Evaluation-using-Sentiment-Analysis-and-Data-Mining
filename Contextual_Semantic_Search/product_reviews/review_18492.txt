These Ugg ascot slippers are wonderful in so many ways. I love wearing them around the house, when taking out the trash or grabbing the mail, or even for a short trip to the grocery store.Wearing them feels better than being barefoot.The only real con about the Ascot, and my reason for not giving a 5 star review, is that the fur on the insoles wears out sooner than I would like. It seems like the insoles are good for about 1 season of use, at which point I'll have to get them out (they're glued in a couple places) and put in replacement Ugg sheepskin insoles.The shoes will probably last for years - maybe a decade even - but the insoles will lose their fur with moderate to heavy use.
