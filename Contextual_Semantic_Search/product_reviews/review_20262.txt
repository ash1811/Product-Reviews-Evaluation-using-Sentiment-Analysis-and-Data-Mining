This is a nice shirt, although I found it a tad small.  It fits like a t-shirt, not looser like what I was expecting.  It is also shorter than I was expecting.  It's not really possible to tuck it into your pants without it pulling out (which I prefer to do).  The colors are nice and rich.  For a casual shirt this is OK and does the job.
