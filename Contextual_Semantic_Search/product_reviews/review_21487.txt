My grandson went over the top when he opened these boots Christmas.  He's really into Fireman stuff so these were the cat's meow.  I could never have found them locally and it was worth so much to see his excitement.  They fit him perfectly and went well with all the other fireman stuff I found.  Western Chief is well know for their rain boots so this was a big hit at our house.
