I had lost about 60 pounds and had a waist reduction of 10 inches.  It had been years since a pair of jeans had looked good on me.  So when I ordered from Amazon I did a lot of research before ordering my 569&#34;s.  They fit perfectly.  I have recieved a lot of complements on &#34;how slim&#34; they make me look.  They are dressy with a sports coat yet still causal.  I have already ordered two more pairs.
