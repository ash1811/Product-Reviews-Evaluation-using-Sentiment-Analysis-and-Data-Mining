So I received these expecting that they would be the solution to my necklace but no earrings problem but I didn't realize they were so small. Next time I buy with a ruler in hand :-) Anyway, no issue with the product on a whole and I gave them to my god daughter who unfortunately is in an I love pink phase. I'm sure she will adore them once she breaks out of it.
