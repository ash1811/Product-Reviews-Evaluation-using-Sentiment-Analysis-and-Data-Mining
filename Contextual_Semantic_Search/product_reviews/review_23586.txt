I have narrow feet and I never owned a pair of narrow sneakers. After trying them on I realize that they are the perfect fit. I can tell the difference in my med size sneakers. I am Sooo glad that I ordered them in narrow. They are classie looking and supports my feet so well when working out and they're very light on my feet.Therefore I never feel like I'm loosing my balance when stretching. Thank you Amazon for carrying these in a narrow.
