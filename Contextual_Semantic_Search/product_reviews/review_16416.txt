I can spin like a top in these shoes. I dance a lot and these shoes are awesome for swing and country. I can even do informal ballroom in them. I read some comments that made me want to laugh.  These are Jazz shoes, the are supposed to have a split sole, and they are supposed to be slippery. If you want a shoe that grips the floor buy athletic sneakers.These are by far my favorite of the five pairs of dance shoes I have.
