First off, the smell is great and they do a good job of keeping the wrinkles out in my boots.  My only problem is with the design since I have had the string already break.  My advice is to spend the extra $10 and get one with metal clips that you can pull up on.  Other than the strings, these items are great.  I use them to stretch out a pair of boots.
