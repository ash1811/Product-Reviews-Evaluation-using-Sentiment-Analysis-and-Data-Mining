Reef flip flops are the most comfortable in the world. I wore a pair for the first time to sea world and walked around for hours with no pain or friction.The longer you wear them, the foam begins to conform to your foot. This particualr one is nice because it has thick padding.I'vs gotten 10 years out of a pair before!
