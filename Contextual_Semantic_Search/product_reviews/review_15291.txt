I purchased these items for 2 relatives and they were very pleased.  I want to say &#34;Thank You&#34; to the reviewer that suggested placing a plastic bag over the shoes BEFORE slipping on the boots -- it works !!.  We are keeping extra plactic bags stuffed in the boots for when they are needed.  Will update once the rainy season comes in.
