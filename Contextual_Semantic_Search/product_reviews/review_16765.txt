OK so you were browsing on Amazon and you stumbled across this jacket. Suddenly you remembered how much you enjoyed wearing this jacket when you were a skinny kid. Well I've got news for you. Your not a skinny kid anymore. Your a big Fatso. You will still love wearing it but think about ordering this tapered jacket a couple of sizes larger than you think you will need. Especially if your thinking of wearing a sweater under it. Sure the sleeves will be long enough to fit a full grown Orangutan but just push them up a bit and smile.
