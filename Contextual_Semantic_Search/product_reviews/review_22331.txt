This is a beautiful corset, well made and true to size IF you understand how corsets are sized. Measure your waist and subtract four inches for good fit.The corset has moderate boning and has sturdy construction for cinching. My only issue with it is that the cinching ribbons are too short, but if you spend a few dollars to replace them, it is a lovely, quality corset. Here's a video showing how to properly put on and cinch a corset:  [..]BTW, it is fully reversible, and the garters are removable. It's worth twice the asking price, and beautiful.
