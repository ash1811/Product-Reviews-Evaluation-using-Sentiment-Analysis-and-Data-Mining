The watch is beautiful and I loved it.  I wore it sparingly so it would stay nice, using an older watch for everyday use.  In spite of that 10 months after I got it it no longer works and the metal that surrounds the date window has fallen off and is loose in the case.I think there are some quality issues at Bulova.  Be careful.
