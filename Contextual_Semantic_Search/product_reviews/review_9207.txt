I just wanted to repeat what others have already posted (since I didn't believe them and paid for it). This is a somewhat thick and stiff belt (but not so much not to roll up to fit in a drawer) that is 2 to 4 inches shorter than the specified size. I sent the first one back and reorder another 4 inches longer (although just 2 inches would have been better) to get one that fit. It is very popular and I like it (although my son wouldn't wear it thinking the stitching is too "girly" for school), but you have been forewarned that size is not true.
