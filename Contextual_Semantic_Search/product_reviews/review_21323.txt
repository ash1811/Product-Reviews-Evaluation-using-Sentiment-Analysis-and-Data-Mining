These are great shoes for all day comfort and style. They've held up great over the past year. However some of the stitching has gotten pulled out and frayed. I've also used waterproofing products on these, and it just doesn't seem to have any effect. Your feet will get wet and even rain drops leave ugly, large wet spots.
