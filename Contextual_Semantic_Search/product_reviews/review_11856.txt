These are by far the best mens loafers out there. Sebago is an amazing brand that once purchased lasts for years and then you just want to buy another pair! Perfect for jeans or suit pants. Amazon's price is about half the price you would find anywhere else and they ship super fast so there is no point in the hassle of going to the store and over paying if you know your size already. These shoes do seem to run a little narrow which I like. I tend to have issues with shoes being too wide even though I don't have "narrow" feet per say. Over all a great buy.
