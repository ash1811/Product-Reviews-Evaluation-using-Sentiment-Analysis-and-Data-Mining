I really was amazed at how well these little boots felt when I went on a trip to Germany.  I have torn cartilage in one of my knees and must insert orthotic insoles into every pair of shoes I wear.  These boots absorbed the shock when i was sightseeing and were easy to take on and off during the long overseas plane ride.  I only wish they were made in a size like A or AA because I have a very narrow foot, but I'll  take anything I can get.  I liked the black ones so well I bought the brown pair.
