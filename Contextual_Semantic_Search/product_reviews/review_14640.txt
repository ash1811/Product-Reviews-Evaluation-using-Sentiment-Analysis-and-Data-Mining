I ordered size 7.5 in storm blue for my daughter. She wears an 8 and sometimes can fit a 7.5, but they were waaaay too roomy in the toes to be a size 7.5. The stock photo of the blue color is WAY off. It depicts the shoes to be a medium blueish teal color. They are actually a pale grayish blue, which isn't at all what she wanted. The pic is very misleading. If a company is going to post a stock photo of the product they should make the picture as accurate as possible to what it actually looks like. On the other hand, they are extremely comfy and cute, definitely recommend them to anyone who leans toward a comfortable shoe. Just know that if you want the blue color that is shown, you're not going to get it. But kudos to Amazon, they provided great service as always!Love their free & quick shipping, and free returns!
