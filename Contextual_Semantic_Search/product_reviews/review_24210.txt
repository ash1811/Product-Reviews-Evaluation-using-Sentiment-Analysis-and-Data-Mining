I got the plus sized light blue stockings.  They are a very pretty color in person and they are truly plus sized.  At first I was worried I couldn't wear them because they looked so small, but they stretch pretty good (keep in mind I have thick thighs), and they don't stay stretched out when you take them off.  They do a little bit, but they go back to their original size.
