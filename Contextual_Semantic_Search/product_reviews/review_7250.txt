I was worried when I ordered that it would be too small or large, however, I'm always a 7.5 and I ordered that, and that's exactly what I received.  It's flexible, with a soft sole, and the strap on top and fits perfectly.  It's a little wide but the ties can be tightened.  I wear them around the house and they've held up great.  Quality seems fine.  Nothing loose or tearing.
