The best thing about this is the length. I had to buy this to go under a corset because the corset did not go down long enough to hold in my stomach. I love that I have no issues with this covering my midsection. It does really help smooth out my figure to a very nice hourglass and I now feel confident that I will look smooth and thinner on my big day.Lines are minimal and great for more form fitting dresses.There is flexibility in this which makes it practical for existing! I have been in some where you cant breath or sit. while the fabric does suck you in it also allows for movement and I dont feel like Im going to pass out. thank god!THINGS I WISH WERE DIFFERENT:1.) I wish the fabric was a bit thicker. I know it needs to be thin for movement but I feel it could be thicker for even better control2.) It only has one hook option. there is one fixture it can close out. that means that you better get the right size because you cant cinch it or let it out anymore than how it comes.I bought a small and I am glad that I did. I am 143 pounds and 5'6&#34;. it does give an uneven look where it meets at my back, but thats because I need to lose weight and not the fault of the cincher. I intend to lose about 10 pounds before my wedding and I think it will be perfect and seamless then.The shape is nice before it goes on and I am happy with the product and the results.
