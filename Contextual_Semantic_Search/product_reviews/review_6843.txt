My first introduction to Gold Toe socks was around 1998. Absolutely fell in love with these socks. Thick yet still amazingly elastic cotton. So comfortable that I refused to wear anything else. In fact, it's just now (14 years later) that the heels of all those original socks have worn away to nothing. So I purchased some more Gold Toe to replace them. Bah! Can't believe these things have the Gold Toe label. They wear and feel like your basic Hanes or FoTL. No density. No exceptional construction. Just your generic, thin sock. I'm so tired of things being made so cheaply. I don't mind paying more for quality, but it's like none exists anymore. Even the more expensive items are cheaply made...with your extra money going towards the brand alone. For me, Gold Toe socks are no longer a quality item worth investing in.
