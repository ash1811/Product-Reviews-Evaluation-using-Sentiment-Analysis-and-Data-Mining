This bra feels good for about the first 2 hours you wear it. Then the band that goes across your rib cage gets bunched up and twisted and it diggs into your skin. I am always having to go into the bathroom and pull it down or readjust during the day. Also the cup is shaped like a cone under your shirt ( SO NOT NATURAL LOOKING AT ALL) Also the cone shaped cup material ruchees from the nipple up to the arm strap after you have been waering it awhile. This product is not worth your money. Mine went to the goodwill.
