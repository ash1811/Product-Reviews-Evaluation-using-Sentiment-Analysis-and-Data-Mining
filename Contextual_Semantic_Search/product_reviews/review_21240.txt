I've been wearing Sanuk's for about 5 years now and they are hands down the best flip flops I've ever owned. I usually live in them from the time the snow melts until it starts falling again. They are sturdy, they are comfortable, and they are lightweight. The yoga mat base is unbelievably comfortable, and stays comfortable even with regular use. The strap is made of cloth and a soft leather/cloth combination. Honestly once you wear these you'll never go to another Old Navy $1 flip flop day. The last point I want to make about these flip flops is that they are great for travel. I wore them for nearly 3 weeks while backpacking in Europe and my feet did not blister or peel and the lightweight material was great for reducing weight while traveling.
