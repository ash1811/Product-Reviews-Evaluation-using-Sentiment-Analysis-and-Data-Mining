There are plenty of us burly folks with thick necks and a muscle or two, who do not want to feel squeezed in our attire. This ungenerous sweatshirt is composed of thin fabric cinched on top by a too-tight neck. I should have read David Marvin's true and informative 1-star review. This is over-priced for the low quality. I've bought thicker, better quality sweatshirts from WalMart. That's how cheaply made this thing is. I can't tolerate a tight neck pulling on me all day like a rabid dachshund; totally uncomfortable to say the least. As the group Little Big Town sings on their CDThe Reason Why, "There's a price for keeping me, I may be cheap, but I ain't free..." This cheap fuzzy offering in larger sizes (2x, etc.) turned out better:Soffe Men's Classic Crew Neck Sweatshirt.
