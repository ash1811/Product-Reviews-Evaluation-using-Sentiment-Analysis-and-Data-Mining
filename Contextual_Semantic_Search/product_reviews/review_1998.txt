I like these. I wanted something that wasn't too flashy to wear on a regular basis, and I'm allergic to most of the earrings I currently have. I can wear these all day comfortably. They're subtle but not tiny; any bigger and I'd feel a little uncomfortable with them. The back is a little flimsy, and I do worry about losing them. Overall, I'm very pleased with the purchase.
