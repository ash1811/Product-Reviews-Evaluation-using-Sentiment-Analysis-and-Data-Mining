As a previous review already mentioned as well these are really on the large side. Way too baggy for my taste. OK standing up but as soon as one tries to sit in them the extra material will fold under one's leg s and buttocks making these pants really uncomfortable and forever tugging at the fabric truing to pull it out from under oneself. Not comfortable.
