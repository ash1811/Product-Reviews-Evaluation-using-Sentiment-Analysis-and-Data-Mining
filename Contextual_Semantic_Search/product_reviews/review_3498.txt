Berkshire stockings are the best!  Very well made and durable - they don't run the minute you put them on like a lot of brands do.  And, my legs look very sexy in them according to my significant other - they are silky smooth.  "City Beige" is a good, all-around color.  I've worn them to work with my high heels and received numerous comments from the guys.  Recommend them highly - I'll buy more!
