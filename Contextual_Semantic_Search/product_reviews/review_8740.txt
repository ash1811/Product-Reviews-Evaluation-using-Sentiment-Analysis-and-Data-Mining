This is my very first automatic watch. I strayed away from them because of the accuracy, but I have to say that this one is not that bad. I am thinking maybe 5 seconds or less a day, for an automatic with this price you cannot beat it. I have seen reviews for this watch saying that they are losing up to 45 seconds a day. I think this problem comes about from not wearing the watch much.If the watch is not being moved around it is not being wound and you will lose time. In the manual it does not give exact specs, it says "The specifications are subject to change without prior notice for product improvement". So maybe the earlier versions of this watch were a little less accurate.Another thing is that I think there are two versions of this watch. One has a Japanese movement and the other has a Malaysian movement. From what I have read there is really not that much of a difference since Seiko makes all of their products in house in Japan.For all you divers out their that are looking for the ISO 6425 standard. I don't think that the Malaysian movement has it. The reason I say this is because the watches that meet this standard are stamped with L3. The one I received did not have this stamp. I have looked around on the internet and all of the Malaysian movements from Seiko don't have it. I don't do any diving and just like the look of the watch so it is not a big deal to me.Overall a nice automatic watch and great lume.
