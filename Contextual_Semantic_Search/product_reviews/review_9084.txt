I have ordered several of the 511 washes. I am going to focus on the ones I think are most important.Rigid Dragon: I accidentally ordered the wrong size last time, but this wash is gorgeous. It's perfect for any non-business situation. Very clean. There's a reason it sells out almost instantly.Clean Dark: The picture is misleading. Even if your monitor is properly calibrated, odds are you may still miss the texturing on the back of the knees. Some people like that sort of detailing, I think it looks awful. That pattern will wear in to your jeans anyway, why have a fake looking version of that natural wear?Loungin Blues: I haven't ordered this wash from Amazon, but I am pretty sure it is the wash that I am wearing right now. They are my favorite jeans. Highly recommended (with that obvious caveat that there's a slight possibility they're not the jeans I'm wearing.)I like my black ones. They're good if you need black jeans, but they feel more stiff than my loungin blues (which stretch).
