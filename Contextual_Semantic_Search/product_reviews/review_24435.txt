My most recent pair of flip flops were all rubber and, although they are easy to clean, they are not comfortable. This time I wanted a pair that had a more cushioning sole and softer piece that goes over the foot. For flip flops, these are stylish and comfortable and the size is true to my shoe size. (If there is any question, go to the next higher size.) These are too nice for yardwork (will keep the old rubber ones for that.)
