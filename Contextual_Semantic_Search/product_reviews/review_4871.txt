I do an extensive amount of traveling and am a fan of quick wash underwear. It reduces the amount of clothing I have to carry. Cotton doesn't travel well - sure, it's comfy but doesn't work with hand washing.In the past I've traveled with Patagonia 100% underwear, and it's caused bad chafing over the period of a week or so while on the road. Polyester chafing sucks. That alone is enough to make me consider something else. The ExOfficio underwear doesn't seem to cause chafing, nor makes me feel gross after a day of traveling like cotton does. And on those epic travel days where you have been on the go for 3 days through multiple airports and you're sure you smell like manure, I feel better wearing them.Handwashing them is easy - wring them out and they dry overnight. I tend to bring a few pairs along with me on trips. Sure, they say that you can go for weeks on end with two pairs, but I'd go with a 3-4 pairs.Sure, they're pricy, but they're an investment. You can't go wrong with ExOfficio's clothing.
