I bought this based on Amazon's recommendation that it is frequently purchased with the watch I was buying. There are several types of bands as illustrated at [...] and it is very difficult to determine which type your new watch has until it is in your hands. This does not work with the Casio Men's WV300DA-7AC Waveceptor Solar Atomic Silver-Tone Watch that I purchased, so I just took my watch to a nearby jeweler and they sized it perfectly for $10. The pins in the watchband are very small and pop out several feet into the air, so be careful if you attempt to size your watch band and do it in a large uncluttered work area, like on a large dining table, and be sure you have the right tool for your band. I added this to my tool box, but I am skeptical that I will ever use it. I am happy there are still local jewelers to assist with watches you did not purchase from them.
