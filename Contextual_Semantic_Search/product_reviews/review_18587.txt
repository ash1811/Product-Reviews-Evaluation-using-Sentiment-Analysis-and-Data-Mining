I just got these boots and cleared land chainsawed logs and even shot some hoops with them and wore the new right off.Fairly comfortable for what they are and on sale I see them as being a bargain, steel toes are always a good idea for serious workers.As for size and weight they feel solid and secure laces are fabric but ok has some padding for foot as well as leg, I ran, walked 100s of yards and worked for hours without rest they are by no means to heavy.Oh yes size they are perfect for me 10.5 ew fits to a t, they also list other size standards for the none Americans out there.Leather looks good but wears easily, I would not recommend to steel workers or the like, for others who work in hazardous environments go for it.Update: My review stands 4/5 heavy use some wear shows boots still work 100%!
