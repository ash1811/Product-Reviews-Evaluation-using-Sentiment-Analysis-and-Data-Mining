Once you've worn a Sanuk flip flop with yoga mat (or in the case of the men's shoes, beer cozy) sole, you'll never want to wear any other brand.  These are the most cushioned, comfortable flip flops I've ever worn.  My daughter, grandkids and all my friends who've come over to the Sanuk flip flop agree.  They are the best hands down.  And they come in so many color options!
