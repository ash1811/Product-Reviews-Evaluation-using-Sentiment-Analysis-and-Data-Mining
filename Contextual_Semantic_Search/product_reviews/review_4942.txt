They fit tight but not too tight. Don't expect a lot of support from these. The material keeps you dry and just a little breeze can be felt thru them. A lot cooler than normal cotton drawers in the dessert. They are everything I'd hoped for. The only drawback I see is durability. I'm not sure how well these will hold up in the washer and dryer.
