I have worn Easy Spirit AP1's for years. I have bony ankles and these shoes are cut low, so as not to hit the bones. They have great traction and the leather lasts and lasts. I generally pay $70, so $53 is a great price. The white leather does get dirty. You can throw them in the washer. (NOT the dryer, of course). I have found that they can be polished with the good, old fashioned "Hollywood Sani-White" that we used to use for children's and nurses' white leather shoes. (Shake well before using!) This does get chalky, so I then buff them and spray on a clear polish. I've removed the sockliner and replaced it with magnetic insoles. My feet and knees never hurt anymore. Ten stars!!
