I bought a few pairs of these several summers ago and thought they were amazing.  I think I had a total of 5 or 6 pairs, and wore them for hiking/camping etc, but also every-day use.They hold up great, wick awesomely, and I've seen very little to no wearing out from washing them, or even drying on high heat...although you can of course just air dry them in little to no time.Meanwhile, this past year I had a puppy who liked to get into my dirty clothes and eat them, and I was down to only 3 pairs left so I decided to order more!These are seriously the best underwear that you can buy.
