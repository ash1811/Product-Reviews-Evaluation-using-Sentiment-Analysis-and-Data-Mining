I had to go on a weekend camping trip to northwest wisconsin with my son in January where we were going to be outside most of the day. The temperature dropped to -5, but these and a pair of wool pants kept my legs warm the entire time. I was worried that they would be itchy, but they are very smooth and did not itch at all. Great product!
