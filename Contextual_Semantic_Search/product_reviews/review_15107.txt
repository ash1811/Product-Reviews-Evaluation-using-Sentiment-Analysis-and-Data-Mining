I gave these size medium sweats a three star rating because they are warm and I like the Oxford color. The closed bottom are a bit tight for my taste. I'm 5' 3". Me personally, I like a more loose closed bottom so that my pants fit over my shoe a certain way. These comfortably hug my ankles but I don't care for this particular style. The fit is rather loose in waist and legs though. I bought two sets and washed and tumbled dried each piece and they did not pill and the inside remained soft. I will wear these only around the house and to bed.
