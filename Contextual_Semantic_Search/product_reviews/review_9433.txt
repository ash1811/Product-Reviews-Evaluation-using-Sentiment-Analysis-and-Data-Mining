These are very nice blue diamonds! The picture does show more of a blue, but these are more of a blue/green like the ocean, which is more true to the blue diamond. If you want a BLUER...you should look at sapphires. I got these to match a blue diamond ring I purchased while in St. Thomas....now to find a necklace to complete! Nicely packaged. If you want nice blue diamonds for a good price, give these a try!
