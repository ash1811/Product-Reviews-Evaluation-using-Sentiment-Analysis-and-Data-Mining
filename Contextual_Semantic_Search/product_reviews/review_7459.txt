This shirt was cheaper online so I bought it here. And the quality is great but when I put it on the shirt seemed like it could easily be a 4X or something. I bought an extra large, but the shoulders go to my elbows, the sleeves to my forearms and the bottom of the shirt is WAY LONG.Still good quality and great brand just maybe order a size smaller
