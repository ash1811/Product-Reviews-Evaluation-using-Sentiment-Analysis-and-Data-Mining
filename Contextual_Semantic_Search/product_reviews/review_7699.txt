I have a number of suspenders and I much prefer these belt clip on to the metal clip on to the pants. The metal clip ons inevitably spring loose and they take a bit to put on. If one has to sit down on the toilet, one spends a bit of time getting your pants back on and suspendered properly. The belt on never springs loose and can be put on easily with pants on which makes the bathroom issue disappear. My one complaint is they only sell the navy blue here on Amazon. C'mon Perry, we do have other colored shirts requiring different colors.
