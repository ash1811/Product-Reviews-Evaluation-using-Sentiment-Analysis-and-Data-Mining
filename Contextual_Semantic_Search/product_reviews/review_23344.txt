Wanted to like this robe, but it's a big disappointment. It doesn't drape well on me and hangs badly in places.  I'm 5'5 and 118, and the small size should have fit better.  I'd prefer it longer than reaching the top of my calves, and it's awkward to reach up high for anything because of the constricted way the sleeves are cut.For the price, I was hoping for a robe that looked becoming.  It just looks dowdy and sloppy -- not classy as I'd expected.  On the other hand, a fun robe I bought from Kmart's site on a lark for only $18 looks much better.  I'm returning the Shangri-la robe.  For the same money I can buy something I'll actually use.
