When I ordered this product there were 2 colors offered - white and black.  Should be clear as black and white, right?  But the color picture of the "black" shorts showed as grey which was my preference.  I figured the pictured color was considered black.  Drat, wrong again.  The shorts arrived and are a very black black, not a grey black.  Not a big complaint for me but still a little annoying.  Everything else appears OK.
