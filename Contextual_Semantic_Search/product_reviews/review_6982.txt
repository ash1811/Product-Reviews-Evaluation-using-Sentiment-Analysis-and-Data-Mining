I usually wear my athletic white socks with my casual shoes.  This doesn't look right when wearing certain types of shoes.  These socks look great with any shoe and I am actually now using them with dress shoes since they are about as comfortable as possible.  I also like the slightly thicker gauge of the cotton which is warmer in the winter.  They seem durable so I am very hopeful that they will last a long time.Very good shipping with a reasonable price.
