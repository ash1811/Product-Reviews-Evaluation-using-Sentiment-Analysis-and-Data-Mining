The waistband on these clacks is so tight......no give. Which can look great, but honestly the button was stitched on so tightly, that neither of us can even get the button hooked even when not wearing the pants! The button is not far enough away form the waistband material to even loop it into the button hole. VERY disappointed. These are fine looking pants. They would be great, but I don't think getting a larger size would help. You just can't put them on.
