They didn't have the size I needed. (They're completely out of all 31 waist for overdyed black and they don't even have 33 length whatsoever) Regardless, I'm still pleased with what I got, which was the 32 by 34. It's better to have pants too loose than too tight..as body weight can fluctuate all the time.The waist is just a little too big as I expected, but thankfully the length isn't too long when I have shoes on - in fact it's just perfect. With no shoes though, they completely cover my ankles...but I usually only wear these pants when I'm going out somewhere anyway.Aside from the fact that I have to wear a belt every time I wear the pants, I'm very happy. They're very durable and tough. As another reviewer pointed out though, they aren't extremely comfortable. Getting into the pockets is quite a chore, as you are forced to stand up every time you need to get something out of them.Overall though, they're very nice jeans, reasonably comfortable, they look wonderful and are perfect for work. Very happy.
