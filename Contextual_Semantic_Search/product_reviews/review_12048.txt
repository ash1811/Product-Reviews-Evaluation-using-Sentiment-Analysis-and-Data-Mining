I bought these Black Dockers Men's Gordon Cap Toe Oxford shoes, because of Dockers Brand name, and the price. What I got looks pretty good, well worth what I paid for. But now I realize only the uppers are leather, the rest of the construction is man made materials. I would've preferred to pay more and get a pair of shoes wholly made of real leather. However the workmanship these shoes looks pretty good. If they last as long as a pair of real leather shoes, then I made a good decision with these. They look and feel excellent. The rubber soles are a plus for me. So, time will tell if I bought a pair of shoes that will last a long time. Happy for now :-)
