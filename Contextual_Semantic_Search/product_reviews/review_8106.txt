I love this ring so much I purchased again in a smaller size.  I ordered a size 8 and it was a little big.  No big deal, I used a micro fabric towel with pliers to bring it together.  It's comfortable (I had no issue with the bands round smooth thickness) and get lots of comments.  The way the amber comes out on the each end they light hits it and adds a glow.  Can't wait to get my new ring...hope it looks the same.  Great price, beautiful ring.
