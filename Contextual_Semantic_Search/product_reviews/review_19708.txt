The dog ate my husband's last wallet. I shopped around for a wallet that was big enough to hold his stuff, yet small enough to fit in his front pocket for those times he didn't want it in his back pocket. I chose this wallet. My husband loves it! It is high quality, holds everything well, has a nice flip up ID section, and it is slim enough to fit comfortably in his front pocket when it is completely full. No other wallet has been able to accomplish that. Now to keep this one away from the dog!
