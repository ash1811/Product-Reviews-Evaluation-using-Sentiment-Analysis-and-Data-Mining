Quality seems to be good. Description of sizes might need review, unless bibs are intended to be normally long. The 32&#34; length , my normal inseam, is way long. I'll have to cuff them to keep them from dragging. Had to draw the straps up to the max to keep the crotch from being at my knees!!  Plenty of room for additional cold weathers layers.
