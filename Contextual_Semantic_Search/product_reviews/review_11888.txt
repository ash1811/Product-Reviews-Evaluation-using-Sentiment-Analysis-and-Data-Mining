im 6'2" 250 so i like loose fitting clothes. Ordered up 2 sizes and the waist was comfortable, loose but not sagging. The 13in inseam went well passed my knee and covered my knee even when sitting but these were way to baggy in the legs(glad i didnt get the 15in). It looked like I was wearing parachute shorts or something and I dont have skinny or avg size legs. I ordered the regular fit this time so hopefully they wont look so baggy.EDIT: I went with the 11in reg fit and they fit great still cover my knee while standing and sitting. They still fit loose and are comfortable in the legs/thighs and it doesnt look like im a wanna be gangster or wearing parachute shorts.
