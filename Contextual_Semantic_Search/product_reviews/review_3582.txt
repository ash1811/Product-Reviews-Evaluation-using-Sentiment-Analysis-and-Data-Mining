This is my second purchase of these Wigwam brand hiking/outdoor socks. I now have seven pair. Why so many? These are the single best socks I have ever used. They are all synthetic, warm in winter, good in summer, no blisters, chafing, no wet feet, fit perfectly (I wear mens 9 shoe and use the Large size instead of the recommended medium), and look good. Turn them inside-out when you wash them in the machine, use no bleach, and they might outlast your hiking shoes. Socks are really important in walking comfort. I am an urban hiker and have always been pleased how warm my feet are all winter now that I use these artificial fiber socks instead of wool. Cotton? Forget it. These are the best - worth every penny. Highly recommended.
