I love acorn slippers that don't have a center seam across the top.  Since I have a wide foot, they always fit.  I would have ordered an additional pair, however; these are not flat on the bottom.  Somehow my foot often seems to roll sideways when I walk.  I think there is something to make the sole soft and it lifts my foot.  Otherwise, they are great to keep my feet warm when I am sitting.
