I have a watch like this and it has, as the add use to say (paraphrase), &#34;taken a licking and keeps on ticking.&#34;  This particular watch was bought for a young friend and needed to be solid and still have that camo look he likes.  Great watch for outdoors and work when you don't want to beat your good watch up or lose it.  Easy to read, 12/24 hour markings on the dial, water resistant to 30 meters, great price.  He loves it
