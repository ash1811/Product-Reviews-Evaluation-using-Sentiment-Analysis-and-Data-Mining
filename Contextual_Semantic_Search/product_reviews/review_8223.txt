I am a second Invicta watch owner. This is my first automatic and so far so good. The price was right with the 20% off, making it the lowest price around for an automatic movement watch. The crown is easy to adjust. For some reason people were saying it was difficult to work. I was amazed by the quality of the watch and the fine craftsmanship and detail. The band was about 3 links too big; however, I was able to remove the pins with ease with the free Invicta watch tool I received by calling Invicta! I toyed with either buying the gold finish or the stainless. I made the right choice as this is probably the best time piece I have ever seen. The second hand sweeps smooth rather than in steps like a regular watch. I believe Rolex and only a few other watches do this. Since this is my first day with it, I am sure I will list an update at some point. Invicta warranties the watch for 1 year with the option of an additional 4 years; however, the price for the warranty was about half of what I paid for the watch. The only downside is that if you need it repaired under the 1 year or extended warranty, you need to send a check for $20.00 along with the watch. I am sure that if you complain enough if it breaks they might waive the $20.00. Anyway, great loooking watch, great price, You will impress your friends no doubt! By the way, got it in 2 days from the date I placed the order. A++++ Amazon!Dec 2007 - I have written to Invicta, emailed them, faxed them and I never receive a reply. Tried to inform them that there web site was not working right. Also had requested a catalog about 2 months ago along with a spare link for the watch. NEVER a word. You call them and you are on hold for 30 minutes with still no answer. I am getting the impression that Invicta is just a bunch of mirrors and smoke screens. Probably a shack in the basement of someones house. So, keep in mind if you order one, don't expect much from customer service.
