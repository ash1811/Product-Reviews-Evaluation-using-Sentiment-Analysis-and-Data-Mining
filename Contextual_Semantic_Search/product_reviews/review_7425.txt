I bought this for my son and I can't get him to wear anything else - even in the coldest winter weather days!  He loves that it is a simple hoodie with all the warmth of a coat.  The thermal liner creates a nice warm jacket and when layered over a t-shirt and long-sleeve shirt it seems to be perfect for him.  Love Carhartt!!
