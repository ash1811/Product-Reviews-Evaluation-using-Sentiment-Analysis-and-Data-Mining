This fits so nicely and is thin!  I didn't itch at all wearing this, and it really helped my trouble spots.  You can't really see from the picture, but it DOES come all the way up to the bust, at least on me - 5'5 140lbs.I have tried a lot of shapers over the past few years, from Spanx, Hanes, Flexees, Curvi and more.  I am the most happiest with this shaper!  Very comfortable and I can wear them all day!You can't feel the hidden garter, which is really a nice option to have, and it doesn't move!  The legs don't creep up and the top doesn't creep down.  I even went so far as to wearing a waist cincher UNDER this shaper and it smoothed out the edges of the cincher too!I will be wearing the waist cincher under this shaper for my wedding in a couple weeks - in 85 degrees - and I have total confidence that I will look AWESOME rockin' my hourglass shape!(here is the cincher I bought too:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007QMK8M/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_40)
