I LOVE Soft Style shoes and rarely have a problem with sizing. I ordered my regular size, which is a 7.5 but found it tight in the toe box. This style is a great shoe! It is not a complete flat but has a very small heel, just what I was looking for especially since I am petite. Often flats do not give me enough height and this shoe was perfect in giving me just a little more height than a flat shoe. It is not a shoe I would consider as a pump but as a nice casual flat with a small heel :) I think going up a size would be too big. Wish it fit.
