My review is only about the boot itself, not the seller of this product.  My main gripe is how terrible they are in the ice and snow.  I live in Chicago, and we get about 4 months of horrible weather from Dec-March.  It is icy, wet, slippery snowing, etc. almost every day.  Last winter I fell on the ice in these boots about 5 times.  The last time it happened, I tore a hamstring.  It finally dawned on me that these boots have no traction whatsoever and they are not made for icy/snowy conditions. The bottom of these boots consists of a slick, waxy surface with no traction.  So while they may be warm and fashionable, they are NOT made for people who have to walk in ice and snow.  I am selling my boots on ebay and will NEVER buy Uggs again.
