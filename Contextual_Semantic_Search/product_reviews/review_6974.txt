I bought these socks for my older son when I was looking for long black socks for a costume. They are thick and heavy and fit snugly so they stay up. Note though that they are quite snug fitting and not very stretchy. I would say that they wouldn't be very comfortable for a man with larger ankles and calves. I think that a man with a size 12 1/2 shoe size would find these a little too tight for comfort on his foot, too. They definitely don't work for a man who wears a size 13 shoe - guess how I know this???
