I bought this for firm control post abdominal surgery. I bought the small (was a little concerned it would be too tight,, and admittedly when I put it on at first, I thought it was, but once I had it on all day I was glad I'd bought the small). For reference I am 5'2&#34; 109 lbs 34&#34; hip (waist is swollen so cannot provide you with an accurate measurement there, but I'm generally a small).Pros:Provides great support that meet my needsDoes NOT roll on me (I have read some reviews where they had issues with it rolling - I have never had this happen and wear it  both sitting and standing for long periods of time)It is really pretty and sexyI can fold the bottom half up when going to the bathroom, so it's easy to get it out of the way when you need toCons:The hook and eye closures are a little cumbersomeIt does feel *really* tight at first (but it does have give after a while)Overall, this product gets an A from me. I am going to buy another one right now.
