I got the Sandstone Active Jacket in &#34;mushroom&#34; color, which is exactly as shown in the picture -- it's a tan color but more brown than beige.  This jacket - above all - was a great value. I'm not sure if I got an off season discount or what, but when I saw it I jumped on it.  The jacket itself is great. I have owned three of these in my lifetime and they're pretty hard to destroy.  Mine just got to looking kind of ratty after many years, and need replacement.  The quilted flannel lining is warm enough for sub-freezing temps with layers underneath.  This is the original work wear jacket. I have seen a bunch of knock offs, but Carhartt is still the king. It's not about the label, it's about the quality.
