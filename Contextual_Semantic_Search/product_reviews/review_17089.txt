For $11, a very good deal. Its big enough to hold everything I need. Two compartments is good - put soap or other liquid items in one side only. I like that it's canvas - it goes in the shower with me in the gym and hangs off a hook in there, gets a little wet, no problem, because it will dry out pdq.
