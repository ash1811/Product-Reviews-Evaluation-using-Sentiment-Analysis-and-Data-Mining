I liked these at first as they were inexpensive, fit well, are comfortable, and are thick enough to look and feel substantial.  Unfortunately, after about 5 or 6 hourlong rides and two washes, tiny holes developed along and next to the seams in the seat.  I have to throw these out since the holes will only get worse with wear or washes and since they're not repairable due to the fabric and fit of the tights.  I have a 25" waist and my tights were slightly large in a size 26", so the issue was not that they were too small. Just a lack of quality, I guess.  I'm disappointed and am returning the second pair I bought.
