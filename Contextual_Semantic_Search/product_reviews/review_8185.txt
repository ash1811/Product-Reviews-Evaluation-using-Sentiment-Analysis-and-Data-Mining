Along with the other models in the SKX007 line, this watch is tough, sporty, nice, and a really really good workhorse. It keeps excellent time unless you're a &#34;$5000 a watch snob.&#34;  In that case, nothing on Amazon will make you happy.  However, for us real people without unlimited budgets this is a great all around watch that can do a day by the ocean or a night on the town.  The bezel rotates nicely, doesn't feel cheap and clicks 120 times around. This is also an ISO rated diver.  The movement can be serviced AND regulated to keep even better time than it already does and there are multiple strap options along with a plethora of aftermarket parts to swap out to make it your own.  This line and it's predecessors have been around for decades now with minor improvements along the way. Do yourself a favor if you can only afford one watch to do everything, get this or another in its line. (007, 009 etc). Thank you.
