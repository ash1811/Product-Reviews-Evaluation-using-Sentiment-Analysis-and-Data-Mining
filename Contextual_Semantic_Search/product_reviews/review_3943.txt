It's hard to find 34DD in the stores where I live, so I ordered a bunch on amazon knowing that I would find one's that fit great and one's that suck. This bra sucked. I measured it against a 34 DD that I love wearing and the straps, band, and cup shape were all different. It's made well, but doesn't fit my body.
