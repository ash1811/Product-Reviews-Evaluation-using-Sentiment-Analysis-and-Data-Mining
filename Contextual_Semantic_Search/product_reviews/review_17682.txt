These were not the usual glove leather that I am used to in the Reebok  princess sneakers . These are more like counterfeit knock off in a Reebok box . The material was hard , stiff ,man made  and cheap man made. The shoes that listed as wide were not even a medium. The price was comparable to market value but not quality . I bought a pair fory mom and me and they both went back . I won't be buying from this vender ever again. However I had no problem getting a return label or my money refunded. The star is for their customer service. The shoes get nothing.
