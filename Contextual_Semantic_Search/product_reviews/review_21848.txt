These are made from comfortable materiel, if a tad on the lighter side (which is exactly what I wanted). Will work great as undershirts or casual white v-necks (I use them for both). I usually wear either an L or an XL (6ft, broad build, 200 pounds), and these in a Large fit me in a comfortable and complimenting way. Would (and will!) buy again.
