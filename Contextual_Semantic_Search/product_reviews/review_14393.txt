The watch is very nice for only $25, feels rugged and strong, the details on the dial are quite nice as well.  Excellent wristwatch, I give it 5 stars. It's def. better than a similar Pulsar which I also bought for $50(no knock against Pulsar now they produce good watches)  But this particular Timex model is much better, they outdid Pulsar in my opinion.
