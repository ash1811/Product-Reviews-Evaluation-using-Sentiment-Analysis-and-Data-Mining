My boys are very much into the superhero stage, and these were perfect!!  They are inflatable back pieces, with white elastic straps similar to a backpack style.  The great thing is no one gets injured from being whacked with the wings of these mid-flight.  (as one who got smacked in the face while my Buzz was off to save the galaxy, I can vouch for that).  Price was great, these are super fun!
