Great bag for swimming!!  I was able to fit a lot in it.  We carried fins, kick board, goggles, towel and everything else my child needed for swim team in this.  The kids were able to carry it themselves.  We also had a friend embroider their names on the front which looked great.  We have used for one heavy swimming summer and they were still in great shape!
