Having been an Easy Spirit fan for many years, I'm always looking for less-than-full price shoes.  These "Motion" have been a consistently good buy, a great value shoe that holds up well, comfortable, polishes like new, and never separates at the seams.  I wear the newest ones for outings, the older ones for around the house, the oldest ones for the garden.  But I always watch for when they go for less than full price....because I know I will get great, consistent shoes.
