I was looking for a bag to keep my larger camping items. This bag is perfect. It holds all of the following: Coleman 6-person instant tent & rain fly, large Kelly shade house, two queen size inflatable mattresses, electric air pump, and 2 folding camp chairs!!!!!!!! Yea it takes 2 people to load/unload it from the truck, but all my stuff is in one place, and I only use this equipment for "car camping".
