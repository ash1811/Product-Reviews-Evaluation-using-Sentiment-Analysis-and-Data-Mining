It was not what I expected.  Very thick and sturdy.  Easy to wiggle into with sneaker socks and even room for my heel pad.  I wore them the first week barefoot and they were great.  Roomy but snug.  They are magic AND tough.  Lots of shoveling and hard new garden chores.  slipped out of them on the porch going in and wiggled hands free getting them back  on to go back out.  I LOVE THEM.  Order your true size without fear.
