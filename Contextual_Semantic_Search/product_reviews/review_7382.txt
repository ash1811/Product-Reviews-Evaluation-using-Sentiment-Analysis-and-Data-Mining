I should know better by now, but this time I figured if I bought the 3X size it might be long enough to at least make it to my belt.  Nope.  Now, having said that, I'm not a scarecrow by any means--I typically wear XL or XXL T-shirts.  Right now I'm wearing a Reebok 2X NY Giants T-shirt that's about 4 inches longer than this 3X Russell t-shirt and I've found this to be true of every Russell shirt I've ever purchased. I don't know what they use as a template, but all I can figure is that they use dwarves. Check out the model in the picture.  The shirt is hanging below his crotch--when I wear it I look like Comic Book guy from the Simpsons. I wear 40 X 30 jeans, so it's not like I'm Fat Albert--I'd just like Russell to add a couple of inches to all their athletic shirts. Their sweatshirts have the same problem.
