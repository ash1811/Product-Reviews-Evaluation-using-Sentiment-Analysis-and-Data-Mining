It is really perfect. The material is stiff until you was it, once that happens the material relaxes a bit and becomes amazing. The jacket is really warm without beign crazy. I wear it with appropriate layers from 65 degrees all the way to 30's. When i make my way up to northern california ill be sure to update this on how the jacket performs in snow and lower temps. I have high hopes. Highly recommended just as with all carhartt products.
