I always have problems finding a size 5 and I was thrilled to find these in my size.  I'm 52 years old and these shoes are great because they don't look like children's...they're comfortable, well made and shipped in a speedo shoebox.  I highly recommend this seller.  I actually bought 2 pairs!  Going to aruba and these are perfect!
