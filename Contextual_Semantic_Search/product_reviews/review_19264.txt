The PRC 200 series of watches have been hugely popular in the last five years and you can see why.The watches have a large (39.8mm), clear face, with easy to read hands and a generous amount of luminous markers.  The hour markings are sharp and the square-cut date window is at the 4 o'clock position. The watch case is made of highly polished stainless steel and is sealed with a six point (jaxa) waterproof caseback.While maintaining its simple elegance, this watch is also packed with sports features including:* scratch-resistant sapphire crystal watch glass* a rim-placed tachymetre* Swiss quartz (ETA G10.211) chronograph movement providing 10th of seconds/ seconds/ 30 min* screw-down crown providing water-tightness to 200 metres (660 feet)While some people may take some time to get used to the deployment clasp on the strap, most will agree that it minimises wear and tear on the leather (compared to a buckle) and quickly becomes second nature to put on and remove.I have enjoyed this watch for the last two years and it has travelled well, kept good time and the face has remained scratch free.
