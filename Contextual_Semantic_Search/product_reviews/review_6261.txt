If you are a bigger guy then you know all about the magic that is fishing shirts! These shirts do run big, but they fit so well. You can move and bend and it doesn't get tight. The Columbia brand specifically seems to be a GREAT brand on this shirt. I have had no trouble with shirts fading or buttons falling out.  What is also nice is that they are long so you can bend over without your lower back falling out.  Really a great product, but know that they run a little big. If you have experience with these shirts then you know all about it.
