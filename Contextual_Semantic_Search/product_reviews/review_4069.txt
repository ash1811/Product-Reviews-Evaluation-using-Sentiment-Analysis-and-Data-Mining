After reading all the reviews posted here, and considering the sizing guidelines, I ordered an XL of this waist cincher. I have no difficulty at all putting this on - it hooked up quickly with no real pulling or struggle required. This size certainly provides some shaping and support - but not to the extent I'd predicted based on reviews. In hindsight, I should have ordered a L, instead. At some point, after I lose a few more pounds, I will probably dig deep and order the smaller size. The cincher does pull in my waist about a half inch, and it help make me more conscious of my waistline (which helps remind me not to snack!!). As other reviewers have indicated, the bottom of the cincher irritates my skin, even when worn over tights or hose. But overall, I am pleased with my purchase.
