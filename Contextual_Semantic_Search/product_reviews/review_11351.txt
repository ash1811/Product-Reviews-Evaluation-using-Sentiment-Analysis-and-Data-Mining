This backpack is beautiful. It is also bare bones. It is quite thin, and I don't know how long it will hold up to a 10 year old's abuse. I could have bought equal quality at the drug store for half the price. I own another Jansport style that I bought 4 months ago and it is awesome: sturdy, stylish, roomy, and lots of great compartments. This one has only one compartment, and a zippered one in the front. That's it. My daughter loves it so I will let her keep it. Hopefully it will last the new school year.
