My daughter really enjoyed this costume.  It comes with several pieces, including a small attached cape (can be tricky to get on), gloves, and rubber like belt.  The belt itself is a magnet for dirt and gets dingy and grey very fast.  But the material is neat - shiney and thin so it helps create the Batgirl illusion.In all, we liked it.
