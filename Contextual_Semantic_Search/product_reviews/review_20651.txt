We haven't found these to be as useful as I had expected.  We've bought a few pairs of these since my oldest was an infant.  I liked them when she was an infant for water play, so that her foot would not slip when standing or stepping.  Since she's been older, we've really just used Crocs for most water situations.  Crocs are just so much easier to slip on/off for the pool, and so easy at the beach since sand shakes right off.The problem with these surfwalkers is that they are harder to get on/off for the pool, and they get covered with sand when wet.  And when wet, they are impossible to get back on.I find the only usefulness is for rocky beaches where you want them on your feet in the water.  But don't expect to put them back on if you take them off.  Get crocs for that.
