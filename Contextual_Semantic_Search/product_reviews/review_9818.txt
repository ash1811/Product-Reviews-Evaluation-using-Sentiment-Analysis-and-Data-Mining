When it has came down to Citizen and their classic Solar-powered Eco-Drive watches, they have shown both the good and the bad in distinction and class. That though for the past couple of years has been a sad mess for Citizen, since so many people have wanted fine watches from brands like Michael Kors and Guess, where the quality has been lost over quantity. But Citizen tried that with the Drive 2.0 and 3.0 collection, but that hasn't delivered well. This watch is classic style and design. The classic Citizen Eco-Drive Calibre is a contemporary and classy watch. Yet there is one big disadvantage. With the perpetual movement, it takes a bit longer to setup and is a little more complicated. But has god illumination, easy to read calendar date and time. It is a good buy from Citizen, but there should be a easier way to setup the world around you.Price: CSetup & Comfort: C+Overall: C 1/2+
