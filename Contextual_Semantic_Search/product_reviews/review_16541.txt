This jeans came as ordered and were exactly what I thought they were suppose to be.  The only problem that I saw with these jeans is after wearing them for the day, the material "strechted" out and were a LOT bigger than when I put them on that morning.  I would probably not purchase these pants again.  I live an active life and do not need or desire to have pants that end up something that I am pulling up to keep on at the end of the day.
