I got these for my husband (A very picky man).  They are sturdy denim and sized right.  When my man tried them on, he liked them so much he didn't take them off.  These are a good weight denim, not too light and not too stiff.  There is room in the crotch which makes them more comfortable for the men.  Well sewn and seem long-lasting.
