My husband loves Keens and these are one of his favorite models. If you have wide feet and a high instep, this shoe is made for you! The ones just received are replacing a pair he wore out. They look really great on, and if you're on your feet all day, they offer comfort, and a professional/casual look that's hard to beat.  I received them promptly, and for a good price.So, the shoes themselves deserve five stars, but Massey's Outfitters, where they shipped from, deserve 2. They were received in fair condition but sold as new. There were marks all over the leather, as if they'd been chewed on or clawed?! No kidding. There were scuffs on the side of one shoe as if it had been dragged around the warehouse, and then the vamp of the same shoe had marks all over it that looked like scratches made by an animal. The tongue of one shoe had blemishes resembling bite marks. The soles of the shoes were fine, as were the interiors, so I don't think they'd been used. They were also just kind of thrown in the box, with paper jumbled around them, and the cardboard inserts that help them keep their shape during shipping were actually OUTSIDE the shoes!  I know raccoons are cheap labor, but they're easily distracted and not very detail oriented...high school students are a much better choice for seasonal workers :-)  I'm not returning them because I don't want the hassle. I'll be able to put some mink oil on them before hubby gets them for Christmas, and that should take care of surface imperfections. Not sure if they fit him yet, will let you know. If they don't, it'll be because the shoes are the wrong size, not the wrong make!
