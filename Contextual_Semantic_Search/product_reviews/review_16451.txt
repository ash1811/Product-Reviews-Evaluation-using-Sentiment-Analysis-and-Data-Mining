Maybe they are sterling silver, but they look nothing like the numerous other sterling silver jewelry I have and seem to cause a reaction in my ear...too bad.  They are cute besides that.  I gave one star because I would expect something that says sterling silver to without question appear to be sterling silver.  Not that the price that was paid was extremely high, but for cheap material $10 is way too much.
