My son requested this watch for Christmas. He has a very small, thin wrist for a man, so most watches don't fit him. His friend has one so he knew it work for him. Since this is so thin and has a strap with no holes, it can be adjusted to fit his very small wrist. He liked it very much. The price was good, which I liked.
