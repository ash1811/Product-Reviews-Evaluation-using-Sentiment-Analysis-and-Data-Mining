I had a pair of Dearfoams terry scuffs for so long I can't remember where I lived when I got them.  Ten or 15 years!  I replaced my old ones with these in August 2006.  Still top-notch.  Comfortable, with a sturdy sole.  You can step outside if you want.  They're marvelous for those of us who don't wear flip-flops because we hate that thing between our toes.  They're just terrific in warm weather.  You can protect your soles and toes while keeping your feet cool.  The terry is very soft.  Dearfoams doesn't skimp on the size, either.  Order your regular size and be confident your foot won't be hanging off the edge of the sole.Now that it's January, I'm wearing these slippers only occasionally.  I've washed them about 9 times, and they look practically brand new. I would buy these again.August 2008 - I haven't bought them again, because they still look and feel practically new, despite dozens of washings!March 2010 - I STILL have these, though they've seen better days now.  Terrific value.
