Fly Flap is still too short.  It is about 1/2&#34; longer than the famous &#34;gapless&#34; shorts of a couple years ago designed according to some as having been done a woman for sure.  I am still seeing men loosening their pants before a urinal these days  --combined with the short 6&#34; zippers in the pants themselves one must loosen and drop pant a bit.  What is wrong with the designers or is it just a matter of cutting cost.  Overall size is about the same -- not skimpy there.  I refuse to pay $10 a pair for name boxers.
