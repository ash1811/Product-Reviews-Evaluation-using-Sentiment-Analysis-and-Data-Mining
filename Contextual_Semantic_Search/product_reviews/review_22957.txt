I bought a &#34;black&#34; pair of these shoes at Nordstrum where they are 30% more expensive, and I found this pair to be comfortable from the start.I bought a brown pair of this same shoe through Amazon at the cheaper price and found them to be uncomfortable because their inner sole insert was irregular and not flat. I returned them to Amazon.
