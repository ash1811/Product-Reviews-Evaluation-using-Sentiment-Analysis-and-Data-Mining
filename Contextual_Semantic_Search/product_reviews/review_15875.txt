I have used these socks for hiking around our high desert and mountain areas since 2006.  When my last pair wore out, I was pleased to find them on Amazon.These are my favorite socks for hiking the local trails.  The moisture- wicking technology keeps my feet relatively dry and the cushioning helps in preventing blisters.
