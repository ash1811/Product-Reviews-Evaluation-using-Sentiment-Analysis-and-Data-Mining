I took a chance with these Levi's 511 jeans and I am sooooo happy that I did !! I am 6ft tall -- weigh 216lbs . Most of my weight is upper ( shoulders / chest / gut areas ) . I am also in my 40's . I always was thin in my teens / 20's / 30's , and like to dress somewhat fashionable . ( I played in Rock bands all my life and my wardrobe was pretty much leather jackets , t-shirts , tight jeans / cords ) . AS I am now in my 40's , I have quit partying and started taking better care of myself . I had no idea that I was going gain so much more weight ( I just wanted to live healthy ) . -- Well I am healthy alright ! In my 30's I never thought I would pass 190 lbs. Now at 216 lbs I feel huge !! I hate that damn scale !! ) hahahahahaha--- anyway---- I have been shedding a few pounds here and there but it is only affecting my upper parts . My waist seems to stay the same ( I have been in a 34 - 36 waist for 20 years )?? -- The bottom line --- I was pretty nervous about wearing these . I don't want to be that guy who is old - fat - and tries to pull off wearing 'skinny' jeans !! -- Well these are really not that skinny . They feel great !! There is still room even though they may appear tight fitting . I purchased the Black and this really cool looking Grey . They look nice on as well as feeling nice . The tough part was wearing them in front of my kids --- I have 3 very opinionated kids in their early teens to early 20's . They like them !!! As a matter of fact my wife and youngest daughter thought I lost A LOT of weight - when I wore the Black pair . They made me appear thin again !! --- So now its time to shed a little more upstairs and go hit the stage - again !! Thank You and Good Night !
