I think these socks are incredible, not just for tennis but for daily wear. The toe area and heel are thickly padded. The socks are well-made, high quality. Worth the money! Cheap socks are a misery. These are definitely worth the price. They're comfortable, they stay up... I have nothing negative to say about them. Highly recommended!
