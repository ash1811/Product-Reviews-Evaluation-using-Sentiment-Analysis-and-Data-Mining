I own probably 10 pairs of these briefs. They are very comfortable and light.  The banding around the legs is sized well, unlikesome other brands that will be too small or shrink.The lining is cotton, so no danger of collecting moisture.  I wash them and hang to dry; however, occasionally they accidentally get dried on high in the clothes dryer without sustaining shrinkage.They are a good deal for the price, also.
