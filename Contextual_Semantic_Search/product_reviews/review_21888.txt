This swim nappy is easy to get on and off, and easy to take care of - I put it on a cold rinse through the machine each time we go in the pool.On the downside, it's far too big.  I went by weight and while my daughter met the minimum weight recommendation at 2 1/2 months, it would be useless for containing any mess.  We use it as an under layer with a 'Happy Nappy' from Splash About and that works great.
