In the proper size, this bra lifts the breasts off the ribcage, giving a more youthful silhouette, and makes you more shapely by bringing them a little more toward center, making one look thinner.  So, up and center.  This bra provides plenty of support with a natural look, no padding in the cup area, but does have some special stitching on the armpit side of the cup for support.  It's hard to see in the photos but works well.  The shoulder straps have some padding, making them a little wider and more comfortable.  Fabric is soft and comfy.You'll feel prettier and thinner.  I got a professional bra fitting and bought a couple of these at the lingerie outlet store, and am now buying other colors on Amazon.  BTW, Amazon's price is $2 cheaper than the outlet store (and that doesn't take in to consideration the cost of gas to drive thirty miles one way to get there.The bra consultant said that most women have to go down one size in inches and up one cup size.  That's exactly what happened.  I thought a larger cup size would make me look bigger, in fact, I look smaller busted, more shapely, and trimmer.All in all, a great investment, and my most favorite bra ever.
