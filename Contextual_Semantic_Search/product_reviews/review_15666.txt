I am particular about my socks.  I hate when I can feel the seam near my toes, and this seam is comfortable.  I wear these socks daily for work.  Because I give lectures where I am standing all day, my feet need to be comfortable.  And lets face it, if you are thinking about your socks something is wrong!  These socks stay up, never bunch or have hot spots.  And because they are a liner, they are not thick and they keep my feet a pleasant temperature - not too hot, or wet or smelly!  After a year or two of daily wear they start to get thin at the heal, so then I go buy five more pairs!  I have been wearing these socks for 7+ years - they are awesome!
