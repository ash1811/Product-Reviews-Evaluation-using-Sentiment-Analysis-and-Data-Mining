These are tiny, tiny earrings.  Yes, the photo shows the measurements, but it is so extremely magnified that you don't realize they are half-an-inch EACH...and that's not big at all.  The photo must be at least 5x larger than actuality.  Other than that, they're pretty, but way too small.  I was buying these for my grandmother, but had to rush to get her something else once I received these.  I will definitely be more careful when buying jewelry online!
