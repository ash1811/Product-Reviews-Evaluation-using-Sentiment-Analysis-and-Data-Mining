I bought this summer weight cap, wondering if it would be cool enough for the Texas heat....surprise!  it was!  The photos do not do justice, as the fabric is very open and allows a lot of air in to your head and heat out...i.e. it is fine for the Texas summer heat, looks really nice, and I have worn one for months with no problems with stains, rips, tears, or other fabrick problems.  Gotten many compliments on the summer hat by Kangol.  I recommend!
