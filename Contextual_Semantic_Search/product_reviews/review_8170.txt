This was given as a gift.  The recipient loved the watch and the way it looked.  Because it has both gold and silver tones to it, it coordinates well with other silver and gold jewelry worn at the same time.  The only issue is that, unlike some other watches, it is not aware of what particular month it is (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.) so \the information on day and date can desynchronize because of the different number of days in each month.
