My son wouldn't wear it because he can be a stick in the mud. However, the costume is very cute, came within e boot covers, holster, bandana, hat, and one piece costume. I only wish it ran a little bigger so he could wear it in a few weeks or months if he ever lightens up and enjoys dressing up in costumes.
