These socks are brilliant; easily the most comfortable socks I've ever worn. I've been wearing Ingenious socks since 2001, but I switched to these merino/silk ones for this Afghanistan trip.Very warm, wick moisture away far better than the Ingenious socks, and since the liner is silk, the overzealous Fluor laundry guys can't destroy the liner with jet-blast dryer heat like they did to my Ingenious socks.The downside: despite only a few wearings/washings, several pairs developed holes in the Achilles area.Update: Of the original 15 pairs of these socks that I bought just over a year ago, I am down to a single pair. Why? all 14 other pairs developed holes in the Achilles area. Didn't matter what boots or hiking shoes I wore, within a few wearings they were torn up. The first few times, I had the socks repaired, but the patch wouldn't hold. I would really recommend Wigwam figure out some Achilles/heel reinforcement weaving technique.
