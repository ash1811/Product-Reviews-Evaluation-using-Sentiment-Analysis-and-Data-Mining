I ordered 6 of these bags for my bridesmaids.  Even though they shipped together in the same box, each one was charged $4 in shipping.  So while the bag was only $4, it was a total of $8 per bag.  I didn't think that was a bad price until I received the bags and felt how cheap they are.  Very thin.  Will work for a beach bag and I am not returning them since they are gifts, but I would not buy more unless they get the shipping down to an acceptable level.  $8 for this bag is WAYYYY too much for the quality delivered.
