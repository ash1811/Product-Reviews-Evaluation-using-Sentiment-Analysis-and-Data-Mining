I purchased these shoes because I have neuropathy in my feet. I imagined that the innersole having the rubbber spikes would be good for blood circulation. I was wrong, they were terribly painful. I was going to give them to my daughter who loves sandals and she gave them back to me saying they were too painful. I then asked my granddaughter who is 11 to try them and she had the same problem. All along I thought it was me. Others in the reviews raved about them. Sorry I couldn't join your praise.
