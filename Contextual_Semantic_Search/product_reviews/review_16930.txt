I had a pair which lasted for over 15 years!!  Finally cracked this spring so I ordered a new pair.  I am at the gym by 5:30 a.m. five days a week and the weather here in Southern Maine/NH border can change very quickly.  I hate wet, cold feet and these boots keep me warm and give good traction.  I have received quite a few compliments and I've a friend who ordered a pair.  I also ordered a pair for my husband as a Christmas gift.  Great seller fabulous product!!
