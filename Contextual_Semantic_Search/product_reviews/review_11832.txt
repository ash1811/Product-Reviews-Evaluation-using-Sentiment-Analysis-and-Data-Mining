I was really hoping these would be great shoes but they&#8217;re not.  They seem well made but the sizing is really off.  In fact it&#8217;s so off I didn&#8217;t even try and re-order because I have no idea what size.  I do understand shoe sizing and I am one of those &#8220;spend money on your footwear&#8221; people.  These seemed like a deal but they were so slim and long I don&#8217;t know whose feet fit them.
