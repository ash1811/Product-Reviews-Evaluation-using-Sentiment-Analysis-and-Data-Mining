These work perfectly in my Lowa hiking boots (Zephyr model). The boots run a little small so the high volume insoles made things a little bit too tight. These have a medium amount of cushioning at 1.6mm (some other SOLE insoles, including some I have, are 3.2mm). I can tell a difference.These insoles are supportive without feeling overly aggressive. I even got them completely soaked with water when it thunderstormed and after air drying in front of a simple fan for a day they appear as new. Actually, even when wet they still appeared (and functioned) perfect.I did not heat them in the oven to mold them. I just trimmed a little, stuck them in the boots, and went for it.
