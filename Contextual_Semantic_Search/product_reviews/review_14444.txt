I ordered these to replace an older pair that needed to be donated. I absolutely love how these fit. They stretch out with time so order your true size and force yourself to have a break in period. I had no issues of authenticity like others have stated (remember Jack Rogers have different inscriptions/signatures on the sole for the different styles of shoes and these Navajo Hamptons have always looked this way so I am unsure of what other reviewers are talking about). I have already purchased a second pair in gold and had no issues with those either. Well worth the money as you can dress them up or down. They will last a long time too. Thanks Amazon as always!
