I will say the belt it's just fine, the material it's very soft so it feel comfy, but don't see a remarkable plastic area as described by others, anyway I pack it with some plastic zipper bags to protect the documents and keep away the money of sweat, to avoid that horrible smell of the wet money. I will recommend it if you are looking for an inexpensive solution, otherwise, try a different one.
