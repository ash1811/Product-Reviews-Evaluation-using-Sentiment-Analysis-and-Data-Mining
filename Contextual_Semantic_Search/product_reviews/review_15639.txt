I was first disappointed in the stiffness of the so called soft fabric,  Compared to Faconnable jacket I bought years ago it is like paper compared to velvet.  I also notice the XL seemed a little smaller.  The finish of the fabric had scratches on it too.  But for only 60 dollars it's an OK jacket but I probably won't be buying cloths online anytime soon again.  I was hoping for a bit better than this from Amazon.
