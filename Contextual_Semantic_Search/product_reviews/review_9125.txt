Bought two different sizes, but on both pair, my thighs bulge out as if I'm wearing yoga pants.  I don't have thunder thighs nor do I have chicken legs.  They are athletic and muscular legs with very little fat.  You really need to be thin and lanky for this pair to look good on you.  Also the material isn't your typical jean material.  Quite thin and stretchy.  Not unlike your typical yoga pants that ladies wear.  There is also the danger of male cameltoe appearance unless that is the intended effect you are going after.  Not for me. I've seen the picture of the members of Journey taken together sporting ill fitting and tight contraption like jeans from the late 70's.  We've gone past that.  Steve Perry is gone from the band and so should his fashion sense from the 70's.
