These Columbia Tango thongs are super nice and comfy.  They are comparable to other companies' nicest thong offerings, including the Teva Katavi, Merrell Tortugus, and even the Teva Jetter thong.Of these, I would say that the Teva Jetter is the plushest, softest, and most cushiony of them all, but the Tango is not far behind.  The Tango is trimmed in leather on both the footbed and the straps, making it instantly comfortable.  I love the quilted, padded arch support, and in that regard this is the best of them all.The sole has some large, sturdy lugs on the bottom and these thongs are comfortable enough to walk/stand in them all day.  This thong has my highest recommendation and is a very good value at the current Amazon prices.
