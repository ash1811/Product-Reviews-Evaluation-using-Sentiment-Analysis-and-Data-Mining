These are a good product and wear well.  I wear them on my property doing a number of chores including tending our goat herd.  They are comfortable and provide plenty of pockets.  The only criticism was that I ordered a 30" inseam and received a 36" inseam.  Not a deal breaker, I just cut 5" off.  Also, the ones I received were not a light blue, they were dark blue.  Not a problem for me, but could be for someone wanting a light blue pair.
