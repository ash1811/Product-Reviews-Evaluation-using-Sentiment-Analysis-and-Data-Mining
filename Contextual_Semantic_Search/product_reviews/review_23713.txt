The actual product is rather comfortable. Like other reviewers I have found that there is some stretch in the legs after wearing them for more than a few hours. I find that the product does return to fitting properly again after rewash.**Note that assorted color is more than assorted greys. I received 1 tan,1 dark blue, 1 medium blue, and one red.
