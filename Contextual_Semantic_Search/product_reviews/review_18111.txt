I was looking for a sneaker-feel on a pair of flats that I could still wear with nice slacks, but that isn't what this product is. I am on my feet for my entire shift at my job, and while these shoes can coordinate with jeans, they are inappropriate for anything more formal. I still wear them, but I wish they were more versatile. But if that is what you are looking for, you're good to go.
