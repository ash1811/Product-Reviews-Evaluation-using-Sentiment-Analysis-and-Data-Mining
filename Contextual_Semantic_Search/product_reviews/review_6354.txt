Both my husband and I wanted a navy blue sweatshirt but the colors were picked over after Xmas. Hanes had the navy in our sizes so we decided to try them out since my husband has worn the underwear with no problem. Well these have the strangest sizing imaginable. Body was too large yet short and the neck was so small you could barely get it over your head. If I'd only ordered one I'd have thought it was just that one but both sizes had the same issues. Buyer beware!!!!! Stick to their underwear.
