Purchased these shoes at the end of September. There are cracks on the top of both shoes after barely a month of use. I don't subject them to a lot of wear and tear; I work at a desk. This is the second straight pair of Skechers that have lasted me barely a month. Suffice it to say I will never purchase Skechers again.
