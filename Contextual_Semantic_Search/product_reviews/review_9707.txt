I bought these for my great niece who is going through socks like crazy.  She's not quite 7 months old, but has big feet (closer to 9 month size).  I guess she got her daddy's feet.  According to her parents these fit.  We'll see how long it takes her to outgrow them.  She's starting to pull herself into a standing position so the non-skid should be helpful.  Nice bright colors too.  I would recommend them.
