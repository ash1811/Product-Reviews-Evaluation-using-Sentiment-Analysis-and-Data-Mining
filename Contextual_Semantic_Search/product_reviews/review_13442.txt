I have had several front pocket wallets, but they were limited to two or three cards and nothing else.  This wallet is smaller then most, but can hold upto eight cards or various ids and credit cards plus a few bucks and still is wearable and keeps things in order.  It is well made, I have ordered an additional one, just in case something were to happen to the one I had.
