This is a great quality backpack. After watching my school age child go through 1 to 2 backpacks a year I decided to spend a little more money for a better one. This JanSport is holding up great. It's well padded at the shoulders so it's comfortable to carry and it fits a lot of books and folders. The zippers are easy to pull and don't snag. There are several pockets to help organize things. It's a good investment.
