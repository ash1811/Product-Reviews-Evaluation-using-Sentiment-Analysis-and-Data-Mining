I've been suffering with some serious back injuries these past 7 years and my survival skills are lacking. I wanted a pack with a waist strap and this one has it. I've put maybe 15 lbs of stuff in it to test how it sits on body and because of the strap system, I can adjust how the weight is distributed taking pressure off of some sensitive areas.My background is in the Fire Service and I wanted to slowly build a survival type system that also will have a practical use on my good days just to enjoy the Rocky MOuntains. You never know, we did have a Solar Flare happen last week which got slight coverage on the news as it did disrupt cells and other devices. It's better to be safe than sorry.This pack is very nice. It's something I would've loved to have cutting line on a 16 hour day way back when.Others have made some really proper and accurate reviews so there's really nothing to add except that I agree with the 4 and 5 star reviews!Oh, I' also killing 2 birds with 1 pack. Instead of spending $100 in baggage fees on my upcoming plane trip, I decided to go with the carry-on and back-pack option and send my liquids a week ahead of time. I'd rather have something to show for the money rather than give it to overpriced pain in the az airlines. This pack is under the 45 linear inches and it also conforms with most airlines carry-on (45 linear inches) plus having a big back pack rule.
