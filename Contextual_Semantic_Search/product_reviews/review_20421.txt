I bought these pj's just for the bottoms.  I gave the top to my gal.  These are just like wearing long panties.  If you like the feel of panties on your skin, these are the bomb.  There is plenty of room up front for us guys.  They are a bit sheer.  Ladies, you probably should not wear these in front of the kids without a robe on.  Sunlight really makes them sheer.  It also may be this color that is a bit more see through.  I am very happy with this purchase and look forward to wearing these a long time.
