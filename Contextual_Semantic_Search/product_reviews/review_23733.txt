I am just so disappointed in how short the tops are.  Yes, I am tall and a plus size.  However, I read and read and re-read reviews on uniforms.  I was use to ordering from one stop shop which is a company that sells for places like Catherine's, Roman's and Lane Bryant,  The 4X you purchase from somewhere like Romans or Catherine's is NO where close to a 4X in these scrubs.  These scrubs run so much smaller than the plus size clothing line of clothes.  Ladies, just be aware and know that you may read how these run large and fit as expected but most of these comments are not coming from someone needing a plus size uniform.
