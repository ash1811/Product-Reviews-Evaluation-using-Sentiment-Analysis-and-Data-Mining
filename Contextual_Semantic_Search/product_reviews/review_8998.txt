THE BEST REAL JEANS! Shrink to Fit 501 Levis are what I have worn all my 50 years. These are the bad-ass original jeans that I love. Went to a well known (higher class) department store where I found them retailing for $86 dollars??? Then I went to a lower affordable Super retail store and they were $64??? I love Amazon. $47 out the door as a Prime shipping member. That means, I received them in less than 48 hours. YOU DA MON AMAZON!!!
