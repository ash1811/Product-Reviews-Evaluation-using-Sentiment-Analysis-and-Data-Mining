My normal  tee shirt size is xxl, but after they (different brand) have  been worn and washed repeatedly the neck stretches out. I like to keep my neck mostly covered to hide a scar so I bought these cheepo t's  at the smallest size and made them into dickies  I say cheepo's but they are good quality t's. When I need more of my normal size I would buy these..
