The shipping on these was super fast but I was disappointed when I got them. The lenses are too close together. The nose bridge is very short so these make me look like a fly. They are great for sun because they are super dark. They are fashionable and seem to be sturdy glasses, but they are just too close. My face is too big for them. I will use them in a pinch, but I will order something a bit more spaced out.
