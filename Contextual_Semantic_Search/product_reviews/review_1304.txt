These seem to be great overall quality, and fit just like expected.  Just thought I'd add that the &#34;slip on/off&#34; factor in these comes together really well. Some lace-less shoes end up getting a bit weird when you actually try to just kick them on, these don't roll or jam up on your foot, the elastic lets them slide on nicely.
