I have been buying Gold Toe socks for many years. One reason is that few manufacturers make over-the-calf socks, but fortunately this first-class company does. Note to buyers: &#34;Wool&#34; means 50% wool, 49% nylon, and 1% spandex. I trust their judgment that this is the right combination to make a quality sock. FYI if you run into &#34;Silver Toe&#34; socks, be advised that they are the identical socks re-branded for stores like Macys. A marketing blunder because the logical assumption is that a &#34;silver&#34; product is a notch below a &#34;gold&#34; product.
