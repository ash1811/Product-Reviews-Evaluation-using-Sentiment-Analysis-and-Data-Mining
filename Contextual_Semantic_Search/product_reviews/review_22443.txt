Very good looking and quite massive watch in my opinion.  Not for those who do not like heavy watches.Accuracy so far has been in the +15 seconds per day range.  I believe that this is good performance for a mechanical watch but it does not come close to matching what a good Quartz watch can do as I have two Seiko Quartz watches that are holding to less than 1 second per month error.At the price with the two straps and pin removing tools I consider it to be a excellent buy.
