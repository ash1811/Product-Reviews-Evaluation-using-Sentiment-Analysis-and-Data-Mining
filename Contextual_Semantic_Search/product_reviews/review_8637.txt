These are my favorite panties. They fit very perfectly everywhere and low on the hip for my low rise skinny jeans. The material is very stretchy and not the type that will stretch out loose. The price I'd have to say is in the okay to high range given that all panties are usually pretty expensive. I've worn them very often for many months and they have been great. I also wear it to the beach as a bikini which looks great.As always I'll revisit my review if something changes.
