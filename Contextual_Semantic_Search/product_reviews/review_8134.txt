This is a pretty sarong and will do a nice job as a bathing suit cover up.  Note:  I wear a large in dresses and although I can wrap this as a halter dress (as seen on model), I'm not sure the remaining fabric will hold around my neck (due to bust size).  This is not to indicate an issue with the product, just consumer comfort -- so if you happen to be leaning toward plus size, I would suggest ordering one of those sarongs or contacting the seller to make sure you have enough fabric so you are comfortable.  Again, no issue with the sarong, I'll use a safety pin on the tie area.  Nice selection of designs, I'll probably order another one.
