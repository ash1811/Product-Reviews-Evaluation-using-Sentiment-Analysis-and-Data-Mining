great boot for the price. I wear a 10 or 10.5 4E shoe, and the 10.5 fit with plenty of width. one thing i didnt like was the lack of arch support. my flat feet got even flatter, and my ankle really got sore. but i put in some decent orthotics (there's plenty of room for them-the sock liner comes out), and they are fine. i wear them to ride, and they breathe very well; great for a summer cycle boot, and AMAZINGLY LIGHT!
