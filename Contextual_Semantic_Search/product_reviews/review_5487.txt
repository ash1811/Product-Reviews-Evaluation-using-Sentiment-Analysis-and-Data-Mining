I've always loved Dickies pants. They're resilient, wear well and last for-ever. I got 2 pairs (one black, one gray) for my boyfriend as a Christmas present and he loves them. They're comfortable like jeans, but professional enough to wear to work or go out to a nice dinner. And who doesn't love all those pockets?!
