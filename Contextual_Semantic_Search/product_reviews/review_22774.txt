I ordered this one for my son for Xmas 2012. He likes dragons & I've purchased other Dragon shirts for him in the past, they seem to be the only articles of clothing I can buy for him that are above complaint. Let's hope when he opens this one on Christmas Morning my perfect record remains intact! lol! I'll be 5 for 5 then! Wish me luck! Tee graphix are pretty cool & it arrived really quik thank you!
