This one ended up turning out a lot thinner than I expected. After another disappointment with a different seller I had to use this chain. Not only has it proved to be 100% silver, but it is also sturdy and very resistant. I've been wearing for months with a very heavy piece of silver hanging from it and it has proven to have been the best choice I've made in months.
