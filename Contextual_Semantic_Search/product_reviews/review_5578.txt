I wanted another hat to use while I worked in the garden and yard and small orchard that I have.  We have had nearly a month of 100 or more weather and this hat keeps my head cooler than my wide brim straw hat.  It is more breathable covers the ears well, shades the eyes as needed and does not get caught up in the low hanging branches of my fruit trees (or in the confides of the rose garden when weeding). The hat appears sturdy and well made for rough work in my jungle.  The vents again keep my head cooler than my large straw hat.  My fitted baseball cap size is 7 1/8th and I ordered a 7 1/4 and it fits just perfect.  Some complained about the hat been rolled up and stuffed into an envelop when shipped causing creases in the hat/brim.  Easy solution...take it out, spray it with some water (don't soak) and iron it out...two minute job.  Spritz again with a little more water and repeat of needed.  The drawstring/chin strap is sewn in, not looped around the crown and has a small leather adjustment tab...it functions, but a spring loaded plastic "keeper" like some other hats have would be better. There is no inner sweat band which would make a super improvement.  All in all I would not have a problem recommending the Rothco Boonie Hat to anyone.  Lots of choices in colors...I ordered the vintage Vietnam Tiger Stripes to be different.
