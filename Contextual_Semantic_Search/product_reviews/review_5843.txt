I've been using Hanes Tees for five years now. I use them under my long sleeve shirts. Every day, six days a week, for about 12 to 16 hours each day, I wear them. I buy 14 each year and change them; that means I need to wash them almost 26 times each year. At the end of the year, they are good enough to give to charity.With this I tell you the quality of these Tees.
