These are hard to find and somewhat expensive in the department stores. This is the best way to purchase pantyhose. I'm a regular purchaser of these on Amazon. ALL the colors are available unlike a visit to Macy's or Dillard's and Hanes has the best quality and fit of any reasonably priced pantyhose I've tried.
