These glasses work great - Block an appropriate amount of sun and they are very fashionable. Couple things to note:-The 52mm lenses are much smaller than they seem compared to the 55mm. If you have a small face, definitely go with the 52mm.-Expect to see some light from the top or bottom of these glasses - these aren't made to completely block all light.-If you have light colored eyes, I highly suggest getting the polarized version of these glasses.-Also, if you have a narrow face, expect these to fall off if you look down.Overall, I greatly enjoy this product! I would recommend it to anyone.
