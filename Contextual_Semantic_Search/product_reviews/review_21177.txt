This flip flop is great! The straps do not cause blisters and the cushioning of the foot bed is the most comfortable I've ever worn. The fit is perfect. My foot is a B width, but at the wider end, so sometime shoes are a little snug. These are extremely comfortable. I usually wear 7.5, purchased 8 and am happy with the sizing.
