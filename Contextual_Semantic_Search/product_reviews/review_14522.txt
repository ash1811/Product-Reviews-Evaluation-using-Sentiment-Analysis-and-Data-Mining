It was enormous.  Ordered 38M for daughter who wears size 7; the 38 was even too large for me who wears 8 or 8 1/2.  Return was easy with online process and printing of the label.  Unclear if the problem was unisex sizing or if, in fact, Birkenstock runs huge despite the sizing chart.  Their website was of no help.  Yay for Amazon for their return process.
