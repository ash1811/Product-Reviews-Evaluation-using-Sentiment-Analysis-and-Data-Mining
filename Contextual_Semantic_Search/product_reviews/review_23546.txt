I had been looking for Easy Spirit leather walkers to replace ones which I have worn and washed for nearly 8 years.  I couldn't find them in the stores. Finally I found the ones I needed on Amazon.  They are true to size and last a long time.  I had bought another label here on Amazon and didn't really like them, but kept them because I couldn't find the Easy Spirit I truly wanted.  Now I am finally satisfied. Good work, Amazon!!
