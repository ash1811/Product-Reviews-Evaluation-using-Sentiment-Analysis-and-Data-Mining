Shoes for everyday all time highly comfortI have worn only this shoe for over 10 years and will have nothing else. They are at home with casual or dress.Quiet comfort. It's a great slip-onthat incorporates quietness and comfort. I believe the it's styling and cushioned footbed is the ultimate in a comfortable Dress Shoe. Fully padded kidskin leather upper keeps a soft feel and a polished look. it is with styling, instant flexibility and comfort. Leather linings and cushioned footbed. Looks like a Dress Shoe, feels like a Slipper
