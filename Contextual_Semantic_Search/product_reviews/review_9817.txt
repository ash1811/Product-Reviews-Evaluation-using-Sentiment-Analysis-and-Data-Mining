I have to admit I love watches. I have some very expensive ones and I have 3 citizen watches to just wear anywhere. Citizen watches work very well. Better than some ten thousand dollar ones. I am not sure if many people realize this. There are also many brands that sell watches in this price range. With exception to seiko, they do not even come close to the quality of a Citizen.
