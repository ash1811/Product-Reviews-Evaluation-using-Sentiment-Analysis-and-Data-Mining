I have just ordered my third watch like this.  They last about 2 years, and my second one isn't dead yet, but the top right corner display is starting to disintegrate and I don't want to be without one.  I am not complaining about the two year lifespan because I wear it ALL the time. In the shower, windsurfing, swimming, etc.  I take some pretty good falls while windsurfing and everything keeps working.  Yes, most of the silver has come off around the face and the face has lots of small scratches on it but the band is fine, the three alarms are great, the chrono is terrific.  In short, I love the features and the style, yes I wish it could take the beating I give it a little longer, but I didn't pay that much for it.That being said, I am sticking with the black band even though I like the other colors.  Lighter colors get grungy.  Also, I agree with the person who said they would like to just have the plain gray resin around the face.Also, I love that Amazon tells me when I last bought the watch, when I go to order a new one.  Thanks, Amazon!
