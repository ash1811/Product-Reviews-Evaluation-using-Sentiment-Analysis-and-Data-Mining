Bought this for the gym- fits my sneakers and my gym clothes, along with my other clothes, a water bottle, and even a small purse.I thought there would be other compartments in the bag but there wasnt. A little disappointed in that, but for the price its a nice size bag to fit everything and it also fits in my gym locker.
