I usually wear a 7.5 or 8 medium, ordered the 8 and it fit perfectly.  It holds on my heel enough to walk like a shoe and stays on my foot.  It is extremely comfortable and works well when I am going to be on my feet alot walking around on tours.  I have worn with both with light socks and without socks and it still hugs my heel.  I am very happy with this purchase and recommend the shoe.
