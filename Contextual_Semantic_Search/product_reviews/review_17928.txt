These socks are okay, but it doesn't take long for them to wear out on the bottom. Why ALL sock makers don't make their socks with thicker material/weave on the soles/toes, I will never know! This is not exactly rocket-science is it? This is like planned obsolescence for socks - or perhaps just manufacturing stupidity. Either way, I don't like it, and I will be purchasing socks in future that are designated as having thicker soles/toe sections.
