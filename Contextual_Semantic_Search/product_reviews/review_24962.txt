These boots are way more comfortable than they look. Make sure you order them wide enough as they seem to run narrow: I wear a medium but ordered the E2 size and felt only slightly wider than a medium. Very shiny high gloss leather. Slippery soles so not good on ice or snow. I will try to switch out the laces from the flat cotton to a dressier waxed type.
