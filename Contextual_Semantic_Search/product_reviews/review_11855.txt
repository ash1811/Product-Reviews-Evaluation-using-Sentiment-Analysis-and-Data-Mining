I have two pair of these stiff narrow classic loafers and and working on breaking them in to where they are comfortable. They are well made and had they been wide enough would be a true classic for me. Right now it is a case of seeing how they wear as I seek to break them in ... here's hoping they can broaden their horizons ...
