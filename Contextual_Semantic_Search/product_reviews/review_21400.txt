I got this bra because I hurt my shoulder and traditional bras hurt. I am not overly large breasted, but I need the back and shoulder support because of injury. I decided to try this bra out. While I love the back support it is lacking in front support. And it is some what itchy but nothing I cannot ignore. After retireing this bra to my drawer I pulled it out again to give it another try. I decided to slide some underwire in it from another bra, wow what a difference. The bra now fits perfectly. I have awesome front and back support!
