I was a little burned up about the cost of shipping on this item, but now that I have the tool and have used it a couple times, I am over that.This tool is great for swapping watch bands.  It makes the task quick and painless.The tool is much sturdier than I expected for the price and I see it lasting a lifetime for someone not employed in watch repair, so long as I do not loose it.
