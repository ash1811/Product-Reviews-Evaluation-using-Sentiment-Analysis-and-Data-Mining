After over a year, these flip flops have still held up. They are very comfortable and last a long time.However, take note that these types of shoes will not withstand the blades of a lawnmower.Other than that they are very well-built shoes.Five stars because the shoes came quickly and are of a good quality.Edit: It's been almost two years now and the shoes are showing very little signs of wear. The Rainbow stamp is still mostly visible on the sole. Still very comfortable.
