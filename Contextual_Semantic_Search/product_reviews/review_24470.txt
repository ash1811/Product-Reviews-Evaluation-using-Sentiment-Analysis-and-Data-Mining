I'm so glad I ordered these flip flops. They are the most comfortable flops I've ever owned. No rubbing between my toes or on top of my foot. I wish I had discovered these sooner. They are very shock absorbent so the'd be perfect for anyone with knee and or back issues. I will definitely purchase more of these in the future.
