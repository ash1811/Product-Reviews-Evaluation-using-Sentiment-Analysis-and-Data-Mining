I have two pairs of these, and like the fact that they don't reveal a panty line, but they tend to run a bit tight and small, and don't have much stretch to them.  I prefer the Maidenform Flirty Tanga, which is cotton and a bit stretchier.  Since comfort can be a matter of personal preference, though, I'd suggest buying a pair in a few styles to see which pair is most comfy before stocking up on them.Overall, I'd give these 3 1/2 stars.
