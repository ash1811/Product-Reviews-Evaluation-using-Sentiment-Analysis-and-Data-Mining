The model I purchased was described as a 'small' size. But I can't imagine what a medium or large bag would be.  I doubt that I'd easily fit this bag in the locker of a spa I sometimes go to.  I'm certain that I'll have to empty everything out, and collapse the bag before it would fit in the locker. And the material has a 'cheap nylon' feel.  It would be fine for storing a lot of items in the floor of your closet, or if you were planning to take a trip around the world and needed to carry as much clothing, etc. as possible.  But it's just too massive for a quick trip to the gym.
