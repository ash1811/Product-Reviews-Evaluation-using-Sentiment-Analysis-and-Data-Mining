Not much else to say about this watch really.  However, one plus that goes over looked is the fact that it has screw bars instead of spring bars.  This is a real plus in my opinion and makes this watch a real keeper.  It actually wears thinner and a tad smaller than the typical 6900s which is odd to me but I've never had one malfunction with it.
