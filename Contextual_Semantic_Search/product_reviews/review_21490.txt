My son (3yrs) had the Thomas Boots ("Choo Choo boots") last year and has worn them out completely! The Fireman boots will be a Christmas present this year and will replace his old Choo Choo boots. Once he figured out he could get in and out of them himself - he slips them on all the time and wears them year-round! They did not do well when he went puddle jumping - "note to self - put rain pants over boots" - they filled with water from him splashing it in from the tops!!! Simple rookie parenting mistake!!! After one year they still fit - upsized them on purchase - larger didn't matter to him he could kick them off real easy! The backs split recently - but these were heavily used - I just taped them up and they are good as new! He will love the Fireman Boots!!!
