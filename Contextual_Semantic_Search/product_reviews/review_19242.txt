It's hard to buy a bandanna these days, as they tend to be crappy.  This was takes a few washings to soften up, like most of them do, but end up soft and don't bleed in the process.  Not the highest quality, but not a piece of junk either.  I use it around my neck when I ride my motorcycle, and it's great for that.  A bit small for around my head, but I also have a head the size of a zeppelin.
