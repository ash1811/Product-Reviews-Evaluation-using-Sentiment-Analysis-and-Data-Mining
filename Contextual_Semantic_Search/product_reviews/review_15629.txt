We just took our little one out for her first Halloween party. People loved her in the costume and got Princess Leia right away. We did not use the head piece which is awkwardly and cheaply made. It is not good at all. But the robe is a lightweight fleece material with velcro closures. We got the 6 to 12 month. Our daughter is 13 months old but very small for her age. It felt well except the arms were too long. But I think it was size appropriate.The velcro makes it easy to take on and off. Get some white tights, white shoes, and try to make your child's hair look as much like Princess Leia as you can. Because the head piece is, sadly, very poorly done. 1 star on the heaf piece.
