I've always liked Jansport brand backpacks.  They weigh absolutely nothing and this is kind to my back and the extra padding in the straps is nice, too.  The material and stitching is always far superior to other brands.I love the new fabrics they are making these out of!  I got the Black Tattoo Love and simply adore it.  I can feel the eyes on my backpack when I go out in public.  It's cool to have a unique backpack.
