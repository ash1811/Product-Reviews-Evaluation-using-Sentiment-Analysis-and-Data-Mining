Make sure you order about 10 sizes larger than what you need. These are meant to be warn over other layers of clothing so you need to take in account for that. I wear a size 36 waist so I got a 46 and it fits great over jeans with thermals underneath. Fits great also over just jeans. Like all Carhartt products its warm and durable. I highly recommend it for anyone working out in cold conditions. It keeps you warm in sub zero windy conditions
