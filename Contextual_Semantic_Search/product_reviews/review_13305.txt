These are the perfect size for every face type and practically every size of face.  I have a smaller, heart face and I looked really, really good in these!!  But I bought these for my boyfriend who has a wider, square face with a broad jaw.  He still looked amazing in them too.  And I love the mirrored lenses.  Not as intense as I expected, but still very apparent.
