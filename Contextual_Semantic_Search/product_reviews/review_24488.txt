Got this for my husband and he loves it! It fits great. It was a little hard to wedge the horns in all the way but he finally did it and now they stay in perfectly. Did not have to assemble the helmet like some mentioned - just had to stick the horns in. Nice comfortable fit but very hot inside! We may poke holes at the very top for ventilation if it gets too hot.
