The fit is slightly tight for my normal size, so maybe order 1 size up. They are very durable, but not all that comfortable. A lot of pet hair also clings to these. Looks strange walking around with tons of cat hair clinging tto your pants... have never had that issue before. (Plenty of shirts that do that, never pants.) Honestly I would recommend looking elsewhere, but they aren't terrible.
