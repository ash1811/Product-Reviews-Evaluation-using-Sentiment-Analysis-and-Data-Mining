I purchased these shoe trees to replace some that I lost in a house fire.  These fit perfectly in both my loafers and lace-up dress shoes.  They also smell terrific.  I'm looking forward to having these prolong the life of my shoes as my old ones have.  Plus, no need for shoe deodorizer when you leave these in your shoes over night.
