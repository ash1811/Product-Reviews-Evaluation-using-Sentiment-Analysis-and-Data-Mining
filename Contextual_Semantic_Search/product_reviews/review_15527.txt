I have twin baby boys and I've learned not to go cheap on the bodysuits.  Last time I got a 5 pack for $10, it was the Leveret brand and they were terrible.  Carter's makes decent ones, and good price if you can get them on sale.  These are better.  SOFT (as soft as the other reviews promise) and even better, a thick but breathable fabric.  Reinforced snaps.  Reinforced stitching on the hems.  Some reviews complain about the neck being too wide.  I opened it up and saw what they meant, but when I actually put it on my babies, they were fine.  I'll add a picture to show.  I got the 18-month ones and, even at 11 months, they fit fine, with lots of room to grow.  I'll definitely buy another pack!Edit: picture of the (slightly) lighter twin: http://i.imgur.com/lbxQXw6.jpg
