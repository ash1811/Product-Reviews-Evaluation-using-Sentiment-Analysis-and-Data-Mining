I had just about given up on Skechers before I purchased this pair. They fit well, ordered my regular size. They are quite wide for a medium width in the toe bed, keeping the laces really tight has helped some, thus the 4 stars,  I am keeping them despite being too wide,  as I love the really cushy sole, I really needed that because of a bad Achilles. If they came in narrow I would order a couple of back up pairs.
