I may have ordered a size too small for these, but they still fit me. They're a little snug, but I read that the leather in Sperry shoes expands and conforms to your foot. Since I usually use these for the created purpose, they sounded like a no-brainer. They look nice, wear good, and grip great on deck. I'd recommend them.
