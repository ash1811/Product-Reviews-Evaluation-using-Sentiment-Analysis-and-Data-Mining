This antiqued chain is one of the best I've ordered. That's because it is attractive looking, with visual interest due to the &#34;popcorn&#34; cast links. Also, unlike many 2mm chains, it has a slim hoop on the end to fit the lobster-claw type clasp. Some 2-4 mm chains have very large circular loops, which will only pass through a few pendants with very large openings-this one will fit nearly any pendant because of the narrower loop end. Another really good feature, which I like, is that I don't need to be concerned about constant tarnishing, because of the darker finish. One thing of note, you need fairly small fingers, or patient dexterity to unlock the clasp. But that's a minor issue some men with larger hands might experience. Overall, really sharp & practical.
