Okay, did I read the reviews about this u'wear before buying it? Yes. I was impressed with all the positive feedback so thought I'd buy hubby a pair just to see if he'd like them. He's definitely not a world traveler, or a hiker or a mountain climber but he enjoys a comfortable pair of underpants and these fill the bill. Now you can believe me or not, but we've been married for a long time and when these arrived I had to explain what the &#34;big deal&#34; was about them. Wash and wear, dry in an hour, feel great, no smelly's, so I told him all of that and would you believe he wears them and then washes them out in the sink!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I told him they couldn't go into the dryer. He tosses them over the towel rack to dry. Of course, I usually put them away in his drawer so he can find them next time. He'd forget where they were! Anyway, I chose black as the color. The fit is true to size. I will wait until Valentine's Day and then order another pair. Definitely more useful than a frilly card or a box of chocolates.
