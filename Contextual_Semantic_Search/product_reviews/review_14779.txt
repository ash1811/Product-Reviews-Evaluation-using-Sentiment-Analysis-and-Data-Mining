I have been wearing this brand for years and have always loved these slippers.  They are comfortable, relatively long lasting, washable and even allow you to put a gel heel cushion inside if you need cushion support.  The price is reasonable, and I appreciate having the soft rubber sole so you don't slip on wood or tile floors!
