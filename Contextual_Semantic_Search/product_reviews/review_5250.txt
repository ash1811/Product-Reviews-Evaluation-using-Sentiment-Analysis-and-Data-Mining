I do not have to roll up the cuffs!!!  That is a first for me, it fits the way I expected and is not too tight or loose any where, I have now purchased them in 5 different colors.The denim has an AWFUL  smell that take several washings to get out. I did not find that the other colors had that smell.Don't know what that smell is but it kind of gags you as you open the packaging, that definitely has to be addressed!
