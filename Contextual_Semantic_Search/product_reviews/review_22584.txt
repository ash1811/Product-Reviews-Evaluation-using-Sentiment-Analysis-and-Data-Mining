I've owned the watch for 3 months and worn it every day. Just today I swapped out the band for a 4$ WalMart black 1-piece (similar to the maratac ones). I'm glad I switched bands. I tried to live with it after reading all the negative reviews, but it was sort of getting on my nerves. As you've probably read before, the metal grommets are too large, so 1 eyelet will be too loose, leading to the watch "leaning" away from the center of your wrist. And the next one will be too tight. The watch has been very accurate. It's comfortable for being a metal piece. The illumination is awesome. I am someone who has always worn Casio or Timex's, and this glow is so much better. Just stepping outside for a minute in cloudy weather is enough to make it glow pretty bright. Another great thing is that it is completely silent. You can't hear the ticking at all.The only cons I can see with this watch is you have to occasionally readjust the date; and of course the band.
