I didn't get the color I wanted, or it looks different in person than online, but the jacket is awesome. It is very light weight, fits great and really keeps the rain out! I have been very happy. I live in a place where it rains a lot but isn't necessarily cold so the light weight aspect fits. Once it is colder I can fit a warm sweater underneath.
