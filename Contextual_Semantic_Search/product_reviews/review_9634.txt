I'm a skinny guy (5'10, 145), and have tried several companies' versions of slim fit boot cut.  The exact same size of Lucky and Levi's I've been quite happy with.  These looked like a bargain and had good reviews, so I gave them a shot.Denim: Thick, strong fabric, more so than I'm used to.  Maybe useful when you get kicked by a horse, but also difficult to move in and smashes your package uncomfortably.  I'm not kidding when I say you have to peel yourself off your leg when you take a whiz.Pockets: like a good wife, tight and small in the front.  If you manage to cram your wallet in there, good luck getting it out again.Cut:  Sits high so you look like a character out of Cool Hand Luke if your shirt is off.  Traditional I guess, and you'll be as fashionable as any hick in the hills.And heck if the button doesn't dig into your belly when you sit.
