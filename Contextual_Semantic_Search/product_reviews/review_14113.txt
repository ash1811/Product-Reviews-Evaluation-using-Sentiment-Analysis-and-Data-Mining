Jeans are jeans. They're blue, have zips, have pockets, and have seams on the sides. For a poor jean connoisseur like me, these are some very excellent jeans: they're cheap, they fit, and they fit my definition of jeans.This pair's strongest suit is its price, being at half of what you'd pay for some other brand. They are however a little on the thin fabric side, so don't be expecting a great deal of thermal insulation from wearing them. If you're the athletic type with some very defined thighs you're going to find the standard size a little on the tight side.If I was to recommend another product over this one, it'd be the cheap $15 jeans you can find at a Target store; the two pairs I purchased two years ago still serve me faithfully now. If however you're in my condition (no nearby cheap store), then these aren't that bad a deal. Do buy one size larger though, as those will fit much more comfortably.
