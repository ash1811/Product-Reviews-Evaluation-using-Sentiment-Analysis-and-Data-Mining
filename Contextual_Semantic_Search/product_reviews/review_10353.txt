I got this shirt for my husband because it seemed pretty cheap. I guess you get what you paid for. The material of this shirt was very ROUGH, he did not like it at all. Also the shirt is not true to size (I think!). The medium seem so big, I even took that shirt and measured it against other medium shirts that my husband has and it still seemed pretty big (by big- I mean wide). He is skinny so that might have affected a little bit, but I still I do no think it is completely true to size. I do not recommend this product. Don't let the price catch you! I rather pay $10 more and get a decent shirt made with a soft material.
