I love the look of these shoes and was so hoping the fit would be great...not so. I ordered a (92A) and the left shoe wasso long, couldn't believe it; the right shoe fit great. So I decided to order a 81/2(2A)...just received them. I couldn't believe it--they don't fit either...left shoe still too long & too wide and right shoe doesn't fit--too wide.I have trouble finding narrow shoes that are affordable and attractive so am very disappointed. I'm wondering if there wasa problem in production and therefore were cheaper???
