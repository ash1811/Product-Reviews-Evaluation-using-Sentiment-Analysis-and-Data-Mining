Dickies Carpenter Jeans are a good, serviceable pair of work jeans. They are well made and fairly comfortable. I still prefer the Lee brand, however, and for the difference in cost I'll continue to use them instead. If the few dollars you save are important, then you will be OK. If you get them on sale, go for it.
