Accidentally got the large. Way too big. I'm normally a 33&#34; waist. Sent back for exchange but had to be refunded. Be aware, when something that shipped free is returned, they refund you minus a shipping charge. So I lost about $8. No biggie, cuz it was my fault, but I'll be more particular about clothing on Amazon.
