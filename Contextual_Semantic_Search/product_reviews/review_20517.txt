My two year old niece has fallen in love with horses but is an only child and has almost everything imaginable!  I remember being a little child and loving the music box that I had so figured this would be the ideal gift for her.  Not only is the character adorable, there are lots of little storage compartments and the music doesn't sound "tinny".  I doubt this will become a family heirloom, but she is mesmerised by the movement and loves to keep her little precious things locked away.
