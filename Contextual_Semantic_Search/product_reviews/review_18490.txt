These Ugg slippers are very sharp looking! The black leather is a classy look. They even look good with jeans...almost like a casual dress shoe.They are very comfortable, very warm and fit true to size.As always, with Ugg brand, they are made very well and I expect them to last a very long time. We have over 20 pairs of Uggs in our house between myself, my 2 teen daughters, a teen son and my husband. The men of the house love them as much as the women. My son also has these in the classic chestnut color. They are just so versatile. You can wear them indoors or out and they are great for either occasion.
