Great looking, great fitting, and great wearing shoe. Oh, and GREAT price. I like these so much I have 3 pair. One pair did develop a tear along the underside where the seam meets the sole. But I'm tough on shoes, so I don't know precisely if I did it, or if it was a defect in the show. But the other two pair have held up great. I get a lot of compliments on these White Oxfords. I wash these prior to wearing, and let them dry at room temp. They fit and wear perfect. I'm 55, 6', 180, and rotate shoes every other day. I highly recommend these if you are looking for a quality walking or running show without breaking the bank. Look great with jeans and a sport coat.
