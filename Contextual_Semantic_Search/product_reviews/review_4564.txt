Made tough to handle all types of work, a bit stiff when new, just need some breaking in. gotta love the double knee's added material and these have nice wide straight construction, so it isn't tight on your ankles so I can wear them with my boots or with my skateboard sneakers without those ugly tight ankle width that gets caught on the tops of your shoes.
