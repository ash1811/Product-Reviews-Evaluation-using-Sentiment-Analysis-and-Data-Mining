I LOVE these socks!  My preschool-aged son had a pair last winter for sledding and outdoor fun, but we lost 1 sock.  This year, I returned to purchase 2 more pairs to prepare for this year's winter adventures!  These socks are super-warm and lightweight.  They are not the bulky, heavy wool socks of our childhoods!
