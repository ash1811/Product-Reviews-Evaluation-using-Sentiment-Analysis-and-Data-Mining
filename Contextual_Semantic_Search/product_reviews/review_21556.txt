I use to purchase the Bloch ballet tights for my daughter, but each pair would snag, run, or get a hole in them after very little wear.  I just assumed that Bloch tights would be of good quality because of the Bloch dance shoes that I buy are made well and my daughter loves them.I eventually decided to buy the Danskin brand for her a few years ago and I have been extremely satisfied. They are the perfect color, the perfect weight, and most important, they do not run.  If she does get a hole in them, it's because she got them caught on to something that snagged them or tore them.  She loves these tights! They are very well made and I highly recommend them.  By the way, the sizing is pretty accurate.  My daughter is 5ft 2in and she wears the AB size.You will not be disappointed with these tights!
