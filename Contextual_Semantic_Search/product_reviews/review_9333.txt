I like the snug fit of the boot part, but I'm just not happy with the soles. The rubber soles are kind of floppy and if I don't pick my feet up pretty high when I walk, I end up tripping. Guess I'm going to have to quit doing the Stockade Shuffle and do some real marching when I have these slippers on.My physical therapist told me I should walk around the house barefoot. That's not likely to happen -- with a dog and cat residing with us, the floor would leave my soles dirty all the time. I must admit, the rubber soles on these boots do allow me that "grip" he wants me to feel when I walk.Update on my review - 05/17/12These Moon Boots have become my favorite slippers now that I have learned to walk... LOL... instead of shuffling like I do with the slide slippers I own. They are pretty terrific and I can't believe that my feet stay warm even though the soles are thin and the uppers are not a heavy terry cloth but stretchy and very substantial.
