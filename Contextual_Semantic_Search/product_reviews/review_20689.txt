As advised by Wrangler, I ordered a size smaller than I usually take.  They fit great everywhere except the waist, it is about1 to 2 inches too small, however, with a waist stretcher I think I can make them work as the next size larger will be too large in all the other places.  I like the fabric and other than the waist, they look great.
