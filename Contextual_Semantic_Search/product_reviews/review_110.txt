I travel 3 weeks a month and carry 2 50 lb bags everywhere I go.  I have been using this strap for a couple months now to pull both bags together and it works awesome.  I wouldn't go back to traveling without it and the convenience for the price is great.I can even get both bags, when piggybacked, on an escalator and the strap is strong enough to hold the second bag in the air without snapping or anything.
