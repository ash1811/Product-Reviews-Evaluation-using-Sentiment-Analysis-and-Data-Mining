These are an OK value for the price, but they only lasted 3 or 4 wearings before they ran.  They don't stay up very well-- a common problem with this type of stocking -- but can easily be used with a garter (which is a sexier look in any case). I prefer sooth top to lace.  I won't order again, but I recommend this seller for inexpensive lingerie that does not need to be too durable.
