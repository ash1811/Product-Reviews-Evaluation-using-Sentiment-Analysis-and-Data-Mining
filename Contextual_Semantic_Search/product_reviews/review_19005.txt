Pros- Cost/value: You wont be crying if something happens to it- Attractive appearance: very simple/modern/stylish, note the case is a polished chrome, not a matte/flat finish you might think from the photo which I'm fine with- Practicality: Numbers large and easy to read, Indiglo, day and date, 10 year battery (supposedly)Cons- Band: its a bit thick and feels like cheap foam or paper, stiff at first, the loops on it are almost paper thin- Noise: The ticking is noticeable when in a quiet room- The Indiglo effect doesnt completely cover the face, looks like they missed the top couple of millimetersOther:- A little smaller than I thought it would be but fits my small wrists- The band is a shade darker than it appears in the photo which I like- Very lightweight you might forget it's there
