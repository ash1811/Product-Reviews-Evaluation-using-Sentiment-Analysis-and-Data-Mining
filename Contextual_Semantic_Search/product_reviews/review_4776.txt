Love em! Warm, comfortable, durable. Like all Men's Carhartt, in my experience, these shirts run big; Med. fit what's usually a 2X, and small what's usually a LG, and they do not shrink. Perfect for outdoor winter work in combination w/ my Active Duck Jacket. Ordered one for a friend as a gift,  he loves it. Green looks great, deep color. I highly recommend, just order down a size or so.
