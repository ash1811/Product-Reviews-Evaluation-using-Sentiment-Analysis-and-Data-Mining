I bought these for my boyfriend and when he first saw them he got the "what ugly thing did you buy for me on Amazon?" look on his face....but then he tried them on and now he wears them every night!  I bought him the large size, his shoe size is around a ten usually....they fit perfect and as I said he loves them!
