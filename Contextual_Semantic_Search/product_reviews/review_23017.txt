I have owned 3 pairs of these because I wear them out. They are durable shoes though. I ruin all my shoes.. I remember when people said doc martens were indestructible and I destroyed those as well back in high school. These shoes fit GREAT. I have very wide big feet 5E. These don't look super expensive, but they are nice looking casual shoes. Give them a shot. The price ranges from around 60 to 90. Price shop them.
