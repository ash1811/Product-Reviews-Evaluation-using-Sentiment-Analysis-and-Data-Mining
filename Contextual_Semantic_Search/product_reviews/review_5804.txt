I ordered three of these and have worn the kiwi and the brown shirts and they fit me fine.  The length was just about right since I am slightly shorter than normal.  I found them to be a nice weight and they were a little heavier than the Fruit of the Loom t-shirts with the pockets that I ordered from another page from amazon.  I like both styles, though, and will make use of all of them.
