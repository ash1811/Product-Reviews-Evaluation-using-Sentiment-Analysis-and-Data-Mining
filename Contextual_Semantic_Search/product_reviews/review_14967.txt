Good price for work out shirt (or very casual wear) but would not wear for anything else. Fabric is extremely thin (think cheap t-shirt) and VERY boxy-there is absolutely no definition between arm pit and hem (even the really cheap T shirts at discount stores usually have some curve in at the waist so you don't have ~8-10 inches of fabric bunched around your waist).  Sizes seem to run large (and a little long). I ordered what was supposed to be "my" size based on the size chart and it was baggy and too long to tuck in (the one I got hung ~4 inches down my thighs-and I don't have a petite torso), so if you want something more fitted, order a size down.
