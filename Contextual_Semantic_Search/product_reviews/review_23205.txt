I have a wide foot and large calves so I bought a size larger.  Should not have.  They fit my leg well and the wide width made them a little large.  I put an insert and they fit better.  Only problem is they are so soft they are a little floppy when I put them on. Very comfortable.  Don't buy larger than your normal shoe size.
