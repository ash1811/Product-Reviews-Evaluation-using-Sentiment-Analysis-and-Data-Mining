I have used these through one Missouri winter and I don't see how you can slip with these on ice or snow. Held up great. A life saver literally. My brother in law slipped on the ice and he has had 3 back surgeries and is disabled. I saw these on Amazon and I got them the first chance I got after seeing he's horrible luck, Slip on and off easy when you need them to. Otherwise stay on tight for me.  I got the medium's. Size 10.5 to 11 Mens for me.
