I bought this watch while my wife and I were on a cruise down in the Cayman islands about 4 year ago. I had always wanted a nice watch and always settled with Timex, so to step up to a citizen was great. I've had the watch for the past 4 years and it's still in great condition. I love that it's light powered so there is no messing with a battery. It's entertaining to get up in the morning and turn on the light and see the hour and minute hands start spinning to catch up to the current time. I love the technology on this thing.  Not once have I had to adjust the date, replace a battery, or the wrist strap and I wear this thing 5 days a week to work. I've dropped it a few time and even hit it pretty hard on metal cabinets on accident and there are no scratches on the face. It's a great watch, it's a touch watch, I really do love this watch. Highly recommend it.
