I was expecting more after reading the other reviews on this product. First, they fit small for me! I normally wear a 6.5-7, but after reading the other reviews that said these shoes run large, I ordered a 6.5. They were too small (too short and too tight) for my foot. So, I sent them back and got a 7. The length is better, but they're still a little tight. I know they will stretch. Also, the quality just isn't what I expected. I've been wearing them 1-2 times per week for roughly a month, and they already have some frayed fabric. The most annoying thing about these shoes is that the laces WILL NOT stay tied! I'm thinking of gluing or sewing them down it's so bothersome.
