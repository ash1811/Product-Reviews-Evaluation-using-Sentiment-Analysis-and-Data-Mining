This product is extremely sturdy, and has plenty of storage for all types of jewelry. The portable box inside does not lock, but it is perfect for travel. Or you could take the whole box because it closes up into a very portable box, but looks great when it's open as well. The lock is a little cheap, it could be unlocked with a knife, but it does the job. I love this box!!
