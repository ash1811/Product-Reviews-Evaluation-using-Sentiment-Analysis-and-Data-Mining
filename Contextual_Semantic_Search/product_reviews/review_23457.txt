I got this bag as a gift and it's been my travel companion ever since. Its many compartments keep belongings organized and easily accessible, and I always know where everything is. Since compartments are all zippered, everything is secure. Another advantage is that it's discrete enough to double as a handbag (my sling bag is black), so no need to stuff extra weight in my suitcase. The nylon is rugged and resistant, zippers are good quality. I should know: I've been using this bag a lot and not being exactly kind to it.I don't have any clanging zippers, but did find that the adjustable strap keeps slipping through the metal holder (I like the bag at waist length, close to the body, and the strap is long), perhaps because the nylon it is made of is so smooth. I solved this by getting a cheap metal barrette and closing it around the strap right below the holder (it works!). Another interesting aspect is that the bag is a lot more comfortable to carry when slung over the right shoulder -- not made for lefties! I'm a lefty, but this doesn't bother me.
