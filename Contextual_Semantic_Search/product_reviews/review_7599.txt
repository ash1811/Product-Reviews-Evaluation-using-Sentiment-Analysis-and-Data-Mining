I thought these looked clunky and uncomfortable. Also I was reading there was a sizing problem. I took the chance because of the high star rating and I am completely happy I did. They arrive in a box with no weight at all. I was wondering if there were shoes in there. Packed very well. Tried them on and was in heaven. The size was not a problem. It fit perfect. I had to adjust the straps but that was easy. I had no problem walking in them. They are made for feet comfort. I no longer think they look clunky because they look great on the feet. What a keeper! Thanks Dr. Scholls my feet are happy now!
