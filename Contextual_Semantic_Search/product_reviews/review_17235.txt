I wore these shoes about 1/2 a day every couple of days until they were broken in correctly.  Now I still need a shoehorn to put them on, and they fit comfortably all day with no danger of slipping off.The color is a nice shade of brown, and althought the toe is more square than I like, they look good.  I wear them to work once or twice each week.
