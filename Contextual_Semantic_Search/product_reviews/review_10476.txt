What else could you want ?Well, they fit right ,too.Thanks for caring.I wear a 28 or 29 inch inseam, and for some reason, they never have that length in the dept stores or places I shop.  This is one case where mail order is superior to a brick and mortar store = I can get exactly what I want and then reorder exactly the same thing a couple of years later, which is why I'm here right now.  I wore out my last pair.
