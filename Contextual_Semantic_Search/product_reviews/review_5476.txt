I purchased one, but will be purchasing more as my husband really likes these.  Helike the multi use pocket as well as the depth in all the pockets and how they fit (not too snug and not too loose.He especially likes the buttons on the back left pocket.  It is very useful for buttoning in his wallet or other things ofthat nature.  He feels more secure with that button.  Recently, I purchased the same brandfrom a store and didn't notice that it had no button or buttonholes on the back left pockets.  Sonow I am trying to find a seamstress to put in buttonholes on those back pockets.  He prefers that theleft pocket has the button and usually it does.  I already washed the pants so I can't take them back to the store.My husband wears these for work as well as casual and occasionally to church if he doesn't need a dress shirt and tie.
