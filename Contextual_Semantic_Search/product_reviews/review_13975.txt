The waist sits a bit low, but not bad.  The color is a deep dark indigo which I love.  It fades over time, of course, but I love it.  These jeans fit me kind of tight, which looks good and I receive a lot of compliments.If I could make a suggestion it would be for the denim to be slightly heavier like some other jeans, such as Eddie Bauer.
