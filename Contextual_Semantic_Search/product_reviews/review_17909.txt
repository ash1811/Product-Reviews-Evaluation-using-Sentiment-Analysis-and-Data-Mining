I was looking for American made socks, and found these from Wigwam. I am tired of having to throw away my socks for the well known brands, all imported, many made in China. So I thought I would try socks made here in the states, and crossed my fingers that they would be better. Although I haven't had these socks long enough to say they have, I do know that they are comfortable and fit well, and seem sturdy enough. Hopefully I will remember later on to come back and update my review as to how they have fared over time.
