This is a very comfortable sneaker. I typically wear minimalist shoes. I've tried the fabric version of these and a few other Onitsuka Tiger models, which are usually on the loose side (my foot just slid around inside several of them). These leather shoes are more fitted at the arch and sides of the toe box (but not too short in length or tight across the toe box), and I would feel much more comfortable working out in these.The sole is thin, with an allover miniature nub texture and a very slight increase in heel height. There is a low arch support. It basically has a flexible rubber sole with a thin, perforated sockliner. The white leather looks nice, though the suede toe cap looks like it will mark up, if you're not careful. As others mentioned, and like most shoes from that time, there is a bit of time required for these to break in. I wore them around the house a few days, and there was some rubbing on my Achilles, but after a couple of days (just wearing them a little each afternoon), the leather stretched to fit my foot. I would prefer that the heel tab stay folded down, but it will flip up on you quite a bit, until you've worn them quite a few times. You could use binder clips or something to help the fold set.These are nice enough for a casual look with chinos or more dressed up look with nicer jeans, and lots of folks comment on how cool/nice they look. They're relatively cheap, compared to other minimalist shoes, and they really are comfortable, once you break them in. If they were to get too dirty to wear as a casual shoe, I wouldn't have any qualms about wearing them to the gym as a basic workout shoe.
