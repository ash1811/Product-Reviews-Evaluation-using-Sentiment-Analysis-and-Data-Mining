WARNING: I ordered a 22mm watch strap for this and I wish I would have seen reviews below me that stated it wasn't, because it is a 20 mm. I measured it and put a 22 mm strap on it that was too big. So if you plan to get another strap (which you should) order a 20mm.First off, this watch looks much better in person. The case is a lot more classy than it looks in the picture with that cheap band. The luminous is very impressive, I wish I could post a picture. Time is easy to set along with the date. Second hand hits every tic mark perfectly. I swam with it a few times and had no problems, no where near 100 m, but at least it holds up for that. It looks great with the NATO bands I'ved ordered for it (just order the 20 mm band).Downsides: the strap, but I think that's obvious enough. It's not comfortable at all and doesn't look as black as it does in the picture. Mine had some white residue on it. The bezel is almost a pain to rotate, so much so that I probably won't even use it, or maybe I should so it will loosen up. It does however have a good anti reverse, which isn't saying much because it almost seems as if it's against going forward. I also don't like how it is hard to tell where the 12 o clock position is, but I knew that when I ordered it.Overall it's a good watch for $50 that has it's pros and cons, but most of the negative can be overlooked.
