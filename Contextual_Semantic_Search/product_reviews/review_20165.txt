I order these boots because I wanted a pair of snow boots that was going to last many years. They are very warm and comfortable. Some of the reviewers said the boots were way to big but I think boots are suppose to be a little big so your feet have some air and winter socks fit in them. I usually wear an 8.5 and so I order an 8 and it fit perfectly! I love these boots so much I wear them around all day when we get snow here!Fantastic boots, definitely get what you pay for!
