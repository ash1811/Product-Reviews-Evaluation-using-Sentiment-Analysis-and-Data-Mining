I have a few other pairs of these and could never find them until perusing around Amazon the other day. I have other pairs and they have been around for many years and I tried not to wear them often to make them last because they are my favorite ones. Now I have MORE!!!These are my favorites and look so cute. I don't think I have the best shape but they look so good and I go up and down in weight and they always fit just perfectly no matter what weight I am at.I like how durable they are which is hard to find these days. So you get the best of everything, something cute and you know they aren't going to fall apart after a few times without spending a fortune. Great buy. Definitely going to order more soon.
