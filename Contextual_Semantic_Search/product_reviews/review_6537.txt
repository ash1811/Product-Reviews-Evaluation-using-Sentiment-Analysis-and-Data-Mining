The shoe runs narrow.  The inside label says both &#34;B&#34; and &#34;D&#34;, B is printed on top of a line and D is printed underneath.  I don't know what that means, I ordered D width, but they seem to be a B width by appearance.  HOWEVER, they are very comfortable anyway on my wide feet!  They are well-made and quite attractive, I can wear them with nice dresses/skirts.  I am going to order more.
