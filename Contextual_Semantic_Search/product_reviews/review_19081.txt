I returned this pair of tights because to my way of thinking, orange is NOT the new pink. I had glanced over the reviews before I ordered and thought I ordered the right color, but as soon as I opened the package, I knew that I made the wrong choice. If you want to order a true pink to go with a pink leotard, you need to order Theatrical Pink.
