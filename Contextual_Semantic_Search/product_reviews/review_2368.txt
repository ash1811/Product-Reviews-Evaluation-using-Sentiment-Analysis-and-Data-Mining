These were poorly made, light material and just HUGE!  The front pockets sagged, the color was odd and my wife commented that she could get in there with me (not a bad thing). I have 3 other pair of 501's in the house that are the same size I ordered. These are pretty big. The other issue is they have redesigned the change pocket and made it lots bigger.  So big it is nearly useless because it tucks under your belt if you wear a wide one.Now the comment about going to Penny's. The last pair I bought there (501's are the only thing I buy there) seemed to be heavier material. Washed 501's seem to have a lot of size variance, so trying them on is good. Second, the darker material blue ones fade more normally in the wash.  These medium stone washed have the weird color that is popular on jeans worn by 20 somethings.  Almost looks dirty.I've worn these things for 40 years. I'll keep on wearing them but I'm not happy.These went back though.
