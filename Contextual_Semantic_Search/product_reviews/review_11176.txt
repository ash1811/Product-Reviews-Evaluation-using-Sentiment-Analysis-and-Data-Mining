I bought these keens for my mother, who just had her big toe amputated due to cancer. Everything about them is perfect for her! The inside of the shoe is super soft, the foot bed is supportive and firm, the toe bumper protects the amputation area, each shoe adjusts to fit each foot, the color scheme matches most clothing, the tread prevents slipping, and they are waterproof! When she wears them, no one can tell a quarter of her foot is gone! And I ordered from Amazon cause they are always quick, cheap, and a pleasure to work with!!! I would recommend these shoes to anyone - in fact I've decided to get a pair for myself and my husband!
