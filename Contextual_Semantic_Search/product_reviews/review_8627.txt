This string bikini is one of the best I've ever worn.  From the feel of the material to the fit to the many colors available, this is definitely a panty to have in your wardrobe.  The material has a heavy sturdy feel, but at the same time, feel very soft against the skin.  VF panties run true to size generally, and this one is no exception.  My size 8 fits like a glove.  Just an all-around nice panty.  Can't get enough of them!
