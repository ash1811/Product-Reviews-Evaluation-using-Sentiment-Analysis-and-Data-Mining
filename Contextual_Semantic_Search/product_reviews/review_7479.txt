Columbia has yet to let me down in the quality of their clothes, durability and materials used.  This shirt, is no exception.  The only problem with this shirt, and it's a big one, is that the size is waaayyyy off.  I would venture to say 2 sizes off.  I ordered a large, as I am a large in every other brand including other Columbia product lines, but this shirt was so big I could fully loaded ruck sack underneath it!!Seriously, it is at least one size larger than labeled but I would venture to say it might even be 2 sizes too large.  I'm going to give it to my dad who typically wears a XXL and see if it fits him.  Bottom line, do not order this shirt online unless you have confirmed your size in a store first.
