AFter reading many reviews, I was worried about the scratchy lace but like many, I found once it was washed - that went away.  I am short, 5'1" and it fits fine though long when I go up the stairs.  I am also 'full figured so the large worked well.  I have always loved Shadowline and this set did not let me down  (or my husband)
