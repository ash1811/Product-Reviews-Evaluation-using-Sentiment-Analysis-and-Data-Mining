I bought this sneaker because this is the shoe my mother-in-law can not do without! She has only bought Keds Champion sneakers ever since I have known her. Every Christmas time we buy her a new set so she can get out her old shoes and start using a new pair. It is something that I believe at this point in her life is just expecting every year and don't want to disappoint her in what she enjoys! This is always a great gift for her this time of year and these shoes look FANTASTIC!
