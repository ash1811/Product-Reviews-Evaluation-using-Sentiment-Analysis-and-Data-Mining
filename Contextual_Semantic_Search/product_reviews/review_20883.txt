comfortable because it has absolutely no support at all.  This bra only works if you are really wide in the back and very full busted.  If not forget it..I tried it on at a dept. store, with the suggestion of a sales rep, it was horrid, so much for all lunaire bras, they are only made for very full busted women, and I am 36 DD. small around the back.  I also tried a few other styles by Lunaire, same story, different style....I have to say, same goes for Wacoal, pricey, and don't last, no support, and I paid $60.00..Sorry to all the Wacoal lovers, I wore the ultra suede full figure, no support, didn't last, not worth the money...I also only hand washed all my lingerie, so, they need to come up with something better...
