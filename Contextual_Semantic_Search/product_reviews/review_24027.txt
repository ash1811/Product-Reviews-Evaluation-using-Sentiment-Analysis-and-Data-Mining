Extremely well made and I can see it lasting for many, many trips. The neck cord is easily adjustable and the average person should be able to wear it around their neck, waist, or cross-body. I'm tall and thin and all three modes work for me, as they do for my average (and proportionately) sized husband. The cord is a twisted metal cable, sheathed in fabric, designed to prevent pickpockets from cutting and stealing the pouch while worn. It was stiffer than I initially expected, and a silk cord would be more flexible and comfortable to wear, though that would completely defeat the pouch's purpose. Likely, I will wear it around my neck while breezing through the airport and around my waist or cross-body the rest of the time. The pouch will hold one (maybe two) passports, cash, and credit cards. It's not a purse, but a great pouch to secure basic valuables against your body. As a hardcore geek traveler, I give this product two thumbs up.
