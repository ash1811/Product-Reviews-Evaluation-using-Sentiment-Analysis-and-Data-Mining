Trying to pull costumes together for &#34;Pirate Night&#34; on a Disney Cruise, I was shopping for a family of 6! I paid anywhere from $35 - $85 per outfit. This was the least expensive outfit I bought for my youngest swashbuckler and it was made as well as the other costumes that were twice the price. I'm hoping to get a Halloween wear out of it as well as next year's cruise - fingers crossed!
