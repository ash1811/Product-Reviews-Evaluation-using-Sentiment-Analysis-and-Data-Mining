I have worn these shoes for years and have loved them for their fit and comfort.  However, now they no longer are real leather but some synthetic product.  They are not as comfortable as they once were.  Why, oh why, Reebok did you change this?  Oh, never mind, I think I know.  It's the almighty dollar.  Well, you are going to find you are going to lose customers and probably will not realize the gain you thought you would.
