I got these pants for my 12 year old son who needs pants for his band uniform.  He is slim and tall.  When I first ordered Dickies pants, I ordered them in slim which is what I usually need to do.  When the pants came in the mail, I saw that they were extremely slim pants, more for a 7 or 8 year old.  So I gave them to a friend whose son is actually that slim.  I then ordered the Dickies pants in regular.  They are just right for him.  My experience with these pants is that they are very well made but they run very slim.
