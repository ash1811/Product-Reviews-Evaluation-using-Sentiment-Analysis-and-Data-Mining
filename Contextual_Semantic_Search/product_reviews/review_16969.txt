I am a tall man, 6'5&#34;, about 215. Boot cut jeans are a necessity, as slim cut or 'tapered' makes my size 14's look like clown boots.But these. Talk about perfect.Now, mind you, I'm not given to 5 star reviews, but these are seriously, the best jeans I've ever owned. I wore them in my twenties and now continue to well into my 30's.Good job, Levis.
