Looked everywhere to replace some terry-lined socks I bought many years ago.  Found these & now it's like I'm back in touch with an old friend.  These socks are so soft & comfortable, a pure white with the gold toe that takes nothing away from the comfort and they are a great fit.  No "scrunching down" as I walk.
