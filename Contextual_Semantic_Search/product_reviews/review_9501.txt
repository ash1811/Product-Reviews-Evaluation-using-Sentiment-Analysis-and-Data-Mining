I have multiple pairs of Wigwam socks and love them.  So I was a little surprised to notice after a few washings that the fabric was really pilling up around the toes, and its slowly coming apart.  Not sure if I got a bad pair, but I'm going to stay away from buying the Cool-lite hikers from here on out.
