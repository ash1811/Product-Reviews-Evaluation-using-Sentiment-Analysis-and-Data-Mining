I'm pretty wary about buying shoes online, but I didn't see much variety in the colors or styles in the stores.  I'm glad I bought these because they fit great.  I normally wear a 10 and read the reviews that said they ran big, so I ordered a size 9.  I'm glad I did; a 10 would have been way too big, but the 9 fits just right.  I like the colors too.
