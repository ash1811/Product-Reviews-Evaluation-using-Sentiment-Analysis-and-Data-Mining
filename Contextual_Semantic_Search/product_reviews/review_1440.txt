I wear these socks for every day, versus hiking, and they are perfect. They are not too thick for regular wear, but enough cushioning in the right places to feel good.I ordered the socks in Women's Small.  According to the cardboard packaging, this should fit shoe size:US(W).. 5.0 - 6.5UK .... 3.5 - 5.0EU .... 36.0 - 38.0My shoe size is 6 Wide and these socks just fit nicely.
