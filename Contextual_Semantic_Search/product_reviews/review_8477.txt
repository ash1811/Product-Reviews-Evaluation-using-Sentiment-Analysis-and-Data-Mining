I ordered this scarf as a gift..and I wanted to keep it so bad!Shipping was great even though I ordered it during the holidays. It came on time and the packaging was intact. The scarf came sealed in plastic and I fell in love with it! There is a little Harry Potter tag in Chinese but since the scarf was made in China it made sense.So, onto the scarf itself. It is wide and thick, which is perfect because it will definitely keep you warm. The material is very soft and there's even wool in it. The colors are accurate. The fringes aren't messed up and are just as soft. Now...the Slytherin emblem....that blew me away. It is actually embroidered and the colors are rich. It's sure to stand out and make a statement.Overall, this scarf is very accurate and just so soft! I will get myself a Gryffindor one (because I'm sooo not a Slytherin and yet I don't want people to know that I actually fit into Hufflepuff. Ha!)
