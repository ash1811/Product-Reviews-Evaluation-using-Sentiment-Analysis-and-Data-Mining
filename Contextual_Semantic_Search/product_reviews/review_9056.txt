The material is soft and the tank contours to my muscular build as in the pics. Accurate depiction of the product as advertised. It fits a bit snug and tight for a Large, but I really believe that's the intended design. An XL would probably not feel so restrictive on my skin, but again, I do not think it would look right if I chose more comfort over proper fit/look. Guys, if you're built and you want a comfortable, cool looking tank that shows your hard work, this one fits the bill nice. I've been training for over 25 yrs and have more of a body builder look, as to the lean model look, so that's why it's a bit on the snug side, but I would still recommend due to the quality feel of the material and design.
