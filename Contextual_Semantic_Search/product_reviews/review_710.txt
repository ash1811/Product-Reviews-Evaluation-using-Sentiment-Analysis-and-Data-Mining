At the moment, I can only wear nylons on one leg.The other foot is still wrapped from surgery and will befor another few months.I recommend these stockings even if you can use both.They stay up without garters or garter belts.  No need forpantyhose.  The elastic is firm but not too tight.I may use them when I have the use of both legs.
