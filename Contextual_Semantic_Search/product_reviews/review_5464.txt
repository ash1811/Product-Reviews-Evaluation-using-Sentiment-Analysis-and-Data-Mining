I'm impressed with this watchband - it seems to be durable (I've used it for a couple of weeks now), it's comfortable and it looks nice. It has no frills which is exactly what I want from a watch band. It was easy to install (make sure you have the right watch band tool if you are going to do it yourself without tears - I haven't used the attached product myself but you want something like it:Paylak Watch Band Spring Bar Remover) and came with all the components (the little spring bars were included which was surprising to me for such an inexpensive product). There are no signs of early wear so it appears that proper dye was used to stain the leather. If you're looking for a basic black watchband with silver colored buckle, this is the one.Also I noticed that this watch band is slightly smaller (less long) than the one I replaced. This is nice for me since I have a relatively small wrist - I buckle it right on the middle hole. But for a really burly guy this band would be too small probably.
