My husband wears a large in any brand I've shopped at all major stores, however he was swimming in this shirt.  It is light, cool, and is made very well so I gave it 4 stars.  Just beware to buy one size down for a good fit.  The shirt is so nice that we have decided to give it as a gift to family member who is a larger man for Christmas.
