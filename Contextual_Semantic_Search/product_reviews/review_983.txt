So, why am I happy with this? It is a 36 B, and I pretty much fill it out. As others have mentioned, sheer bras are normally way too large in the cup, usually because they're stretchy. This is not stretchy through the cup, and I couldn't be happier. I'm built lanky: long arms and legs, broad shoulders, small boobs. This does not dig into me, and I don't find it to be itchy. This is working for me. I am so freaking glad it doesn't push my breasts together!!! All that does is make them look smaller, and, well....squished together. How that is supposed to help, I have no idea. Who ever thought that up? This allows them to sit a lot closer to where they want to sit (they tend to point outwards just a bit), however, it DOES GIVE SUPPORT. This is a small miracle. Hats off to Felina. And, thanks to all the previous reviewers whose comments clued me in as to how this would fit!
