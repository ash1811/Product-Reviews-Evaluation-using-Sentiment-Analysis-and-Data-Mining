These are amazingly comfortable! When I bought them, they were so cushy and warm. A few years later, they're less squishy but have held up quite well, and are still very warm. They're warm enough to wear in cold New England winters.I would recommend sizing down. I'm normally a size 6, but size 5 in these fit well.They're admittedly not the most attractive boot, but they look pretty good with jeans or leggings. I got the chocolate color, and they've held up very well. I get any spots out with vinegar and water, or suede cleaner. I've had them for several years, and I wear them often.
