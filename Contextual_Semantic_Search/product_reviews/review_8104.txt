The ring I received was almost exactly the same as pictured. Very similar colors with lovely flecks which catch the light. I ordered a size 9 and received a size closer to 9.5-10. The side stones are a little bit smaller than pictured but the ring is still quite chunky. The band is round rather than flat like most rings. This is slightly uncomfortable between the fingers but still very wearable. Adjusting the size would take quite some effort as the band is very sturdy. I haven't noticed any of the stones being loose as other reviewers stated. Overall, this ring has a nice weight, smooth feel, eye catching appeal and is definitely worth the $35 I paid.
