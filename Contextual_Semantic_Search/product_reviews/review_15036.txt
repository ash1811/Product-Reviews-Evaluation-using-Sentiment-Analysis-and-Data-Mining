I got 3 pairs of these for my live in maid. They fit her good with lots of room to move in. She just wears them with tees while cleaning. Its hot and humid where we live (Singapore) and these are not too thick. She's 5 ft, possibly ard 125 lbs and got the large. So I guess they run a lil small? But with the elastic waistband Im sure they can stretch to someone larger.
