This is a cute little canvas bag that resembles a saddle bag or canteen bag, only smaller.  It's not much larger than a cd case, and it's about as deep as my iPhone is wide.  Very economical use of space.It holds everything I need to get through my day with room to spare.  I have systemic lupus, and I use a cane and forget things.  This bag is small enough and comfortable enough for me to put it on in the morning and wear it all day without having to take it off the way you'd set down a purse or briefcase.  Which is good.  Because I've lost all my purses, and I am beholden to the kindness of more than one stranger for the fact that I still have my briefcase.This bag is shorter, deeper, and less well-organized than the Venturer Travel Portfolio, which makes it better for some applications (it leaves extra room for a camera and allows the use of one's "real" wallet).  The cellphone pocket is roomy enough for the smartest smartphones and multimedia devices.  It closes with velcro, and it's right up front.  I love that.And despite the less organized feel to the bag, it still works great for someone who needs to have one hand free (for driving, walking with a child, walking a dog).I'm glad I have both of these little bags.
