I'm a rather fit person, and my feet are definitely far from overweight, so I would love to know why they don't fit into these socks.  Oh, they'll fit alright, but then at the end of the day, I have red marks from the circulation being cut off.  No joke, sometimes purple if I've been in them all day.  It's ridiculous.  I'm a size 10-11.  Sometimes 9 (rarely) depending on the shoemaker.  How hard is it for Hanes to say 6-10 or 6-9?  Of course it will cost them more, but they have lost my business.  I wear nice clothes, watches, etc, and they surely are not cheap.  Would I wear Hanes? NO!  But, when it comes to socks, no one is going to see them, so as long as they're comfortable, I'm okay.  Well, I like the texture of the sock, but the padding and size have sent me in the direction of another company.
