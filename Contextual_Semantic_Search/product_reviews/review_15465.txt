I am a big fan of moccasins and these are just the latest pair that I have gotten. I have worn moccasins in one form or color or another since the late 1990's when I was first introduced to them. This particular pair are super comfortable. I generally don't wear socks when I first get moccasins so that the shoe has a chance to conform with my foot. Even with the hard sole, I had no problem wearing them for hours on end. And at the end of the day, the leather/dye did not come off on my foot too much. There was some leather flakes but nothing that I wasn't expecting. The dye doesn't rub off so it won't stain your socks. That being said though, I wouldn't wear white socks with them. Even if the dye doesn't rub off, your feet are still going to sweat causing there to be some discoloration with the sock and the leather.So to sum up:Super comfortableFits as expected so if you wear a size 7 (like me) buy a size 7Light weight and breathableEasy on/off zipper in backI would recommend buying this. I plan on getting another pair in black soon.
