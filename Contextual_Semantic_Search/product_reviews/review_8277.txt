This watch adjusts well, fits great, looks good, keeps good time, and is good for dress or play. Sooooo what more do you want in a watch in this price range. I only hope Invicta gets it's head out of it's you know what and goes back to what really works. If they don't they will be sorry for the new speedways are nothing like these. The reserves, grand diver, and this are all what's great about the speedway line. So get yours soon for they are not making these anymore.
