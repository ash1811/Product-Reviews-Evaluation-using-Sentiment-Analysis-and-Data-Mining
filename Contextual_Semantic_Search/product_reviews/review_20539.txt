This bra fits but does not control bounce for my DDs. I am not completely disappointed because it is comfortable but it is actually a &#34;medium impact&#34; bra according to the tags on it when it arrived. For activities such as &#34;yoga and walking&#34; Blah. I need something to really work out in. Oh well.
