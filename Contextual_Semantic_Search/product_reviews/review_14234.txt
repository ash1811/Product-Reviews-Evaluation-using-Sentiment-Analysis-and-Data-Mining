I read the reviews before I bought this and decided to take the risk.  I use these skullies under my motorcycle helmet to protect my hair. I wear a Medium helmet size.The one I received looks nice:  the printing is bright and well done.  The panels all appear to be symmetrical and sewn properly.  It's all cotton, no terry-cloth.  The sizing is roomy; it easily fits my average-sized female head with room to spare.  That's not a problem since it has the little tails to tie it in the back.It looks like it would fit any guy just fine.
