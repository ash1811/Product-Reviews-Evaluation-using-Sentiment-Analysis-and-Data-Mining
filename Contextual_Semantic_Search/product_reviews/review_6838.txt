I've been buying Gold Toe socks for years. Dress socks, low cut athletic socks, quarter cut, etc... They are a bit more to buy but the quality is superb and they tend to last much longer than the cheaper made socks. I've bleached them, beat them up and made them nice and stinky... they always endure. Gold Toe are a notch above in quality and we'll keep our eyes open since products made overseas are often made cheaper these days. So far, so good!
