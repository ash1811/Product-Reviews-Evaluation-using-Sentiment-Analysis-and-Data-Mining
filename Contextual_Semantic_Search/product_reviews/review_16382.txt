I'd not worn a wireless bra in decades and I was skeptical about this one. But I must say it is the most comfortable bra I've had. I was sitting at my desk at work the first day I wore it and kept thinking there was something different. Different in a good way, that is. I was wearing a great bra! First Bali I've tried. Will certainly be buying more.
