The bill is so large that it looks ridiculous. Especially from a profile view.  But, because it's so large it covers the sun from your entire face. So it does it's job. I wear it while at home around the yard but would never go out in public with this laughably large thing. It's comfortable and doesn't squeeze my head at all. I will be getting a smaller bill for wearing outside of my yard as it is an attractive material.
