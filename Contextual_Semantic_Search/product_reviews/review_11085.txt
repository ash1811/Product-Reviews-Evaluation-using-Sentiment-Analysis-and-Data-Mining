I purchased the police belt that has plastic handcuffs. After reading how quickly the plastic ones break, I ordered these so my grandson had a back up pair to play with.  He has only had them a week, but so far these have held up great to a 6 year olds use.  He thinks they are cool! However, Grandpa's wrists are too large to lock up which disappointed our grandson.
