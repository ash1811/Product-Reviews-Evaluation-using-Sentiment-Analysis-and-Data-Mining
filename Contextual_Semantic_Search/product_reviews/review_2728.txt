I've already been through 3 Timex watches now, but I got this one for my girlfriend awhile back, and I liked it so much I decided to get one for myself.The first watch had the Indiglo feature, which made it perfect for wearing to the movies. The second watch had both a chronograph and Indiglo and an alarm, so I thought that was pretty cool for the price. First the Indiglo went out, and the replacement I got lasted a few months before the alarm went out. So, I'm hoping for better with this watch.This watch is the best looking one of them all, with a very handsome band that would look good at the beach, on a date or in the boardroom. It's a lot easier to set than most alarm watches, and easier to set than most other Timex watches, as you can turn the outer dial instead of the crown to set everything -- nice touch. And, all the instructions are on the outer ring and the back of the watch, so you can lose the instructions no problem.As I said, I got this for my girlfriend, and it's size makes it a lot easier to read than those dainty women's watches, yet it looks good on women or men. Great gift for the money, and the recipient will really appreciate the alarm.I can't give it 5 starts because of my previous experience with Timex watches, but for some reason I keep getting them again, hence the 4 star review. If you want a watch that will last you the rest of your life, and then some, my Omega is over 40 years old, and my neighbor has some Rolex watches that are a lot older than that. But, you should know that when they need service, and they will, each service will cost you a lot of Timex watches.Follow-up: This watch is now 3 years old and still going strong so I've upped the rating to 5 stars. My only complaint now is the band broke and I was not able to find an exact replacement from Timex. While not a huge deal, bands don't last forever, the OEM watch band was really, really nice.
