Always have been a Thorlo fan and now finally got my wife to try and she  is twinkle toe happy. Her size selection  was true to form, and the little extra cushion works great for her daily seven-mile &#34;walks&#34;. She's used them now both in her LL Bean hike/walk shoe and her favorite New Balance running shoe. She's happy--and I'm relieved I made the right choice. Not a fifth start because of the price.
