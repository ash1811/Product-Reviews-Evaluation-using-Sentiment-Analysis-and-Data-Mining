I was concerned with the sizing so I ordered a 14 (I wear a mens 12 and have B width) - They fit tightly but are OK - I would not want any smaller - because my feet are narrow I think makes a difference.  If you have a wide foot I'd suggest getting a 2 1/2 size greater than you normally wear, I like how they lace up tight so that the shoe fits well and does not roll.  They work well on both wood, tile, and concrete floors - no sticking or binding to the floor when I twist or turn - has helped my knees immensely - they are much lighter than any of the shoes I used and for dancing 2 1/2 hours the lightness makes a difference.  I like the relatively hard soles - neat how both the heal and front sole slide easily.I Think they are attractive - have received many questions on them - they look great - while called 'women dance' shoes my wife wound not get them even though they would be perfect for dancing (nothing really works for her) as they look too masculine!'I am very pleased with them - they had made a big difference in my dance comfort. (square dancing) - totally recommended.
