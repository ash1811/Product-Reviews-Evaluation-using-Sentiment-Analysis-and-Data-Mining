The straps in the back are long and are somehow supposed to go through various eye holes to look like they are laced up or something.  This is IMPOSSIBLE to do by yourself and it's also IMPOSSIBLE to figure out its supposed to look in the end.  What on earth were they thinking?  The robe is fine but the babydoll thing is a joke, they dont include instructions on how it's supposed to go together or look or anything. Very Strange
