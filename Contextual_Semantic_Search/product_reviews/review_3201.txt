I've had so much trouble finding a leisure bra in an H cup, and I am so thrilled I found this one. No, it's not the cutting edge of support, but it's not supposed to be. It's perfect for sleeping or lazing around the house, but if the doorbell rings you don't have to run to put a bra on. Plus, it comes in a cute polka dot style!
