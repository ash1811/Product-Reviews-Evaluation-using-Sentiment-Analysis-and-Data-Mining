This is my 4th pair of these slippers.  I always have 1 pair stored away still-in-box for when the current pair wears out.  (Just in case they discontinue making them)  And it takes a lot of wear to wear out!  They feel like a comfy slipper, but wear like a shoe.  For the first few days, the fluffy interior is a bit tight.  But that soon compresses and then they feel great.  I wish I could find a pair of shoes that felt as good.
