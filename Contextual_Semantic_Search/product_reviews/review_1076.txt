I used to wear the Jockey for Her cotton briefs.  They fit perfectly and lasted for years.  Several years ago we moved quite far from a Jockey store and I had to try other brands, none of which were close to the quality and fit of the old Jockey for Her briefs.  I was happy to find Jockey underwear on Amazon but since the picture, the name and the description were obviously different from the original briefs I used to wear I ordered only one package of 3 pairs of the Elance briefs.Boy, am I glad I only ordered one package!  I am terribly disappointed that they do not fit comfortably at all.  When I got them out of the package the leg holes looked like they were too large and I think that is the problem. They are definitely not "full coverage" and I do not want part of my bum uncovered. At least the cotton knit is nice and soft.Now I will have to try to find another package of the Lollipop brand cotton briefs I bought a year or so ago.  They fit perfectly - just like the Jockey brand used to do.  I will say that the Elance pants are not the worst underpants I have.  I bought a package of Hanes a while ago and they are much worse!After receiving these underpants I did further research and found that what is described as "PLUS size Classic briefs" actually are available in the size 6 that I wear.......and that is not a "PLUS" size by any means.  If the description had not specified PLUS size I would have looked at those and ordered them and perhaps been more satisfied.  However, I am very hesitant to order any more Jockey underpants because of the problem with the leg openings being too large in the Elance style.
