I love Capezio cobra ballet shoe's fit. The fit is better than Bloch Prolite II leather ballet shoes I bought here in Australia. When they say it's street shoe size... it definitely is! Too bad the seller doesn't ship overseas. But good thing my mother-in-law came to visit me so I had Amazon deliver it to her CA address. :)
