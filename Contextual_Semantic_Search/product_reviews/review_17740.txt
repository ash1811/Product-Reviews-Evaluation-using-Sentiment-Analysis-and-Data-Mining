This is one of the first shoes that I started wearing a while back from Reebok. The style is one of my favorite. They do not lose their shape and they are so comfortable and perfect with jeans. I will continue to purchase this brand of shoe because it says Me all over it. Besides my flip flops and sandals, the Princess Sneaker is going to be my summer shoe.
