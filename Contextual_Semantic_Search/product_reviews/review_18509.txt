I have been looking for a &#34;old style&#34; silky robe with &#34;arm pads&#34;.....I have given up......Then I ordered this robe and it has small arm pads to give a &#34;balance&#34; look.....And.....its washable!!......It looks like silk....feels like silk and you can wash it......I WOULD recommend....I am going to their website and giving a review there too as ......THIS WAS BETTER THAN EXPECTED.....I LOVE IT!....What a nice surprise!
