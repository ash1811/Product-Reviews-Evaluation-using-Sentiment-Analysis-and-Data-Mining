I have been wearing Jockey Elance bikini's for over 25 years.  I decided to buy some of the briefs after an abdominal surgery to avoid the scar being irritated.  The Elance briefs were very nice.  As always, these wash up well and can last for several years without a hitch.  I trust the Jockey name and as I mentioned, have worn their Elance products for over 25 years.  Not disappointed at all. I highly recommend these.
