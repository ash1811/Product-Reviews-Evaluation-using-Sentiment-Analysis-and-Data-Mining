I usually take XL but wanted some extra space so I ordered an XXL.It fit like a medium or large, too tight so I figured I'll it to sleep in. Next day was getting dressed and if I wear it underneath a blousy top it wouldnt matter since it being tight wouldnt make a difference, SO WRONG! One of the straps came torn in the middle of one strap, leaving it hanging by the front and back so I can no longer use it to sleep but I cant use it period. The material iscrap. I would think twice if your interested in purchasing. I did get a refund tho. But I really  needed tanks and had planned on ordering more. :(
