These are the only 'slippers,' my 80 year old mom has worn, for well over a decade, not only in the home, but for outside outings, as well.  When she has a black pair on with slacks, you can't tell that they aren't traditional ballet flats, unless you look closely.  They are very easy for her to slip on and off, and since they stretch, they accommodate for days that she has foot swelling. If she tries to ambulate with any shoe with a heel, she is clumsy and catches the heel.  This significantly increases her risk for a fall. She has enjoyed all colors, but I've just ordered her first pair of red slippers. I've never seen this color selection before.  I think she will be delighted with these ruby slippers.I, too, wear these slippers at home and when they have been washed countless times and begin to show some wear, I delegate them to the backyard, where they continue to take a lot of punishment before giving out altogether. You wouldn't believe some of the things they've survived.I couldn't recommend these slippers more highly, for everyone, but in my mom's case they have kept her on her feet, self ambulating,  longer than she might have been, wearing traditional, clunky shoes. If you know a senior clumsy in shoes, give these a try, to see if they assist with ambulation.  If they do, encourage them to wear them away from home, too, for many casual outings.  Who cares, when safety and comfort is the priority.
