Nice, cushioned socks that don't slide down. Some reviewers commented that they can wear them as formal socks with slacks, not sure how they pull it off, as these are a little too thick for that, but they do work fine with jeans and more casual pants (e.g. casual khakis from Kavu or REI).They do fade slightly in the wash, so I need to be careful matching up older vs. newer pairs when folding laundry. Overall, these are nice, comfortable and sturdy socks, I prefer them to socks from Eddie Bauer or GAP, which, in my experience, pill, fray, shed elastic and generally turn into rags after just a few washings.
