I really like this bra. I wore one before losing 84 lbs. and loved it. I ordered a smaller one after losing the 84 lbs. I just receive it today, tried it on and love it. Now I'm ordering another one. I love the Maple Leaf color. It provides great lift and no extra is hanging out the top. It doesn't ride up in the back. It's so sexy
