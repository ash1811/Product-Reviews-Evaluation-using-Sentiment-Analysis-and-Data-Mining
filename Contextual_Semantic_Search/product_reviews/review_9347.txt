These are probably my eighth or ninth pair of Enzo Liberty Loafers.  I have had them in many colors over the years; they wear well.  I do have to replace my basic colors occasionally and these are replacing my old black ones. Thsey are comfortable from the first wearing forward, are a flattering fit and look good with casual and work clothes.  When they are on sale, they are an unbeatable value.
