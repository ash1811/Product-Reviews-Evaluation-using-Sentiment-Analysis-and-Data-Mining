I am updating my review because they fell apart completely already!  I have had my old  Isotoners for 5 years and they finally got to having to be replaced. Unfortunately these did not even last 5 months!  I bought 5 pairs from different vendors and they are all falling apart, so the problem obviously is with Isotoner not the dealers.  I guess in the five years Isotoners quality has really gone dramatically down.  I am terribly disappointed, I am disabled and have lots of problems with my feet, Isotoner has always been the only slipper that would stay on my feet.  I have no clue what I am going to do now.IIn closing I would tell potential buyers to buy another brand...every single pair I bought a few months ago are falling apart and most are not even wearable anymore.  My apologies to the seller, I have no problem with the seller...but I would tell the seller to drop this line or at least confront the manufacturer.
