I bought it for my husband who is a big Clarks fan since childhood. We saw them in the Manhattan NY and he tried them on but they cost almost double in the store. So he was very happy then he got them and there was no surprises because he tried them on before. Now I got one problem - he doesn't wear it because he keeps it for special occasions so I don't get to see the shoes too often :-(
