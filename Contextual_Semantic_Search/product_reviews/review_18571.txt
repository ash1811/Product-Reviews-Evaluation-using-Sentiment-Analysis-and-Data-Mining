I've been a Timex fan for over 30 years because they take a licking & keep on ticking.  When I first read the reviews for this watch, I feared that Timex was going down hill.  I'm THRILLED to say that is NOT the case!!!  A couple of reviews indicated that this watch was not truly waterproof...that has NOT been my experience!!!  With my eyesight not being as good as it once was, I love the larger numbers & the back-lit face.  I also love that the strap is replaceable when need be.  I'm glad that I looked past some of the negative reviews & used my common sense by buying this watch.  If you're sitting on the fence, jump off & press the "buy it now" button...you won't be sorry!!!
