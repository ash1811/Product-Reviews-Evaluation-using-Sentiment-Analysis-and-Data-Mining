My wife had been on me for years to try these since I work outside. Since we only get snow/ ice maybe 10-20 days a year here I just did not bother. Well we got a real good dumping of snow (for us) that came with 20 deg weather for a couple weeks. I finally gave in and tried these. I don't know why I waited. I went from slipping all over trying to walk in the packed ice, to almost feeling like I was walking on bare dry ground. They are amazing. Easy to put on and off, and they just work great.
