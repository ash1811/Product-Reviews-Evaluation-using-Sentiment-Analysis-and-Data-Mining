These socks are sooooo soft and comforting.  I have four pairs and put them on when I get home from work.  They are wonderful just for relaxing but they are strong enough for the workout of a hike.  You will love these socks.  They are thick and cushiony so can only be worn with slippers, hiking boots or other shoes which will accomodate them - I wear them with Crocs.  The merino wool is soft but the silk really adds another dimension of softness and strength.
