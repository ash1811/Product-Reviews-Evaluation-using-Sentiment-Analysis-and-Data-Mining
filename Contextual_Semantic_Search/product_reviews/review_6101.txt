I've always wanted a pair of these for when I'm doing woodworking in the garage. They don't tend to show up in stores, and I prefer to shop on Amazon, so I ordered a pair. I ordered 34W X 32L, my regular pants size.  Although my pants tend to be a bit on the loose side, these are a bit on the tight side, but I suppose they will stretch out a bit.  If I were to get another pair, I'd go for 36 waist, although these are perfectly useable.They are comfortable, have lots of pockets, and are perfect for working on a project, with a place for lots of small items.  Dickies makes a good product, so I'm sure they'll last for years.
