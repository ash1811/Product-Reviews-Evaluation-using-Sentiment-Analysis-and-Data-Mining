This swim suit fits as expected and the string at the top is very sturdy.The color is a shade or 2 darker than the pic on the site but that is good thing for me. I have never owned this fitted style of suit before but I love it. I can not wait to swim in it on my vacation.It arrived on time, was packed well and is good quality. My GFs like it so much they want me to order the other 2 colors as well.
