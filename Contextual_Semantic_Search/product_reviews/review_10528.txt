Great fit, sturdy denim material, good looks: these jeans ignore "trendy" fit, color and ornamentation, they're the real thing. They are very comfortable and high value. I guess the 38" waist shrunk by no more than " to ", and the 34" length by no more than " to " after washings. The initial sizing was exactly as expected (desired) for my 6'2" height and 214# heft.
