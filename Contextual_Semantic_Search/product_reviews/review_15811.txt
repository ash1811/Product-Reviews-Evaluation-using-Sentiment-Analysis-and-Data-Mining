Over the years I have purchased many brands of socks - smartwool, gold toe, wigman, etc. but these feel WONDERFUL on my feet.  I don't really like a thick sock but didn't want a paper thin one either and these were perfect.  I like the way they really feel snug - not tight - on my foot - like they were custom made for me.  I'm converted now - Thorlo only for me!
