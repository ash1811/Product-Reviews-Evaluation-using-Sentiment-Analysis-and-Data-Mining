I was looking for earings I could put on and wear and not have to worry about.  These fit the bill.  These are beautiful if your dressed up or down.  I sleep in them and they are comfortable.  These are beautiful on and they are not too long or too short.  Everything I wanted are all in these earings.  I had to have my ears repierced due to a lot of years of being on the phone.  If I had these before I would have been fine.  Without the post and the back it would not have pulled my pierceing down so far.  Now I want to decide which of the other styles they offer I want to choose next.  I originally thought that the threaders were the answer and I do like them but these are even better.  You won't be disappointed if you order these.
