I have been wearing Arizona style Birkenstocks for 13 years. They are comfortable, provide plenty of support for my high arches, and are overall great. I assume as long as they keep making them, I'll keep buying them. I wear them daily and I wear out a pair about every year. They are completely worth it. Go beyond the stereotypes, seriously, these are awesome sandals.
