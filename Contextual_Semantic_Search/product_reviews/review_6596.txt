I have been wanting to purchase a pair of Uggs, but didn't want to spend that amount of money.  I came across this brand on Amazon.com and did some research before purchasing.  The Bearpaw official website says to buy a size larger.  I wear a 6 1/2 and ordered a size 7.  When I first tried them on, they seemed very snug and I was afraid they would be too small.  However, once I got my foot into the boot, the wool lining seemed to mold around my foot after a short while.  They are super comfortable and I receive so many compliments on them.  I bought the birch color, which have just a slight tint of green to them, but are still very nuetral in color.  The boots are made very well, even though made in China.  Forget the Uggs!
