The quality is certainly better than I expected.  For under 10 bucks apiece, these are far cheaper than about any other.  These I would say look as good as ones several times their price.  The shade of grey is quite nice.The hardware seems to be of good quality, suspenders hold up my pants quite well.  The straps themselves look nice, and adjust easily for different sized people (fairly large for me).  Overall, the suspenders look simple & clean, which is exactly what I wanted.Lastly, these are made in the US.  I do make a very conscious effort to buy US made goods whenever possible.  For this price, I would expect them to be made in china!
