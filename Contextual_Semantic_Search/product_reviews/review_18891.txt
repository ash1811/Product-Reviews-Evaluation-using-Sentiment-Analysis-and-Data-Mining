At first glance it looked like the foot part was one color the remainder of the boot another.  I decided to keep them as they felt good on my feet.  I seem to be wearing them a lot now, under jeans, with skirts, leggings etc so what I am saying is, they have grown on me and I do like them - great leather and seems like a good boot that will last.
