Every time I look at Carhartt reviews, there are reviews on multiple items lumped together.  Coats being reviewed with Coveralls and the like.  So, these...Carhartt Men's Extremes Arctic Quilt Lined Zip-To-Waist Biberall, Black,...  are what I am talking about.  My hubby is crom SOuthern California. We were transferred to Maryland.  Now, some people say that it is not too cold in Maryland...we tend to disagree.  Any time it gets below freezing, we get cold.  So, I bought these as a Christmas presant for my HUsband, who works outside.  The other day, it was 6 degrees outside, and windy as hell.  He was warm enough to keep working.  Says a lot to us.  Now a piece of advice...go find a local retailer, and try them on first.... The fit is very strange, and the numbers mean nothing. Just make sure thast you have room to bend over...all the way over.  If it is binding, then get a larger size.  It is too hard to do any kind of work when things start tying you up.
