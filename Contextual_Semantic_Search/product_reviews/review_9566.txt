The weight of the denim and the cut and fit is the way a pair of jeans should fit a man...not the girly-men Levi seems to be going after these days with what they've done to their 505's. You can work in these or wear them on the weekends...either way, to paraphrase...you're gonna like the way you look, and the way they fit...
