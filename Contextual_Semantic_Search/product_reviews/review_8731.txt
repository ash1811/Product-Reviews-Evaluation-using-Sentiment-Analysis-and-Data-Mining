As soon as I opened the box I was going to send this watch back, it is a solid piece but is very small in size. I don't know where the word "monster" comes from in the title. Yes it is well designed, but if your looking for a large face watch, this is not it. I don't know why so many commented on how big this was. The watch band is very narrow and thin, not very wide, looks almost like women's band. The band should be wide and thick, not so narrow. These are only my opinions towards the watch. It's just to small, I am now selling mine. Thanks for your time!
