New Balance is one of my favorite walking and workout shoes.  I have owned several pairs over the years.  This style was equally comfortable.  I don't know if it was only the brown/tan color I ordered or all colors...but these were very unattractive on the foot.  They looked huge (long) and clunky.  Looked like my foot was about 6 sizes larger than is real.  I returned them for that reason.
