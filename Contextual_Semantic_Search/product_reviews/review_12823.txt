I think Playtex Bras rock.  I've tried others, but since high school, I always come back to these.  Great fit, superb support, no ride-up, no pinching, just fit and wear perfectly.  Plenty of choices of style.  I haven't actually purchased them from Amazon, yet; but you can't beat the price, so I'll be getting them here next time I need them (soon).
