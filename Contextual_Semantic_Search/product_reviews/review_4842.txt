The title post says it all, I switched from American Eagle boxers to the ExOfficio boxers and the comfortability factor is night and day. I hate the price, as these are about $30 each, however, if you have to wear them more than once (i.e. long travel trip or outdoors), these are the underwear to have with you. Worth the price, you'll feel a lot better about spending the extra money once you put them on.
