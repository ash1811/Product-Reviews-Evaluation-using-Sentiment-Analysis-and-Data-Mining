I have looked everywhere for a grey jersey robe that was long - something that would feel like slipping into a great silky t-shirt...and this is it!  Fit is great, fabric is soft, the weight is perfect - not too light, definitely not heavy.  The feel is feminine, but still very modest.  Wish it wasn't quite so pricey...but I paid it, & I'm not returning it!
