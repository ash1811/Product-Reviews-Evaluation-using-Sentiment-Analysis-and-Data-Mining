I have now purchased 3 pair of these jeans and they have all had the same fit. I did not notice any difference between them. I have bought the dark stonewashed, black and silver fox. The silver fox was a thinner and softer type of material and I liked it a lot! The best thing about ordering your jeans through amazon is that you can always find your size. I have always had a hard time finding 36x36 in the 505's. It's minimally more expensive but at least I know they will have what I need. No more frustration of hunting through the stack of jeans at a store hoping that someone put your size in the wrong bin!4 stars because these jeans are still no where near the same quality of the jeans I got in the early 80's when they were made in america. I hold onto them hoping I will eventually fit back into my 34 waist. If you have any original levi's before 1985 I would hold onto them. They are in great demand. They have everything going for them. They are high quality original Made in America blue jeans and are now retro. win-win. if you have ANY levi's from the 50's and 60's they can easily command $500 or more depending on the condition. Children sizes are the most in demand because they were well worn and sell the best, so they are the hardest to find.*update* 8-7-2012My fourth pair was not sewn right. It was a pair of the Dark Stonewash and the seam on the right leg would rotate to the top of my knee when sitting. I was able to get a replacement from amazon without hassle so I'm leaving the review as 4 stars. The replacement pair of dark stonewash fit great!
