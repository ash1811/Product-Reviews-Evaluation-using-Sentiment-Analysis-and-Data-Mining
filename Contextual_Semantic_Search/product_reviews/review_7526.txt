The best thing about these earrings are that these are real gemstones. The shapes and colors are beautiful. The size is big for stud earrings, between 5mm-8mm depending on cut (about 1 carat diamond size). They are nicely cut, and sparkle in your ears. As others commented, the setting is high so they are best viewed from the front. If you have really tiny and thin earlobes then these will be too big and may droop a little. If you're going for the delicate look, then these will probably not meet your expectations with the high setting and the bigger size. I think they're not very suitable for tweens but may be ok for an older teenager.They come in a long satin blue box which has individual boxes inside so you can gift these away to 5 different people if you like.
