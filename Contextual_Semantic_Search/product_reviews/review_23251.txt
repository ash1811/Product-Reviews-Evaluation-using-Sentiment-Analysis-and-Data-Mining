~I have owned a number of this same style watch over the last 25 years and I've never cared much for other watches since. It is rugged and extremely attractive.Since it is waterproof, I don't have to worry about getting it wet. It's made for Navy SEALs so it's going to be a great watch. I give them to very close special friends as well as my sons. Never had anyone say they didn't love it. I probably will be wearing these in my casket someday [ not too soon I hope ].It's attractive enough to wear to a formal event, but rugged enough to be worn by spelunkers, sky divers, mountain climbers, and hikers all over the world.It will definitely be with me as I hike 500 miles in full backpack this Fall.Way to go Amazing-zon!!~
