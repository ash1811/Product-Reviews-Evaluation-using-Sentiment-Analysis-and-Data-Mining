Nice bag that is very well made.  Not small. In fact, I originally thought that it was too big.  But now that I have more room, I bought more personal gear... and it all fits well.  It holds my Biofuse Training Fins, paddles, kickboard, goggles, suit ext.  Also room for dirty gym clothes too on the way home.  I highly recommend it.  Great value.
