I wish I had read the previous review before I ordered this bra.  It doesn't just run on the small side, the sizes are completely off.  Believe us, the cup size is about 2 sizes smaller than should be.  If you order a "D" cup in this bra, you will get the equivalent of a "B" cup, I went so far as to measure it against a "B" cup and they were approximately the same size.  Save you money, time, and return postage.
