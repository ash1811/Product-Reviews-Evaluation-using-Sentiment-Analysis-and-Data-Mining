Hi guys !The 501 XX stf are ( ALMOST ) the original waist overalls from Jacob W. Davis & Levi Strauss & Company (Jacob invented the copper rivets but he could not afford to pay the patent so he wrote from Reno/Nevada to S.Francisco/California to Levi, asking for his financial backing ).BEWARE the shrinkage  -  the leg shrinks two inches & the waist, from my own experience, DOESN'T SHRINKS .......Antonio  -  Portugal
