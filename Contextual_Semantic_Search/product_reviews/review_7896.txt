This jacket is the best I could find for a 'day to day' use i.e. not professional use.* It has a comfortable fit that is suitable for almost everyone not just skinny people* It has comfortable side pockets* it has an adjustable waist* you can typically find it on sale for very attractive prices* it comes in very nice solid colorsI took one star off because at some point Columbia replace the quality zipper with a cheaper one. I'm not sure they have done this for ALL the colors but it sure was the case with this one.What can I say - bottom line is I already have 3 of these...
