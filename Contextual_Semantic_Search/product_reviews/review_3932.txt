I love this bra!  It is difficult for me to find my size anywhere, let alone find a bra in my size that actually fits and flatters AND is comfortable, but this bra does all those things.  I hardly even know I have it on.  No gaps, no digging into my side, no tugging it down in front every time I raise my arms, and it is very smooth under my clothes.  Nice shape, washes well.  I'm in love.  The beige is a bit darker than I was expecting.  I have very fair skin, and the beige is several shades darker than my skin tone, and darker than my other beige bras.  It still doesn't show under clothes much, but I might have trouble with it under white or sheer clothing.  I will be on the lookout for a pale pink or maybe the bisque color will work better in that regard.  But otherwise, perfect bra at a decent price.  I've already bought another one in a different color.
