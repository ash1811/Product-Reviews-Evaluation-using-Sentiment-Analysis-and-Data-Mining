Wanting something to slip on when I have to take the trash out, or go outside for the mail, or water garden, I wanted a sturdy shoe that can get dirty and clean easily.  These fit that bill.  They are also a prime choice for my &#34;utilitarian&#34; [read:wide] feet.  The foot bed has the nubs, which are a little odd on the bottom on my feet, but I find if I wear a pair of socks with these, then the nubs are quite cozy.  Without the socks, the nubs feel good in some places and too much in other parts of my feet.
