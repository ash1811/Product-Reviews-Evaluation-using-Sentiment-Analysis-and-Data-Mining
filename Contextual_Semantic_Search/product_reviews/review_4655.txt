I got this for my son who is 6'2 and weighs about 250.  The coat fit great, he says it is very comfortable and warm.  He loves the fleece lining.  The price was very good too, I was pleased that he liked it (for once) and that I did not spend an arm and leg on a jacket ~ and it shipped quickly.  I would buy again from vendor.
