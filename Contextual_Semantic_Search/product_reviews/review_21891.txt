These are great.  I just purchased my second one.  The one that I have had for about 3 years has finally stretched out too much, but I got a couple years of use out of it (with a LOT of time in the chlorine of the pool).  This is so much cheaper than buying the overpriced disposable swim diapers, and I feel much better about reusing this instead of throwing away the disposables.  Definitely recommend this.  (Especially for twin moms like me!)
