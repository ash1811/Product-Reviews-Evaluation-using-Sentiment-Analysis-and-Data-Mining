This "bra" provided support for the GF wearing a backless Halloween costume.  Fit seems true for her C-cups.  It obviously can't provide any lift or padding, but does pull the girls together, prevents sway, and protects those nipples.It took a few tries to get positioned right at first, but was easy to remove / place again, and easy to clean according to directions.  No discomfort in removal.  The clasp that holds the two halves together did come undone once during the night, which the GF had to go correct in the ladies room, but that was the only complaint.Recommended.
