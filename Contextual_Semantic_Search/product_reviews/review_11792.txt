This is not the first pair of these shoes I have bought...more like the 5th or 6th pair.  I love them.  They are so comfortable that I can be on my feet all day without backache, and warm enough to wear all winter outdoors, and waterproof enough and high enough to shovel the driveway in them.  Can't say enough good about them.
