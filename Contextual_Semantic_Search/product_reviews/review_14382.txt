Okay, wow, these kind of caught me off guard. As soon as I took them out of the packaging I noticed they were thick and very, very soft. Then I tried them on and they were not tight around my waist/butt at all! I'm 5'6&#34;, weigh 140 and they fit perfectly and barely stretched. They are clearly better quality than the cheap Halloween store or Hottopic ones. Girls, seriously, get these. They are totally worth it!
