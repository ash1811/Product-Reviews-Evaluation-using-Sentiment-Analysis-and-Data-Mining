These earrings are very darling - shiny and a nice hue of gold.  The quality looks fine and the backs on mine do click, but the backs are pretty small too, so have to be careful handling them. I think these earrings would look best on a petite person or young teen.  They might appear a bit small on someone with med to large sized ears.
