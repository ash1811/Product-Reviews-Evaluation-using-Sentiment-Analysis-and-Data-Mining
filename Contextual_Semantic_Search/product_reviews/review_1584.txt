When Dockers discontinued my favorite pocketed T's five years ago, I started my quest for replacements. I've been disappointed until two weeks ago when I came back to Carhartt Men's Workwear Pocket T-Shirts. For starters, I bought one Large and one XL.I'm 6'2" and 200 pounds. While the XL hides my recently acquired larger waist, it's also so large that it could accommodate shoulder pads. Further, the length covers a good part of my pockets in my jeans or shorts. The Large is close to a perfect fit, and just a little big in the shoulders.THEY DID NOT SHRINK when just thrown into the washer and dryer, and came out remarkably almost wrinkle free.I don't know why it's called "workwear." It's very comfortable, a little heavier than the better pocket T's, and will be my daily wear when I hike, am on a photo shoot, "working" around the house, or just lazing around. I'd consider it "casual wear."I just bought 6 more, all in Large.ew
