This is a beautiful and wonderful chain!  It was exactly what I was looking for and looks fantastic around my neck!  I wanted a  somewhat thicker chain than the one that I bought at a store when I bought the charms that hang on it.  A thicker chain gives much more support to the three (children's birthstones) charms that I have on it.  In fact, the other chain that came from the store, is a replacement for the original one I bought that broke while on my neck!  I was super lucky that I didn't lose my charms when that happened!  This chain has given no need for concern in that matter!!!  Highly recommended!
