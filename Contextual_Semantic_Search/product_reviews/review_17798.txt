This is a basic simple watch that will serve you well for years. I had one of these 20 years or more ago so it's nice to see that some things remain the same.The only thing I don't like about this watch is that it's quite small so it almost looks like it was made for a woman's wrist. The only thing is it's obviously masculine (meaning kind of ugly) so noone should mistake it for a woman's watch.Very comfortable and light, in fact i can hardly tell it is there. However, I would have chosen the $15.96 model after seeing this one because the numbers are kind of small for my eyes.I'll keep it for a year than buy the other one. At these prices it certainly wouldn't pay to return it!
