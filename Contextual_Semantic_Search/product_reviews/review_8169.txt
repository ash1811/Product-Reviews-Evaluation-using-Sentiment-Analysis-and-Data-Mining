I WAS GIVEN THIS LOVELY TWO-TONE SEIKO WATCH WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS BORN 21 YEARS AGO. IT RAN FLAWLESSLY UNTIL A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, WHEN IT STOPPED FOR GOOD. I GOT ON LINE AND FOUND THE IDENTICAL WATCH AT AMAZON, JUST WHAT I WANTED AND REASONABLY PRICED. I HOPE THIS LASTS ANOTHER 20 YEARS. IT'S A CLASSIC.
