these sandals are awesome. The bottle opener bottom is always a hit at parties in the summer. Do not get a smaller size, get a half size bigger if you have the option of going bigger or smaller. They are well made. My last ones lasted 2 years and never stunk. For some reason, these do not store feet smell. lol. Not that mine are terrible, but sandals are known to get smelly. My last ones eventually failed when the toe strap became brittle due to too many days at the beach and standing in salt water. Honestly, for the price they could have been made a little better in that respect, but they lasted two solid years of hard fishing and daily use in the summer. Good enough that I bought them again. better than most junk out there.
