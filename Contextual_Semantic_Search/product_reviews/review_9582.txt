Wrangler jeans are made of heavy weight denim, not some of the lighter weights you find in wanna-be jeans. They have brass rivets at the stress point. My Wrangler jeans can handle all the hard work I want to give them and keep coming back wash after wash. There are slim, regular and relaxed fit. Be sure and check the relaxed fit, as not all styles use the heavier denim. These are the real deals, and the real men I know wear Wrangler jeans.
