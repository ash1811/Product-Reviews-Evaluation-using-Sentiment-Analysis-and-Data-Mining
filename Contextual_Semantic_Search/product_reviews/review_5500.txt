I used one of the pair I bought for backpacking while being a chapperone for a group of high school kids going on a tour of Grand Coulee Dam.  I was impressed with these socks.  We did a LOT of walking and a LOT of standing and my feet were both comfortable and dry.I can't attest to the longevity as of yet, but from the other reports I've read, they'll be with me until the Dryer Monster eats one of the two.
