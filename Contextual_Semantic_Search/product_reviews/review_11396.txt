This backpack is awesome for my liking.There are many backpacks on the market to fit everyone's need and style. For me I wanted something simple, light, functional and reliable, and this is itI have used a very similar backpack (same profile, material and built but from a different company, Dickies) for 9 years before it even started showing signs that it needs to be replaced.This backpack is extremely light. It has one main compartment and another smaller one in the front. It is also very comfortable - it rides good on the back. The shoulder straps are thick with foam and wide enough to be comfortable, but not too big to be aesthetically  awkward or stand out. Because it is a very simple design there aren't many things that can go wrong with it.Considering the material and build quality is the same or better than my old backpack that I've used for more than 9 years, I expect this to hold out for a long time.This item is highly recommended.
