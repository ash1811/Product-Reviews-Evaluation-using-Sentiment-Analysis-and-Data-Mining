These are very nice quality house slippers, and nice looking too. My husband was preparing for surgery and a stay in the hospital and asked for a pair of good quality house slippers; I decided on these. In over a years time of wearing them every single night, they just now are showing some wear and tear. I've ordered this 2nd pair as a Christmas gift.
