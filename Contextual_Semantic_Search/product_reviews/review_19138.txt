These earrings are nicely made and sturdy for the price.  However, just as stated in previous reviews I've read, the color of the pearls is very light.  I also feel the earrings are a little too "busy" for lack of a better word; I would not have included the additional silver/beads on both the top and bottom of the pearl; overdone just a tad bit, but a nice pair of earrings nonetheless...especially for the price.
