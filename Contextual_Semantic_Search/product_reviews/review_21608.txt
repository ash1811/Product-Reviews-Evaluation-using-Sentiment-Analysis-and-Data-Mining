I have purchased plenty of other types of ugg boots and they all fall apart pretty fast, I finally broke down and spent the money for these UGGs and they are of such better quality then any others.  I hesitated even after going through three different types of boots but figured that it was better than buying 5 pairs at $50 a pair...well I dont have to buy anymore as these have lasted longer already than any of the others (4 months so far) very happy I decided to spend the money.
