This review is specific to the Small size. I wore these all the time in Medium size, and recommend those, but lost a little weight recently so they didn't fit and I ordered some Small sized ones as replacements. I'm not going to go into details, but suffice to say that these fit in the waist but have too little coverage elsewhere -- very uncomfortably so. They are so tight as to be unwearable.Other Jockey offerings (e.g.,Jockey Slim Fit Cotton Stretch Low-Rise Brief - 2 pack) fit fine in the Small size, so I recommend those instead if that's your size. If you're medium or larger for the waist size, then these will likely fit well. The sizing chart seems accurate, maybe fitting about 1" larger than it says.The mediums that I had before lasted well and looked great, so overall I recommend these except for the limitation in the small size. Good luck!
