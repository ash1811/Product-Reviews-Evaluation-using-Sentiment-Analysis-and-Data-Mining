I am a big guy, and wear a XL hat.  This is a little tight for me, but fits my 12 year old with no issues.  The material is good, stretch type nylon. The stitching is done well, however the crease is a little uncomfortable around the nose.  I purchased two of these for Airsoft Play because of their low price.
