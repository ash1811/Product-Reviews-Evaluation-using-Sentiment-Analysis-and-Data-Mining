Seems lately the shoes you get are getting shorter or narrower or just don't fit. Had a few pairs of Romeos and all pairs hurt my feet.  Was skeptical about these Merrell Jungle Mocs but the 100s of reviews were outstanding so I tried them.wow, glad I did! Told my wife I will need a nw pair soon because these will be worn out from constant wear. Now she wants a pair. Oh, did I forget to say, they are good looking, too!
