Love the LOOK of this watch - have had to return the last two as the mesh bracelet kinks, producing sharp metal barbs that RIP my delicate clothing as my arm brushes against my side when I walk. The snags and tiny tears the band makes in the fabrics are NOT nice!Other than that, the watch is lovely.
