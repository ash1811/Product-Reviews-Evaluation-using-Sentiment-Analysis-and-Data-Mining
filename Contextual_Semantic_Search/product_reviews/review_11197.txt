I love these sandals! They are comfortable and are great to wear all summer long. I've had them for almost a year and they still look brand new. Great support too. Love the color I got as they go with just about everything I wear. True to size, (7) in length and width. I'm interested in the function of the shoes I buy, as well as the fit and look. These are perfect for me. Would I order them again? You bet I would!
