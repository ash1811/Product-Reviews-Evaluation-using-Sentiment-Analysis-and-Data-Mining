This wallet is big enough to hold all my credit cards. I also love the two different places you can put your paper money in. Also I love the unique change purse which is divided  pennies on one side and quarters and nickles on the the other side.. Has two clasps on it. One for full wallet and the other one when less is in it. Nice leather on the outside and good man made material on the inside. Will be buying another in  different one as well.
