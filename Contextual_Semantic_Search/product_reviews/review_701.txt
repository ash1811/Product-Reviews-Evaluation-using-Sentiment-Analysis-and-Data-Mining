By accident I purchased my first Shadowline gown back in 1995.  Have been buying them ever since.  They are the best gowns.  Material is soft...and wears like iron.  The length is perfect.  I love my gowns long.....not ankle length.  I am 5'6&#34; and the gown brushes the top of my foot.  This gown is worth the money.
