I've not worn Mephistos before, and I love these sandals!!! So comfy and they are stylish enough to dress up a little. I usually wear a 9, so ordered a 40 euro.  Note:  I ordered a 40 in this shoe from GB, and they're at least a half size bigger than the 40s I purchased on Amazon, and stick out from my heel a little.
