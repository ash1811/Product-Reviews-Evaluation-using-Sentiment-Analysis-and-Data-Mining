I would have rated these 5 stars for the show itself and the comfort factor, but was a tad disappointed to find that these run on the small side.  I tend to wear a size 9 in shoes, but buy a 9.5 in sneakers to allow for socks. Since I was planning on wearing these without socks I purchased a 9 and although they are nice and wide in the toe and foot bed, they JUST fit (my heel may hang off a tad) on the other end. I didn't want to bother returning them and will definitely buy again, but just order 1/2 size larger next time.Excellent quality.
