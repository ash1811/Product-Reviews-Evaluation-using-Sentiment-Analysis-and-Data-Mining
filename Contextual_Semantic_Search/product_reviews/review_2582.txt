This is a very lightweight top which is great to wear under clothing. It is very silkly feeling against the skin. Although when I washed it the first time using Ivory gentle detergent, cool water, and washed by hand, it lost some of the silkyness and shrank a tad. Next time I will use less detergent and very "cold" water. Just a heads-up to others.
