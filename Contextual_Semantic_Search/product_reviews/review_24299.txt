Firstly, this watch looks better in the photo than it does in real life. It has a cheap plastic look and a flimsy feel and the band should be ashamed of itself. Now that I have the negatives out of the way let me roll in the positives. You get a good watch for the money with tons of features. Despite what other reviewers have said about bits and pieces breaking and falling off, I have not experienced this. My watch has held up very good.I must admit that I only wear it once a week and have not subjected it to it's true purpose...outdoor activities.As an avid collector and lover of wrist watches I rotate my stock.Features: The alarm is quite loud, louder than my other expeditions, it actually wakes me up. The three times zones are useful for travelling. 24 hour countdown timer is very handy for those who need it, and although I don't use the rotating bezel, others may find this useful as a second timer, for whatever reason. All digital Expeditions have a stopwatch so nothing new there. Indiglo night light is adaquate, with the night mode feature being a bonus.I have found this watch to keep very good time, only losing a few beats per month, like all Timex quartz watches.I recomend this as a good knock around watch, but if you're looking for something really sturdy that will hold up well out in the field then look elsewhere . Go for G Shock or a Pathfinder or a Citizen Protek or the like.All in all a good watch for the hard earned you will outlay.
