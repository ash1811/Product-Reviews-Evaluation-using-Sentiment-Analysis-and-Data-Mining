I bought these for the reception after my wedding.  I have a size 11/12 shoe size depending on the type of shoe I wear so I was hoping that when I got the XXL size they would fit.  Well I just got them and they are perfect!  The size in the shoe even says 11/12 which I think they should list so people know what is what.  Anyway, they are extremely comfortable! They have a nice thick layer of cusion the bottom and the tops are not so tight that they dig into the tops of your feet like some ballerina slippers.  I would suggest these to anyone thinking of purchasing them!
