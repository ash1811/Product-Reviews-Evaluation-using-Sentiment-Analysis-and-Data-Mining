The clip on style works for my needs. I thought the clips would have enough tension to stay on when I take the pants off but they tend to slip off the belt. Not that big a deal since it's easy to refasten to the belt. My first pair of suspenders, I'm normally a belt guy so this is a new experience but they are comfortable.
