When I first go the sandals they felt a bit on the tight side. But as I wore them around the house they compressed and became more comfortable. My only concern is where the straps lay. I'd prefer them to sit a bit higher over the top of my foot. They seem to slouch low over the course of the day, so I have to keep adjusting them. Not a deal breaker though.
