I have bought 40X30 pants before that were perfect fits.  These however are a bit tight at the waist and more than a bit tight ar the thighs. Although I am pleased with the material I cannot wear thes pants because they are too tight. Ironically  I bought a pair of levi's same size and they fit perfectly. I am not sure what to do with these. And to think I bought two pairs.
