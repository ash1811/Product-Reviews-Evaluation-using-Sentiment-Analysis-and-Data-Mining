I love Easy Spirit Shoes!  I have been buying the Romy sneaker for YEARS!  Just keep buying it!  They are so comfortable on my 8W size feet.  I am a nurse ,12 hour shifts on my feet all day,and these are my shoes.  I love them,they are also machine washable and come out of the washer looking new.  Please never stop making the Romy!
