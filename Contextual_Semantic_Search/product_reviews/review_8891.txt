This box has a nice set up, doors for hanging jewelry on the sides, 4 drawers with a variety of compartment sizes, ring holders, a place for stud earrings and it even has a mini jewelry box in which is handy for travel or &#34;everyday&#34; items and can fit in the top compartment or be kept separately. It is a good quality leather and is very simple and elegant looking. If you have larger chunky jewelry the drawers might be too shallow for them (although I do have one big piece which sits in the top compartment and the top closes as it should). The longer necklaces have to be doubled or tripled as the side doors are not that tall but anklets or bracelets fit perfectly. I looked at a lot of jewelry boxes before I decided to purchase this one and overall it is great and the quality of the make inside and out is very good.
