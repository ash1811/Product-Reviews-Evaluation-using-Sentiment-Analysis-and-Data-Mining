After 12 years(!!) of enjoying the comfort of my previous pair of brown Reef flip flops it was time for another purchase. You really can't go wrong.  They are plain brown and will go with anything, they offer SO much comfort and won't bother your feet...ever, and they are durable.  I put my other Reefs through the ringer--they've been through a LOT.  I feel as though the quality of my new pair is just as great.YAY. Do it. Buy a pair. You won't regret it.
