I went by the measurement guide and ordered accordingly, however the bust/straps are about a size too large and come off more droopy than fitted.Love the feel of the lace at the top and the silky bottom, but it's such a noticeable slump in the strap/bust that I feel I'll have to find a way to take up the straps/alter it.I would recommend ordering a size smaller than the measurements.
