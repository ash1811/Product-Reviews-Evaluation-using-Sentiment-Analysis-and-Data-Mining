This bra fits perfectly! I enjoy the conical shape; it goes under my pin up dresses wonderfully. I have bought a What Katie Did bra in the past, and it is uncomfortable, small, poorly made, and very expensive.  This bra has none of those qualities,  and will probably buy more colors. I was afraid that this bra would look too old on me, but that could not be further from the truth. I enjoy the padded straps and full coverage. It is both comfortable and sexy.
