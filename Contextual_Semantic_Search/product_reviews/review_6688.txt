March 2014: I continue to order about one pair of Carhartt men's bib overalls yearly.  I have my sizing down pat and so long as the manufacturer doesn't change the specs I can order with confidence that the overalls will fit me properly.  But I put my cellphone in the right front pocket, and with a largish display 2013 vintage cell I have to wear the bibs way low to avoid crimping the cell.  I measured the pocket at about 13" deep; if the pocket were 14" I could wear the bibs at a more reasonable height.January 2012: I prefer overall style jeans to belted jeans, because the latter seem to have a waistband that's determined to cut me in half!  I just wish overalls would come back into style for both men & women because I also think they look great.  Despite being out of style, I've found that I can wear overalls to almost any occasion where regular jeans are acceptable, and I even wear them to the office on casual days.  I've found the Carhartts to be exceptionally comfortable and I now spend most of my time in them.  The only problem is that, like many blue denim products, they tend to die quickly with washing.  So I'm inclined to wash them far less frequently than I should.  Unlike many folks, I tend to like new-looking darkish denim, and that look is pretty much gone after the first wash.  Other than this wear issue, I can happily recommend them.
