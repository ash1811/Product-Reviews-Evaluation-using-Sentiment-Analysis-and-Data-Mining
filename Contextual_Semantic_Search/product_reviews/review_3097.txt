This Sweater was purchased for my elderly Mother. It's a great sweater for someone who is often chilled even when they are behind closed doors. It's Cotton and Machine washable. The fit is great, it has pockets and my Mom receives lots of compliments on the sweater. I will purchase her another one in another color.
