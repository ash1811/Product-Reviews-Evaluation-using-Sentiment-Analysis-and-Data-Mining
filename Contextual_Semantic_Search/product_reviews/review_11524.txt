Bought this on another site because they were having a sale and I'd recently gotten a different maidenform that I loved... I ordered the same size as that bra and it was way too small in the cups (band was ok).It seems like it'd be a great bra in the right cup size, so ladies, consider ordering one cup from your usual.
