I bought these on the recommendation of a friend when I mentioned that my runs were getting colder and less comfortable.  Once I received my Coldgear Tights, winter running because a breeze.  I ran comfortably, all winter long, in temps as low as 15 degrees F.  These definitely made me a believer in Under Armour.
