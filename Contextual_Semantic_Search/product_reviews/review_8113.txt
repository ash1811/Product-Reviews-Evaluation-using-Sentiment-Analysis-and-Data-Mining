I absolutely LOVE this ring! My husband gave it to me for Christmas 2 years ago and ever since I wore it just about every day. It did take a bit of getting used to because the band is indeed very thick but I received so many compliments every every day, it has been hard to get myself to wear a different ring. I love the fact that it is adjustable, during the very hot summer months when my hands swelled I never needed to take it off.If you like heavy, bold, draw attention type rings then you probably won't be dissappointed.
