Teva size 8, all my other brands I wear a 7 1/2. please measure your foot and order based on the Teva shoe chart.I purchased these ( black pair, brown pair-which I have worn twice) a little over 4 yrs ago along with the Dozer (Dozer model has changed). Florida weather lets the flip flop freaks skip with joy pretty much all year. I also am known to throw on the toe socks for cool weather so I can still wear these.I expected them to last for a little while given the reliability of the brand but not this long and not after what they have been through. Everyday these find their way to my feet. ( really everyday). The strapping is great to hold these on with out throwing them off your feet when walking.They have made it through several hikes, mud and snow (with toe socks, LOL) .They mold over time to your feet (toes included). Yes, if your are in the sun you will have some funky tan lines. They also have a very slight arch which is perfect.Price point is excellent for the life of this shoe. I wasn't hesitant to pay it because the brand is excellent in durability and quality.
