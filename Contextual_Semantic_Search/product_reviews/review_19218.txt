Decent balaclava, but much too small for my liking. I feel that I have a very &#34;average-sized&#34; head, but this &#34;one size fits most&#34; balaclava is TIGHT. That's great in ALL regards, except for comfort on my face. :[It'd be the perfect size it if was larger across the &#34;nose&#34; section. It fits snugly around my head, neck, and ears&#8211;which is what I want because I wear it under a bicycle helmet, and I want it to be aerodynamic. However, it's SUPER tight around my big ol schnoz! It actually bends my nose because it's so tight!Other than the size, everything is &#34;okay.&#34; It'd a very lightweight material, so I wouldn't mind it being a tad thicker/warmer. However, the lightness can be nice for cool, early-winter/late-spring rides. Despite the lightness of the material, is seem very strong and durable.
