Cons:It is smaller than advertised.  10x8x3.5 is what the package says.The design makes it flimsy and stuff falls out of the top even when the ears are laying on top as they should be.The shoulder strap was fraying when I got it.Looks more like a purse, not a bag for a man to use as I wanted.Pros:The stitching is ok.The material is decently thick.I like the colorOverall, I am not happy with this bag.  I purchased two of them.  One to carry my dogs stuff, and another to use for my clipper set.  It was a little too small for both tasks.  I ended up giving it to my daughter to use as a purse.  She seems happy enough with it since she rarely carries one.
