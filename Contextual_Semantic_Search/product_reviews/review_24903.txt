I have a lot in my wallet and no  it isn't money.  Lots of papers, and some receipts and discount cards.  My previous wallet was extremely fat and heavy.  This one is still able to carry everything I had in my previous wallet, but this wallet makes everything a lot slimmer!  Fits perfectly in my purse, and not heavy.  Fits my checkbook perfectly too.
