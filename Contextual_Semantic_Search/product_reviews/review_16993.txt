Amazon also has these 527's[...]but I didn't like them as much as these ones I'm reviewing.I'm 6'1" about 185 lbs with a 32-34" waist.I have a number of versions of the 527's from over the years and was looking to replace a holey pair.I ordered the 34Wx32L. These jeans feel thin, made in Bangladesh, but they're kinda perfect for these warm summer nights. They might not last years but I like the fit and cut better and they're very comfortable. Got a random compliment too. I like them!The other jeans are "slim boot cut" 527'sI first ordered the other ones at 34Wx34L but they were too long (Made in Bangladesh I believe).Then I ordered them at 34Wx32L but I just don't love the slim boot fit (Made in Vietnam).I think the Bangladesh ones feel thinner than the Vietnam although both feel thinner than my older pairs (probably made in Mexico ;)You might like the "slim boot cut" and Amazon's "free return" policy is pretty painless so you may as well take advantage of it and try both varieties to see which suits your tastes.I'm gonna stick with these.
