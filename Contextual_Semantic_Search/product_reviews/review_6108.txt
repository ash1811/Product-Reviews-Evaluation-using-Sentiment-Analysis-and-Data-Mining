It's Dickies...you get what you pay for and that's good rugged quality fabric. It's made for a working man, from painting your shed to getting on the ground and changing your oil...they fit as expected...the Demi is thick and fits good. The pockets were a little high on the back for my taste and that's the only reason why I didn't  give it a 5 star rating, but nonetheless I like them a lot worth ever penny I spent....and my wife says and I quote &#34;they look good of your butt honey&#34;  Ha!
