I ordered these jeans when my husband's previous ones began to get frayed at the hem.  Levis never disappoints! They are a quality brand. My spouse says that the pants fit well, are comfortable and I think they look great on him.  I've laundered them several times and the color hasn't faded.  In the past, the washing directions stated, &#34; wash in hot water, &#34; but now it suggests cold.  I think this is a good change, because clothes laundered in cold water seem to last longer.
