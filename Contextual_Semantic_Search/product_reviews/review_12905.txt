This Jeans is one of the most comfortable jeans especially for fat people it reaches the waist which is perfect if you want to wear a dress shirt or a polo shirt that you need to put inside the jeans. When i wear these shirts with a 501 jeans the shirts keep going out of the jeans but the 550 eliminated this problem. I loved this jeans cut.
