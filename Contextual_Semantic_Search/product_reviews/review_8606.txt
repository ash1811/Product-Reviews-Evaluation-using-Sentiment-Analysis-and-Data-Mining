My size- I'm a jeans size 26 and I bought a handful of size medium. I'm very glad I did because they fit perfectly and they do not ride up at ALL during the day, even with my very tight jeans. Additionally, my husband commented on them *immediately* as he thought they were extremely sexy!! He'll never know they're my lounge underwear!! ;) I looooove them!Oh, and if you buy Victoria's Secret underwear, the sizing is extremely similar for mediums. I wear a Victoria's Secret medium and the same is true for these Vanity Fair panties. I'm an XS/S in clothing but a M in these panties.
