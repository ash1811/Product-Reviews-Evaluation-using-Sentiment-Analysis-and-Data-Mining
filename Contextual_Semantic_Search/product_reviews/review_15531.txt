Very disappointed. These looked nice, but after an initial pre-wear wash and dry (cold water, medium heat), these shrunk a TON. As in about 2 inches shorter than a 12 month Carter's onesie. I don't think these will even snap on her now. I might be able to still use them as a sleep shirt if I just cut the crotch portion off at the bottom, but I'm annoyed. Also, the reviewers who mentioned the very large neck were right. Would not buy these again.It's SO hard to find 12+ month onesies! If you're looking for smaller sizes in plain colors, I HIGHLY recommend the Disney Cuddly Bodysuits. I just wish they came in bigger sizes!
