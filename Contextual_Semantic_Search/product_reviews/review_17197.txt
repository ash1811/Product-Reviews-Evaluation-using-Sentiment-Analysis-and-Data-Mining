These are very soft, cushy slippers. I wear a women's size 8.5 in a normal shoe and ordered these in medium based on other reviews. They're a good fit so I'd recommend others do the same. I took off a star because, as others have mentioned, the band that goes around the foot is quite tight- too tight, I'd say. Still, looking forward to using these for some relief from walking around on bare hardwood floors!
