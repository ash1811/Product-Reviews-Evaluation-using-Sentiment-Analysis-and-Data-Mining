These are beautiful. I bought a few pairs, some for gifts, some for myself. The ones I got are very light silver...not antiqued the way the photo appears.  They are beautiful and perfect for those of us who like the simplicity of studs.  You can go running in the morning, to work, and then to the opera without worrying about any jewelry changes.  Boom.
