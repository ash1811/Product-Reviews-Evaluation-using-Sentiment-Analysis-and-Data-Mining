I have bought Gold Toe socks for probably 20 years or more. They have always been high quality and wore very well. For the last several years I have bought them from Amazon with no problems. The last package I bought from Amazon were terrible. The bottoms frayed very quickly and wore through and the fabric became dingy and no amount of washing or bleach helped. I understand that they are now made outside the US so that explains it. I have seen this happen with dozens of products that I have used over the years. Before too long it will be impossible to buy ANY quality products in the US.Someone on here recommended Adidas socks and I followed their advice. No luck there either. I ordered 6 pairs of Adidas black low top socks from Amazon less then a week ago. A couple of days ago I wore a pair and then washed them. The bottoms looked like they had been ran through a shredder and one even had a hole all the way through the fabric.I'm starting to think that Amazon needs to screen their sellers a little better. I buy a LOT of items from Amazon because I despise shopping but some of the items I've been getting lately have me believing they might be knock-offs, including these socks. I know for a fact that a lot of sellers are running scams. I have seen things for sale for as much as 10x the price that they are available for everywhere else, one company with a Hispanic name tries to sell all kinds of items, mostly grocery items, for 4-5x their usual price. A lot of times if you point it out in a review Amazon refuses to post it.CAN ANYONE RECOMMEND A BRAND OF ATHLETIC SOCK THAT WILL LAST MORE THEN A COUPLE OF MONTHS?
