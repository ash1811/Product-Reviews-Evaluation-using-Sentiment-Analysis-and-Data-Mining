Love, LOVE, LoooooVE these!!Reminds me of the ones Jackie O.  wore in the 70's.These are oversized, but not so big that they take away, they enhance, these are retro but with an updated look to them. Well balanced, they do not look cheap at all, have UV lenses and the price is right.....what more could you ask?? Except, who is that Hollywood Starlet behind those sunglasses??!!
