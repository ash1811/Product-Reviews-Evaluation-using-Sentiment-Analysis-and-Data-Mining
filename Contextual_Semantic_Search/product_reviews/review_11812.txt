The leather portion of the shoe is excellent , looks and feels great. The fit was a tad tight on me but I am pretty sure they will stretch as I wear them.I do wish the lower portion of the shoe and heel were leather as well, personally I think they would wear better and longer.If you have never tried out the  Florsheim  brand , treat yourself to one of the nicest looking and most comfortable shoes out there.
