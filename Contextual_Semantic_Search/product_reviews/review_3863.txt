I don't like the material that it is made out of. The first time putting it on, I was afraid it would rip. I don't know how sturdy the material really is, but I'm not going to try and test it out. It's also rough and abrasive. The garter hooks (not sure if that's the correct term or not), dug into my legs. That was only after wearing it for less than a minute when I first tried it on. I ended up cutting them out. The whole get up is snug every where from torso down to thighs. Not a minute really goes by that I can't tell I'm wearing it. Some of the seams kind of cut in a little bit, leaving indentations in my skin. There's an opening at the crotch area and I'm not really sure of that purpose. I thought maybe it was in order to use the restroom without pulling the whole thing down, but I could not figure out a way to do that without making a mess somewhere (perhaps I need a funnel?). Basically, it's one of the most painful and uncomfortable body shapers I have ever worn. With all that being said, it does hold things in and flattens my stomach. This item follows the &#34;Beauty is Painful&#34; idea. If you are looking for something to take inches off, this is not it. All in all, my torso is about 1/2&#34; smaller. Depending on your side, rolls can hang over the top area. This item can be worn under jeans that are loose fitting. And I don't think it really does anything for my bottom. I thought it might boost it a little, but it doesn't. As for recommending this product: order at your own risk. If you want a flatten stomach and you don't mind a little pain and discomfort, this is your item.
