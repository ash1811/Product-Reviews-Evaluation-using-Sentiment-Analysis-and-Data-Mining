I've had this watch for five years and was lured by the &#34;Navy Seal&#34; mystique.  In that time period, it's gone through numerous batteries while the watch sat in watchbox most of the time.  This watch uses about three batteries a year on average.  I use excellent quality batteries that last two to three years on other watches.  I wear the watch maybe 10 times a year and don't abuse it.  The second hand fell off once and rotating dial came loose in the first six months.  The case back screws rusted after three years.Trying to deal with Luminox was maddening and they wanted $130 to repair the watch with a three month turn-around.  I took it to a local watchmaker (has worked on my watches for 20 years) who made it better than new for $60. The watchmaker said not to take this into the water because he questioned the watch being &#34;water resistant&#34; because the original factory seal (no pun intended) was so poor.  I've had Timex watches that are far better quality than this.  My far less expensive Casio G Shock feels like far better quality.  The stainless steel caseback is the best made part of this watch.  It's sturdy.  The rest of the watch is cheap plastic. I'd like to see better build quality, more metal/less plastic a better water resistant seal.Now onto the case:  it's not much better.  While it's hard and protects the watch because it has a soft foam inside, the zipper broke after three months.  The red rivets on the zipper fall out of the case.  Again, dealing with Luminox was unsuccessful.Advice: Don't be lured by the mystique of a &#34;Navy Seal&#34; watch.  Spend your hard-earned money on something else.
