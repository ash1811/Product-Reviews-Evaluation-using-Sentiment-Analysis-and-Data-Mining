The length  of the legs was fine, as was the waist but the shoulder straps  barely reached to connect.  Im only 5'11  so Im a regular.  They should tell customers these are &#34;short&#34; torso and not regular or long.  You buy things like this for comfort and ease of movement.  Walking bent over or struggling to get them fastened isnt my idea of comfort.  If I was shorter they would be a good buy.
