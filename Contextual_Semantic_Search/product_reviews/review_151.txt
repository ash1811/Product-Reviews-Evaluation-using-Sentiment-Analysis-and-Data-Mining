Yelp, I guarantee this costume will rip on the 1st day of play.  It is really cheaply made.  It's the same cheap costumes that you find in walmart for 7-10 bucks.  And I had to cut out a nose and mouth it doesn't give them a place to breath out of .  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR so don't pay over 10 bucks for this temporary costume
