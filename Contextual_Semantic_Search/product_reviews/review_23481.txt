I'm used to Ray Bans but kept scratching the lenses and got sick and tired of spending $70 each time I needed a new pair of sunglasses. Bought these and wore them for about one day. Too tight, too flimsy, lenses look weird, things are distorted. They probably are great glasses for someone, just not me.
