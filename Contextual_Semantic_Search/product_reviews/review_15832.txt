These socks were ordered for my son who has arthritis in his feet and ankles. These socks ROCK!  They are cushioned, keep your feet cool, and the wash up perfect every time without any visible wear.I highly recommend this product, and am purchasing more. I know the price is high, but if you are going to be on your feet then they will work for you. Also these fit my son who wears a 15.5 shoe.Excellent product.
