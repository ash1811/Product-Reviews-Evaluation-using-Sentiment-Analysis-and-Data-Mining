i am not that old but just seems so many things were better years ago. that said the denim seems lighter. i am not a fashion bug i wear jeans 99.9% of the time. i usually try clothes on in a store then order on line. i usually order 5-6 sets ate a time all same. i have found black jeans fit and wear and shrink different then light blue or dark etc. 5 pair usually last about a year or so . i remember them lasting longer. still a year isnt bad since i am tough on everything. will buy again as these wear out.with amazon prime if a pair get ripped  can have another in two days  convience countsbottom line they fit they last and are priced right
