So, I looked too long for mesh bags.  This bag is fine.  It barely holds two big pool towels and some bathing suits.  Don't be fooled by what you read.  The bag straps could easily rip off if you keep stuffing this simple bag with too much.  It has a nice front zipper pocket, we keep child goggles, YMCA lock and a wallet and keys in there.  This bag is great for parent/kid suit, two pairs of flip flops, two peshtemals (not bulky towels), and two cover ups.  Perfect for YMCA swim trips.
