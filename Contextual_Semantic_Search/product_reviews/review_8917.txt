The fit is great and it actually has &#34;full coverage!&#34; Gilligan O'Malley nursing bras from Target call thier nursing bra a &#34;full coverage&#34; bra, but my nursing breasts always fell out of the cup, to the point that I could not wear the bra without wearing a cami to hold myself together. This bra is great! I feel fully supported and the 3-hook design really adds to making the bra feel very secure. This is a fabulous nursing bra for a very reasonable price!
