I've bought these tights 3 times for my daughter to use in her 3/4 year old ballet class. After picking and running all 3 pairs with once a week use (usually on the 2nd or 3rd wear) I've resorted to buying the 1.99 tights at target and wouldn't you know it... they hold up. She has yet to run those. These are very nice looking but they seem to run faster than the cheaper tights.
