I am 6'1&#34; tall and am carrying about 30 extra pounds of weight. These fit great! The length is perfect--to the top of my knees (32&#34; inseam).  The legs are firm but not too tight. The bottom seams are slightly loose so they don't dig in and cut my circulation. I really like the weight of the material. It's a mid-weight. Slightly heavier than most summer shorts. Should be just right for my winter indoor tennis. The shorts are a brighter yellow than shown in the photo. Compares to a standard &#34;smiley face&#34; yellow. It looks mustard in the photo because it was shot on a black mannequin. Definitely a base short.
