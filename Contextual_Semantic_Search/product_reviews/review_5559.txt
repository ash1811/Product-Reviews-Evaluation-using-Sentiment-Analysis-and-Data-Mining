I purchased this for my brother's upcoming birthday. He's a diehard metal fan and especially loves Metallica so I'm sure he'll love this. For the price, I thought this was a great buy. The t-shirt is not overly thick which makes it perfect for hot summery weather, or it could always be worn under a sweater in cooler seasons. The picture on the front looks like its firmly in place, no peeling or anything, though I hope it remains the same after going through the wash. There's also a list of song titles from the album on the back. All in all, I think this is value for money.
