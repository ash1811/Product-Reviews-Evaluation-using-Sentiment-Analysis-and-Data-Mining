So I have a husband with a Charlie Harper style...even before the show existed.Think someone in Hollywood saw my husband and said that's what we want Charlie to wear. Problem was anytime he wore black he would have on any pair of his brown boat shoes....YUCK!!!! Now he matches much better with the black Sebago boat shoes. Ladies is you have a husband with the Charlie Harper style, these are the shoes to get him.
