This is one of the best shoes I have ever purchased in my life. I bought this shoe to use when I go cycling. It is comfy. It supports my feet when cycling like no sneaker can. My feet stay cool but my toes are protected. I love that. I also started wearing these for walking whenever I would go out shopping or anywhere really. They are very comfortable for walking. These shoes are easy to clean. I love, love, love these shoes. I would buy them in every color if I could. I'm a huge KEEN fan for life now. I would suggest that people wash the black shoes according to the directions in the box before they wear them. They did leave black marks on my feet. That's the only negative which can easily be solved by washing them before you wear them.
