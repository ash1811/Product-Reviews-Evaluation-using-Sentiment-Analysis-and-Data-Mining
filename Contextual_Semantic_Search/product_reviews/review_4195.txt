I bought this bra in 4 sizes (32 FF and G, and 34 FF and G), determined to get one that worked. Well, the 32FF fit best, and the cups nicely covered the whole bust area, but the underwires go up weirdly high in the center and kind of stabbed my sternum. (Some reviewers had this issue with the wires up under your arms, but I didn't have trouble there--only in the center.) This happened with all 4 of the sizes, so I think it's an issue of the make vs personal fit.Also, this definitely gives you a 50s torpedo shape to your bustline. Even with the underwire issue, it was pretty and priced well enough that I considered keeping it ... until I put on a shirt and looked in the mirror. Everything was very high, separated, and pointy. I know some women like that lift, but as a somewhat younger consumer (29) I prefer a more rounded, natural look.You also don't really get any cleavage line since everything is lifted so far apart. Again, that may be preferable for you.
