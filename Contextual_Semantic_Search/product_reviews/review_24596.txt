We bought these for the boys this Christmas and they just love them.  In fact, you can't get them off their feet!  They are SO warm, cushioned nicely, and they're not that cheapo nasty slipper that keeps your feel cold all winter.  These guys have some umph to them, and the sole is pretty hard.  Hard enough to get the mail without getting your feet soaked. Guess it pays to up the anty when you are buying slippers.  The suede is easily cleaned - just brush it off and go.  Can't say enough good about these - just glad I FINALLY found a pair that was worth the money.  I'll buy more when these wear out.  HIGHLY recommend!
