I had a stone washed denim shirt that I wore for 20 years, until the elbows wore out on the sleeves, then I cut the sleeves off and wore it to cut the grass and work around the property in, until it fell apart.  If this one lasts as long, and I'm sure it will, they can bury me in it.  There's no way I will be able to wear it outside during the summer months here on the MS Gulf Coast though...too hot and humid for the weight of this shirt, so I can't wait for cooler weather.  The fit and feel is perfect.  I think I finally found a replacement for my favorite shirt that I had to finally give up on a few years back!
