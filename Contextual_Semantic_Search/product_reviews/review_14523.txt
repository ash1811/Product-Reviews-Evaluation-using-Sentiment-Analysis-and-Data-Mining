I bought these for my husband that has a size 13 narrow foot. These are his first pair of Birkenstocks and he loves them. It is so hard to find a great shoe that fits him because of his foot size but these do. Even though these seem like they will hold up well, we will always know where to come back to when we need to get another pair of sandals.
