This bra is perfect for my growing teenager. She doesn't fall out of it and it looks great with her lower cut shirts. No cleavage but still beautiful and feminine. Very comfortable for her and she feels right in it! It fits just a tad small as she is a 36D and I get her a 36DD in this bra and its perfect on her. Love it!
