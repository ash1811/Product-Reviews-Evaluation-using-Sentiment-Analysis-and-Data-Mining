Looks good, feels good, well made. It can be difficult to find a good quality polo shirt with a pocket (to conveniently hold reading glasses or other small items) but this one fills the bill.  I bought several of different colors (greens & brown, I'm an earth tone) and I love them all. Great for looking a little extra spiffy at a technician job where most workers wear t-shirts.
