this coat can be worn in the field or to a meeting at the office.... it's good for the top floor of an open structure or the conference room or the shop.... keeps me VERY warm yet when unzipped is fine indoors.... GREAT BUY!.... the attachable hood stinks tho.... WAYYYYY TO SMALL! (see separate review)
