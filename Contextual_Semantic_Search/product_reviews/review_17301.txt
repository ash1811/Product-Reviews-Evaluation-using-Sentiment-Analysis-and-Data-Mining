I think I've been a Reef-only flip-flop woman for 15 years now. They are hands down the most comfortable flip-flop on the market. The only complaint I've ever had is that there aren't half-sizes. I'm an 8 1/2 medium, and the 8 usually fits fine after the straps stretch a bit, and the 9 feels great in the straps but has too much sole. I almost always opt for the 8 because I wear them to death and the canvas straps stretch nicely (but not so much that they fall off or anything). This is my first time buying suede over canvas, so I'm hopeful they'll stretch out as well. Still incredibly comfortable and no pinching or anything. LOVE Reef. I snub my nose at other brands and will until someone proves to me that theirs are better. :)
