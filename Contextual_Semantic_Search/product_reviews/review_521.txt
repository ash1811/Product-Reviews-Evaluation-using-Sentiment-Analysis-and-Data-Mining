I have had my wallet,card/ck book holder/attached coin purse for about 7 years. It is perfect for me. When my Mom saw it she loved it so of course I bought her one as a gift and she loved it. Then about 3 yrs ago her wallet was lost/stolen and she bought herself a different wallet that she didn't really like. Anyway, we all Prayed her wallet would be returned and 8 months later somebody put in in her mailbox!!!! Of course the $ was gone but her personal things were in tack.. Today she said she was looking for a new wallet because hers was a little shabby looking (mine is fine because I do 90% of my shopping "on-line" with Amazon. (no wear and tear shopping on line) My Mom said she looked in a few stores and wanted a wallet w/ the change purse attached and hasn't found one yet. Well of course I went on Amazon typed in buxton wallets and in 30 seconds I found our wallet. I called my Mom and just asked what color she wanted.. She said black would be just fine again.. I have just started my Christmas shopping!! Since my Mom doesn't ask for anything it's hard to buy something I know she would like AND use. So, thank you for still having this wallet on the market. I am going to fill up the credit card slots w/ store gift cards for Her. So a $21.00 plus gift turns into a $220.00 when it's opened. I also ordered the key chain/store scan card holder for her. (Mom doesn't keep her scan cards on her key chain so I think she might like it--I ordered it in red so its easy to find) I may just order myself another wallet just to save in case its discontinued... Great organizer/wallet...
