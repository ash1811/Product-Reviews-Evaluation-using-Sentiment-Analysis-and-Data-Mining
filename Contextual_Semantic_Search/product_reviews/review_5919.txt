I was recently in the hospital for a while and dug the socks they gave me. They were pretty comfortable, and definitely kept me from slipping (I was told that I had to wear them so the hospital would avoid a lawsuit). My parents have gotten at the age where I am concerned about their fragility, so I saw these and thought they would be a nice way to avoid any injuries.... and kind of gave them as a gag gift.Well, it's a good thing that they come in a giant bundle, because these things fall apart pretty much immediately. Walking around the house causes the pads to come off the sock. The hospital socks have a different material on the bottom to create the grip padding --- what these give you is more or less a sticker on a sock.I do NOT recommend these for anyone that things they're getting anything functional.
