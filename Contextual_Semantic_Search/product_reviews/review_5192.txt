I really like the functionality of the Ironman watches. I like this one in particular because it's on the smaller side. The watch features 3 alarms (with day-of-the-week options), 2 different count-down alarms (and one allows you to set multiple successive count downs of varying lengths), a stopwatch and 2 timezones. It's very easy to use, and gives instructions on how to set various things. I liked this watch so much that I bought a second after the first one broke.Unfortunately, every one of the Ironman watches I've owned have failed in the exact same way - the band. There are little rubber tabs that fit into the watch case, and they are the only thing that connects the band to the watch. If the rubber tabs get stretched or torn, then the watch case falls out. To be fair, the band is definitely comfortable, and the curvature of the band makes it fit sturdily without being too tight.The bands have lasted between 3-14 months, so I've been buying a new $30-$40 watch once a year (or so) for the past 6 years. I've been unable to find watch band replacements, and I'm not sure that I could do it myself anyway. The warranty specifically says that it does not cover any problems with the band of the watch. At this point, there's a clear financial incentive for Timex to pair awesome watches with bad bands. If you search the reviews for Ironman watches, so many people just buy a new watch when the watchband breaks, rather than try to get the band replaced. I'm boycotting the Ironman watches because of this.It looks like the Timex Expedition has most of the features I want, so that's what I'm going to get next.
