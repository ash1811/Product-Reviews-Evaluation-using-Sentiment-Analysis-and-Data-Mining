Immediately after receiving these slippers I put them on. Then I went out into the back yard to play with our two Great Pyr pups (100 lb & 130 lbs). They heard a dog bark on the next property and went tearing off, with me in hot pursuit in my new slippers. I probably ran about 6 acres through Canada Thistle, sage brush, AND CACTI GALORE. My point in telling all of this is that these slippers held up great. After getting home 45 minutes later I pounded them together to get all the various pointy/sharp plant matter off and put them back on. Ahhh, comfort.UPDATE:6 months later and the left toe has ripped out. After my first "run through the sagebrush" I have largely worn these shoes inside, with brief trips out to the trash can, et cetera. I would not buy them again, as I expect a bit more than 6 months of life, even out of slippers.
