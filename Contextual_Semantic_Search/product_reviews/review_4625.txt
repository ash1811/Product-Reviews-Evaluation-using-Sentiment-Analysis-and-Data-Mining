My husband wears Bib overalls to work in - heavy highway construction- because they do not bind.Very east to get in and out of for restroom breaks. Comfortable. Good price. Convenient shopping since these can be hard to locate in many stores. He has wore these couple of new pair we have for a few months. Color has stayed pretty well. No shrinkage.  Recommend.
