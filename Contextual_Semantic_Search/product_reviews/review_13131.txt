I like the Playtex bras.  I'm not huge, 36B, the fit is perfect for me.  Playtex  may have a bra with padding that would good to wear under tee shirts, but I haven't found it.  This one only has lining.  I don't mind the wide straps with shirts or tees with sleeves, but with sleeveless shirts and tanks the straps show and that bothers me.  This is a good bra and Amazon has them at a good price, I think.
