This is a nice shirt that should last you years, very durable!It has a bit too much polyester for my liking although that is likely what makes it so durable and easy to clean.It has great styling and stays tucked in (it's a bit long). For the price, if you need a work shirt, this is the one to get! I have this same shirt in 3 different colors and like them all.
