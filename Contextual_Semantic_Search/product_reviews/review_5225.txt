With this wallet I was downsizing from the larger wallets I've used for years.  No longer feeling it necessary to keep my checkbook in my wallet, I realized I could use a smaller one and take up less room in my purse.  I am very happy with my choice!  There are plenty of spaces for everything!  I would recommend this nicely-made wallet to anyone, and the seller did a great job.
