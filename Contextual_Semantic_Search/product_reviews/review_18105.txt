I usually love Sketchers and have been trying several styles to replace an old pair I have. These did not fill the bill. The stitching on the cross strap that had the Velcro rubbed a blister on me. The heel area is also a little big. The plus side of this shoe is that it has plenty of toe room. Unfortunately, I had to send them back.
