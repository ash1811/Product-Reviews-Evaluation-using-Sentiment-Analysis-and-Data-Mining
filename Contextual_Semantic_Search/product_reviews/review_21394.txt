Either it's 5 star or none with this bra. This is the classic toned-down bullet bra or simply the retro bra I've been hunting down.Support extends to the rib-cage which ALL bras lack nowadays. This particular bra has NO elasticity in the bra straps whatsoever, and only slight elasticity in the back. That is why you must know your true size. You can't wear two different sizes in this bra. The bra fits like a glove and cups the breasts perfectly. I usually alternate between 34C and 36B, but 36B is what I ordered and it is my true fit. 34C is only possible for me if I buy today's bras because of the &#34;stretch&#34;.This bra is the FIRST that I can actually SLEEP IN! It's very comfortable. Another GREAT thing about this bra is drying time! Since there is no padding, they dry so quickly!! The perfect travel bra too since they add NO bulk!Now, it's not the prettiest, so it's not something to brag about, but the &#34;fit&#34; is. I LOVE the way my clothes fall on my body since I've had these bras. I put ALL my &#34;other&#34; bras away. I have bras from VS, and department stores. I don't think I'll ever wear them again.Cons: I don't like that I had to &#34;tuck in&#34; the bra strap when I first adjusted it. BUT, I think it's a small inconvenience knowing that I will only do it once. I actually like the pads on the straps and tuck the loose bra strap under it.I purchased six of these particular bras. I love them and will probably stock up.
