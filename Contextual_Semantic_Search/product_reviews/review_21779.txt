I do not trust that the contents won't fall out of this bag.  Its sloppy and unstructured and has a difficult to use closure mechanism.  You have to weave the strap through a buckle (or let the strap hang and look tacky and trust the bag not to come open).  Who is going to do that in a hurry?  Even buckled, it never really feels closed, things can slip out the side.  The material and sewing seem sturdy and sound enough, but I just don't trust that I won't loose my smaller stuff out the cracks on the sides.
