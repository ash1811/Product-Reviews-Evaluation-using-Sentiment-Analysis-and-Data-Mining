Simple straight forward tension belt no velcro at all. The material is simple ballistic nylon weave belt. Metal tension buckle it nice and tough. The width of the belt is my only problem it really could be about a 1/4&#34; less to make it more comfortable and fit better in belt loops like jeans etc. This barely fits into my jeans due to the width of the belt. So its a solid belt but would be so much better if it was not as wide.
