After much research I found the (Campus) Frye Boots I wanted on Amazon.  I did a lot of price checking and found the boots for $236.00 instead of $299.00.  What a great deal!  I was a little hesitant not being able to try the boots on before I purchased them but when they arrived and I tried them on they fit like a charm!  Super comfortable and of course wonderful Frye quaility.I have purchased many items off Amazon and have been very satisfied with all.And, I saved a good deal of money for the same boots Nordstrom's sell for $299.00.  I call that SMART shopping!!
