My wife bought me this watch two Christmases ago. Accurate in keeping time, great looks, has been mistaken for those VERY high end &#34;Aviator's&#34; Chronograph's, Get compliments on it each time I wear it, which pleases my darling wife to no end ! To those gentlemen who are lucky enough to receive this time piece from their &#34;Better Half&#34;, you're in for a real treat, So guys : Do the right thing by them.............follow ? :)
