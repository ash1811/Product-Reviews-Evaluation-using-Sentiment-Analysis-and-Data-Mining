I hate wearing a watch on my wrist.  Seems when I'm in a meeting it looks too obvious when I turn my wrist to check the time.  With this watch hanging from my belt loop or my purse, I can easily look down, check the time, and no one knows I'm itching for the meeting to be over!!  Seems durable too.  And orange is my favorite color, so I could hardly stop myself from buying this item!!!
