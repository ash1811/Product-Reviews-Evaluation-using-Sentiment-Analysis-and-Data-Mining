These arrived today and are well made and very comfortable.  One caveat however is that the sole of the sneakers are very stiff.  If you plan to walk on slippery surfaces this may be an issue for you.  Overall though I like them but keep in mind to take care not to slip when walking on slick stairs, etc.
