these proved to be very soft, comfortable, and warm, i highly recommend these for cold legs!  after reading the reviews, they sounded like what i needed for an extended backpacking trip through some low mountains in March.  they were not necessary during the mild sunny days, or at night when i was zipped up in a very warm sleeping bag, but in the evenings when doing camp chores and the temperature quickly plunged from the 60s down to the 30s, i needed something to stave off the chill that my jacket and pants alone couldnt quite do.  i threw these on under my pants and when combined with my fleece and softshell tops i was quite comfortable sitting idle in the cold, still air. i have a bunch of old, &#34;polyblend&#34; thermal underwear that are completely outperformed by these, and i will never look back.  these are quite a bit more pricey but worth it especially if you can nab them on sale.  5 stars all the way.
