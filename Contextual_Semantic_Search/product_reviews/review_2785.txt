I live in Dallas Tx and ordered this item in spring thinking that I would put it away till the winter (all 3 days of it in the DFW area). Two days after it arrived my twins came home with soaking wet shoes and socks after attempting to jump every puddle on their way home from school. Their shoes were so wet that I knew that it would take days to dry even if I used the shoe rack inside of my front loader dryer so I decided to take this out of the box, put it together and give it a go. Assembly was a breeze, no issue at all. I like that it comes with the hardware to mount it to the wall if that is how you want to use it, I just put it together with the leg stand. Initially I had planned not to use it till winter of 2011 and thought our youngest child would be old enough by then that it would not pose temptation or danger. I tossed around having it on top of the table till I knew how hot to the touch it was when operating but we decided to plug it in in the kitchen and just block it off while it was in use/turned on. We plugged it in and it did not feel hot, a little warm but not hot. After 15 minutes the same and after 30 minutes the same. We placed both boys shoes on the tines(?) as shown in the instructions and left overnight. In the morning the boys shoes were completely dry, not hot or crisp and again I touched the unit and it was warm to the touch. I to buy a few more of these to have enough for the whole family's gloves and boots.
