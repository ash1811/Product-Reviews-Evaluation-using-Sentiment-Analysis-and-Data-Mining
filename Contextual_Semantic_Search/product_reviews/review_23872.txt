These glasses are super fresh. I have the small Wayfarer with the orange and purple. I have yet to see anyone else wearing them. Everyone wears the black wayfarers and its becoming too generic, but these ones allow you to enjoy the style of a wayfarer while still looking original.I'm guessing these glasses are unisex, I'm a guy and I don't think they look too feminine. I'm always getting compliments on them. For a $125 bucks they're pretty awesome.The lenses are not too dark from the outside so people can see a good amount of your eyes. Sometimes people ask me if they're sunglasses or just regular glasses. Looking out from them its great because the lenses aren't too dark so you can see a good amount of light and color for non-polarized sunglasses.The only reason I wouldn't recommend them is so that I can be the only one who has them.
