I bought the Mary Jane Sketchers to use as work shoes. Every time I walk, move my foot or ankle the leather on the top of the shoe makes noise/squeaks. I work in a quiet environment and the noise is very annoying. I'm hoping the leather softens up in time, cause it's driving me nuts! I DO like the adjustable straps that cross over the top of the shoe and it does run true to size. The shoe is stylish but are not as comfortable as other Sketcher styles. All in all I like the shoe, however I don't think it's really suitable for what I originally intended to use them for.
