Purchased more out of need than want but this is a nice wallet.  The quality of the leather is a step above my expectations for the price-point.  Initially, the pockets all seemed very tight but this is genuine leather and it stretched into the perfect size after a day or two.  The design is very plain, the logo is discrete.
