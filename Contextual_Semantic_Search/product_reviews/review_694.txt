Since a few customers have commented that the quality has changed- and I have NOT found this to be the case, I want to include some information from a comment by one of the sellers.  It will be after my own review.  I have worn these gowns for more than 20 years.  I used to purchase them at Dillard's Dept. Stores, but they quit selling them some years ago.  I was so happy to find them available here on Amazon because absolutely NOTHING I have found, for any amount of money, has been as nice as the Shadowline.  The pale pink, peach, and periwinkle are not quite as opaque as the other colors but I do not find anything unusual about that (think white pants!).  If you find the darker colors to be too revealing, you should probably consider flannel nightgowns. Just saying. :-)___________________Shoppers please note: There was a short period of time (late 2011) when Shadowline used a different fabric for the Petals gowns in Holly Red and Deep Lavender. It was not as nice as their traditional Opacitrique fabric. When they changed this in 2012 (and changed the color names to Red and Purple), the listings got mixed up here and were combined into the same page (for Purple and Deep Lavender). ALL of the new Petals gowns are made from the same fabric now, which is their trademarked Opacitrique fabric--the original Shadowline Petals fabric. The new owner is extremely picky about the quality of his products. And I believe the Deep Lavender and Purple are now the same gowns. If you have doubts, it is a simple matter to contact the seller of whichever size & color you are viewing and ask them whether it is Opacitrique fabric: select a size and color, then click on the seller's name that shows up. On the right side of the page, scroll down to the link that says Contact Seller. Hope this helps!
