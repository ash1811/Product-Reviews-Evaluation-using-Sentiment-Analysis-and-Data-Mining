Don't be dissuaded from buying this because of the low price. This is a nice little necklace especially for a young lady. No it is nothing fancy but it does the job. The first one I bought as a gift to use with a small pendant broke after 2 months but my friend asked for a replacement of the same necklace because she liked it so much.
