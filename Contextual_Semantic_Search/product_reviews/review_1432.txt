I was discussing survival techniques with an Army officer who recommended Thorlo socks for warmth. I bought some for that purpose, for power outages, cold Winter weather, etc., and never have wanted any other kind since. They last for years and I wear them every day, Winter and Summer, usually without shoes since I work from home, sometimes with shoes on 3-mile walks. These are everything I want in a sock. I highly recommend them.Be careful to choose the right color.
