I got these as a gift for Christmas! They wonderful: warm, comfortable, and fit perfectly. Initially they were very snug but stretched over a couple of nights to what is now a perfect fit! For the first time in 20 winters, my feet are warm and feel great! My house is cool in the winter but now I don't care. I agree that this is a heck of lot of money for a pair of slippers but hopefully they'll last for a few years. I need to go to the UGG web site for cleaning instructions but that is my only concern. If they come on sale or a coupon becomes available I will buy another pair for myself to back these up - they are that great!!!!
