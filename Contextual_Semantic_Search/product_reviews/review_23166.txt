For someone that works on their feet 12 hours a day, these shoes are amazing when I'm off the clock.  I bought a similar pair (closed) to wear at work at are by far the best investment I've made for my feet in a very long time.  The comfort I have with them cannot compare to anything, not even the custom made orthodics!  Will definitely be buying another pair soon.  :)
