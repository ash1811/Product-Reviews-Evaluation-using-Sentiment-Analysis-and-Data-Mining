The moment I put the shoes on, was well pleased.  So comfortable.  Been wearing for a few hours and they feel like an old friend already.  The size was perfect.  I like these much better than the New Balance just purchased for the same price.  It was past time for my old Nikes and the fit and feel of these shoes make me wonder what took so long to get new shoes.Athletic shoes are ridicules in price, these are so reasonable, was concerned the quality might be second rate or fit oddly.  I'm tempted to get another pair, but I have exceeded my budget for shoes.&#8203;
