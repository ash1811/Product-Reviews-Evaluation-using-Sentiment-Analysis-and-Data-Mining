This backpack is huge!!  That was a pleasant surprise.  I wanted to get her something that would last after a Justice bag she just HAD to have fell apart after 6 months of use.  The zebra print is right up her alley and the backpack has LOTS of great pockets & compartments for everything a 4th grader needs for school.  I just hope she doesn't outgrow the cute pattern.. because I think this pack will last her a long time!
