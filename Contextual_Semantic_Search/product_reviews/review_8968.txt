This bra does exactly what it says it does and quickly became a staple in my wardrobe. Unfortunately it does have 2-3 shortcomings that keep it from being perfect. One, there is a contouring side-seam in the lace layer that does show through some tops. Given that the bra cup itself is seamless, this is particularly irritating. Two, the bra cup, while comfortable, is a thin stretch material and not very supportive; nor does it provide any protection from nipple show-through (although the lace texture and the unfortunate side-seam do provide a little camouflage in that area).
