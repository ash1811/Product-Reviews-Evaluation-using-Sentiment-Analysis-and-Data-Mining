Good product not fancy  I am 6ft 3 in  I ordered the 2xl tall was a good decision nice and long sleeves and body of sweater is long going well down covering my hips and then some  Not fancy but good al around throw on when a little cool  I have only had for a few weeks  time will tell if it holds up  But all in all  a good product .  I only gave it a 4 as to me the zipper seems a little light but todate I have had no problem with it
