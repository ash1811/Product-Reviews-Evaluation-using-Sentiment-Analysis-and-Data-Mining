These pants are made to last. My husband owns a home improvement company and these are the best jeans we have found. They are high quality; not seconds. The material is thick which they will last forever. Washed two pair and they didnt fade or wrinkle. They look brand new still. Very pleased with the short time it took to get them too, highly recommend.
