I used Domke bags several years ago when I worked as a news photographer.  The design was/is one of the best around for a bag to work out of rather than just to carry equipment.  I liked the bag for its "floppiness" and its ability to mold itself to your body when carried.  The biggest problem with the bags--and I saw this in virtually every Domke bag being carried by news photographers at the time--was that they wore through due to friction.  Carrying it every day meant it rubbed against your side and mine eventually wore a big hole in the back.  The only other problem I had with the bag was the lack of weather proofing.  Being cotton, when they got wet they stayed wet for a long time.I switched to a waterproofed nylon bag but it had its own problems.  Zippers wore out and the rough nylon rubbed against and wore spots on my jackets.Bottom line is--there is no perfect camera bag.  The best I've found has been the Billingham brand (those are 5-star bags).  They are dense-weave cotton with a waterproofing applied.  They don't wear as easily and they don't absorb water.  They're as easy to work out of as a Domke.  They cost a LOT more, however.I like the Domke bags as a less expensive alternative to the Billinghams.  I still like to transport equipment in heavily padded, waterproof nylon bags but, more often than not, I'll carry a Domke or Billingham canvas bag when I'm actually shooting photos.
