This is not ocean blue, it looks like dark turquoise or perhaps aquamarine,  there is too much green in it to be ocean blue.  It is not what is pictured.  On the other hand, I've never had a SPF 30 shirt before, so maybe there's something to that.  It fits and looks great.  I'll keep this one but remember not to buy from them again.
