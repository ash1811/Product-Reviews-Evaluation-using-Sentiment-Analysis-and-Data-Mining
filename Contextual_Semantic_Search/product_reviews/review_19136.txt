I ordered these earrings after buying, and loving, the white and pink pairs (SCER155 10mm White Genuine Swarovski Pearl And Swarovski Crystals Silver Leverback 1.5" Long Drop Earrings).  I was looking for a dangle earring to go with my black pearls, but as another reviewer pointed out, these are actually a pale gray.  The Amazon item picture is not that far off, but I uploaded a picture next to a pair of cultured black pearl studs and you can see the stark difference.  Despite that, these are beautiful earrings!  I wear them with black cz studs to match the crystals.These are nice quality for simulated pearls and I think they are worth the price. The leverbacks are very secure, so I don't worry about losing one as I do with french hooks.  Overall, highly recommended and I think I'll be buying the blue pair next!
