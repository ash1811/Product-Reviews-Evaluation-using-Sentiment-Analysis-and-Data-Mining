Keeps in place when I'm running or just lounging around.  Size is pretty true to fit as well.  Doesn't shrink when u wash it either.  It accentuates the curves on your bum so that makes it even more better.  Got 2 front pockets that are nice and can keep small things in it.  Will buy again in different color next time.
