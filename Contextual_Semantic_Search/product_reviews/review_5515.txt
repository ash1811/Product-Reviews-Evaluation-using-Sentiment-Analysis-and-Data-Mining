Good fit, although I took others suggestions about the length and they were dead on. If you typically wear a 32 in the length get a 30" and you'll be good. I found the waist to be true to size. The pants are comfortable, maybe a touch lightweight for the winter but I get cold easier than most. Otherwise very comfortable, they have pleanty of room in legs and the rise is roomy. All in all they look nice and I love the cargo pockets. I would reccomend these to anyone
