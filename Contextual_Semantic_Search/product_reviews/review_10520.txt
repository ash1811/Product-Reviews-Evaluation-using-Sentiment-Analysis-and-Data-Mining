I buy Wrangler jeans regularly. These jean fit a little tighter than most other jeans on my hips. I just delete the belt and all is good to go. All Wrangler jeans are about 1 inch longer than the size that you order (IMHO). If you are a 34 length.....Get a 33 length jean. If you are normally a 32 inch jean......get a 31 inch jean or you will be rolling up your pant legs. Have a Merry Christmas to all readers.
