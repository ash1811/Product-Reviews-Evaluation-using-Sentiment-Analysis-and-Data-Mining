I have not found anything wrong with these and the clasps hold well. I have not washed them yet and when I do, I will hand wash. I will caution to consider wearing a shirt over these and if you don't, to be conscious that you will tear up or scratch the leather on the back of your car seat or chair. When you have done that, you won't be happy and "no" your mechanic did not do it.
