These shirts were comfortable but a bit looser than expected and too much too tuck into jeans/khakis. I think these are closer to a arizona/jockey size large than a size medium, which I had anticipated being about the same measurements. If you usually wear a medium in white shirts, I'd suggest the small, or at least washing and drying these super hot if you're afraid to get too small of a fit with a small size.
