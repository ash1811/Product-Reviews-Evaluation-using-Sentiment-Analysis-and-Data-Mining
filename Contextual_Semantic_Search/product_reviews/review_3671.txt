I bought these thinking 'What a nice color'. Little did I realise that the dye used for this color has a really unpleasant smell. I washed them repeatedly in my very efficient and eco-friendly Asko washer, but the smell remained. If the jeans were mixed with other laundry, the odor would contaminate the other clothes. So, they were returned to Amazon. Thankfully, they accepted them.(This, in many years of online purchase, has been my only return).I wish I could say something better, but the truth must be told.
