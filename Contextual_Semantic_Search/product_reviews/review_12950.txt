I have worn this style ever since they started making &#34;relaxed&#34; fit Levi's.  They feel comfortable from day one.  This pair feels - almost comfortable - There is something short about the back and when I bend over they pull at the waistband of my underwear.  Most annoying.  I'm pretty sure that these jeans are cut and sewn to the company's specifications but, as in all things assembled, slight differences occur.  I'm sure these are one of those pair whose pattern was cut slightly off and sewn slightly off, as well.  I will still wear them but they will not be &#34;my favorite pair.&#34;
