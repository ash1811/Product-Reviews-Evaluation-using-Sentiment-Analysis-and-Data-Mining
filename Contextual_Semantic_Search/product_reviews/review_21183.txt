I love these flip flops. Sandals aren't really made for long distances, but I can wear these for a mile without any real complaints. They are so comfy, I will continue buying. I actually purchased the men's beer cozy (I believe to be the same material) for my boyfriend and dad. Neither of which a flip flop type guys, but they love these! Five stars all the way!
