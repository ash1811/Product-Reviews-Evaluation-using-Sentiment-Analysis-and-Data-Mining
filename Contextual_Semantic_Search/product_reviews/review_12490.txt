Keds are kind of trendy right now as a spring/summer shoe, and I wanted a pair to wear with dresses and on the weekends. They look perfect - slim, perfect color, and the sole looks aesthetically thin like I wanted it to. The cons are that the padding isn't terribly thick, and the vamp is a little lower than I would have wanted, so my socks show. Overall, I still really like them, they just aren't quite perfect.
