The cushioning and arch support on these slippers are the most comfortable I've ever experienced with a thong slipper. This is my third pair. I work from home, so I live in these. The rubber soles hold up, but the cloth foot bed becomes threadbare from the continuous washing and wearing. I am a 9.5N shoe, and the Large 8-9 is a good fit. Thank you, Acorn, for happy feet!
