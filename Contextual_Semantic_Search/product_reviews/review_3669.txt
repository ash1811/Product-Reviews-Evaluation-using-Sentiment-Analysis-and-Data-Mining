Levi's jeans remain a reliable and consistent staple. This Levi's Men's 505 Straight (regular) fit jean retains quality fabric and classic styling. The legs are not too narrow or too wide. The design is comfortable, classy, and no-nonsense. These jeans are versatile, and can be dressed up or down. We personally can not abide passing fashion trends, with guys wearing girlfriend-style jeans, or rolled-up cuffs. In contrast, Levi's jeans are cool and timeless, like the Rolling Stones and ZZ Top. They work for men whether urban or country. Enjoy!
