I've owned a lot of pairs of shoes in my day. I'm mainly a converse/vans/toms girl but I loved the look of these and they are a classic.  This was my very first pair of Sambas, and they are very high quality leather and I can tell now why they are a classic. They are lightweight and feel like they are barely there, which is a feature I am more than happy to brag about. I am so glad I chose these over the "original" version due to the arch support and tongue that does not squeak. I feel that this will certainly not be my last pair of Sambas, but I can tell it will be a long time before I have to buy another pair of these babies due to the high quality materials. This may even be my go to shoe over my converse!
