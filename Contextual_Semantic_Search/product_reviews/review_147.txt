This watch screams high-tech, and anyone venturing off to a comic book convention is bound to get a few nods from people dressed in Sith Lord garb and even a wicked witch or two.So it's big, real big, but cool.  If you want a little more discreet, go with the Observer.The new synthetic band that has replaced the leather is a real improvement.  After all, whoever heard of a sports watch with a leather band?  The idea is absolutely absurd.  HOWEVER, the back eyelit got chafed and worn away the first two weeks.  Of course, it doesn't show, but it's annoying, especially considering this isn't an el cheapo watch.If you're into mountain biking, running, swimming, hiking, or training of any sort, this is the watch for you.  It doesn't have super sports specific functionality, but in my experience I've never used stuff like that in any case, so this watch accomodates me perfectly.And women DROOL over it.  Well, sorta.
