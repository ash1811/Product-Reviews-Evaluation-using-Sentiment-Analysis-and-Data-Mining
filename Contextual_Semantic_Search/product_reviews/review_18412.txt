What a great pirate chest! The colors are fine, it looks like an old chest. the clasp is a cool skull with two different jewel colored eyes.The quality is just fine. Our son is 3 and he has played with this chest since Christmas and hasn't had a problem. I made sure to have some small wood screws and hinges on hand in case he did break the lid off as other reviewers stated, but we haven't needed them. (I am concerned the skull clasp may break before anything else).The coins it comes with are pretty cheesie but we bought it for the chest not the things that come with it. The eye patch is pretty cool though, its not the single rubberband type, it actually has a velcro closure and is real material all the way around.Our son loves his pirate treasure chest and he loves using the false bottom. Of course you can tell it has a false bottom, its a toy and is designed for kids to be able to use. (Its not gonna hide your real stuff from anyone...lol some reviews crack me up).Recommend this toy for your pirate loving kids!
