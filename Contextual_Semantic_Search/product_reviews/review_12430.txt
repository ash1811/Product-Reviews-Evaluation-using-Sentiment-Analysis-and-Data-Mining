I have had several of these Skagen watches and love them. They are very thin and lightweight. They come in many different styles and colors to suit your taste. The reason I go through so many of them is that I wear them while  doing yard work and various repairs with power tools and I never take my watch off except to clean it. Therefore, the watch gets a lot of ware. But since the price is so low I can replace it every couple of years as needed.Try this beautiful and reliable watch and I think you will be glad you did.
