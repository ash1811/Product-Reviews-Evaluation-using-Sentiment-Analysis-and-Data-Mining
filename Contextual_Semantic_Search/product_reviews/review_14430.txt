I got this for my wife as she works out a lot.  After three months the band broke.  I contacted Timex and they never responded.  It was past the time to return to Amazon.  In reading more reviews on other websites the band is poorly made and breaks on a lot of people who never hear back from Timex.  This is not a good product at any price
