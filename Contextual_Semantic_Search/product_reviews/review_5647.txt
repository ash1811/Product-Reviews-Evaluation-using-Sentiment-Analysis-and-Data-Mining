Really, I should have added a few more "O"s to LOOOOVE - that's how much I love this product. It's comfortable and easy to get on and off - and unless you have exceptionally big (or small) ears this will fit you. If you're worried about this looking "unprofessional" - it doesn't! (And I'm honestly surprised by that!) It's really discrete and very pretty. I've been wearing mine for a few days now and hasn't fallen off once. My one gripe (and I gave it 5 stars despite this) is that the plastic case it came in was cracked on both sides. I threw the case away and kept the earring but it probably wouldn't be such a bad thing if these were shipped in boxes rather than the padded envelope I received mine in.
