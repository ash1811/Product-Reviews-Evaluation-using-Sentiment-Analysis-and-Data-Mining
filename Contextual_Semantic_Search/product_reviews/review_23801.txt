These Ray-Bans were a great purchase.  Though I usually buy cheap sunglasses, I decided to pop for these Ray-Bans, and I am glad I did.  They are made very well and are quite comfortable to wear.  They do a great job blocking out the sun too!  They also came with a hard-sided case that protects them very well when they are not being worn.
