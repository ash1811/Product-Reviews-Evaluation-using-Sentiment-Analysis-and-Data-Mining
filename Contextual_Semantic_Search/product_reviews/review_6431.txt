My husband loves these shirts!  They do, however, run a size smaller than what one normally wears.  Typically, an XL fits my husband, but he needed a XXL in these.  The sleeve length is great, the quality of the fabric is very good and when I had an issue with a defective shirt (spots on the back), the company was superb to work with .  Highly recommend!
