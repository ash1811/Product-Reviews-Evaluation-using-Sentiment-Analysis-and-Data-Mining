They are very cute and I kept them because I can wear them, but they are very snug.  Hoping they will loosen up in time because they are a great color and I love the embroidered design.  Maybe good advice is to order up a size, but it depends on foot structure. I have a broad toe, narrow heel and high instep.  Next time I'll order up a size.
