The sneakers fit fine but the material that covers the top of your foot digs into your foot so bad. I wore them one time and had to stop at a store and buy myself a pair of flip flops because I could not stand the pain anymore. I wish I would have wore them around the house before so that I could have returned them for a refund. I am so mad I just threw out all this money on such a crappy pair of sneakers.
