I had been buying Wolverine Boots Steel Toes for my husband  they are nice boots but they didn't last any longer than a year, The leather would always wear off the toe where the steel is. otherwise they where ok, But I decided to try these cat boots to see if they would last longer. So far they are doing great and with standing the harsh situations in which he works in and the toes are doing great so far.
