I ordered one of these shirts for my husband thinking it would be similar to the &#34;beefy t&#34; that he likes.  It's actually not much heavier at all than the regular weight gray t shirts you buy in the packs.  It's definitely not like the beefy t weight.  If you're looking for something oh so slightly heavier than the regular ones then this is for you.
