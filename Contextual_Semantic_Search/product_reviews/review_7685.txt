I needed suspenders to hold up my jeans better than a belt.As I've gotten older my hips are smaller than my belly. I've had the heavy duty things from buiding supply companies & you just can't rely on them to really hold. I ran across these on Amazon & when I saw that they hooked on the belt, I knew I had to try a pair.They're pretty good. Although they do have 3 faults, for me anyway, that keep me from giving them 5 stars.The clip in back I have no problem with, but the ones in front are very hard to get started on a thick belt like you usually wear with jeans. The clips might work on a lighter dress belt but these things seem to be targeted toward tradesmen who would be used to wearing a heavier belt. The other problem I have is that I wished they were made from stiffer elastic. They don't hold up my jeans as well as I'd like them to. This brings up the final flaw.I've adjusted them higher & higher trying to get the support I need for my pants & if I'm active at all, they keep slipping in the adjustment buckles.After I find the right adjustment to keep my pants up right, I'm going to put rivets through them so they'll stay.These suspenders work better than anything else I've ever had but, they're not percect.THIS IS AN ADD-ON TO MY ORIGINAL REVIEW... At the time I bought these, I didn't realize they made 2" suspenders. I'm going to get a pair of them & see if that fixes my gripes.
