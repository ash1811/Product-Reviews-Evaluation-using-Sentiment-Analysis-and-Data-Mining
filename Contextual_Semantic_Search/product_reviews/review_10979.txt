Very bright and the fit was perfect.  Nice house dress - light breathable fabric that washes nicely.  She'll have this one for a long time - wish it came in more print options!  She can carry her cell phone in the pocket and the collar is a nice addition which makes it look a little more dressy than just a plain house dress.  She loved it!
