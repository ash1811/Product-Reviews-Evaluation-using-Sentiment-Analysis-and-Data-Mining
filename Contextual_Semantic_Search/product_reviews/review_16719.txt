After reading the reviews, thought I'd take a chance.  I bought 1 size above (as most suggested, and correctly I might add) the size I would normally buy. Well, the top of the outfit is perfect, however to lower part, bottom of outfit flairs out and does not cling on my hips like it shows on the model, which would have made it perfect.  It clings some but not enough to create the sexy look that the model has.  I'll have to take it in (taper) on each side about 1+1/2 inches.  I decided to wear it with a skirt and my hubby really liked it, the breast area is super sexy, and the holds you up pretty good. Not perfect but almost.
