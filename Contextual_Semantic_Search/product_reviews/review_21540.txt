I love Baggallini bags.  I have five now, I believe!  They have so many little storage places.  I really like the weight of them - very light - especially for use when traveling.  I haven't actually used this bag yet.  I purchased it for travel and haven't done so yet.  I think it will be great.  I wanted something for the plane that would hold a lot but not be super heavy.  I have a canvas bag, but even without anything in it, it is heavy.  These bags wipe down nicely.  I think this will also &#34;crush&#34; enough to slide under the plane seat.  Definitely recommend most any Baggallini bag.
