After having 3 pairs of thee most famous jeans in the world fail prematurely due to shoddy construction and stitching, I reluctantly decided to try these Carhartt's.  They have held up exceptionally well (this being my 2nd pair) and have been plagued with none of the problems I experienced with those other maker's jeans.  Fit is good, sizing accurate, wear exceptional.
