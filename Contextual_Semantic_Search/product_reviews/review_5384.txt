I really like these bibs. I'm 6'4&#34; and 240 lbs. so its always been kinda hard to find clothes that fit me. Now that I've gotten a bit older, 55, I have a bit of a beer belly going so it was a bit difficult deciding what size of these to order. My jeans are 38x34 and a bit tight but 40x34 jeans fall off my butt. I really need a 39 waist jeans but they don't make that size. Any who, tired of ill fitting jeans that are either too tight or fall off, and I ain't a fan of the droopy pants showing my underwear, I thought I'd go for some bibbies. It would be nice if they had these in a 34 length but with the straps out all the way these are ok. I probably should have ordered the 42 waist but I can do with these any who.These bibs are very well stitched and are made from nice heavy fabric so they should wear for years. The stripes are pretty cool looking too. They make me look a lot taller and kinda hide me beer belly I've grown too. So if you're looking for something comfortable to work in in the shop or around the yard or just kicking back these are great.
