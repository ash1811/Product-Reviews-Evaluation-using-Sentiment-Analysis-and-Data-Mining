I bought this pant long time ago... Maybe a couple of years ago... And definitely... It's my favourite Adidas pant ever... !!! I wear it almost everyday... It's fantastic to exercise... Or simply take a walk around the block... The fabric is GREAT and comfortable... Nice fit and colors... Maybe It's a little baggy... But that's not big deal because I like that way... A lot of room on my legs... In fact... I ordered a few days ago a new one in Black... 100% Recommended.
