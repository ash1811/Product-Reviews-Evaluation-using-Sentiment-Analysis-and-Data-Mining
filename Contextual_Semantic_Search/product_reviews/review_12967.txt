I've experimented with a couple of the different color choices, like tumbled rigid, but they mostly have thin-feeling, cheap, and rough/scratchy fabric.Rinse, on the other hand, is normal heavy-ish denim, dyed very dark indigo (color comes off when you wipe with a damp rag, even after a washing).I buy them dark, wear them until they get holes in the knees, and then patch them and use them for yard work. By that point they look like a medium stonewash (maybe 20-30 washings max).they don't shrink much though, so I don't think it's raw denim.
