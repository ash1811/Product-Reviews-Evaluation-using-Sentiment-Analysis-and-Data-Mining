After becoming pregnant, I needed some new bras.  I got a couple styles, but this one is by far my favorite.  The support is great and the underwire doesn't dig into me like some of the others I bought.  This bra is comfortable to wear all day and looks good, even in a larger size.  I will definitely be ordering another of this style.
