I just used this bag to go to Vegas.  Really nice bag.  It held 3 sports coats, 3 pairs of jeans, and 3 shirts on the hanger.  I did not use any of the other compartments to keep the weight down.  My only complaint was the handle not having a push button.  It got quite annoying it falling down when I let go or tried to push it backwards.  If it had a button handle I would have given it 5 stars.
