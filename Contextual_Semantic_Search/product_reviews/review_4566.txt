Alright, the first thing you need to be aware of when buying Dickies clothes is this: Their sizes are true-to-measurement. That is, if you put a measuring tape around your "waist" (wherever you wear your trousers), and look at that number, that's the measurement you want to buy your trousers in. I used to buy trousers at Old Navy, where they size things way differently. Their size 38 is actually closer to a 40 or 41 (maybe even 42). Not so with Dickies.  So when you buy Dickies trousers, you may have to estimate upward a bit, or better yet, just put a tape measure around wherever you wear your pants, just to be sure.Okay, now that that's out of the way, the trousers themselves are great, but you're going to want to wash them once before wearing them for an extended period of time. They arrive in a very tight and stiff state, a little scratchy and rough. So just wash them once and they'll be much more comfortable to wear. They're sturdy, comfortable, nicer than traditional dickies work trousers in that their fit is a bit more modern and loosely cut. They actually sit at my hips, rather than at my waist (which is how I prefer to wear my trousers.They're really solid, basic trousers, and if you look around a little you can find them in some cool colors, including some pretty wacky colors. I recommend them highly if you're a guy who wants something other than jeans that can pass for "office" wear but are still comfortable and durable.
