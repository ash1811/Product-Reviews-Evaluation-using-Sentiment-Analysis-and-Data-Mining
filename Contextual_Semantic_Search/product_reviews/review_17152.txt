I just received my slippers today at my work address and couldn't wait to get home to put them on and see if all the reviews were what I expected.  I am SO pleased! I have bad kness, a sore heal and recovering from a broken toe. I wish I could wear these to work tomorrow as in a matter of 2 hours right now I know I am going to order a few more pairs (just to have). My foot is a 9 to a 9 1/2 so I got the 9 1/2 to 10 1/2 and its a great fit.. a little long but the front is snug enough and I will check to see what other foot wear Acorn may make. The foot cushion is great. I didn't even realize the price when I orderd and I didn't care and these little "puppies" are worth every penny I spent. Thanks to whoever designed/made them! Have a Blessed Thanksgiving! I think I may just bring them with me to my Mom's house on Thanksgiving so I can help out and be comfortable!!! GOOD JOB!
