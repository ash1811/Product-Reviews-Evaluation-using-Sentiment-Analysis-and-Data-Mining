I originally ordered two of these one red one white, I got the white one first and decided to return the red one before I received it. The ties in back are confusing and it still doesnt fit right and the fabric is cheap. Plus I didnt' think about it before hand but wouldn't you rather have matching panties than a padded hanger. I should have spent more, you pay for quality I guess. Wouldn't recommend
