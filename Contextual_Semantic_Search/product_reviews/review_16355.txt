I just can't get away from this Bali bra.  When I try to branch out and buy another brand/style, I find myself going to back to this Bali the next time I buy.  First, it has no underwires, so nothing to poke me in uncomfortable places.  The support is solid.  In this latest iteration, the issue I had with the straps (fold over &#34;ribbon&#34; that tended to separate and scratch at the bottom) is resolved:  the strap is now one solid piece of fabric.  The four hook back is secure and comfortable.  Second, this bra wears and wears and wears and wears if I throw it in the washer (cold/cold) and hang to dry.  Then there's the price:  I used to buy them on sale, for ~$26 at a major department store.  The price on this site, just under $20, beats that hands down.  As far as I can tell, this is exactly the same bra and not a knock-off.  I am a 36D.  I highly recommend this bra.
