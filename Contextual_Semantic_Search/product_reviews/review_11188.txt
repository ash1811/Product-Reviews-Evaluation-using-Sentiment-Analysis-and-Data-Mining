These are so classic, they're going on five plus years for Keen. So comfortable. Half shoe, half sandal. Sturdy, solid, functional, and did I say comfortable? When I first got these, they made my size 6.5 feet look like duck feet, and I had to return them. I think they might have been uni-sex sizing in the beginning and were almost as wide as I am tall. The pair I just bought are a women's 6.5 and although wide looking, but not eye-poppingly wide looking, and fit better. I recommend these for walking around town or walking in the surf. So comfortable...
