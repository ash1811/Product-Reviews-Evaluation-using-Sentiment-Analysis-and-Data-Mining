Very nice bag. The outer pocket does not match the picture. :(  Not quite big enough for what I wanted though. I kept it but i really needed a bag to take on the plane with me....so tired of heavy back packs. I ended up with the Patagonia MiniMass. The Baggallini just wasn't big enough for all these items:  ipad, full size Bose headphones, a paperback book, small toiletries bag, glasses case  and odds and ends.
