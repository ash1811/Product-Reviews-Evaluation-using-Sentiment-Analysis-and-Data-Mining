A self winding movement relies on a half circle of metal that revolves around a central axis to periodically wind the main spring that keeps the watch ticking, in this particular seiko model there is a tendency for the tightening nut on the weight to come loose, whether by design defect or poor workmanship I am not qualified to say, but it is a regular problem with these watches, within months to a few years the weight will loosen until it can no longer revolve and wind the watch.When this happened to mine, I carefully unscrewed the back with a watch tool wrench,( you may also use fine nose pliers through a cloth) and being careful to not dislodge the rubber gasket, carefully re-tighten the copper colored metal nut over the weight's axis. Carefully reseal your watch, do not dislodge the rubber gasket.This seems to be the only major defect in this watch, and only affects a small percentage within the first 5 or so years, though I believe it will affect close to 100% of these watches within a decade of regular use. The big issue is service. Even if you can get a watch repair facility ( very tough nowadays) the cost of this simple repair will set you back over a hundred bucks.In all other regards this is a beautiful watch, but it is an mechanical watch, inherently inaccurate, always the potential for failure due to a myriad of moving parts. The buyer of a mechanical watch is buying an modern antique, and must understand the limitations of old tyme technology: you will be resetting the time every couple of days for accuracy, you will not subject the watch to excessive shock due to impact, and so on.I bought this watch because my first watch was an automatic seiko, and I wore a automatic seiko diver through the mid seventies into the nineties with no problems( a gift from my dad)with many great memories, I did not buy this watch for its accuracy, toughness or durability compared to modern eco-drives or quartz watches,( I have a great citizen for actually diving and ocean swimming)but because I like having a piece of 'high tech' from when I was young, pure nostalgia.If you don't mind learning a little basic watch maintenance and repair, and appreciate the skull sweat that went into making a collection of gears and spring into an reasonably accurate time piece, and love a really big, heavy, manly watch, this is for you. Otherwise stick to the ecozilla or other quartz divers and you'll be happier.
