Sturdy seams, strong fabric, no loose stitching. A bit larger than I thought it would be, butthat's not a fault in a jacket... fulfilled a dress code requiring white tops and still let me sneak inthe occasional white-based light print scrub top underneath.., and added2 more roomy pockets for all my assorted nurse stuff and pencollection... great product!
