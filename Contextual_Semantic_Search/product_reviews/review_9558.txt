I ordered the prewashed indigo version of these jeans in a size 36x34.I took advantage of the free shipping offered by Amazon and received thejeans in about 5 days.They were well packaged and arrived in perfect condition.The jeans fit perfectly and looked and felt really good.I have worn Levi's 550 jeans for about 20 years, but these are the jeansI will be wearing from now on.They fit better than the 550's and I likethe hue of the Wrangler indigo better then the Levi's indigo color.The rivets on the back pockets are also quite cool.There are also7 belt loops instead of the 5 loops Levi's now uses.The coin pocket on theWranglers is much larger than the Levi's pocket and can actually be usedfor something.The Wranglers have higher back pockets than Levi's,and the Wranglers front pockets are are not as deep as the Levi's.Also, the Wranglers are about half the price of a similar pair of Levi's.
