OK  so I am a 34 waist in jeans and when I bought the 34 waist in Dickie pants, they were tight. I had to buy a 36 instead to fit me right. The length is good no problem with that, but not the waist. I've experienced this for years and it's something I noticed about these pants. The quality and material is good. They last and whatnot, but the waist size is just the problem. Overall I say 3 stars.
