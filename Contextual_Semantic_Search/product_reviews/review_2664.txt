This watch was purchased for my husband.  His old Timex was very similar and recently stopped working.  He really liked this watch because it wasn't digital and had the day/date.  It looked just like his old watch but when he received it he realized the watch face was just a bit smaller than the old one and he really like that.  He said his old one always felt too big on his wrist.  All in all he was very happy with this purchse.
