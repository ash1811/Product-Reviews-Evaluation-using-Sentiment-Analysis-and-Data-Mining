This bra is much more comfortable than I had expected. I found the sizing perfect in the cups, but the it does run a little small in the band. I usually wear a 38 DD, but because Amazon didn't offer this bra in a DD in a 38, I sized up. Good thing too, because there is no way the 38 would have fit. However, since I did order a size up, it does fit just fine. I wore it all day shopping and didn't have to tug at my straps even once. I forgot I was even wearing it!  I definitely recommend this item.
