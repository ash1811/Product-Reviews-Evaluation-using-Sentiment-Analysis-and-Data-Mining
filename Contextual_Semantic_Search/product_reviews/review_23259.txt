I received this watch as a gift about 3 years ago and the battery is still going strong. One of the things I look for in an analog watch is the precision in which the second hand hits the markers and this one hits them right on target. The luminosity of the hour markers is outstanding and extremely clear in total darkness. The markers are so bright they enable you to see other objects at close range when you point the watch.No problems at all with the water resistance, case, crystal, or hands. So far, so good! I still have the original strap and it's a bit uncomfortable when it's really hot outside. The watch is accurate and light weight so it doesn't feel like you're wearing a brick on your wrist. When I received the watch it had a mark on the back like someone had taken a drill to it, but this hasn't affected performance and since it's on the back, nobody knows it's there. I'm not so sure about the Navy Seal claims, but it's rugged enough for non-seals.I'd certainly buy this or another Luminox watch.
