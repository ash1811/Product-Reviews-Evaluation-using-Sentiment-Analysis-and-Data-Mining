Such a soft and cushy sole! I have heels that crack after wearing normal flip flops for a few days in a row. I wore these all summer last year and my heels never cracked! I get lots of compliments and I love them. I wish I could rate them 100 stars!!!!!The one weird thing: They are a kind of odd textured foot bed and I wore them to the beach once when they were pretty new and sand got almost like rubbed into the foot bed. After a few wearings it all came out. Kinda weird. Never happened again. And didn't effect the wearing as far as I can tell.I bought the brown last year. Ill be getting the black this year :)Fits true to size. Maaaaaybe a TINY bit on the smallish side. Took one wearing or so to stretch them into the perfect shape.
