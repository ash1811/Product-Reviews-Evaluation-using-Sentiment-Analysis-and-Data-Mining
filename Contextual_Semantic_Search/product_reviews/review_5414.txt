Several reviewers wrote that these boots are wide. I bought the wide width and I must say, they aren't that wide. I've worn them a few times and they've stretched some now so they're not too tight like they were at first. If you have large calves, you won't be able to tuck your jeans inside them.  Like others have said, these boots are comfortable. I like that the heels are rubber and less likely to slip on hard floors like other boots do.
