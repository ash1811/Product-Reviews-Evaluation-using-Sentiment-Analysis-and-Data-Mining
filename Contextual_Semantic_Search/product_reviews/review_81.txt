This was a very handy wallet that I used in India.The color is near neutral so it does not show through a shirt but best to wear a vest or a jacket for additional safetyNice velcro closure keeps money safe.You can easily carry 1,000 rupee bills with comfortAlso can carry valueable documents or passports if you wishNice long neck strap that can be shortenedEasier than carrything a thick wallet in trouser pants
