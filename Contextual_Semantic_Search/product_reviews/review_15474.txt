I have bunion surgery on one of my feet several months ago and finding a shoe that doesn't press on the surgical site isn't easy. These shoes are soft and the pressure is even on the front straps so it doesn't hurt.  I can't wear a lot of my old shoes yet, which is pretty discouraging, and wearing athletic shoes all the time is NOT fun.  I really like these, and they will take me into fall beautifully.
