Would not do for serious walking or any rough terrain walking as the soles are soft - you really feel the rocks. But very comfortable, non-slip sole, and inner fleece on first pair I bought (still wearing after 6 months or so) has yet to pack down badly - bought a second pair a couple of weeks after the first to be sure to have a spare.Only problem is leather thong laces won't stay tied, even when double knotted - but tht is normal for mocassins.Sizing tends a bit small - I got 1 full size larger and they are good but on looser side, so about 1/2 size smaller than they state.
