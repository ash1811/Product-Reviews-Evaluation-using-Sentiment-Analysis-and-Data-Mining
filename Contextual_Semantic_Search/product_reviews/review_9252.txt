I received mine today and put them on, and said, I have to get used to these, But as the day goes on and night is here, they are HAPPY FEET! I got a size 8 and I usually wear a 7.5 so these fit good. I got the blue ones and love the color and the cute Bow. I am hoping the sole holds up. I do a lot of house cleaning and walking in the house.
