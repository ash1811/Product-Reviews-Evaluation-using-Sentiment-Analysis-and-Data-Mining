We are wearing these sweatpants and making do, but they are not as roomy as some of the other Sweatpants we purchase from Amazon which also have pockets and similar design. For this sweatpant, the material is okay but not our favorite, the pockets are okay but not super deep, and the color is bright, and they wash and dry okay, but we are not likely to reorder these sweatpants in the future. On the brighter side, Amazon has a wide selection of Sweatpants available for purchase, and OUR ABSOLUTE FAVORITES IN MANY COLORS AND GOOD SIZING AND EASY CARE are those from SOFFE, with DEEP pockets, and we have now many SOFFE purchased happily from Amazon in many lovely colors and are completely sold on this item, and we also have gifted Amazon's SOFFE to Our Families and Friends and they are equally pleased with these garments. Thank you, Amazon. Blessings.
