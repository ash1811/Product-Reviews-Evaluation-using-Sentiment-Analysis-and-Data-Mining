Purchased these shorts for our 12 year old daughter in extra small.  Size was perfect.  However, the waist band on all 4 pairs of shorts we ordered was not the same.  The product picture shows a white waistband on the Soffe shorts.  Our shorts did not have a white waistband.  Not sure how much this will matter to most people.Other than the issue with the product description, we found the shorts to be of high quality material and stitching, just like all our previous purchases. Sizing was accurate. We also bought them on sale for an incredible price where we essentially received 3 pairs for the price of one (not all sizes and color were available however).So, if the waistband color is a non-issue, I would definitely recommend these shorts. Amazon usually has lower prices than I can find locally.
