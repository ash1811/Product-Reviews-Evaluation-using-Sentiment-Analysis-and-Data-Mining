I just received this for my birthday and I love it!  The color is great: very feminine but not 'fru-fru'.  It's so light-weight and comfortable.  I'm not too concerned about durability because I'm not hard on things.  But if it ever starts 'falling apart' I will be sure to update my review.  Two months later I still love this watch - light-weight and comfortable - wear it day and night but remove it to take a shower.  Overall a great value.
