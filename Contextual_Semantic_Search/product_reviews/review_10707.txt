I am a petite 128 lb, 34DD lady who wears Walcoal exclusively.  I have several Walcoal Full Figure Basic Beauty bras, which are very comfortable and provide excellent support but decided to order the Halo, which I had worn in the past.  I remembered that the Halo is a bit more sleek in fit and lighter weight due to lace cups, making it a good summer choice.  Amazon offered it at a very attractive price for a few days so I ordered it and am glad I did.This seamless bra is great under tee shirts and the stretch lace fits perfectly against the skin.  The straps are comfortable without being too &#34;industrial strength&#34; looking.  I did find that the tag on this bra was very sharp or itchy and had to cut it off.  Other than that, it has been exactly what I expected and wanted.  I do not think this bra would be the best choice for someone wearing a cup size larger than mine.  It is on the outside limit of the kind of support I expect bras to give DD ladies.
