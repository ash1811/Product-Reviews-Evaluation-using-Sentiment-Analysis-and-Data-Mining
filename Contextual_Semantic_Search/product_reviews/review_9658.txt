These jeans ooze quality. The denim fabric feels like its woven for strength and comfort. Zipper feels taut and durable. I like the look of the flat rivets, although they will not be favoured by everyone. Nice embroidery styling in the front pockets without looking too flashy. I am now converted from Levi's.Not giving 5-stars, because I'd prefer a darker hue of blue. The jeans are a slightly lighter colour then in the photo ... and then will go lighter still after several washes.
