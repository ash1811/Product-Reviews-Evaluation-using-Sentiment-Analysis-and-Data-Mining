I have to order up a size but I have a bigger butt and legs.  Once I got over the size issue, (swallow your pride girl)these are some of my favorite pants.  I do need a belt.  They are really soft!  I wear them to work and they look nice with sweaters or jackets.  They wash in the machine and dry in the dryer.  I have three pair, would order on line again as they all fit the same.  They don't have any flaps on the back pockets so are nice and smooth under tops.
