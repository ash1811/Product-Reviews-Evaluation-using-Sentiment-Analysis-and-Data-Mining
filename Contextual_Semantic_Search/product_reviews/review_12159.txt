PROS:-Quintessential rough and rugged look you want from a work boot, and go well with jeans, khakis and shorts.-You simply CANNOT beat Amazon's price...$59 shipped with free, no-hassel returns. Compare that with a $110 price tag at local stores...CONS:-Horrible fitment. I'm not picky when it comes to shoes, but I felt as if I was wearing a wooden box on each foot with these Cats. The inside of the boot simply did nothing to contour to my feet. It wasn't even a matter of breaking them in. It's as if they forgot to add the insoles and padding during the manufacturing process.-Poor fitment consistency. I am a solid size 11 (M) US. Own 10 pairs of shoes that include everything from dress shoes to sandals, always a 11. Bizarre that 11.5 on these boots felt as if they were 1&#34; too big. But then I ordered the 11's, and they were a very tight fit!! Can't explain that one.OTHER THOUGHTS:-I really want these because they look so awesome, and I re-ordered the 11.5's, and I'm going to get 3rd party innersoles and make 'em fit.
