I love these flip flops! I have two pairs now and just adore them. They are extremely comfortable and last for years! They do get slippery when you get them wet, so beware not to fall. These flops did rub my foot raw where the cloth hit it, but only because one of the egdes was raised a bit. I just got the material wet and put a barret there to mold the material flat, instead of raised. Worked like a charm and they are super comfy!
