I bought these for my son for Christmas and held my breath because you never know what someone else would really like, but he loved these pants.  They run true to size, and the fabric is very strong, yet not too strong as to be uncomfortable.  My son's only complaint is that the colors are limited because he would like some in black.  I bought two pairs for him one brown and the other beige.  The detailing with the leather on the front pocket to hold a measuring tape and the hammer holder he used right away.
