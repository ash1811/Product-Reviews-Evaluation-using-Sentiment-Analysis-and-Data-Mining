As has often been my experience when purchasing shoes, the size that fits is unpredictable.  Such was the case with this shoe.  It was my first time purchasing this shoe.  I've wanted a pair for quite some time and I was pleasantly surprised to see it discounted over 40% a little while ago and decided that it was now or never.  I ordered size 10.  It was immediately apparent that my size in this model was actually a half-size lower, so I immediately requested an exchange.  Amazon makes this easy and, even though the price had gone up substantially, I wasn't charged the difference.  I received size 9 1/2 a couple of days ago and immediately started wearing them.  The fit is perfect and the experience I've had thus far exceeds my expectations.  They are comfortable yet afford me with exceptional support.  I've read other reviews that describe this shoe as being on the heavy side.  Possibly, however I will say that, in my opinion, any shoe that affords the degree of comfort and support this one does will have what I would term a &#34;substantial presence.&#34;  I do not find it to be excessively heavy and my feet do not fatigue with extended wear.  Although I've only had it for a couple of days, I can already envision this shoe to be a favorite.  I almost wish I'd purchased 2 pair at the price I paid.  I'd recommend this shoe to anyone wishing an upscale look that offers great support and comfort.  I watched the price fluctuate in my shopping cart under &#34;Saved for Later&#34; for several months before I finally went for it.  I've only seen it offered lower once (27 cents), so I bought as close to the bottom as possible in my opinion.  Possibly you can do as well if you're patient.
