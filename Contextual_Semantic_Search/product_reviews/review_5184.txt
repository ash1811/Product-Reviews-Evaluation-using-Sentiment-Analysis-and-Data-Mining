I had previously reviewed my other green version of this same wathc and was disappointed because it fogged up and stopped working because I swam with it with my kids.  I was hesitant to buy another one based on the reviews but I did finally go ahead and buy the black and silver version.  It has been fine through swimming the gym etc.  I wear it every day and it has been great.  No problems.
