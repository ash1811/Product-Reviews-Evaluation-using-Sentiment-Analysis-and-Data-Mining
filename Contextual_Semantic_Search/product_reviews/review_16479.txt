I have used these style of boots for about 7 years now for while at work.  They are good looking and very light weight. I love how they unzip and are easily removed without having to untie and tie every time.  They hold a nice spit shine on the toe and are comfortable.  I wear these at work every day and I can usually get about a 1 and a half year of use out of them before the rubber sole starts to come apart or wears too badly.  One minor complaint is every time I buy a pair of these boots the price goes up, whats the deal?
