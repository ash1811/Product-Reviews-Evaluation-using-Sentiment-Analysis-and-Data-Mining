I normally wear a size 9 and I have wide feet.  I initally ordered a size 9 from Teva.com and even got free 2 day shipping.  The flip flops are LOVELY (I ordered the Poppy Red)but were WAY too snug... I called Teva and they offered to overnight me a size 10 for free!  They arrived today as promised and they are perfect.  These are great flip flops... if you want them... get them!  And consider ordering from Teva... their service is really great.
