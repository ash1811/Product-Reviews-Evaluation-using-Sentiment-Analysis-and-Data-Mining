These are a lovely colour, I got them in the aqua, but they are rather small. I wear a 6M shoe and with most brands I find that their shoes are true to size, except camper and beautifeel, now this brand will be added to the other two about sizing. It's the first time I have bought shoes from this brand so I take this as a learning experience and I will keep that in mind if in the future I buy anymore shoes from White Mountain.
