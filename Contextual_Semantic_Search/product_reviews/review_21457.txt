They fit like a true XXL(2x)...Normally I'd were a XL but I wanted some room in them for hiking and working outdoors. I don't however know what to do with the draw strings on bottom of pants. Any ideas or tips from someone that owns these please let me know. I have not wore them yet as its been to hot here but I will as soon as fall arrives. I ordered a black & a khaki pair but I like these much much more and for some reason these were a bit softer material wise.
