These seem to be well made and of good quality.  Hopefully they will hold up.  If they do, then they will be worth the rather steep price, I guess.  Based on the other reviews here, I bought the XXL (13-14) size for my size 11 feet and they fit fine, a little extra room in the toes which is fine, snug everywhere else.  As mentioned elsewhere, they are ugly, but they feel good and are very comfortable.  Like moccasins.  They can breathe which was very important to me.  They are warm, too.  Soft and quiet on a hard floor.So far, very happy with them.
