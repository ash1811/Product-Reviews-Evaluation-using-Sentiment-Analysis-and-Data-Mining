its a great sweatshirt!! the color(black) is nice so is the texture. Its definitely warm and heavyweight. Now I thought people were exaggerating about it being kind of big, but its very true, they do run big. It even says so in the tag &#34;with room to move&#34;. I recommend sizing down. I got an XL, but it fits like 2XL or even a 3XL. Overall im satisfied, Four stars due to lag in shipping it; about 3 days after the purchase.
