This is my fourth pair of these I've purchased, not because of any quality issues, but because they are my favorite skin-tone tights to use for leggy costumes. I'm 5'6&#34; with a 32&#34; inseam and 42&#34; hips, and the Large/X-large fits me like a dream. I'm really pale, and Light Toast is just a tad darker than my skin tone, but it actually looks pretty natural and gives a sleek, tanned effect that I'm pretty fond of. They're magical and amazing and make your legs look perfectly flawless from a relatively short distance. They are also, as the name suggests, ultra-soft.
