I purchased this watch for my husband several weeks ago, as his watches always needed battery replacements often. My husband and I both like that fact that it's Eco-Drive, so hopefully it will last a long time. It was pretty easy to set up. We even let it sit under a florescent lamp for a few days just to be sure it would work well. I also took the suggestion from other reviewers and purchased a separate watch strap, as the one that comes with it is a bit bulky and stiff. I bought a Maratac Mil Series NATO 18mm strap in black from &lt;[...]>, as per a reviewer's suggestion because he said it works well when typing on a keyboard all day at work (the buckle is on the side of the wrist, not the bottom). Overall, my husband is really happy with the watch (and he really likes the replacement strap I bought too).
