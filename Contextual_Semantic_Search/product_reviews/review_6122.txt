I purchased these Columbia pants for my husband for Christmas.  I actually wanted them for an upcoming trip we will be taking to Paris; there is a side, zip pocket which will be very helpful to fend off pick-pockets.  This side zip pocket has a small, zipper pull that is essentially attached via a loop.  It can be removed (which we will do for travel) and then easily put back on without damaging it.  The pockets themselves are deep - another plus. The pants are nice looking and they must be comfortable, since he has been wearing them often!  The sage color is kinda like a grey-green khaki; it will go with many other colors.  The fit is slightly loose in the butt, but otherwise they look nice on and can be worn for most casual events.
