I purchased this item back in July of 2009 when I decided to stop carrying my wallet and go with a money clip and a slim card carrier of some kind. Based on the reviews I read this seemed to fit the bill at a reasonable price.Along with my license I keep my insurance card, ATM card, CCW permit, and registration and proof of insurance slips for two vehicles - which I keep in the center pouch. With that in place it's still slim enough to carry in the front right pocket of my jeans. I've carried more but that is about the max I'd recommend for day to day use without discomfort.I use this daily and it often gets thrown in my backpack as well along with my other junk I carry. The leather is still all in good shape with no wear marks. It has definitely stood the test of time and I can highly recommend it.Keep in mind it is not meant to replace your wallet. I still carry my wallet in my backpack with other junk like pictures, business cards and other less used stuff which would otherwise jut not fit in this carrier.
