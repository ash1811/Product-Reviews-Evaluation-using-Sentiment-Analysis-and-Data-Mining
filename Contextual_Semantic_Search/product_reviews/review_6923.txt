Living in my area, going into the woods requires over-the-calf boots to protect against snake bites. The wool socks I use during the fall and winter as too heavy, thus warm, for the spring and summer. Gold Toe Windsor Wool Over the Calf sock is a blend of 50% wool and is a thin dress sock.  The wool regulates temperature within my boots and wicks away moisture. Great sock. My husband wears the Windsor calf length sock year round for the office. I hope Gold Toe continues to make Windsor over the calf and ankle wool blend socks.
