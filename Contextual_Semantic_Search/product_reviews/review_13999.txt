Jeans are notoriously variable in their fit, and these are no exception.  I ordered 2 pair of 35" waist pants, and although they were both labeled as 35" waist, 1 pair was closer to 34" & 1 pair was closer to 36".  I'll keep them anyway.  The tighter pair will work fine with an untucked shirt, & the looser one will be fine with a bulky winter wool shirt tucked in.
