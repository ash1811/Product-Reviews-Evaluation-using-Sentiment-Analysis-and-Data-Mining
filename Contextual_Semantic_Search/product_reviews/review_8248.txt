This is a great item for watch novices looking for a nice piece to compliment business/formal attire. I've had this mistaken for a Rolex Daytona a few times, which is always nice. A few things I've noticed that allude to the lower price point:- The Cronograph markings on the bezel are slightly offset, with the 0 marker about half minute increment off from 12 o'clock- After owning the watch for 6 months, the second (stopwatch) hand resets to about the 58th minute marker after the knob is pulled to reset the date/time (this is remedied by running the stopwatch for 2 seconds, then leaving it there...a little annoying)- I feel like the watch has lost a few minutes accuracy over the 3 years I've had it, but I never took the time to test it.Those things aside, the watch has nice details like screw down knobs, and Invicta logos impressed into the clasp and middle knob for that added touch. I've had mine for about 3 years now and will probably replace it. Money well spent.
