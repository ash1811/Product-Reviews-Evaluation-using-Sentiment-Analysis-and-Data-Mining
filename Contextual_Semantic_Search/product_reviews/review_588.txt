I always come back to Buxton for wallets.  This one has a place for everything, and I do mean everything!  I really like the currency compartment--there are two slots for bills and a center zippered compartment for coins, receipts, or large denominations.  There's also a change pouch in front for easy access.  There are almost enough card slots, and there are a number of plastic sleeves if you run out of slots.  For some reason the slots are not of uniform size and I had to do some finagling to make some of my cards fit.  I also wish the snap flap went over the currency compartment so I didn't have to keep it zipped, but I'll get used to it, and I'm sure the leather slots will loosen up with use.After an exhaustive online and in store search, I've decided that this clutch gives the best bang for the buck.  Mine is red, and it's a rich, not fire engine color.  I'm very pleased.
