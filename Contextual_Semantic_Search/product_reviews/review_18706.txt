Nice but smaller than i thought. when i tried to pull the stem out to change the date, it came out totally. put it back in but had to turn the clock threw 3/4 of a months took like an hr. So at the end of a non 31 day month will be doing the same thing. Timed chould make a larger one, many people like larger watches, and they are easier to read. Also drop the date thing. The price was great, would make a great gift for a your first watch, in a kid. Times used to be number one. Now they just make cheap watches, for cheap market. Bet lots of people would love a bigger and more expensive timex.
