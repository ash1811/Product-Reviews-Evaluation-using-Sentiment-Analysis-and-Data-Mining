I have weak ankles, and decided that I needed to wear high top sneakers to give me some support. Years ago, I wore Reeboks exclusively, in many different styles, and never had any problems with sizing. I had read some of the reviews that noted that the shoes ran narrow, but I figured that I would try them anyhow.The shoes arrived yesterday. I liked the sneaker, and the way that they were made. Problem was, that after just one look, I knew that they were not for me. They weren't a little narrow, but so narrow that it was obvious, to the naked eye, that these sneakers would not fit. I tried one on, and was just about able to squeeze my foot into them. Walk in them, forget it.There way no way that I could wear them. Some people had suggested buying a larger size, but I was afraid that it would not work. They still would be narrow, and too long.I have looked all over the internet, for a basic, white hightop, at a reasonable price. Apparently anything that I have seen are either very expensive, or come in garish colors only. Any suggestions?
