I am graduate student who needs decent clothes for not much money. I used to be a Russell Athletic shirt wearer but their quality took a nose dive and Dickies seems to be the only clothes vendor I can find who sells decently made clothing for a good price. All other t-shirt manufacturers are making shirts too small or from thin crappy fabric. Dickies is the only one I know who still makes a shirt heavy enough to last and with seams that will not tear in a stiff  breeze. If you want quality, this is where you will find it.
