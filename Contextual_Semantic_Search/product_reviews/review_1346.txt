I have been purchasing the Men's Merrell Jungle Moc for about six years now.  I have deteriorating Cartilage  my knees.  This is complicated by the fact that I am teacher who has to be on his feet most of the day.  The cushioning of the Jungle Moc actually takes pressure of my knees.  It is a great product, and the vendor delivered them in no time at all.
