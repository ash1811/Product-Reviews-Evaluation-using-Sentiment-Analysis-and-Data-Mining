So what can you say..it's a hooded sweatshirt....but I ordered XL because everyone was saying it was small....not the case on me....it was way too big...as a matter of fact..it's in the washer with hot water..and will be dried in the dryer to shrink it!  I am 6'2&#34;, 205 44 chest and bigger arms....small waist...so...I am confused as to why everyone was saying these fit small...that being said...I don't like clothes to fit &#34;american&#34; ...I prefer a little more snug *not overly tight*...more european
