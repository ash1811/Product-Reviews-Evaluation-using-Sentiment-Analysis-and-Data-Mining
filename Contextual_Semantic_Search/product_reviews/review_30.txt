The product itself is five stars, however the description is faulty.  I researched this product a great deal before purchasing and even got the free demo CD first.  I really do like the learning process, it feels intuitive.  The problem is, sitting at my desktop computer is inconvenient and I do not have a laptop.  So when I learned that there is an "App for that", I was thrilled.  I own both an iPhone and an iPad so with the Rosetta Stone apps that link directly to my account I could learn and practice wherever I needed to.  For three months I made great progress whether at home, in the backyard or at work on my lunch hour.  On day 91 I suddenly could not connect, my apps kept saying "no course found for this account".  The product still works on my desktop but it turns out the apps portion of the product was just a free trial.  If I want to continue learning this way I need to purchase a very expensive subscription.  No where on this product page does it say that the companion apps are a trial version.  I am very disappointed with Rosetta Stone and Amazon.  I did call Amazon but the rep I spoke to did not know whether the product info was written by Rosetta Stone or Amazon, I am sure it was the former.  Amazon did try to assist me by offering a partial refund but that was not really what I wanted.  I want to continue to learn on my iPad!  My disappointed with Amazon is because that call I made to them took place about two months ago and I see the product info page has not changed, I do not see anything about the iPhone apps being a 90 day trial.UPDATE: AUGUST 23, 2013I see that Amazon has updated the description slightly with this sentence, "Enhance your learning on-the-go with Rosetta Stone mobile apps for the Kindle Fire HD, iPad and iPhone. Three month access included with purchase."  I personally think it is still obscure since the part about the mobile companion is much farther down in the description but at least it is something.
