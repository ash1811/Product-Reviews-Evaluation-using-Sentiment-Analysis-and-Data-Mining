This slip is not gorgeous or luxurious, it is just okay. I wear them as nightgowns or around the house in the summer. One of the straps consistently twists around the hook which is annoying and keeps me from wearing it as often as I would otherwise. At least it was inexpensive but you get what you pay for, especially in this case.
