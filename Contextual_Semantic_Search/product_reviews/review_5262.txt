I don't like that this jean is not provided by Amazon.  I purchased two pairs of these jeans, one white and the other Latte size 10.  The white fit perfectly and the Lattie fit like a size 8.  These are great jeans if you are sent the correct size.  They are all made in different countries and that seems to be the problem.  And if the jeans are not provided by Amazon but a Florida company you will need to pay for returns which I think is wrong.  Evidently, this company has had a lot of problems with sizing so please do not buy from this company.
