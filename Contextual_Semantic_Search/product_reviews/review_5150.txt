I purchased these to help widen some of my shoes while also helping to pull out moisture (as cedar does).  Only problem is I missed the part that says these are MENS.  I thought the M in the sizing stood for Medium Width.  Wasn't written anywhere in the description either.Furthermore, how you're suppose to adjust these to widen them, even if I needed these for men's shoes?  I played with them for awhile, since I figured I would try to make them work in my sneakers.  But for the life of me couldn't figure out how to use them properly.  Maybe I'm just slow or inpatient or both.  But I couldn't figure it out.Shame, since they look great and the quality of the cedar was fantastic.  Thankfully amazon is great & I didn't have any problems returning them.
