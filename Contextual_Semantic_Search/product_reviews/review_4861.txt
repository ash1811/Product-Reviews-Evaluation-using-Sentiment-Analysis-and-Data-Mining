Great fabric and feel.  These are surprisingly a little too roomy.  Considering I own all four styles and cuts from this brand and this are the most oddly sized.  A little pricey but unlike some of the competing products these are not shear.  However they do not have a vanity button on the front and I wonder if that might be an improvement considering how loose they are in the front.
