I ordered these for a hiking trip and have been very happy with them.  I also bought a pair of the thicker cushion Thorlo hiking socks.  Both are great, very comfortable and wear well.  I like having both these "semi-thick" and the thicker ones depending on the day, the weather and how much cushioning my feet need that day.  I plan to get another pair of these in a different color.
