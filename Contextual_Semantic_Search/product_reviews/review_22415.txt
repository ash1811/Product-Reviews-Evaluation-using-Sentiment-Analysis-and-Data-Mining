To start, I have to say that this is the first pair of Reefs I've ever owned. I ordered the right size, lucky for me, which ended up being the same as the size I wear for TOMS (if that helps anyone else). I love the soles, which seem great for wearing on a boat, which I did, with no problems. The footbed is squishy and supportive at the same time. The only thing I do not like is the material of the strap. It started to rub my foot raw after about 2 hours. It's not seeming to get any better, either. I'm used to my Rainbows but I picked these because I had read that they were much lighter, weight-wise, and they are. But I am not in love with the sore on top of my foot.
