These cute, red, go anywhere shoes also fit perfectly.  I can't believe I'm wearing sandals and not lace-up shoes with orthotics!  They are so lightweight and allow my feet to rock and bend, putting a spring in my step.  I haven't tried washing them in the machine, yet, but I'm sure it will be fine.  Way above my expectations.
