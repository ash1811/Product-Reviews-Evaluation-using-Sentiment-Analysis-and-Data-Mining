I have owned a lot of Timex field watches, this is about middle of the road in quality. Forget the camp watches- plastic not durable and break rather easily. The higher end expedition watches are very heavy but very durable, mine just broke from a fall of 5 feet to concrete, still functions but broke off the wheel for time setting. This watch to me is a outdoor woman's field watch, as not all of us like he tiny, dainty watches that these companies make for us wild women. Reasonable size very basic functions, time & date and glow light. And a decent band for once. I would really like to find a women's style, ( not too butch not too pretty) true outdoor watch with some added functions like gps or compass that don't look quite so yucky as some of the guys watches. I actually like some of the aviator watches and others but yes they only come in jumbo wrist sizes. Some company will one day figure it out and make a killing selling fashionable functioning outdoor gear for women, still waiting. This watch only gets 4 stars, as durability is still suspect. I'm very active and my watches take a beating, so will see. The greyish face takes getting use to and the light comes off as a greenish color. Just weird colors to put together- grey, green, brown two tone band and silver case, color blind are you?? Guess it will be wet and muddy soon anyway....
