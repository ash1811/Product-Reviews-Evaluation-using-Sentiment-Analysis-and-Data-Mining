I bought these to go with my son's costume.  He's a sz 4.  They were absolutely huge!!!  Went all the way up past his elbows.  I think they would fit a 8-10 year old ok, but not a little one.  Otherwise, ok - went with the rest of the costume.  I'd wish for a little better quality, but as it's only going to be worn once, they would work.
