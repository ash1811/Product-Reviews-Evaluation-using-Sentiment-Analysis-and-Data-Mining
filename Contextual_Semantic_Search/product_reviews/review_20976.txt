Here's a link that will change your life and the comfort of your boobs:http://brittanyherself.com/2014/02/05/happy-boobs/I was under the impression from an expert fitting that I was a 34D - low and behold I found out I am a 32G UK, 32I US. UK sizing is more accurate than US so if you can find a bra that has both you'll be happier.You can thank me later.
