There is a reason the Levis brand is synonymous with jeans.  They are simply the best.  Nothing else compares.The moment you pickup these jeans, you can feel the sturdy construction and quality.  These jeans are heavy.  The material is strong and durable.  These are some fly-by-night jeans that will rip if you sneeze.  These are the real deal.Putting them on reveals a loose fit.  The jeans wrap around your waist but leave enough room for plenty of movement.  The legs taper slight but will easily fit over a pair of construction or work boots.  The seams and ends of the legs are double-stitched to prevent fraying and tears.The pockets are deep and roomy.  I can easily fit an ipod in one front pocket and a large set of keys (almost 40 keys) into the other.  You could unload several rolls of quarters and still have room for your hand.  The back pockets are just as roomy and can hold wallets, tools, flashlights (including a mag-light), and more.Accept no substitutes.  If you want the best, get these jeans.  They won't let you down.
