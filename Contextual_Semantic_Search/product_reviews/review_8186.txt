The watch is gorgeous. I've seen and handled it in a watch store before so I knew what I was getting. The bracelet that came with mine has an alignment problem that skews the clasp enough to make it catch. So the hinge isn't functioning very smoothly. With time, I suspect it will be better. Bracelet is comfy but due to the weight of the watch, I had to make it tight on my wrist to prevent the watch from travelling up and down with every arm motion. I'd say this is at best a $20 bracelet. I might get a better replacement bracelet later. I've already seen a nicer one on amazon.
