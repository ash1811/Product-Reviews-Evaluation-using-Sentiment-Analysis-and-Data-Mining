I've ordered Bandolino's in the past and always had a good fit (size 10).  In fact, the day I ordered these Mylah's I also ordered the Bandolino Capture pumps[[ASIN:B00B5NSRLU Bandolino Women's Capture FB Platform Pump].  The Bandolino Capture's fit great, but the Mylah style was to tight across the toes and very tight over the top of my foot.  These shoes just run small. I ordered the Gold and I did like the style and color, just wish they fit correctly.
