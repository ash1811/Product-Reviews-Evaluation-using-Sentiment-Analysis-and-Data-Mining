Advertised as "Timex Kids' T79081 My First Timex Easy Reader Pink Leather Strap Watch"FYI it clearly says synthetic leather underneath the strap. The fake leather strap feels like cardboard, it's very stiff like a bangle.Straps aside, the actual clock is nice , and has the blue back light feature. I would recommend getting this with a fabric strap.
