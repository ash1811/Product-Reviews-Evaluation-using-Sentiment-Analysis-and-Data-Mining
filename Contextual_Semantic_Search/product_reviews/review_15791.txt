These socks are a nice color and felt great on my feet.  Trouble is, you get hole after hole in a short time if you wear them often.  Surprisingly, these socks are not very durable and do not warrant the rather steep price that Thorlo socks command.  I think the Thorlo brand is vastly overrated.  I'm going to try Wigwam's or Gold Toe socks next time.
