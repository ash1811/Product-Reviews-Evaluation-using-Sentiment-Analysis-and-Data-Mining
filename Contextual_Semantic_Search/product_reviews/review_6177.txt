These are great! Easy on, easy off... you can walk with confidence in the snow/ ice and they have had a workout this winter! I bought them for all my daughters and parents.  Even my little grandson wanted some, they are a bit too big for him this year but the extra small may fit him next year.  The sizes are deceiving, since I think a size 11 women's is large but it only takes a medium trak to fit the shoe well.  You can even wear them with heals because of the design.
