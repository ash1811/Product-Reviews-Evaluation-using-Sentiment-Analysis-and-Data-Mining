First, unlike some other slippers these are quite true to size, I wear a size 14 shoe(although my last Dearfoam slippers were a 13 and fit fine) I ordered these slippers in a 14m and they fit just fine. The suede leather is quite nice and the footbed is very cushiony. Nice thick bottom(which does add to the weight of the slipper) but should work good for not only the house but trips to the mailbox or garage.BTW for whatever reason when I ordered mine they were $36 which was about the max I wanted to spend for slippers but when going back to write this review I see they are now $44.....doubt I would have ordered them if that was the case, but again nice slippers.4-20-2013 update: the more I use these slippers the more I like them. Very comfortable and sole is usable even outdoors. I would order again without hesitation!1-5-2014 update: Still really liking these slippers, I like how the bottom is rather smooth and don't pickup or hold crud from say the garage or outside, they are wearing very well with no issues.
