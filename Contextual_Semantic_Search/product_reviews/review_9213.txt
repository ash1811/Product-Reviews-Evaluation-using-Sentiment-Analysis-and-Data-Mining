This is my first online shoe purchase.  It won't be my last as I simply draw no enjoyment from that trip to the store, but it is a disappointment.These are beautiful shoes, but too small.  I thought they'd &#34;break in&#34; as has happened with other Cole Haan shoes, so I wore them a few times (and enough that I couldn't return them -- another mistake).  They didn't.  All I got were blisters and irritation at my own stupidity.Think before buying.
