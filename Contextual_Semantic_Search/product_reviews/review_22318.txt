my wife is a clean freak so these are perfect for slipping over work shoes while doing renivations and work around the house.  great for guests who don't like to take off their shoes or repairmen working at the house.  they keep dirt/sand/whatever off the hardwoodfloors and carpet.  I keep a box in the kitchen cabinete for those unexpected times
