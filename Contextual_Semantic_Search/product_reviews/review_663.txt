Sure it fits snug - but that's what it is supposed to do! Also, the garters are wonderful, only one has ripped, but it is easily sewn back together. It makes everything smooth underneath clothes, and is just a fun thing to wear! It has a lot of stretch to it, so that's good for me; I recommend for any lady pursuing the glamour of the 1950s!
