For many years I was strictly a Daskin girl, both for performnce and everyday wear. A few years ago I switched to Capezio, they simply seemed to wear better and hold up longer. I recently bought a pair of the Danskin compression tights to try again. Although there is nothing to specifically knock Danskin, I have found the Capezio hold and stretch to be equally supportive and perhps a bit longer wearing.
