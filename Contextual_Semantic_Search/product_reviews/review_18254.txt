I bought this for my husband who was looking for a warm comfortable slipper that had a shoe type sole on the bottom.  This slipper has a warm soft lining inside, the outside almost looks like a shoe when worn with jeans and the rubber bottom is durable and wont wear out like a vinyl bottom would . He loves them!
