Multi-functional, rugged, accurate and decent looking to boot. I found the strap to be a little on the short side for myself. I use the next to the last hole. While the watch case itself is large the acutal dial face is a tad on the small side. The minute hand is a tad too long and the hour hand is a tad too short. The illumination is only for the digital window which is usually set for month/day mode so telling time at night is difficult. Small little things that are not show stoppers, this watch comes from a proud heritage of G-shock development which places this timepiece in the winners circle. I expect to get many years of rugged service from this watch.
