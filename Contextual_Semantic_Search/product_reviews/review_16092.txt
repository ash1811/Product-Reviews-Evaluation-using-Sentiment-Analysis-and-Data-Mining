This neck wallet is clearly superior to carrying stuff in a pocket wallet while traveling, and the feeling of security for your valuables is priceless. It's comfortable to wear pressed against the body and there was no discomfort with the cord that goes around the neck. If these were the only issues, this would be a 5-star review.That said, there was one rather major problem. This item was purchased for a summer Mediterranean cruise and worn all over the Mediterranean during the hottest time of the year. Thus, it came home encrusted with salt from sweat, as it was worn carried against the body "shoulder-holster style." Since the whole point of the wallet is that it should be worn in such a way as to make it highly inconvenient to steal, perhaps it's unfair to complain about that. But it didn't look very attractive whenever it emerged from the under the shirt, and we purchased the natural color. I can't even imagine what the black one would look like. (Note: The salt washed right out in the washing machine in cool water, and the wallet looks as good as new now.)Although everything fit in the wallet quite well, a lot of the items ended up wet because of the problem with sweat. The passport got soaked, and although it wasn't harmed, it wasn't pleasant to handle like that. In the future, the passport will go into a plastic bag before tucking it into the wallet and that will take care of that problem. We're not big enough travelers that I feel we need to buy a different neck wallet for future travels, but I think that if you do a lot of traveling in hot climates, this is probably not the neck wallet for you.
