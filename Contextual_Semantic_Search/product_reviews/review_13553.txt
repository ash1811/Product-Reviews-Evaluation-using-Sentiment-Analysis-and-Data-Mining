Very pretty, very soft/comfortable, Love the color (pink). I'm an 8.5-9.0 so I ordered a size larger. As with every slide on slipper I've ordered they all stretch out very quickly. It seems they just don't make them like they used to, regardless of what brand you buy. I do like that these have a room around the heal area so it does prevent you from sliding off the back of the slipper somewhat.
