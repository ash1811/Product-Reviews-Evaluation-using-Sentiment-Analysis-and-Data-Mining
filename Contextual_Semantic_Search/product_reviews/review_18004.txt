These sneakers are very comfortable and they are true to size. The top of the foot being held well in place by a large elastic instead of laces or velcro.I walk alot with my work and they make me feel like I'm walking on air. High enough so they can be worn instead of boots in winter for running errands and getting in and out of the car. My only negative comment is that they are a little bulky
