I liked this bag right off because of the bright color.  At first I thought I had received the red bag.  It's affordable and packs into a small shape.  I used it on a cruise to carry my towel, swimsuit, and sunscreen.  I used the small side pocket to store my ID, Chapstick, and a little cash.  I wouldn't recommend it for heavier gym items.  My sister used hers to carry extra shoes and workout gear.  She over-weighted the bag, and it tore the first day.  Should be fine if you keep the contents light.
