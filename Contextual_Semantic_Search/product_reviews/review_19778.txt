Love these clog slippers! They are extremely comfortable, and are exactly as seller described them. If it helps, I am a true size 8 in shoes. I worried because the slipper was sized as 7.5/8. My hope was that they would be closer to 8 than 7.5. They fit great!! I'm so pleased with my purchase, and I highly recommend them. Nice job Isotoner and Amazon!!
