I really like this watch.  I thought it was bigger than it is (38MM) and I am used to watches that are bigger.  However I have come to like it as it is lightweight and easy to see the time.  I did replace the watchband with a Timex Velcro band and now I like it even more.  The Indiglo light is really nice and works great.  It has lost about a second since I started using it over a week ago.  Great watch for the money,
