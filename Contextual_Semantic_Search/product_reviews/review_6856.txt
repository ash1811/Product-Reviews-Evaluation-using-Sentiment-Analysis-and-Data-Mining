And, these Gold Toe's fit the bill.  I just love putting on a clean pair of crisp white sox every day.  These are great quality for the money.  The elastic seems to last so I'm not constantly pulling up sox that are creeping down my ankle into my shoe.  I will be ordering more.  Definitely recommend.
