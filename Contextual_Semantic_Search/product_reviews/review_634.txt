This slip was the most economical I could find online. I rarely need a full slip so I didn't want to pay an arm and a leg. It's comfortable, cool (that was my biggest thing), and fits well. The straps do tend to fall down a little bit but you could easily stitch them in place. I don't see this lasting 20 years like my mom's Vanity Fair slip, but I'm happy with my purchase and would recommend it!
