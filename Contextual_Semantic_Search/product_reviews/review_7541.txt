I think this is a very nice collection.  It offered a variety of colors and the stones were just large enough to be noticeable without being over bearing, so they worked well as an earring in the second pierced hole.  Unfortunately, I did lose several of the earrings now.  I don't think my losing them had anything to do with the strength of the end piece (earring back) - I think I'm hard on earrings.  So, if you sleep in your earrings or are pretty active, you may not want to wear these earrings during those times but, rather,  just save them for a special occasion.
