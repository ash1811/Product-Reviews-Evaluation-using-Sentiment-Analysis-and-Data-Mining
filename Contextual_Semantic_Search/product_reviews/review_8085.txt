The title pretty much covers the whole review.. I purchased it for $5 at Christmastime. I was planning on using to carry dishes from table to sink to wash. ( I use a wheelchair ). As soon as it got a little damp, that lovely red dye ran all over whatever it touched. If you just keep it dry, it's an ok bag.
