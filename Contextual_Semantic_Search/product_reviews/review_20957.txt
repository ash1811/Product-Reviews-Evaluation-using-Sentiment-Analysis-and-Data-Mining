I compared this overshoe with the Totes Geometric Loafer, and after trying both on, bought the Totes instead. Here is why:1. It is not that easy to tell from the pictures, but the Totes looks better and is more stylish than this product.2. If you choose the proper Totes size, the overshoe fits like a glove and nicely blends in with your dress shoe. By contrast, the Tingley overshoe fits more loosely and gives more of the appearance that you are wearing a rubber overshoe. It has a &#34;sloppy&#34; feel and look rather than the sleek and snug fit of the Totes.Bottom line: This will work, but the Totes is more stylish.
