And this one is tolerable. I had intended to continue my braless ways through my nursing career, but I hadn't reckoned with milk leakage and the constant need for nursing pads.I could wish that the chest band was a little softer, but it is not hugely uncomfortable.I find that in terms of nursing effectiveness, this works much better than the crossover pull-down type. Beware the clips though. If you don't clip them all the way they will clip on their own and pinch you.
