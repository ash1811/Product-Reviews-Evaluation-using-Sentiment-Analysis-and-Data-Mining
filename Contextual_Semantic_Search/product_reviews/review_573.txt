I bought this same wallet last year for myself. My mom liked it so much that I ordered one for her as well.  We are both very happy with them.  I carry a Nokia 1520 cell phone and it fits perfectly, even with my checkbook. So easy to stay organized with all the pockets. Its held up pretty well too, and I'm not overly careful.  I would definitely recommend this.
