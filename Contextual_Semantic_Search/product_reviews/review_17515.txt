I liked these shoes,  but did not love them.  Everyone said they are small and you need to order up.  So i normally wear a 5.5 to 6, but got 6.5 because i broke my foot and it is really swollen.  However, these are HUGE!  I would say to order your normal size.  I might even need to go down to 5.5, which in flats I normally wear a 6.  Regardless, if i had the right size they are cute and nice.  However, the Frye Regina's are better and i went with those instead.
