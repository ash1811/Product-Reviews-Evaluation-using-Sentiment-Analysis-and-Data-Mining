I am in and out of the house and barnyard all day, so I need waterproof footwear that is easy to slip on and off.  These work fine for me.  The sizing is a little large and in future I will try one size down.  I wish they had a little more support in the sole, but they are really ok.  Time will tell how well they will last.
