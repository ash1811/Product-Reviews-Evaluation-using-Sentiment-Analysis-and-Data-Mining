I've owned this fleece for over two winters and its just great. I purchased it again for my father in-law as a gift. My wife even got another one for her grandfather. Awesome fleece. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. UPDATE: Now the 5th one in the family. I still have mine and got another one from work with the company logo on it.
