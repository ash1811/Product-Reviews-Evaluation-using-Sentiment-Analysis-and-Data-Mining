An expensive lesson.  I ordered an 11 in white to fit my womans 8 shoe.  After they were washed I could not get them on.  They are way too small and I thought they were left here by our grandson.  I just now realized they must be the Thorlo I had ordered.I received the wrong sock.  The ones I have are all white and seem to be the woman's sock that has cotton in it, which might explain why it shrank.  I will contact Amazon to see if anything can be done.
