After struggling to get countless disposable swim diapers on and off my chubby 1 year old I finally found a swim diaper that works! With the side snaps it is so much easier to get this diaper on and off. The only reason why I give it is 4 starts instead of 5 is that it seems to run small. My 1 year old is 26 lbs and 31 1/2 inches long if that gives you a better sizing picture, I ordered the 24 month size and would have done better to even order one up from that.
