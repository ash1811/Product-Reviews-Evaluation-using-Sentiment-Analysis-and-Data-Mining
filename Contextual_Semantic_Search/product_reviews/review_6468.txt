This is my 2nd time ordering these shoes.  The shoes are well made, and long lasting.  I feel like I am wearing house slippers when I wear these shoes yet they are supportive to my high arch.  The shoes seem to run true to size.  They are of good quality and long lasting.  i highly recommend these shoes for those of us who do a lot of standing and/or walking.
