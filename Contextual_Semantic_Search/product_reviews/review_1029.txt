I was looking for panties that fit well, with comfortable coverage and that didn't show under pants or jeans.  Skimp Skamps are all that!  I've worn them in the past and started buying another brand for some reason I can't remember, but they never fit well or washed  well.  I'm so glad I have found Skimp Skamps again.  I'm sticking with them this time.  Great price for a great product!
