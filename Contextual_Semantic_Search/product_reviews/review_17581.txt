Super fragile, not reinforced in the crotch area, so they sorta feel like they're going to split there, especially since they're a little small. The color changes from one stripe to the next are not dyed, they are actually different threads, so there are little black threads and little purple threads that stick out at each color change spot on the inside, and you can see them. They look weird.
