I got the greatest deal I've ever gotten on these shirts. I bought from Amazon Warehouse Deals for $2.04 and free shipping (as I have student prime.)I was expecting this to be a unisex shirt. I love tank tops but as a girl its like impossible to find a tank top that doesn't have the annoying lines all over it, has full straps (spaghetti straps look trashy to me), and isn't made to be super tight. I assumed this would be a male or unisex shirt and was glad that I had gotten a lucky deal on it and all would be well... Well, it wasn't. The package just got here and instead it is an exclusively men's shirt. It's a tank top with enormous arm holes that go almost all the way to my waist, not something a girl can wear anywhere. I can't even express how disappointed I am right now. I wish I could understand why stupid men have to have enormous arm holes. It's so FRICKING ANNOYING to not be able to find a decent tank top anywhere because of it. Men huge arm holes is UNNECESSARY. You do not need a tank top that opens up all the way down your side. Its ridiculous and stupid, and that's all it will ever be. These stupid shirts are going in the garbage I guess because I know shipping them back will cost me more than what I paid for them for.
