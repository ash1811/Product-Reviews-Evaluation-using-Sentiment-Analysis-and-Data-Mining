Like i saw from the true description picture before, was it a fit as i expected.Feeling inside was a new , warm welcome experience, in a silent minute fallen asleep.For liking Carhartt own some jeans , its not possible from outside, without tag to differentiate between flanel-lined and fleece-lined cause they use the same colors. Quality all around, and no surprise after washings.
