This is a great shoe for Zumba and dance workouts... also for working out on carpet. The shoe will not drag on carpet and flooring making your steps glide smoothly. I wish my high school dance team would have used these. They have much more support than a typical jazz shoe. I recommend going up at least one size as with most dance shoes.
