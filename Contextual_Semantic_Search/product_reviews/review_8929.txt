`Even if you are full with milk, the cups are way larger than expected. They dent in and don't stay out. The material is so bad, it is like the equivalent of memory foam so when it dent in, it stays that way until you push out the cup again which is embarrassing. No one wants a dented in chest look.  Take the cup size down a notch when ordering this one. Also this tends to cut off my supply 10 fold with the underwire so if you really need an underwire try this but I'd go down a cup size for sure.
