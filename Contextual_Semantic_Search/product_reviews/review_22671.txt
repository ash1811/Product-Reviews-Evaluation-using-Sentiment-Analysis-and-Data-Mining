I've always considered myself mechanically adept but I had trouble using this tool. The instructions need a great deal of work. My advice to the manufacturer would be to develop a fixed device that I have seen work on jeweler's benches. Also, to be more effective, the heads should consist of a two-sided static pieces and two sides that can be adjusted. Oh, and you will want to fix the base from up and down movement. Otherwise, the watch merely squirms away from the wrench, as it does now.I would not buy this wrench again.If this review was helpful, please add your vote.
