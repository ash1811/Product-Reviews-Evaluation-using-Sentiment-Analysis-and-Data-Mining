7-25-13. This Casio Men's G2900F-1V G-Shock Classic 10-Year Battery Watch will be going to the deep jungles of Venezuela Amazonas just north of the border of Brazil. Half of the journeys by the man using this timepiece in Venezuela, South America are by small boat or canoe (with a motor hung on it) through rough river rapids or through jungles. Water (rivers and rain) is a constant condition to deal with so the waterproof construction is critical.. Over the next few years this watch will get a severe workput. It was chosen for it's sturdiness and ease of use, along with a few key additional features. I'll report on it's uefulness in a year.
