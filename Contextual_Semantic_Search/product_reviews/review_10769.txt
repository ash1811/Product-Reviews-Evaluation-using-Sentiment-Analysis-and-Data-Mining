Alright, first of all, let's not assume this bottle opener is a great idea.  It's novel, but that's about it.After that, you've got a good sturdy flop.  They aren't as comfortable as the Teva Katavi, but I don't think any flop is.These are comfortable, and they hold up okay.  I live in a warm climate and my last pair lasted about 18 months of DAILY use before the thong ripped out of the front.  I'll stress, though, that I wear flops all day every day until the temperature gets below 40, which is about 2 months a year here.This is a good flop minus one star because there are more comfortable flops out there.EDIT 12.05.2013 - I'm not going to fault the flop for this but beware.  I've noticed scratches on my stair treads from where the bottle opener contacts the wood and damages it.  Not good.  This also reminded me of the last pair of these I owned.  Don't put your feet on the coffee table's edge with them on or the metal bottle opener will damage that wood as well.  Again, not gonna fault the shoe, just passing on information.
