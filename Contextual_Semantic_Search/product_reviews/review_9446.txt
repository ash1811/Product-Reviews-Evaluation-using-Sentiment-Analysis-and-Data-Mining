I love these earrings.  Small chunky hoops, about an inch in diameter - the perfect size.  Not to big but still large enough to get noticed.  A very expensive look for something that isn't too costly.I like that the clasp is a clasp and not a post.  These earrings are not going to come out.  They are comfortable to wear, even to bed which sometimes I do when I forget to take them out.The silver goes with everything and the cubic zirconium looks enough like diamonds that people mistake this for the real deal.
