I bought two of these pouches for a recent vacation to Europe.  It was comfortable to wear as long as I didn't put too much in it.  It was fine with credit cards, driver's license and some cash but when I added my passport it became a bit heavy and bulky, but not prohibitively so.  I think if you are planning on carrying your passport with credit cards it will work well for you, but if you are not planning on carrying your passport around, a pouch that is smaller might work better.This pouch is likely a good size if you are carrying quite a bit of stuff, but it will stick out under your clothes if your passport is in it.  A lot  more comfortable with only a bit of cash and credit cards.It is also a l longer in length than I realized.  Its so long that I could wear it around my neck and tuck it into my pants.  My daughter refused to wear it since it is quite bulky under your clothes.
