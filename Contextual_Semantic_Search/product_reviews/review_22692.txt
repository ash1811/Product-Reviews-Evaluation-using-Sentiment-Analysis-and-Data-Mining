I was looking for a pretty anklet but didn't want to spend a lot. I saw this one and saw it had good reviews so i decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed! its so sparkly and pretty. it isn't chunky which i like because i have little ankles. It is very sturdy and you can't beat the price! great buy!
