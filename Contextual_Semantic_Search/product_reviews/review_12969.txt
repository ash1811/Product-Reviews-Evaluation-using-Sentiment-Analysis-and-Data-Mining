My husband is tall and slim, so finding 32x38's is GREAT, but these really have gotten thinner and thinner over the years.  Based on several purchases over the years, I can tell you that they look great for about 8 months to a year with weekly wear, but when they start to fade they fade FAST, and then almost immediately start to develop holes at the back pockets.  But for us, this is a beggars can't be choosers proposition - there are VERY few brands catering to men who are both tall and thin, so we take what we can get, and replace as necessary.
