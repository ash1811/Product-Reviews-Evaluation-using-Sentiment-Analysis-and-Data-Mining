This costume is great. Awesome for the price. It is very detailed. It looks like it might not last long when you first see it but after many times my nephew has worn this the costume still looks great. He probably wears this and other costumes more than he does regular clothes. He is about to out grow it soon. Since it is still in great condition we can probably pass it on to another family kid.
