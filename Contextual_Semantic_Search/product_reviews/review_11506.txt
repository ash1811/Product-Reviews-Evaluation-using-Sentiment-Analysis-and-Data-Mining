This bra--is true to size--it fits perfect--make solid---feminine--attractive---good support (good for larger sizes DD)..Haven't found a  bra this nice in a long time--I ordered the cream color--and am going to order the black and white one as well.Good fit--back doesn't ride up--straps are fine--even thought they do not have the padded shoulder strap...this minimisor works well and is nothing like others I have tried that made me feel like I was in a vise..My Grandmother sold  loungerie her whole life in a high end store---she always said Lilyette was the best brand---she may have been right!!!
