I'm a contractor and these are my go-to shorts for both work and recreation.  I've tried other shorts that are heavy material also but they either weigh me down or restrict my movement and I don't have those issues with these.  I can move around freely, they are comfortable all day, good air flow, and even with regular wear they last for years.
