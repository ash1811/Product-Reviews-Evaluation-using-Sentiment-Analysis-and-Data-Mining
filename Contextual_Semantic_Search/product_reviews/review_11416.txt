I have a bunch of Jansport items in this pattern (white with lavender spots) and they all feel kind of flimsy.  They're not lined, and the zippers feel a bit cheap.  But I only use them for travel, which is once a year or less, and they are so inexpensive that even if they break after one trip, I don't mind.
