My last pair lasted over 2 years and I do laps 4-6 times per week.  I bought the black last time and it gradually faded to brown.  I don't know how fast the navy will fade.8/25/13 update -  The navy faded to brown much faster than the black.  The fabric also didn't hold up as well as the black so I am reducing the rating to 3 stars.  It finally ripped recently and I got reasonable use out of it but months less than the black.
