I Really Wanted to Like These, but... you should try them on in the store first unless you've worn them before. I bought the large and they were still too small for my face. The ear pieces do not flex much -- there is no spring in the hinge area. And if you've been wearing aviator styles with thin frames around the lenses these will be a shock. The thick lens frames will feel like you are trying to look around the center post that separates the windows in your car. They create a blind spot of sorts. If you can live with that -- no worries. They are a great traditional style. Just be sure the size fits you as to width across the face.
