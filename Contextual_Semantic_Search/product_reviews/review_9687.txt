Obviously not an appropriate robe for company, it's still intimate although more conservative than most things. I do love the elegance and flattering design.I purchased this with a complimenting gown from the same line, but in a different color so the contrast would be outstanding underneath the robe when walking about as the skirt flairs open in the center to show the gown underneath.
