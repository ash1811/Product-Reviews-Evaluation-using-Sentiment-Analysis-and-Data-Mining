I purchased a similar shoe a couple years ago. This particular pair of shoes is a shiny leather that looks the same in every other way. I'm not sure if this is the same as what I bought previously, but it seemed like it would be from the pictures. Anyway, the shiny leather squeaks a little while I walk. The sound seems to be going away over time, but it is a little annoying at first
