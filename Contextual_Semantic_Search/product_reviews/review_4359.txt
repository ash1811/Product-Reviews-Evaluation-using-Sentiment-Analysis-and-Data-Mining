My purchase of Jockey Women's No Panty Line Promise Tactel Hi Cut panties arrived today, they are a very pretty powder blue in color. Anyway, I cannot begin to tell you how much I fell in love with them! When I first took them out of the package, they looked very small, but they felt so amazingly soft and silky it was unreal. They are 90% TACTEL Nylon and 10% Lycra Spandex material and feel like butter! I have never felt anything like it! Trying them on they stretched on very easily and like clung to me like magic! They fit like a glove! The soft silky feeling of them against my skin was heavenly! They do have a sort of wide, very soft 100% cotton gusset, which is a very nice feature too, so not riding up your crotch. Being they are high cut is nice also. So I decided to put them to the test, I Put on my tightest leggings, which are yellow, they show everything. I then was modeling them in my full-length mirror. I was very pleased to notice there was absolutely no visible panty line showing through my leggings. So, yes Jockey kept their promise, No Panty Line. I plan on buying more of them in different colors. I would recommend these to anyone, who like comfortable panties, as these surely feel most wonderful. Now that I know how they fit and feel, I would have paid any price for them! I am very happy! Well see how they hold up, I plan on hand cold washing a drip-drying them too. As they seem very delicate. You have to try them, but you might want to shop around, to find the best price on them, and/or you can ask me where I bought mine.
