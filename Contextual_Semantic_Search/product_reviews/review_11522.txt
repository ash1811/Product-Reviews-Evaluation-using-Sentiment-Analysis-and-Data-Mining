I HAVE YET TO RECIEVE THIS ITEM IT'S BEEN 4 DAYS PAST THE ESTIMATED ARRIVAL DATE AND I PAID FOR 1 DAY SHIPPING. I WANTED TO WEAR IT FOR MY BIRTHDAY YESTURDAY AND I ENDED UP HAVING TO GO OUT THE DAY OF AND BUY MY OWN AT A STORE NEARBY. I'M VERY DISSAPOINTED AND I PLAN TO RETURN IT AS SOON AS I GET IT! IT MAY HAVE BEEN A GOOD BRA BUT IT'S WORTHLESS IF IT ISN'T DELIVERED ON TIME!!!!
