I usually buy all my sleeveless bodysuits for my infant directly from the Bon Bebe site as they have the best quality sleeveless tanks with a wider neckline and super quality, way softer fabric at really great prices - a 3 pack runs about $9 regular price, but they always seem to be on sale for $5 on the site.  Someone had gifted me a set of the Carter's sleeveless onesies, which I did not care for due to the smaller arm and neckline - which isn't nearly as comfortable in the heat, so returned the set.  I have purchased several newborn as well as 3-6 month sets from Bon Bebe in anticipation of my summer baby.  My baby is about 5 weeks and is about to outgrow the 3-6 month set from Bon Bebe.  He is about a little taller than average but not overly so and weighs about 10 pounds, and I find most all brands run small on him.  With Bon Bebe being out of stock on the 6-9 month onesies, I decided to purchase some from Amazon.  The Spasilk ones are nice, high quality, but not as nearly well made or better quality than Bon Bebe, and they run small also.  The Spasilk packaging states that the 6 month onesies are for babies up to 18 pounds.  I purchased the 6 month set and after a wash, find them only slightly larger than Bon Bebe's 3-6 month set.  The Spasilk will probably only last a couple more weeks since my baby is growing so quickly.  I purchased another 3 month set from Luvable Friends (also through Amazon) which arrived at the same time and find them much larger.  Luvable Friends also carries colors and patterns if you desire something other than white.  I will probably wait for Bon Bebe to restock and would only buy the Spasilk again if the wait is too long.  I wished Bon Bebe had the sleeveless onesies on Amazon, I would love to order with free shipping through Prime.  In conclusion, these tanks are good, but definitely purchase a larger size if your baby is average or larger.
