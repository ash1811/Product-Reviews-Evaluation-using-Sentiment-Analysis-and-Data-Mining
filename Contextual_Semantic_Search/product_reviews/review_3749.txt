I purchased this pair of Levi's for my father.  He put them on as soon as they arrived and apparently has been wearing them ever since.  He is very picky about how his jeans fit and he says these are VERY comfortable. He is 84 years old and still works in the garden and wants pants that are durable yet comfortable enough for spending afternoons reading.  This style of Levi fits the bill!!
