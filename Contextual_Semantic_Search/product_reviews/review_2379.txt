I have had other Skagen watches and really like them. Over the years I have tried other brands, but keep coming back to Skagen. These are the thinnest and lightest weight watches I have ever seen or owned. Plus, with so many styles there is a large selection. These watches are not costly, so you could pick up a couple. Try one of these watches and you may be glad you did.
