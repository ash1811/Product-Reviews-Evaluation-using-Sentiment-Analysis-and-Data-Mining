Bought 2 of these, a pair for my girlfriend and a pair for myself. We like to go places together looking like FBI agents.These aviators are excellent quality for the price. It's honestly hard to match that. Best part is, since they're so cheap, you don't have to be so worried about breaking them.This is my first time purchasing this particular company or brand of aviators. I always opt for cheap, but of at least decent quality for the reason I stated above. I drop my glasses sometimes and I wanna replace them easy - not with $150 Ray Ban's.The one negative about these aviators is they are dark as night. I need to reemphasize this point to you. The lens on these glasses are VERY dark. The only time the darkness is appropriate is if the sun is brightly shining. If the sun goes behind even a small cloud, it becomes so dark that it is difficult to see.Love the quality, price, and look of these av's, but they are so dark I will keep wearing other ones for the time being except when I go to places like the beach, or anywhere with excessive sunlight. In those cases they will be excellent.
