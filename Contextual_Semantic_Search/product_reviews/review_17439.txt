If you read them, they're mostly old (sorry, but it's true) people complaining that the jeans aren't made the same as they were back in the 70s or 80s. Well sorry but neither are cars, phones or anything else. I started buying these about 2 - 3 years ago and they're my favorite jeans. They're a 'dirty' dark blue with a slight green tint almost but in a way that comes across as looking new far longer than most other jeans. I take care of my body and these fit me really well so I don't know why other people have been complaining about that. So if you're fit or average at least, you should have no problem, you'll rock these jeans
