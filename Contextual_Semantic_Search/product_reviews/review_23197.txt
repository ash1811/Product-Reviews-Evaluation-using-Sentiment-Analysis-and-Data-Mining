I bought these for my son. He loves boots and he wears them ever day no exceptions. I was worried about the wear on them because my son can go through a pair of boots in a couple of months he is really rough on them. But so far these have held up. There is wear on the soles of the boots and I think that will be the part that we have to worry about the most. But they have been a really good pair of boots.
