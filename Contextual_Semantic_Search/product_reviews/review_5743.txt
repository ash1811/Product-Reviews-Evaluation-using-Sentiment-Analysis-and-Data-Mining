FIT TOO SMALL FOR ME, I'M A SIZE 34 WAIST. I GOT THE LARGE AND IT WAS 36-39. NOT GOOD. I RE-ORDERED AND GOT THE MED. 32-34. AND IT WAS WRONG AGAIN, IT WAS A 31 WAIST, SO IF YOUR A SMALL GUY WAIST 29, GET THE MED. IF YOU'RE A REG GUY GET THE LARGE AND HOPE IT SHRINKS IN THE WASH. THE PANTS ARE EXCELLENT, I KEPT THE LARGE AND WILL WASH TILL IT SHRINKS, THEY SHOULD BE PERFECT THEN, THANKS.
