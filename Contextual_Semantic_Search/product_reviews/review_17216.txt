This is 1st layer and should be tight fit right on your skin to hold the warmth. I tried Large and had to change it for Medium.I am 6'1, 165 pounds (185cm, 75 kg) athletic build and the Large size is way too wide on my trunk (maybe the whole cut is meant for someone with wider chest).The sleeves seem to be ok, so I guess Medium will be a tad too short, but I will survive that.Love the material, though, so I think Medium will make me happy.Liked the price and the way Amazon deals with exchanges/return.
