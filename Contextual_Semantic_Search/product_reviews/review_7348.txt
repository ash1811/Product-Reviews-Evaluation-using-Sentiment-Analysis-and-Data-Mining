Certainly this shirt looks nice enough--no better than your average shirt really.  Shirts cut straight from armpit to tail should be banned--their manufacturer's relegated to fry cooking at McDonalds instead of making useless ugly shirts cut like these.  Hey Geoffrey, 32 should be closer to 32 than 64!And those using those plastic collar stays that fall out all the time should have a special torture designed for them.  And their shirts should be rigged to apply that torture the moment the stays fall out.  These shirts alone would put them in an asylum since the stays fall out every time they are washed.This shirt has both of these indicators that the manufacturer has no business manufacturing pick-up sticks let alone shirts.My last purchase of anything made by this pretender.
