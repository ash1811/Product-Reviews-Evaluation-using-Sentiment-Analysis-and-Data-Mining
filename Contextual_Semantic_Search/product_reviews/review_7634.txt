These are snug but not overly so, and I like that the ankles are wrapped tightly which helps to keep heat in.  I understand what other reviewers are saying about the cloth being a little stiff at first due to the waffling, but after a couple of washes now they are pretty soft all around (not super soft, but soft enough for sure).  Good price on these too, which is always a good thing.  I recommend these.-D
