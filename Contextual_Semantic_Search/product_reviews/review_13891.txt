I buy 4 to 6 pairs of these pants in grey a year. They do fade but are very comfortable. The last 3 pairs I have ordered are not the same as they used to be. One pair came with a belt loop only halve sewn on and the material is stiffer. I think Amazon has started selling a lot of items that are seconds, a department store would send this poor of quality merchandise back. I will not be buying clothes from Amazon anymore, and I really don't like shopping at stores.
