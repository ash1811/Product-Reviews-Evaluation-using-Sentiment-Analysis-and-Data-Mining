I have never personally owned a real military issue poncho liner, so I can not comment as to how close these are in quality or thickness.  However I can say they are a great little blanket.  I've washed it about 4 times over the last 5 months and it's held up just fine.  I bought two of them and used one as a ground cover quite a few times for a little star gazing by the fire with the missus.  They have a nice cool feel and are semi water resistant so perfect for that. Now I use the one she didn't claim as a woobie.  I carry it in my backpack stuffed in a small dry bag.  I have used it to cover up with when stuck in air ports and to shield my self from cheap motel beds.  I use it on my own bed as well all the time.  I really love this thing and I recommend that if you don't have you, you get one.
