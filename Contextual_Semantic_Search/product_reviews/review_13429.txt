The Good: I love small billfold type wallets.  Previous to this wallet, I had one I bought at an airport that was very similar and I had it for years.  Once it started to fray on me, I searched around and found this one.  It is a great wallet that allows me to hold my four cards (three credit cards and a drivers license) plus the clear front pocket hold my other ID.  I generally carry about six or seven bills of money and that is about enough to keep the wallet small and comfortable.  Overall, if you are into minimalist wallets, this is great.The Bad:  The flap above the clear pocket stick out too much and now it has been bend so many times its just a floppy piece of leather.  They should have cut it down a little more.  Additionally, there is one extra pocket on the inside which is too small for money but awkward for more cards.  They should not have included it.  Overall, I am happy but it is not my favorite wallet ever.
