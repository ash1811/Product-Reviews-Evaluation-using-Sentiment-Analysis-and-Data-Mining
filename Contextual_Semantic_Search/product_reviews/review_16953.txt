Seriously, it seems like there's a conspiracy to get everyone wearing tight, skinny jeans, notice how the 557s are no longer available, and look at the pictures showing Levi's different styles here on Amazon.Only part of the description that matches the product is "low waist", they are tight in both seat and thigh for anyone with a regular build, if you work out don't waste your time with these.Bought two 527s to replace an ageing pair I was extremely fond of, purchased right here on Amazon, these two new pairs even don't fit exactly the same. 527 is supposed to be the straight boot cut Levi, not anymore. The new jeans are much slimmer and the leg opening is narrower by at least 2 inches, it's nowhere near the 18" advertised. These are not boot cut jeans by any stretch, you'd expect a brand like Levi's to do better.They are actually skinnier than theLevi's Men's 517 Boot Cut Jeanwhich are supposed to be the slim boot cut style, and have a wider leg opening. Styling is completely off. I've always worn Levi's and was really happy I could get the ones I wanted online, but I won't be buying them from Amazon again. If I could give zero stars I would, that's how disappointed I am.
