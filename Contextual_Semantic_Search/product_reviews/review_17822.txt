I bought this watch, a few years back, to go on a whiter-water rafting trip.  I had never been and wanted to be prepared... and not lose gear one way or the other.  The first day was fine.  Just a nice slow easy tour with a few class 2-3 rapids, if we had to work the raft over to get them.  The next day a few hardy souls decided an area that was mostly closed, due to being exceptionally dangerous, save for one run they were tentatively leaving open, would be fun.  So, who was I to deny.  Plus, it did sound like fun (and was).Wow.  Those waters were serious.  The river usually runs at 2 1/2 to 4 foot with somewhat heavy class 2-4 rapids.  When we went it was running at 12 1/2 feet.  As well, like I said, the rating was pretty much wall-to-wall class 4 or more.  No missing these, or having to paddle to them, it was trying to find a safer place between insanity and crazy.  We had to hold tight!  Yeah, well, someone didn't hold tight enough.  Into the drink I went, watch and all.  Oddly, for one time in my life, for no real reason, I had happened to listen to the 'nanny' speech that morning, safety and whatnot.  I did well, but...  I had heavy bruises on the tops of my feet from them nearly being stuck and having to yank back, bruises all over from... who the heck knows what all, and went under (the guys on the raft said) for as long as 40 seconds.  Sure, aim your feet downstream and try to keep it like that.  Nice.  Until you hit a rock at speed or get pulled under and twisted.  Life vest?  Hehehe...  Well, it looked nice.  I was in there for five minutes and now understand what clothes in a washing machine go through.Oh, I did just fine.  I even helped paddle out once they got me back in and then was able to catch my breath.  And the watch?  It looked at me and asked if "We could do that again, daddy?".  Heh  Yeah, if you really need a tight watch, I would recommend this.
