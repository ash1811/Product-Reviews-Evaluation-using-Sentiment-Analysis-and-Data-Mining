Just really great Feedback from my buddy who received this Ironman watch for his BD gift, from me..I picked this watch, because of it's unique features, ratings and the fact that it first caught my eye, when I saw it featured in a movie. In the movie, it was worn by Will Ferrell, in 'Stranger Than Fiction'.Feedback is:* Stainless Steel bracelet > Solid feeling!* Functions in Dual Mode, LED + Sweep Hands* Large number digits, easy to see* Silent Blue Glow Light alarm, Extra Cool!* H2O proof* May be worn as a dress timepiece
