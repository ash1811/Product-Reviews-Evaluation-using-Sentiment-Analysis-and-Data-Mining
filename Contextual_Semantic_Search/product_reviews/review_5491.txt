I'm 6'2&#34; and these run very short on me. If I reach over my head the hem comes all the way up to my belly button. There isn't much to tuck in and they won't stay tucked for any length of time. I also ordered them in 'Desert Sand' and those are just as short as the black ones, so I doubt it was just a bad batch.
