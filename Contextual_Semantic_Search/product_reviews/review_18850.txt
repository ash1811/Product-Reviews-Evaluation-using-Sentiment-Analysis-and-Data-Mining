I don't normally order shoes online after having some bad experiences, thinking they will fit but they don't, so in this case I ordered these sandals a little larger, in a size 8.5WW, which is extra wide.  I could have taken a size 8, but the WW part of these sandals I love.I tried on these sandals, then took them off and buckled the buckle, which I needed to make it smaller, then I adjusted the straps so that they fit correctly on my foot.  Now that they are adjusted correctly to my feet all I need to do is slide them on, then adjust the straps on these sandals.I wore them today.  They were very, very comfortable.  I love that they are leather, that this sandal has some cushioning to it, the heel is not very high.  They look and seem like quality sandals, so that they will last.  Iam glad I ordered these sandals in the WW width, instead of the W width, which is what I would do, to be on the safe side.  The straps do keep your feet from sliding around.  There is nothing I hate worse than shoes that are too tight!I've heard of the company Bass, but had never purchased any of their shoes before.  Iam glad I did, these sandals were just what I was looking for!  They are the PERFECT Summer sandal!
