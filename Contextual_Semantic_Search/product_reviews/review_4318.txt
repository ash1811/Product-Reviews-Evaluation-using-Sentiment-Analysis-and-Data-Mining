I bought my first pair for all-around work years ago, and am surprised at how well they hold up, and the lightness and comfort make them well worth the price - they will last.  I wore them onto rooftops and in any weather; they wash up easily and then recently I wanted this pair for casual and dressier use, they really look sharp with most casual clothing.  I recommend them.
