I ordered larger than I wear because I require an orthotic or insert.  These are so comfortable.  Look nice.  Feel good.I did add an insert and they went from too big to just right.Wanted something casual and easy to slip on and off for summer.These fit the bill.Don't forget 'toe toppers' or 'half socks' :)
