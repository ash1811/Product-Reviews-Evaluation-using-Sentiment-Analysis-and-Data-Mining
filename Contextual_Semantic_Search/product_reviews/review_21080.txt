This swim suit was entirely too small.  I swim three times a week in a rehabilitation pool and I was looking for something that was easy to get on and off, and something that was made to last.  Because of the style of this suit, I don't think it would have been easy for me to get on and off, even if I had gotten a size that fit.  The suit appeared to be made well and probably would have withstood many dips in the pool.  It just wasn't for me.
