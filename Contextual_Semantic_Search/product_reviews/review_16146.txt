We used this for our Britax Marathon convertible car seat and it fit perfectly. When you invest in a car seat the last thing you want is a baggage handler tossing it around. I've seen what they do to regular bags and unfortunately those horrible videos of even pets being mishandled, so I wasn't taking any chances. We didn't use the backpack feature because we checked the bag (usually for free depending on the airline). But the car seat and the bag were both in great condition after our four flights. So, money well spent :)
