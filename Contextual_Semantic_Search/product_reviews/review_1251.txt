I don't think this costume has changed any since one of my older boys wore one years ago.  Fun costume that has held up well even after Halloween for regular play time.One word of caution, buy a size larger than you think you need.  My boy wears a 5/6 normally, and the 7/8 costume just fit.  With a layer of warm clothes underneath he was stuffed tight.
