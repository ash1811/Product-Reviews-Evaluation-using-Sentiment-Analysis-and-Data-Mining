I need slippers with a thicker bottom for running my dogs outside first thing in the morning when the grass is wet.  The Ugg slippers cover that aspect, however, the fur comes off the inside and the slipper quickly becomes way too big and flops around on my feet.  I need to continually wash them in hot water to shrink them.  A lot of money for an okay slipper.  I recommend you research further for other options.
