Been trying all sorts of slippers for around the house. Ok, these aren't exactly slip on and off, but once on they are really comfortable (and they're not hard to get on). Being sock-like you can leave them on when your feet are up on the couch. The sole is suede and looks quite durable (certainly for indoor use) and has a layer of foam between the sock and sole so is quite soft. I have a size UK13/Euro48 average foot and got size X-Large - 12-13 D(M) and they're just right.Might get some for my girlfriend even though she laughs at them - she'll change her tune once she wears them.
