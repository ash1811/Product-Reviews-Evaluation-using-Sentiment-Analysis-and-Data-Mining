The slip is free of unnecessary decoration so it gives your garments a very clean and smooth finish.  The slits (one on each side) end above the knee so the slip does not bunch up or twist when you walk.  If it helps, I am 5'8" tall and and usually take a size 10 in pants and a 12 in dresses and I ordered the slip in size "Large".  The slip ends about 6" above my ankles and the size Large has just enough material to drape nicely over my hips without being clingy or, even worse, too roomy.  Like I said, perfect!
