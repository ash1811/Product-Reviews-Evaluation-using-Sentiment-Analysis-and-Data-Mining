Although through out the years, Levis have stopped making them in USA, the offshore jeans are still pretty good. I give credit to Levis for sourcing their jeans all over the world, and yet are able to ensure the quality of its product. Yes, I don't like that they stopped making regular fit which I used for years. The current straight fit still fits me fine. I just wish the 505s have a lower waist line.
