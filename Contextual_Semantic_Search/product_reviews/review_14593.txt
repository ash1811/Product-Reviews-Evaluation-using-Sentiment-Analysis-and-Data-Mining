I have several pairs of Giorgio Brutini shoes, primarily suede in black and brown.  For the price they are astoundingly well made, durable, and look ten times the price. Decided I would branch out and try some of the brand's other offerings.  Bought a brown cap toe that I really liked.  Color was great and it fit well and looked much more expensive than what I paid for it.  This slip-on was a disappointment. Clunky and cheap looking. Not at all what I've come to expect from this brand. The pattern on the shoe screams fake animal from another planet.  Didn't even try them on.  Back in the box immediately and back to whatever planet they came from.
