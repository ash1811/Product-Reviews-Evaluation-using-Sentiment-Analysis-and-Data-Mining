I was looking for a cool watch for camping and that it was good looking.Pros:1. Gives a military look with 24hrs look and it glows in dark.Cons:1. Not waterproof2. Plastic material, the strap is not very resistant3.  They are much better watches at this price is more like a 10$ watch top.Buy another watch  I get dissapointed at this watch
