My daughter found these at a major department store, the last pair they had and the clerk went to check the sizes and had one 6 and one 8 so she checked other stores and we could not get any.  I came home and looked them up and they were basically the same price and they were sent to my door.  Now for a dance team she needs another pair and I will just order them from here, so easy! Thanks!
