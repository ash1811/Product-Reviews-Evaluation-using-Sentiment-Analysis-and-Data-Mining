I picked up 3 pairs in different colors.  Very comfortable, wrinkles easy but easy to iron out.After the first wash for my black ones, they have already lost a lot of color. Yeah, I'm sure I washed it correctly.Overall, I am satisfied with these..  The measurements are very accurate.  I will buy more in the future..
