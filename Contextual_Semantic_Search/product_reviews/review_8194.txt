I got this watch because I love flight watches and I really wanted to get a Breitling but found out it costs more than I thought so I go this instead to satisfy my urge and my wallet.  It looks great and similar to the Navitimer but like ten times less?!  There is another similar watch that Seiko makes that also has the world time, so you might want to get that instead but the extra LCD display kind of ruins the classical face for me.  The only downside to getting this is that there is really cool technology out there by Seiko and Citizen that eliminates the use of the watch battery, basically you never have to change the battery again.  That is really cool as cracking open the watch every year or two cannot be good and not to mention extra costs.  Kudos for you, bad for the watch repair guy.
