I have to say that it didn't catch my eyes once I opened the box! It was nicer on the picture!This watch isn't too bad, but kind of big and heavy-which I didnt like. I normally like very slim and light watches but I saw lots of good reviews about this watch and decided to buy it. But I ended up not liking it, that's why I exchanged it with a Skagen (which to me is more elegant).What I didn't like about this watch:-I have a thin wrist and since the watch was thick, it kind of hurt my wrist bones. Also it didnt stay firm on my wrist, it'd always slide down from one side of my wrist; and if I tightened it, then it wasn't comfortable due to not being well shaped on the back.-The band was hard and definitely not smooth.-Heavy and bulky and not well shaped.-The second hand did not line up exactly at 12.-It came with a sticker stamp on the back, instead of being printed -or carved (that how looked like on the picture).However, it has lots of cool qualifications: no need for battery, good water resistance, seems strong and durable, numbers and hands illuminate very well in the dark.I believe it is a good one for out door activities like hiking, rafting etc.
