I thought this gown was so pretty and feminine so I ordered two. When I took the gown out of the wrap I was shocked at how wrinkled it was, a sure sign that the material wasn't good quality. It was thin and flimsy, not at all like the picture shows it looking. It looks like it would be flowy with a heavier type of material, it wasn't at all. Very disappointed and they make you pay for the return, waste of money either way, not a good value at all.
