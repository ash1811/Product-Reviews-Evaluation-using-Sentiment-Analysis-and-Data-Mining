So far this Timex watch has been everything the claims say it will be and do..I had to take it to the jeweler's to have a couple of links taken out of the band..and the jeweler very kindly set the date for me..It has been a wonderful addition to my watch collection..I haven't tried the Indiglo light as yet.. With the two-tone bracelet, I'm able to wear it with just about anything..Good looking watch..
