I was needing to replace some Mens Heavyweight Wool Boot Socks, Large Grey and not finding them here at a fair price I thought I would buy these from Wigwam as a possible replacement.  Boy was I wrong. I am outside all day and when inside I am kind of cheap with the heat so its not exactly warm in the house. These socks failed miserably. Granted the Carhartt's are the bomb, but these just are not worth the money. Why?...Well for one the tops stretch to easily and hence they don't stay up very well after even two wash and 2 wears. Second the fabric is thinner then the weight would leave you to believe, they feel more like crews than boot socks. Last but not least the heel is already crushed and flattened after only 2 wears. I know I'm not small @ 220#'s but jezz they should last a season?....My old carhartt's did. So needless so say I am not happy.  Maybe around the house socks but not for real work or outside wear.Yes I went back to Carhartts, I could not find them on here at a good price (shipping killed the deal, And Amazon doesn't have the Boot socks so I got a local retailer to order them.I can not recommend these.
