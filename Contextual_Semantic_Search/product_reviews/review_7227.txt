Had two C-sections and these were a life saver during recovery and the first few weeks post pardum.  It is hard to sneeze or sometimes breathe deep when recovering from a C-section but this helped hold it all together.  Loved it and would recommend it to anyone.  They do run big and are adjustable so as you shrink so does the belt.
