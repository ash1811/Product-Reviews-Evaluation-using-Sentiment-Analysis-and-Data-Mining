I have been buying Reef flip flops exclusively now for the last four or five years. I love the way they look and feel. These are no exception to that. Plus, if you're ever somewhere and need to open a pop-top beverage, there's one built in to the bottom of the flip flop. The price of these were pretty good too; about ten dollars cheaper than I have seen them elsewhere.
