These slippers were comfortable for about a week.  Then they stretched out about 2 sizes larger, and they would fall off my feet when I walk causing me to trip.  The "cushiony" inside, which was the selling point for me, lost its comfort after about a week.  However, I gave it 3 stars because of the price.  They were "inexpensive" and you do get what you pay for.  But I will say that cheaper slippers purchased from the dollar store lasted longer and were more comfortable than these.
