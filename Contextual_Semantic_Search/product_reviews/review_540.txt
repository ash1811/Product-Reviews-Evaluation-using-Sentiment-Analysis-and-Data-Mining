I like the looks of this wallet and especially the color, and all the spaces for cards and your license.  The only thing I had a problem with was the slots for your cards were hard to use. I had alot trouble pulling my cards out, I do like the wallet so I'm going to keep it and hope they will stretch out a little in time.
