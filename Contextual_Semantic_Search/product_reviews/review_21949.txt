I have problem feet. These were recommended years ago by my podiatrist. They are very comfortable and are just what the doctor ordered. I always get Bison Color. I got adventuresome this time and ordered the Grey color. Very nice color. Subtle, not dark. Classy. The fit is just as great. This style of Keen shoes is very forgiving to feet that tire easily and or have issues with arthritis or especially plantar issues.
