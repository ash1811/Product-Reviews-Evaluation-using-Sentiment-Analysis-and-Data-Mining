This is the best shape garment I own.  It slips on easily and does what it is intended to do - cinch up the waist.  It is well made, as all Rago products are.  Plus, since I love to wear stockings, I love the garters.  I especially like to wear it to work under a skirt, and sometimes without panties!  I will order another in a different color.
