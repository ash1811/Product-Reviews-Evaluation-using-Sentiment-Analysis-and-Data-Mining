These are a very comfortable product.  I can hardly tell when I have them on, and the design is great for avoiding pantylines.  The fabric is breathable, but not so thin that it will lose it's shape or support.  They wash well.  It's always hard to find packages of JUST black panties, so I was very excited to see Jockey offered this at a reasonable cost.  Highly recommend!
