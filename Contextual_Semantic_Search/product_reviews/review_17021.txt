The watch band pin remover works well, and is easy to use.  Keep in mind that this tool only starts the pin removal, and you'll need a pair of small pliers to complete the job (I use small, easily available chain nose pliers, about 110mm overall length).  If you read the directions, you'll be able to use this tool on the first try without breaking anything.  Be aware that the pad that the bracelet rests on is spring loaded, but this is not a problem if you read the directions.The only caveat is about watches, not the tool per se.  Normally, a bracelets removable links are marked with an arrow to show the direction to push the pins out.  Some Fossil watches are marked with two arrows...  The pins friction fit in the middle rather than the end on the far side from where the tool's pin engages the bracelet pin.  The tool's pin is a little short for these, but the small pliers make this a non-issue.Read the directions, have the pliers, and this tool is great (Beware of Fossil watches).
