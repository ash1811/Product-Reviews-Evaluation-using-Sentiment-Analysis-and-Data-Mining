When our church started taking collections for school supplies and backpacks, I knew I would order nothing but a Jansport.  It's a good size, carries a decent amount of supplies (I stuffed it full of supplies, including 3 binders!), and the quality is great.  In my opinion, you can't go wrong ordering a Jansport. I'm hoping the child who receives this bookbag is pleased, and that it lasts them a good few years. :)As far as shipping and cost, this bookbag is a steal and was shipped promptly.  Very happy with my purchase. :)
