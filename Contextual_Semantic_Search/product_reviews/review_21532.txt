Perfect!Just what I was looking for for beach trips. I put all my cosmetics, lotions, contact lens gear, soap and shampoos in it with no problem, and hung it on the hook on the bathroom door in the hotel. It gave my husband back his counter space! A nice added feature is the snap-off bottom tier, which would easily fit in most pocketbooks. It's durable and rolls up easily. Love the range of colors and will buy more for gifts.
