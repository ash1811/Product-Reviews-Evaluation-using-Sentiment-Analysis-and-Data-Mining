My husband was having problems finding a good pair of shorts and pants that were big & tall and would not fall apart fast. He tried the Riggs brand shorts first and loved them so much I decided to get him a pair of the Riggs pants for Christmas. He loves them! They fit him perfectly and they hold up well. Before we found Riggs he was going through shorts and pants so fast because they were tearing or holes would develop. He has not had that problem with the Riggs brand.
