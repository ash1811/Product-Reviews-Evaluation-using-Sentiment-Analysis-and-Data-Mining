Thank you to fellow reviewers who gave very accurate feedback regarding sizing. I ordered a size up and slippers are perfect, comfortable and beautifully made.I also ordered them in the Terry Embroidered version - although still comfortable, these solid terry versions are a lot more sturdy in construction.
