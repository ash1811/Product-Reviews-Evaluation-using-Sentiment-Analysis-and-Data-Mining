Soft. Comfortable. Secure. Lasts all summer. Cute. Comes in many color options. Lightweight & super packable. Just enough support & I have foot problems (I used to only be able to wears Birks).What more cold you ask for in a summer shoe! I wear 2 pairs, switching them back & forth, every summer. They last all summer & even into the fall. Yay!
