I planned a simple ceremony so I needed a simple dress. I bought this dress in white and had my seamstress add straps and lace to the bodice. Overall I was very happy with the quality of the dress and since it comes with a useless sash there was plenty of fabric for the alterations I wanted. I went by the size chart and after reading all the comments already posted I ordered one size smaller than the chart. Well, it fit but was a bit snug. I had to have the dress let out, had I ordered the next size bigger I would have had to make it smaller. The price was terrific, in fact since I used Amazon points I paid nothing for it and only $35 for alterations and I had a custom dress.
