I got this wallet as a temporary fix after a wallet I got in Italy finally gave up the ghost.  I like this one so much that it won't be temporary--it will be the one.  It is nicer in person then in the photo, the leather is soft, and it is easy to organize.  I also like that the checkbook cover is removable.
