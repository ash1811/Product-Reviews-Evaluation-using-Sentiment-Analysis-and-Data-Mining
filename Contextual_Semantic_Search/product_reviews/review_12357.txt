I've heard a lot about Rainbows and decided to get a pair. They are painful to break-in, but after that they fit well to your feet and are the most comfortable and durable flip-flops I've ever owned. I have a VERY high arch that tends to make me wear through shoes quickly, but these seem durable enough to withstand.
