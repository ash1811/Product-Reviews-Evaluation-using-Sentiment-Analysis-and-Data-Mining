These socks are great. They're are very comfortable. I know these are advertised for hiking, but I have worn them with 2 inch heeled boots before and they're great. My feet would normally start hurting after walking for a long time in those boots, but with these socks on, my feet don't hurt at all. It's amazing. These socks really do what they say they do. I would order another pair.
