This is a great hat!  It comes in a size big enough to cover my big head, and not fall off.  It fits perfectly (and the Amazon size chart, was very useful in judging the size).  This hat offers a nice brim that keeps the sun off of my head (I burn easily), but is not too large where it gets in my eyes, or in the way (it is pretty stiff, and not just hanging).  Like others have said this hat comes folded in the package, I tossed mine in the dryer (on a low setting), and let it tumble in the heat for about 20 minutes.  After that it was perfectly wrinkly free!  I also took out the string (to tie the hat around your chin), I found the hat to be a perfect fit to my head, and did not need to be tied to me.In the end, this is the first hat that I have ever liked, and so far it has been perfect for my big head, and for keeping the sun off of me!  I highly recommend this hat for anyone looking for a great fitting and nice looking hat!!  Very happy with my purchase!  However, be sure to check your hat size, like I said, the Amazon sizing guide was useful to me -- I got the 3XL.
