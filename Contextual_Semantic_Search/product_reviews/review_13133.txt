After watching many episodes of &#34;Double Divas&#34;, I was so excited when they started an online store with a fitting portion.  I found out I was actually wearing 2 cup sizes too small and 3 band sizes too big!  I ordered this bra because it reminded me of a Playtex bra I used to wear (obviously in the wrong size).  I was very pleased with the purchase.  It was comfortable to wear all day and I absolutely love the subtle color.  I had no problems with this bra and will definitely purchase it in the future as I have a need.
