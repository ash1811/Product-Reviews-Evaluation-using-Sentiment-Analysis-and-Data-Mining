For only 10 dollars can't see why anyone would have a complaint about this watch.  If it doesn't work right you only lost 10bucks so what?  And it being a Casio based on their reputation I'm willing it will serve you good for at least a few years or more.  It's amazing they can make this so cheap, ya can thank Chinese labor for that, if it were made in the U.S. this watch would be running you 40 dollars, 30 dollars at the very least.
