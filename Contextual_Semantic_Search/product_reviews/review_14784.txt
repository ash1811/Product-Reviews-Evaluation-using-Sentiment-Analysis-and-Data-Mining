I normally wear a 10 in closed-toe shoes, and a 9.5 in sandals.  I ordered size XL.These were snug and even though their fabric was stretchy-polyester, they became tiresome after a couple of hours.  They maintained steady pressure on my big toes because they weren't loose enough.  They were wide across the toe tips, but that didn't help them fit me.  That just gave them a bit of a duck-foot appearance.
