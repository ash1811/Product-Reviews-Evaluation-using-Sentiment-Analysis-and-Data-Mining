I've only had an opportunity to wear this bra once.So far it seems like it's fine.  I feel like the cup size is perfect for me.  I purchased a medium, and wear a 34 DDD+ (prior to pregnancy, not sure of my exact size now).I wish it had clasps on the front or back so I would not have to take it off over my head, but otherwise, it seems like an ok bra.
