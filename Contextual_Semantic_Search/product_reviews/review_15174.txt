I purchased this shirt along with the competing Gildan t-shirt.Both are similar in nearly every detail.  After a few wash/wear cycles, I believe that I like the Gildan shirt slightly more.  The Gildan shirt seems to be slightly softer but only slightly.  I do wish that both shirts had a little bit more stretch to them, they are pretty stiff.Well worth the money !
