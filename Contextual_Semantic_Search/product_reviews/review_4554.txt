The pants are great! Fit very well are are well constructed, i liked them so much i bought a second pair the same color . The front pockets are a little tight but i am also 6&#34;4 250. Thats to be expected . Double stitched knee is great and 5th pocket is nice and big, also the loose fit is perfect for loose fit sizes
