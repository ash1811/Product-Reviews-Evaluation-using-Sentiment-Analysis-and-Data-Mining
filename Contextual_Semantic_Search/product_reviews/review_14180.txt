Great service from The Shoe Mart....quick delivery.  Even though the shoe was marked as a 9.5M, the shoe was about a half size too small and not the correct width.  Obviously a problem with the manufacturer and not Sperry itself.  I have 3 pairs of Sperry Topsiders, and all are 9.5M and they fit the same.  The leather for this shoe did not feel as supple as my other Sperry shoes.
