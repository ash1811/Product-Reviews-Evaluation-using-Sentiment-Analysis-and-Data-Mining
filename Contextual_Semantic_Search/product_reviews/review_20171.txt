Decently made, looks nice and keeps the sun off of ears and neck.  But does not really keep you cool at high temp.  In fact, the opposite.  Only practical in cool temps.Not comfortable, either.  Tight in the wrong place for me.  Gives me a headache.  I have to place it on top of my head without bringing it all the way down snug around my crown.I would have spent a little more and purchased something better.Actually, I just did.
