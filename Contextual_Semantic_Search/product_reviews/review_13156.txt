I like this bra. At first, I agreed with the reviews that said it caused an odd shaped bust, but after wearing it a bit, I like it. I think the cups have stretched to a nicer shape. I like the fact that this has support without underwire. I often wear it for my walks rather than an exercise bra because it's much more flattering that an exercise bra!
