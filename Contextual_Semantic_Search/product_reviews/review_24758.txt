I have had a pair of Reef sandals for almost three years now. They have more than served their purpose now. I figured that I would never be able to find sandals that were as soft and comfortable. Then I found the Phantoms on Amazon and they have definitely replaced my old Reefs. I suggest the plaid ones if you aren't sure what to wear them with. They are the most neutral colored.
