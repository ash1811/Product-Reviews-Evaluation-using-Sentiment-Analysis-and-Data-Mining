I ordered a pant size waist 35 inches and the pant came size 37.5 inches, so I can not used it. I am seeing many complains regarding the wrong size. The problem is that  that  Levi does not have Quality Control in the sewing plant or they are not doing thei job. The Amazon Service Department is very good, they solved the problem. I am very happy with them.
