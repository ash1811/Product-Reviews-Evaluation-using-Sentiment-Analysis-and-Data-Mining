I was thrilled when I opened the box to find this necklace was so good looking. I bought it to replace an older dingy silver chain that I was using on a new pendant, because the chain that came with the pendant broke shortly after buying it. Jewelers never seem to provide a sturdy, good quality chain, even when you spend hundreds on the pendant itself. So when I opened the box to this very affordable chain, and it glistened and rolled around like liquid mercury, I was ecstatic. It was as shiny and good looking as the pricey pendant I was going to wear with it. It was a perfect match.The box chain design catches the light and gives it strength. It also keeps my pendant from twisting around in the front, which was a problem with the last chain. It's very smooth, and doesn't pull on any skin hairs, and the clasp in the back is easy to open and close. It's been just the perfect chain. Looking and shining like platinum, at a low afordable price. If anything happens to this one, I'll definitely be picking up another.
