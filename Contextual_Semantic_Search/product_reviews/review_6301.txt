This shirt is not only an awesome sports/fishing shirt, it is great in the desert. I have several - even one with my LSU Tigers logo on it! It is so comfortable, I wear it in the winter in the desert (VERY cold) and just wear my warm tactical coat over it until I enter my control post. If you don't own several, you should!
