hello,wrangler makes great shirts with snaps.  like all wrangler shirts, this one fits well, it feels very soft right out of the packaging.  the snaps are an added bonus. do not compare these stonewashed shirts to the stiffer performance work shirts.  those are stiffer and will hold up to much use and punishment.  these stonewashed ones are like putting on a soft blanket.  they fit well, feel tremendously soft and look great.  dressy or casual...any style will do for this great shirt.  yrmv
