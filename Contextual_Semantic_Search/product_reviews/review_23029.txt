Very comfortable, will definate rebuy these...but they are not wearing out...tough shoe...great in the snow...perfect for dress and casual wear.Update:  now, after 2.5 years of wear, I am just now buying a new pair, the sole and upper leather still look great, but the insole wore out, I tried to replace the insole 2 months ago, but they have never had the same comfort....is well worth a re-buy, wear these shoes everyday for work in a business casual setting..
