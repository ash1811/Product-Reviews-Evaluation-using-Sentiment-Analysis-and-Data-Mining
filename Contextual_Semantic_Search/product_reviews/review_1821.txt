I looked at many shoes that had the traditional office type look but I needed them to be something I could stand in all day and even do a lot of walking on hard surfaces.  I purchased a pair of Rockport walking shoes in 2002 and after having ground through  that 1,000 steps Dakota Trail in the Dandenong ranges I was convinced Rockport are the king.  I read all the reviews from people who also stand a lot and have problematic feet and was convinced these were right.  Good decision.  I wore them for two days and  sometimes I dont know I am wearing them. So light and good heel and sole grip.  I like the style as they can be worn for two purposes, walking and going out in the evening. Thanks to all the good folk who contributed to my decision to buy them.July 2012 -  My feet never felt sore or tired and I did not have to wear my orthotic insoles at any time(in fact I left them home on the basis of the reviews I read prior to purchase.  Waterproofing never failed for those days when it did rain.  I would recommend wearing thicker socks than normal though because the thin cotton or polyester socks then to chaffe on your skin.  That was not a problem for me as I did a trial wear.I now wear these rockports to work all the time.  Best shoes I have ever purchased.
