I buy these shirts for my husband every year and I am thrilled to find them on Amazon! First, I want to let you all know that these do run a size larger. My husband normally wears an extra large so I purchase these in a large and they're perfect. The shirts wash well and do not shrink. While I will say that you need to take them straight out of the dryer when they are dry as they are prone to wrinkle, there are so many greater qualities that makes me not care if I have to iron them! They have a mesh fabric under the back flap of the shirt that allows heat to escape so these shirts are so cool in hot weather. Rain rolls right off of them and you never see sweat. Anyone who works out in the field absolutely would benefit by purchasing one for every day of the week! These are sharp and handsome looking shirts that come in a big variety of colors that do not fade. Amazon needs to put my husband on commission because now all the guys that work with him buy them. I just put two more in my cart!I HIGHLY recommend these awesome shirts and I thank Amazon for carrying them as they are much cheaper here than in the Sports Stores! You can't go wrong and they are addicting!
