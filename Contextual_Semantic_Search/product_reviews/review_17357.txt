I love this bag! This is the second one I have owned, only because I wanted it in black too. It is a very comfortable bag that does not fall off of my shoulder. There are many different pockets so that I can stay organized and have places for all of my things. There are secure pockets on the outside as well as easy access pockets. This bag works well as a purse, but has plenty of room to stash a waterbottle or other larger items. I like it because I can fit a few diapers and wipes in it for a quick trip with my daughter without carrying around the big diaper bag. My first bag has been used heavily for the last 5 years and still looks great. I would highly recommend this bag.
