For the price I paid I expected a decent quality product. What I got is comparable to socks you can buy at the local flea market at $5 for a dozen pair. These 'Big and Tall' Quarter socks designed to fit people who wear shoes size 12-13 just fit my size 13 foot. Putting them on I can see then pulling thin at every seam already. At one point I could actually see my flesh between the threads at the toe seam and in the heel cup. I have little hope of these lasting very long but since I don't often wear shoes/sneakers and socks I'm just going to keep them and switch to a different brand when these eventually apparently quite rapidly fall apart.{Update}Wore and washed these socks. 2nd time I went to wear a pair one of the socks completely fell apart at the ribbed shaft. I know I said I expected them to fall apart but I thought I'd get more than one use out of each sock. The only bright side is Amazon's amazing customer service who have already issued a refund for the cost of the socks less than 12 hours after I contacted them.Avoid these socks.
