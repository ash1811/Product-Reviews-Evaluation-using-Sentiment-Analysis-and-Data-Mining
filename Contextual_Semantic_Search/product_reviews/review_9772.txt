based on the other reviews, I should have known the dress would have been too large. It most certaintly was. I ordered a 5x for one of my bridesmaids and a L for another. These were the correct sizes based on the measurements given on the size chart listed under the pictures. For both girls, when they put on the dress it dropped straight down off them! Luckily, both girls were able to get the dress taken in / take it in themselves. I would definitely recommend ordering at &lt;least> one size smaller than you would based on the size chart. The dresses were of a high quality satin, and the removable straps and shawl were nice additions.
