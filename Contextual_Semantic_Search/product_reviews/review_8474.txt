Got this for my grown kids. The Gryfindor hat/scarf on Amazon match - acryllic type material.  This Sytherin scarf is more of a lambs light-wool, but it matches the acryllic hat fairly close. Can't wait to give these for Christmas. Probably not for super cold days, but a nice gift anyway. The hats are stretchy - I think works for both kids or adults.
