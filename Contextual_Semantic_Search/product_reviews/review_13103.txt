Have finally found a bra that:  lifts without pain in the shoulders; the sizing is accurate; is comfortable; and oh so pretty.  I've tried (and purchased four) of another Playtex bra (Playtex Women's 18-Hour Active Lifestyle)  - same size, but has little support.  To its credit, it is good for relaxing around the house or wearing to bed.  I really like Playtex bras, but like kissing some frogs to find the right one, you gotta do this with Playtex.  Oh, and the price is unbelievably low for such a quality undergarment.  I would have given this bra five stars if it lifted a bit more, but I'm very satisfied with it since I refuse to wear underwire.
