It has been a challenge finding bras without bones, smaller cups and comfortable. Had one of these, finally stopped looking and bought 3 more on line. Am a 42c and most of it in my back. These are so comfortable that I have fallen asleep in them and not compelled to tear them off as soon as I get home!
