This shoe has so much to offer, I can't recommend it enough. The leather is hand tooled (says so in the box), and beautifully detailed with a subtle wing tip look. I bought the black leather, and it has little bronze or gold accents as shown in the photo. The size I purchased was a 9.5 Wide and it fit my feet so perfectly I didn't have to break them in. They felt good all day, every day I have worn them for 8 hrs or more at the office, and walking to and from transit. They are also lined in a light colored leather, which I also find appealing because fabric and synthetic liners can make your feet stink.  I have dancer's bunions, and these did not bother them one bit with the wide width. They fit very true to size for me with the wide selection. I am going to order them in Navy and Brown, they are so perfect.
