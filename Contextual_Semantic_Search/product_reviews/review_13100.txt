I try various bras to find the occasional one I like - and I *love* this one! Everything about it is perfect for me; fit, support, even an awesome periwinkle color. I am a 42DD and this bra provides enough support that I can run in it at the gym should I forget my sports bra. No more need to shop around, I believe I have finally found THE bra I will stick with.
