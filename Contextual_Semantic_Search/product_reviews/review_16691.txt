The color (red) is quite nice. Based on suggestions from other reviewers, I ordered a 3x for a 5 foot 6 200+ lb woman and it was VERY roomy...but robes aren't supposed to be tight, I guess. The sleeves are long and roomy and the length of the robe was good. The accompanying "babydoll" nightgown didn't look too difficult to figure out and seemed like a nice fabric.
