These are pretty decent looking earrings, and overall for the price I am satisfied. The only complaints that I have are how easily they creep down and fall out if you don't check them every so often; I have nearly lost them on a few occasions. They are extremely light weight and you don't even notice them unless you move your head a lot and they swing. Also, the chain is that sort of stiff chain where it won't double back on itself, it more curves around, so when they hang from your earlobe they don't just cascade gently down, they more curve out then down, which isn't as attractive, in my opinion. They feel and appear fairly cheap, especially considering they are Swarovski, but like I said, for the price I am satisfied with the quality of the product.
