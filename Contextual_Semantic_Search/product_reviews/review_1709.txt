My husband goes through a couple pairs of these every year.  We keep an eye out for a good price and I can't believe I didn't check Amazon sooner!  What can you say about Carhartt bibs?  They are great, extremely durable (my husband is unbelieveably tough on his work gear.)  We will most definitely be looking to Amazon for our future Carhartt purchases.
