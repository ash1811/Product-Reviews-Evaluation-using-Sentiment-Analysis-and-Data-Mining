I probably should have bought 4 pairs and then picked the best one pair. The last time I bought this shoe, however, I had good luck the first time. So I loved the shoe and it lasted a really long time. I wore it at the gym only and when it wore down a little with less cushioning,  I got a Spenco total support insert for it and its good to go again. I wanted to try a new pair but it may have just my bad luck as they were too narrow in the toe box unlike my older pair so I sent them back and kept my old ones with my new inserts.
