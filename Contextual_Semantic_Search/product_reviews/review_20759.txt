If you're wearing a hiking shoe or a 3/4 sneaker, maybe they won't show.  With Sperrys, Chucks, or any kind of loafer, they show.  At least an inch of sock sticks out the back of low Chucks, so, you aren't going to get the no-sock look you're after.  They are actually quite a bit higher that white Hanes no-show socks, which boggles the mind.Having had Hanes socks before, I hope the quality is as good.  Price is reasonable, too.  BUT... they SHOW.  A lot.  I will be keeping them since the cost of returning makes it pointless.UPDATE:  these horrible socks shrink dramatically.  I've gone from being disappointed to thoroughly disgusted and will, in fact, never buy a Hanes sock again.  After first washing and drying on low heat, they are so small that they barely fit my wife. They do, however, make great outdoor toys for the dogs since they can be washed when they get dirty.
