They are very good quality shoes and very cute. However, I have wide feet and they did not seem wide enough (I order the C/D width which works with 90% of other shoes).  Also, even though I ordered the right size and they seemed okay length-wise while standing still, they came off of my heel with every step I took. I had to return them.I love other Naturalizer shoes and own many, but these were not for me.
