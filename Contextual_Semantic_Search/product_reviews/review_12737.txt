This bra is a lot larger than the picture makes it look. It has the feel and shape of a vintage foundation garment. If you are looking for a &#34;bullet bra&#34; look, this is the bra for you.It's pretty hefty, so the support is right. However, it's a bit tight in the ribs and large in the bust. I feel like I should have gone up a band size and down a cup size for a better fit.
