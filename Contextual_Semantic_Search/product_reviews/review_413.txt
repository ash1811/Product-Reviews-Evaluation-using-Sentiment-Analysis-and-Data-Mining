I've always loved Converse shoes as they are trendy and comfy. I absolutely love the shoes, though the color I chose (Parasailing) it's a little bit different from the one shown in the picture, a little more towards green than turquoise. Nevertheless, I am happy with my purchase. The seller is concerned about getting feedback from the customer on their overall purchase experience., which I think it's great.
