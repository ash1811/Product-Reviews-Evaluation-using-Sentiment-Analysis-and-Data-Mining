I tried these on just as soon as I came home from work. Of course, that's when your feet are most swollen. I immediately noticed that these shoes were narrower than others of my size. If I had tried these on in a store, I probably would have tried on a wider size just to be sure. As I wore them around the house a bit, they seemed to loosen up. However, there is no 5-star rating here. They feel flat and non-supportive, compared to other shoes of this type. I am not satisfied with that at all. I suspect that I will feel every pebble and bump under my feet. I am very surprized that Easy Spirit shoes would be like this.However, they will do as an "extra" pair for work. I am not thrilled, but I certainly don't hate them. If I ever did buy another pair (the price on Amazon is lots cheaper on other web sites) I would opt for a wider size. The great array of colors is certainly a great temptation.
