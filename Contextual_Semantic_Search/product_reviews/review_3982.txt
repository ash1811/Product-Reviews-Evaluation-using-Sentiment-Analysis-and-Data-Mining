I  am happy with the jeans and how they fit, but usually when I get 517's, they are really stiff and then I get to break them in. This pair was already like pre-washed,just differnt than what I am used to, but I still like them and will wear them. Maybe I have to look into differnt types and find exactly what I am looking for next time. Thank you
