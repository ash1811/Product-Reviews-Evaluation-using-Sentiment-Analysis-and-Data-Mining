You can def shower with the watch on, even swim with it on. If you are in scuba diving and all that than why would you get this watch? its definitely not qualified for that. Well  watch got here on time its just how it looks on pic. All functions are very simple and it does come with the manual. I wouldn't say its structure is flimsy, it should hold up with normal wear and tare. Well I'm  satisfied and will purchase again soon.
