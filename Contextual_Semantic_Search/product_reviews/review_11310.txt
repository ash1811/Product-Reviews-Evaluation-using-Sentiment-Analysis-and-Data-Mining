Perfect for school books and accessories. My son used to carry a larger more complex backpack, that had a lot of straps and extra stuff. He never used the extra stuff, so this backpack is right on. It is extremely light, durable and can carry all of his school materials. Plus, the price is good if you are a Prime member.
