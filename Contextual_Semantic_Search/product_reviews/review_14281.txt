I would quickly and honestly recommend these pants for quality- yet economically-minded shoppers. The price was great and the jeans are not cheaply made. I was pleasantly surprised at the fit as well. They are not too baggy or tight, and the length is right...they seem to be true-fit to size. The color was a deep, smooth and even black as well....not that cheap flimsy greyish black dye job you often see on lesser quality pants. I was happy with this purchase.
