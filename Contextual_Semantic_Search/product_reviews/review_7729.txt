I've ordered from Gem Ave before (2x) the band is not 3mm and looks cheapyou get what you pay for. The package was ripped and the box was what looks like pulled apartthe plastic bag the boxed ring came in looked like it had punch though. On top if I'm wanting to returnit I have to pay shipping which was cost of half the puchase not worth it I'll give it to my niece very disappiontedGem Ave
