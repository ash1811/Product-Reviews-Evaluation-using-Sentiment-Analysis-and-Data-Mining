First off, as the name implies, these Adidas Sambas are classics. They've been around 40 years (probably more) and they still look fresh! In my shallowness, I bought them on looks alone for around-the-house/ casual-Friday's.They are a bit narrow, which is great for me. But they do lack a bit in arch/ball of the foot support. You'd think that if they're making these shoes for narrow-footed people, they would have better arch support because most people with narrow feet tend to have higher arches, right? If you have wide feet, you might want to avoid these.As for the extra-long tongue, I have to say that I kind of like it. It makes the shoes unique. But I think if you wore low-socks, the tongue might chafe you and look funny. Also, folding the tongue down looks kind of dumb as you can see part of the sizing tag.I found the sizing (10.5) to be pretty much right on, maybe a smidge bigger than my other Adidas. Overall though, for the price (I found mine on sale for $30!), I thought they were are a great deal! I really like these Samba Classics. They look fantastic and fit good for a casual shoe. I just wish they had a bit more support (like the Samba Millenium's do), then they'd be perfect.
