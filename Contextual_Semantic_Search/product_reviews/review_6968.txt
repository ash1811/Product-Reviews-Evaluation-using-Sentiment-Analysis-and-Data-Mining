I purchased these mainly because of all the glowing reviews of people who wear them with cowboy boots. They are perfect for that and much cheaper than the boot socks made for that purpose. I don't know if I can add anything to what's already been written, but I'll try. They are mid weight socks, not nearly as thick as hiking socks but much thicker than dress socks. They stay up all day without being uncomfortably tight around your calves. They are super soft and very long, coming up to my mid knee. Sure makes wearing boots more comfortable.
