This is absolutely adorable.  I have the fussiest baby in the world.  No really, he has won the Sleep-Fighting Championship of the World.  When he's mad, he's mad.  I bought this for him to wear at Halloween this year.  For fun, we tried it on this weekend and it's awesome!  Definitely worth the money.
