Been having a hard time finding a nursing bra that gave me good support and made my boobs look normal! I'm a DD and almost an E, and most nursing bras are horribly unsupportive. I bought this based on the reviews. I like it. Gives good support, comfortable, and a nice shape. Closet thing To a normal bra that I have found.  It has molded cups so it hides the nursing pads well. The snaps are good an sturdy. So far it's been a great bra and reasonably priced. I've always worn underwire bras as have never found a bra without underwires that gave me support. It's a great bra for daytime under your normal clothes. The only thing that is kind of annoying is the molded cups. While I like them for hiding nursing pads and such, it is a bit annoying to have to push the molded cup down out of the way to nurse or pump. that's the reason I have 4 stars and not 5. Other than that, definitely worth the purchase. Fits pretty true to size.
