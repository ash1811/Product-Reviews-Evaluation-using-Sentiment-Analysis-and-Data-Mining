I have the orange version (Orange Monster) of this watch, as orange dials as well as yellow dials work better in low light or murky water conditions.  I have other divers as well (Citizen "Eco-Zilla" 300 metre, as well as some Omega 300 metre Seamasters).  For around $200 (or less) this is a typical good quality Seiko diving watch.  The bezel is 120 click, works smoothly, and is very readable.  The lume is very good, even rivaling my Omega Seamaster watches.It has a slightly domed crystal, which aids in reducing reflections under water.  The accuracy is OK, but not great.  I suspect that if it was worn more, it would settle down a bit, but it spends a fair amount of time on one of my winders rather than my wrist.The band is really well made and very substantial.  It does have a divers extension, but I replaced my band with an orange "Zulu" nylon divers band, as it is easier to use over a wetsuit, and isn't as heavy as the SS band supplied by Seiko.  This watch takes a 20 mm band.The dial is very legible, well made, and uncluttered.  I wish that they would make one with a yellow face, but the orange looks great too.  The finish on the case and bezel is good, and the watch really looks more expensive than it really is.This is a great beater, and is a good addition to your dive computer as a timing back-up device.  This is my second Seiko diver.  My first was a 150 metre diver that I bought over 30 years ago, and that one still runs to this day.  If that is any indication, this one should give years of service with only a few trips to the watch maker for adjustment, cleaning, and lubrication.Again, in typical Seiko fashion, you certainly get your money's worth out of this watch.  I would not hesitate to recommend this, or any other Seiko diver, for actual diving use or for those "desk" divers out there.
