My doctor has a Rolex that two or three feet away is virtually indistinguishabe from my Invicta 8928.  I couldn't wait to tell him I had paid less than $90 for it, which is less than he pays to have his Rolex cleaned.  My Invicta is not a Rolex, so I am not expecting a lifetime of service from it.  I'll be glad to get four or five years out of it, and then I'll replace it.  I suspect it may last longer, as I have a number of watches and I only wear this one once a week or less.  Plus I am not hard on watches and take good care of them.  I suspect there are a lot of people like me, so here are a couple of tips.  The Invicta 8928 is an automatic, and keeping it running can be a bitch.  Watch the World of Watches sales, and buy a winder for it.  The winders normally go for $80 or so, but half that on sale.  Adjust the winder to max winding (the instructions will tell you how) and return your Invicta 8928 to the winder when you take it off.  I've never had to wind mine, but apparently it's recommended you do so every few weeks.  Your Invicta manual will tell you how.  As I said I haven't had to do that; apparently my winder does the job for me.  I've had mine six months, and it has never stopped.  It seems to be very accurate.  It's more of a dress or business watch.  If you're a mechanic or plumber and work with tools, get a Cassio or Timex and store your Invicta on the winder.  Get a jewelry cloth and shine it when you're dressing up and you're going to make people think you're one of those Rolex guys.  It's a chick magnet, and you don't have to tell them it's not a Rolex.
