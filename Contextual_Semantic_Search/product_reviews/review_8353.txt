I must tell all who are interested that this bra is literally the most comfortable one I've ever owned. I have had to wear an underwire since I was 17. Even though it does look like "an old ladies bra" it's wonderful for those post menopausal women out there like me-especially in the summer(although I wear it all year). It's the super absorbent cottony fabric-the fact that the underwires don't cut in ever and that you don't have to fiddle with the straps adjustments-it just fits beautifully. I (over the years) have had one in every color and I DON'T USE IT AT ALL FOR SPORTS! I also must emphasize the fact that I have never paid this low a price-even with shipping!!!  Comfort always wins out with me!!P.S. I failed to mention the fact that I am pushing 60 and I've been wearing a42DD all of those years. I think that is pretty impressive for a bra. And also its serves very well as a minimizer .
