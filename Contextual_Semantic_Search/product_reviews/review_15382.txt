I got four of these shawls for myself and the other bridesmaids in a friend's wedding.  The wedding was in the Adirondacks in October so we were a bit worried we'd be cold during the outdoor ceremony.  It ended up being too warm to wear it but they were great for later in the evening when it got chilly.  It's a great size and a perfect weight if you just need a little covering.  I didn't realize until it got here that there was a pattern on it.  It's absolutely beautiful!
