Don't buy expecting too look good in these. Though the picture may make you think different, They are a bit embarrasing. Haven't worn them outside because of that, and serves as a reminder to try things on before you buy. Usually you end up regretting it in the mirror. I dont like to give negative reviews if the product works but when I'm compelled, I like to warn others. Remeber, these are work pants. Treat them as such.
