I love my Uggs but ordering a new pair is always challenging. What size were my last ones? We're they adult or big kid? With a hole finally appearing for my left big toe and the label unreadable I have to guess. I obviously keep mine for a long time! I love that I can order the inserts and refresh them every year. So I ordered the 6 in women's. I wear a 6.5 normally. Short toes. I was surprised at how much smaller the opening was to get my foot in and it wasn't just because it was new. I guess they are cutting some corners. I still like them and I am keeping them expecting them to stretch a bit.  Next pair maybe a 7. I am just worried they will get too big. I am not sure about the ordering down a half size anymore.
