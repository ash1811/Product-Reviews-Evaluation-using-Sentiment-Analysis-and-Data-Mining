These are really nice slippers. My husband likes them a lot. I spent more and bought from Amazon.com and it's Marketplace vendors instead of from one of the big back east catalog companies. They were all more expensive but all of higher quality. He wears slippers exclusively anymore now; even though we live in Hawaii. There really are no slippers to be bought HERE on the Big Island of Hawaii. He wears a perfect size 11 shoe but we have to buy a size 13 in slippers. These were a bit loose but a 12 would have been to short. Nice quality, well made. A big thank you to Amazon and it's Marketplace vendors; we just love you and buy almost everything online now. 99% of what we buy is not sold here! and if it were it would be twice the price. Hats off to you all!
