pretty decent, very thin nylon and overall looks pretty much like it does in the ad photo.  Except the hood isn't attached to the top. It has tiny velcro that is suppose to hold but doesnt really stay on his heaad.  The other peices are fine, so its ok for his a kid's dress up. My five year old took a size medium and he's a size 6.
