The first pack of these I bought long ago, and they've lasted me for three years.  My new pack feels to be of the same quality as they keep their shape very well.  I do wish they made these in XLT, as with a long torso and some belly they aren't quite long enough to be tucked into lower rise jeans.  Usually though, these are the best undershirts I've owned.
