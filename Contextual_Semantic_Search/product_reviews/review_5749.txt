When I got the V neck  Anvil 452 I thought it looked a bit large.  I ordered it in xl, which lately seems to mean skin tight (I am 5'9", ahem, around 150 pounds).  Also, the cotton is not soft like ringspun cotton is.But I LOVE the shirt.  I wish I ordered more...I wear this one too often.  It  has a blousey loose fit around the stomach , even looser around the hips, but fairly tight, with shortish sleeves up on top.  It does not look like a baggy Men's t.  The V neck is not too big so your precious skin stays fairly protected, but you can put crew necks under it that stick out the sleeves a bit for a layered look, or tanks.The only problem with it is you really can't tuck it into any pants that aren't super thick, since there is a lot of cloth on the bottom of the shirt as it widens out.IT IS NOT super tailored tight sexy midriff naked like many other styles of Anvil (I keep writing Advil...I love their shirts, they kill pain), and I wish it was soft like ringspun cotton, but it will break in and hopefully shrink just a smidge for a perfect fit on me.  In your tight tailored anvil shirt, I order a 2x or whatever is above xl, due to me not being comfortable with my stomach showing or being squeezed by my shirt---I don't have a 6 pack any more....
