Lets first say I got the correct size as all my other bra's are this size and it is a little snug.  Next Holy torpedo t*ts Batman, did not expect to have my chest look like I had two ice cream cones sticking out. Not so sure what playtex was thinking the 1950's is long gone. Next I really do not find the gel shoulder pads all that comfortable and the scallop edging on the bra is not very comfy.  Last but not least I cannot stand when you cannot adjust the straps in the front, the objects you want to raise up or lower are in the front not the back.  I guess the one positive thing I can say it really gives you support and pointy lift, the first thing I do when I walk in the door though is whip it off.
