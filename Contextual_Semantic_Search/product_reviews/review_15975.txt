I started using this brand about 7 years ago when I saw them in the pharmacy of the hospital I frequented during one of my check-ups. The thing that attracted my attention was how soft and 'cushiony' they feel. A pair lasted me more than a year of constant washing. What's great about them is, they provide adequate cushioning on the major areas of your feet that rubs on your shoes a lot. That said, you need to get athletic shoes that is a tad bigger than you would normally wear to get a comfortable fit or else your shoes will run snug. All in all, great quality socks. Even if they are a tad pricy! *hint hint* lol
