I bought these mainly for the backs, and with the hope they would be of high enough quality for my second hole.  The backs are great; the earrings themselves are dull and cheap looking. Buyer beware; I would never wear them out, nor consider them as giftable.  The company (Sabrina Silver) was a pleasure to do business with:  timely delivery, secure packaging.
