Whoops, I got this bra confused with another bra.  This one was comfy and the fit was pretty good, but the padding was still just not thick enough for my liking.  I do not like nipple show through and this padding was just shy of being thick enough for that.  Positive experience with returning it to the company, would consider purchasing from them again in perhaps a style that would be better suited for me.
