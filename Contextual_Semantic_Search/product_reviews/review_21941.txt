Too small.  Was very disappointed.  Great looking shoe.  Order in size 14 and Amazon sent them out very quickly.  Refunded me before UPS had the returns in hand so I could get the new ones on the way, and I couldn't be more pleased. Look great with jeans and Khakis, but the ladies will snicker if you wear them with sweats or slacks.  Too bad; they're very comfortable.  Wish I could wear'em with a suit.
