It is unusually loose in the bust area (actually to the size of the bust near the underarms). It will bunch under clothing and be uncomfortable for this reason. It will not fit like the model unless the sides along the chest area is taken in. I am going to see if my Mom can do this for me, so I can wear this slip. Otherwise the slip will not work. Maybe a triple or double D can fill this out (not sure as it is oddly bunched up to the outer edges of the breast).
