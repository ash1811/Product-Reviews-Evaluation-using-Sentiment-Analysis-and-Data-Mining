I know this is a official HP product and they tend to be overpriced, however this is a really pretty piece. I am amazed about the solid weight, it really feels substantial.  I figured it would weigh a fifth of what it does. It's just solid, strong and yet beautiful and feminine. It is also much longer than I expected. The box is wonderful and feels special as well. They really made an exceptional replica here. I am just blown away by it, Its so much more than expected. I know I am gushing on and on, but I really love this piece. I would pay double or even triple for it. You won't be disappointed.
