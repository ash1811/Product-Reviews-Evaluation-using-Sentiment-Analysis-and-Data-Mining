I bought these for my daughter in January 2010. She wears them all the time and they have held up very well through many wears and washings. They are very opaque - most of the time I would think she's wearing leggings, they are that dark. Saves me, as her mother some grief; if I think her skirt is too short, at least her rear is well covered!
