Was thinking about buying Uggs, but for the money, I thought I'd try to see if there was something comparable, made out of comparable materials. I found Bearpaw brand boots. Now, I've never had Uggs before, so I can't compare. But they fit very well, are comfortable and are very warm. I also like the split ides, for ease of tucking pants. I will post again with how they hold up.  But for this price, I can pick up a few pairs for the price of one pair of Uggs.  Worth the try, for sure.
