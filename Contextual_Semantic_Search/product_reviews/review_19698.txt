I purchased this shoe to wear for my first bikini competition and I am pleased with my purchase.  I normally wear a size 8 and a half so I ordered this shoe in a 9 since no half sizes are available and I'm happy that the shoe fit as I expected.  There is about 2 inches of room from my toe to the front of the shoe which is good because when I walk and my foot slides forward, my toes are still comfortably on the shoe with no toes hanging over the edge of the shoe.
