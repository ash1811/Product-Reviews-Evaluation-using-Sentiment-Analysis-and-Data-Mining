I ordered these when they had the 30% off deal. I got all three colors. They are small; they hug the ear lobe. I don't like large earrings,so these are just the right size for me. I can wear them casually when I want to dress up just a little. For other people who may have more than one pierced hole, these would be great to match with the ball studs. I have those in 5mm.
