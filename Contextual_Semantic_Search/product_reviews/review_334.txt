I fell in love with Under Armour's products four years ago, and that hasn't changed.They were still a niche brand then, on the edge of coming into their own as a major brand in the marketplace.These shirts and their whole line of ...Gear products are the reason why. They had a quality product before the image was built.I stayed away at first, not thinking that an undershirt could be worth the twenty-five clams. I tried some of the competitors first, but a friend of mine was such an advocate I had to try at least one. I'm glad I did. The HeatGear material is perfect. It is firm enough that it does it job in compression -- for me, that means keeping my jiggly bits in place when I work out -- but it is not too tight or thick.I have both the sleeveless and the sleeved version. I like the sleeveless version for working out, because it helps your range of motion with your arms. The sleeved version is nice as an undershirt, but the only problem in that context is that they place their logo on the chest with a high contrast so it shines through the outer shirt. UA has started to offer a sleeved "Tactical" version of the shirt, which I might buy one or two, but the color choices are limited.They do what they advertise; the material spreads the sweat out and it evaporates faster than cotton.  The hold you in place.  You are not as hot as some may be while working hard.  You are armoured.These are entirely worth the money, and I recommend that you buy a half-dozen or so as soon as you can.
