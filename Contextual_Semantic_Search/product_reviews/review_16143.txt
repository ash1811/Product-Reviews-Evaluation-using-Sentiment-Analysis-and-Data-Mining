This product is excellent.  We were quite concerned about travelling with our pricey car seat and even considered getting a cheap &#34;travel&#34; version.  Then we realized that we'd have yet another baby item that we barely use so decided to try the travel bag instead.This bag is really great.  It fit out car seat beautifully and covered all the corners with the cushioned sides.  The carrying straps are a great feature, allowing us to keep our hands free while pushing a stroller or holding our baby (or both!).  Definitely a better (and cheaper) investment than getting a travel car seat.
