I am a pretty tough grader on stuff like this and have nothing to lose or gain in any of my reviews. We have had a lot of snow and subsequent ice in our area over the last month. My street and drive are ice covered at least 1-2 inches thick and then it melts on top of the ice and it is impossible to stand up. I purchased the Yaktrax and let me tell you, they are worth every penny. I did not get the Pro model because I didn't know if I would like them. When I first got them I tied to go for a walk down the driveway with my regular New Balance running shoes (no Yaktrax) and could barely stand up... Kept sliding without even walking. Went back in the house and put the Yaktrax over my running shoes and went back outside. I was able to walk across the ice like it wasn't even there. I felt like I probably could run on the ice if I wanted, but didn't want to push it. I don't know how the Yaktrax will be in deep snow, but then you probably wouldn't need them there anyway. But on ice, they are super! I read some previous reviews that said they had problems with breakage.  I make sure that the rubber bands are pulled high up onto the shoe and try to have the rubber bands on the bottom go between any grooves that I have on the bottom of the shoe.  This is a long winded review to a low cost item but I wanted to make sure it gets the review that it deserves.
