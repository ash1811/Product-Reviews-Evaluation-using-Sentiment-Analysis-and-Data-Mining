I love these shoes... I have a hard to fit foot; wide, high instep.  I seldom find a pair of shoes that fit me comfortably, often having to buy a shoe a size too big to get them wide enough - I wear a EEE to EEE size 7. These shoes are wonderful, well made, good material, wonderful flat no-heel sandal that is comfortable to walk in - if I had any thing I would want different it would be that they have an even rounded toe instead of the larger big toe area - my big toe is actually shorter than my other toes... but that would not keep me from buyer more of these sandals in different colors - finally a shoe I can wear... thank you.
