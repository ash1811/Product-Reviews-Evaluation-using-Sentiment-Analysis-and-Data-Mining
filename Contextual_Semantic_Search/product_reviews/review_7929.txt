They work OK for a while, but it won't take too long before they break. They very cheaply made, which is to be expected for the price. The band is plastic, and the point where they connect to each ear muff is plastic and not very sturdy. After some use by the kids opening them up and putting them on, the plastic connection that snaps into place loosens up, and will continually come apart. Since they're adjustable enough to get more than one season out of them for the kids, we'll look for a better quality pair next time.
