I used to own this Seiko Black Monster. It really was a looker of a watch. Good craftsmanship, durable case and bracelet, and very bright luminous markers. It had good waterproofing too. But when it started to gain at least a minute a day, and stopped on me for a couple of hours, like another owner's experience, I just had to avail of Amazon's excellent return policy. (Thank you so much Amazon.com, I will always remain your loyal customer).
