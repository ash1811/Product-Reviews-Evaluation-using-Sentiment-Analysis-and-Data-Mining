This bra was great in the beginning over a short time the material started stretching out and I find myself having to keep adjusting the straps to pull my boobs back up in place. I purchased three but I wish I could return them. Plus side they are made from a nice soft fabric , shoulder straps are comfortable and they wash well , they are not the worst bras I have ever had. But if I know that I would have to keep adjusting the straps all day, they would not have been my first choice.
