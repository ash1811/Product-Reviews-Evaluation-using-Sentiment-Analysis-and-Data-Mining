Yes I remember when all jeans were like this. New meant stiff as a board. Still length is great and just slightly snug in the waist which was no suprise. One wash and a ride in the dryer with some tennis shoes was all it took to break them down a little. Would be a great work jean, tough and well made. Good buy for the money spent!
