I'm a U.S. Master's competitive swimmer, and I've been swimming most of my life. Over the years, I've tried racing briefs like this from just about every major manufacturer out there - Speedo, Tyr, Nike, Adidas, Arena, Dolfin, Hind, Victor, and Finals just to mention some.This one is a timeless classic. It's comfortable and reasonably durable, and does it's job well. It comes in a great selection of colors. The only thing I don't like about it is that over the years, Speedo keeps making the sides wider and wider. It's got a lot of coverage now - a cut Jerry Falwell would love. If you like lots of coverage, that's great, but I find that as a result, these start to bag and sag on me as they loosen up, as lycra suits tend to do with use, and I swim 7 days a week... I've grown to prefer Tyr suits for their briefer, more comfortable and more flattering fit - that's just personal preference, though. Both are good brands.Also, if you swim a lot, take a look at this same suit in Speedo's polyester-blend fabric "Endurance" line, if you want one that really holds up well over the long run.
