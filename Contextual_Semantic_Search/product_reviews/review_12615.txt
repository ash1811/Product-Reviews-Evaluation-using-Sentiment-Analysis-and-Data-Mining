Bought these for my son who is 6'6&#34; and medium to large build.  These 2X-Large sweats FIT PERFECTLY for his height/size.  We were not sure as it is not always easy to buy clothes &#34;sight unseen&#34;.Quality:  It is Adidas so we expected good quality and it was GOOD quality.Fit:  The sweat pants fit perfectly with just enough room for comfort in every day wear and even running (sharing this in case someone wonders what it is like when one wears it - as most comments is just about WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE;-)As far as the service for both Amazon and the Vendor - both were PRETTY AWESOME - my order arrived &#34;before&#34; Christmas 2012 which was a challenge considering a huge or several huge Winter Weather systems which cancelled many flights in the Midwest and Northeast affecting shipments for the Holidays.  But this really speaks to Amazon and the infrastructure they've built - PRETTY EFFICIENT, actually, the MOST EFFICIENT of any Online Retailer.  Thank you so much.
