As so many others have said, order larger.  I wear about an 11 to 11.5, and got the 12, and while they're just perfect once my feet are inside them, they're tough for the openings - it's a little difficult getting the foot IN them initially.But once in, they do feel nice.  I have another pair that I've had for a few years, and the inside has worn and all the fleecey stuff is gone under the ball of my foot.  I wanted to find something close to them, and these were about the best I could locate here on Amazon that fit the price point and the style.They're comfortable and warm, and I forgot they were even on while sitting on the recliner.  Crawling around the floor setting up the new game console I got today, I had no problems with them flexing as I knelt or sat or squatted.So go at least two sizes above what you'd normally get and you should have a little more leeway than I do with the on/off.
