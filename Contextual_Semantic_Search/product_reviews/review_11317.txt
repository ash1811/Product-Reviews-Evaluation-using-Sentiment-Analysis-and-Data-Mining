I can pack all the textbooks I want in here with my lunch, drink, and all the extra stuff that goes with school.  The neon pink also renders me highly visible when I'm walking around, which I need since there are so many terrible drivers about.  I expect this backpack to last me forever, so I guess I'll check in in a few years.
