First off, they are really cheap pants.They feel very comfortable.Lee's sizing is consistent because they make all their clothes in Mexico unlike Levis that makes the same model pants in various countries depending ont he size you order.My only grip is they seem to lose their dark black color fast. Also, dust and dirt shows up quickly and seems to fade the color.
