I originally purchased these in HI back in 2007. They broke a few years later and I immediately got another pair. Those where lost in a rental car a few years later, and I immediately purchased another pair. My advice is to try them on in a store and purchase here on Amazon. I think I like them so much because they wrap around my face and offer superb protection.Hands down, the best, sunglasses I own. I think my next pair will be the matte version, however, I cant seem to find those polarized.
