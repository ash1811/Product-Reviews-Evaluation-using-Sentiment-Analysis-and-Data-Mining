I bought this purse/bag for a trip to Disney World.  I am using it as an every day purse now to get used to it prior to our trip.  It holds a lot!  I like it a lot.  There is only one issue I have with it.  The strap does not stay 100% tight when I adjust it shorter.  But overall, I think it was a good purchase.
