I had trouble finding sleeveless body suits in stores.  These are nice. The cotton is soft and stretchy and a perfect medium weight (neither too thin nor too thick) and they don't shrink much in the wash. Great for layering under sleeveless outfits.  The fit is also good - the 3 month size is like a 0-3 in most brands, 6 month size is 3-6.  Our baby is 12 pounds and the 3 month size fits perfect. The 6 month size is a little big for her right now.
