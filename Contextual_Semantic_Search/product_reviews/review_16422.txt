As opposed to other dance sneakers, these actually fit true to size (for me. I have a narrow foot. I have used a variety of dance sneakers (for Zumba and other dance classes), and these are by far my favorite - lightweight, good pivot surface (your knees will thank you!), good fit, and relatively good support. I do use these in combination with Spenco for her Total Support II insoles to get a bit more lateral stability and prevent injuries since the classes I attend tend to be high energy and involve a lot of jumping. My only complaint about these shoes is that they do not last very long - seem connecting the shoe to the outer sole ripped after only a few short months' use, but are still wearable. Pretty good price too, I just do wish the quality was a little better.
