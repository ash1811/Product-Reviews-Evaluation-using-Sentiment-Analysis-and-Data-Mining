This is my 4th Invicta automatic diver, I also have a 8926OB, 8928C, and 1002.This one came in flawless, no defects, smooth working screw-down crown, and accurate within 3 seconds a day, which is excellent for any automatic.Negatives?  Turning the bezel felt a little bit cheaper than normal, but not really an issue.
