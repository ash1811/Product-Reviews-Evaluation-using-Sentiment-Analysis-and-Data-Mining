Nice watch for my mom. Like the size of the numbers and the indiglo on the face. Good for her older eyes. However, if you have small wrists, the watch will be way too loose. She will have to have sized, if possible or I will have to get a new band. Kinda defeats the purpose of keeping the cost down.
