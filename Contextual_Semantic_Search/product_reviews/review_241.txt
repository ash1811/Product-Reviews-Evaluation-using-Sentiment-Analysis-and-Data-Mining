Product came on time, was exactly as described, were the correct size and the correct color. I had no problems with this order. When I was going through the reviews, I noticed quite a few complaints, and was worried. I needed new sneakers and figured 40 bucks was not all that bad for the shoes. I used to wear Chucks until they fell apart, and will probably do the same with these.
