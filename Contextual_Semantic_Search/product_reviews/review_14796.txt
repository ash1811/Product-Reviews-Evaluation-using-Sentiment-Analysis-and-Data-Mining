I have a pair of these that I got at an outlet, in a pink/purple floral pattern.  I wanted more because they are so comfy for warm weather, but the stores only have leopard print etc. and I am SOOO not interested in animal prints.  So I went on Amazon and found a seller with a whole lot of choices...mostly black, white, and animal prints...but there they were in pretty pink...so I bought them.  The only thing I could mention for other buyers is that I thought they looked better when I swapped the left and right shoes.  They seemed a teeny bit misshapen but swapping left for right pretty much took care of the problem.
