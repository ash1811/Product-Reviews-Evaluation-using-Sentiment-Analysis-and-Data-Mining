Not exactly what I had in mind, but it actually works out well. I thought this was one of those little bags you see on the backs of the little teeny boppers at the pool.  I got this for my gf for her swim stuff, but it turns out this is a full size backback.  Worked out well, because now she has fins and snorkel and such, but if you're looking for one of those little back bags, this is not it.
