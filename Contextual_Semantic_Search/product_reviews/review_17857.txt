Watch is almost too light.  The digital window is only for those who can see well.  I got tires of the buttons for setting the time and not a stem.  If you use a cell phone to text and not to talk this watch may be fine for you.  For the older user it may become a bother to use and reset. Others will speak of the plastic screen that scratches easily, but that won't be a problem for most.  I jest got tired of keeping up with the manuels and the buttons to set time.
