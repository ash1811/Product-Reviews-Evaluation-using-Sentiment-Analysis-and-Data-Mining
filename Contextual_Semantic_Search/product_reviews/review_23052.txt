I enjoyed wearing my Birkenstock Milano sandals. I wore my heel of the sandals down in just a few months; so I stopped wearing them thinking of getting them repaired; but I did not. I found these sandals comfortable as they form fit to one's feet. I liked the cork and latex foot bed so much that I have bought a pair of Mephisto Shark sandals instead of another pair of Milano. The Milano are about a 1/3 of the cost of the Shark; so the Milano may be a good deal.
