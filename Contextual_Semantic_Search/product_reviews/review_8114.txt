This ring was absolutely beautiful when I received it, which was very exciting because it was a great price. I was disappointed that I had made a mistake on the size I ordered, so decided to request a return. Unfortunately, they do not offer exchanges and I had to pay the shipping for return, so I am not sure I will order another.
