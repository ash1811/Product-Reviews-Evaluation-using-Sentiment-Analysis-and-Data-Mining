I wear these shoes almost every day of the year. They are comfortable and durable. I wear them to work in and for walks each morning of up to 4 miles. The shoes have never hurt my feet with the exception of when the insoles break down, which I then replace. Each pair has lasted me 2-3 years. I'm on my fourth pair now. I buy the black model because they don't show dirt and are easy to polish with a liquid Kiwi polish which keeps them looking nice. Mine fit true to size in length but are maybe just a tad bit wide.
