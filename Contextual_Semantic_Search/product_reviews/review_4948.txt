I got these for my husband to try out.  He absolutely loves them and loves the feel of them.  When I go to do the laundry I always know that these brief will be in the washing to do as it is the only ones he picks out to wear.  Sometimes he even washes uniforms during the week and throws the dirty ones in so that he will not have to wear any other kind.
