I wish I would have known that the band for this watch has a very reddish tinge to it.  It's almost maroon, not brown.  I wanted more of a chocolate brown, since I never wear maroon.  I have small wrists, so it fits me great with a couple holes to spare.  I bought this to replace my other Timex watch that is too big even on the smallest hole.  My old watch also didn't have the QuickDate feature, which this one does.  You don't know how big a difference it makes until you don't wear it for awhile and suddenly realize it's a week or 2 off!  It takes a LONG time to manually spin through 24 hours to get the date to change by 1.  It's SO worth it to get the QuickDate feature!  Also I love the gold color trim and the mother of pearl watch face.  It looks very professional and classy without having to wear a really flashy fancy watch.  I may end up keeping it and just having my local watch shop at the mall replace the band for a few bucks.
