The watch is exactly what I had in mind.  Wanted a black band and a black face and not much weight.  Has kept correct time so far which, amazingly, is becoming a rarity with even expensive watches.  It's perfect with long sleeve shirts that can slide right over it since the case is so slim.  The mesh band means it weighs very little.  Will be comfortable in hot weather.  The ONLY issue that made this a 4 star is getting it off can be a real chore.  The first catch unhinges easily, but the second one can be a bit of a challenge. There is probably more of a trick to it than I have figured.
