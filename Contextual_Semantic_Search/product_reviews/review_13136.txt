I love this bra because it is provides the lift that I need and a flattering seamless silhouette. It smooths both the sides and back. It is perfectly comfortable for everyday wear. For those who want to try a wireless that provides as much support as a wired bra (I am only qualifying this for 36D and smaller), this may be your best bet.
