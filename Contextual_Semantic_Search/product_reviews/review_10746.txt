I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend more than $10 on flippy-floppies, but now that I've had these all summer I'd say these are worth it. I chose these since my buddy has a pair that have held up for about 3 years, which is a good sign to me. The fit and finish is really good. The bottle opener in the sole is a total gimmick, but I guess can be cool sometimes. I wouldn't buy them for that feature though as fit and durability are more important to me, and these do really well in those departments.
