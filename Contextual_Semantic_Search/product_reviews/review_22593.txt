I've owned this watch for over six months, now and I am very pleased with it.  Like most citizen watches, it keeps impeccable time.  The size of the dial is just right--not too big, not too small.  I like the canvas band.  It looks great and has held up quite well.  The Luminous hands and numbers show up well in the dark.  If you are looking for a good traditional military-style watch, you can't go wrong with this one.
