My 4 year old grandson was so happy to open his package and find the costume.  He loves to dess up as one of the Super Heroes.  I make a costume box for him at Christmas last year and I just keep adding to it.  When his friends come over they all pick a costume.  Most of the costumes have come from Amazon and have lasted very well through lots of little boys putting them on and taking them off.
