OMG!! These are so VERY comfortable, cozy, warm & look great!! I purchased these on Amazon when they went on sale (Got a great bargain!)! But they are certainly worth every penny at the regular price! I am loving these sooooo much especially since I broke my ankle in Nov & I am still trying to recover from that. Thank you Amazon.com for your great selection of quality items & your free shipping too!!
