My feet take a beating daily in my work.  I need to cushion them from the torture of the day.  These socks are just the ticket to get me through the day.  What you can't see in this advertisement is that the bottom (dark portion) is really extra cushy and maintains that feeling through washings.  Good product.  Would buy again.
