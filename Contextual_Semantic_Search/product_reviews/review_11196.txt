I needed a pair of summer shoes that were comfortable for walking AND could go in the water (I've never had "water" shoes and figured that now that we were going to be living closer to the ocean, I wanted to be prepared). I have about 387 pairs of Crocs in different variations (okay, maybe eight), but they aren't THAT comfortable for serious walking (and for me, serious walking means running errands around town for three hours or going to the zoo for a half day) and not all of them are for summer.So I asked my friends for recommendations and a handful of them suggested this exact pair, raving about them. I trusted them, but $80? Really? For a pair of sandals? Lordy. So I kept wearing my Crocs and my feet kept hurting. And then we moved. And I had a week straight of unloading and unpacking at our new house, and my feet and ankles were super sore and super tired from standing on my feet all day every day.So I broke down, bit the bullet, and bought these--bitching and moaning the whole time I was paying $80 for a PAIR OF SANDALS.But wow are they are comfy. And I worked most of the day in them (still unpacking!) and didn't think once about my feet! Two days a row! Then three! And I didn't have to worry about them slipping off! I haven't had them in the water yet, but at this point I don't care because they're just comfy.The only thing that was slightly worrisome was that I have thick ankles and the first time I attempted to put them on, it was a bit difficult--there was lots of tugging and pulling and stretching. I was honestly thinking that I might have to return them, because I was NOT going to like/want to expend that much effort in putting on shoes. But the next time was easier and now it just takes a little oomph but nothing extraordinary so I'm fine with it.So as someone who hates the idea of expensive sandals, I highly recommend these.
