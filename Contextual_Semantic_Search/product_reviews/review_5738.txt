Pros: lots of pockets and has clasps to keep some of them closed.ComfortableCons: some of the seams where not completely well sewn and had a lot of loose threads but there seems to have some extra stitching in those areas.Overall cool pantsWell I followed a review and ordered a size larger and when they arrived they were almost to big. I wear a 32 and ordered the large and they fit a little loose with the tabs on the side pulled to the smallest setting.
