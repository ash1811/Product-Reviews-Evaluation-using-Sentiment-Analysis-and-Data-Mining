I love the boots. I made sure to try them on at a nearby Clarks outlet and was very surprised to find that I needed to wear an 8.5 sized boot. My normal size in Asics sneakers is 9.5 so I hope that is a useful reference for some. I also got these boots when they dropped down in price to about 67 dollars, which I felt was a steal for how nice they look. Taupe suede looks great with most of my outfits!
