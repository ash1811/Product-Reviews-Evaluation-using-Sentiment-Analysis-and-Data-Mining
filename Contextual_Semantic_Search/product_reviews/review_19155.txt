These earrings are beautiful...lots of sparkle and different colors, so they go with any outfit...casual or dressy.  The leverbacks are very comfortable to wear and the earrings are light as feathers, and the perfect size. The way the crystals catch the light is what I like best.  When I first opened the box, I gasped  with delight because they are so much more gorgeous in person.  I am thrilled with this purchase!!
