The shoes fit great and arrived earlier than expected.  They look great.  I regularly wear a size 12 but find that I need 11.5 when I wear Converse.  The fit is always nice and very comfortable.My complaint is that I ordered BLACK Converse and received grayish colored Converse.  I have another pair of laces Converse and compared the colors and these looked as though they were bleached.  The color was so far off that I had to return them.I love Converse but the ones I received were not what was described.  No fault of Converse.  It was a poor seller that I chose.
