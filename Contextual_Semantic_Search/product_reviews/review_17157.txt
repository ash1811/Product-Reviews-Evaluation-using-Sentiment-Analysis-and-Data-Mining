I've read the reviews here and saw many people say that the feeling is like &#34;Walking on a cloud&#34;. Well, once you put your foot in one of these, you're not going to be able to think of any other way to describe the feeling it gives you. Just absolutely great. They feel great, they even look comfortable, they're perfect. I love them very much.They might be a bit pricier than some other brands, but I've tried others, and you just can't beat &#34;Walking on a cloud&#34;. This is the best.
