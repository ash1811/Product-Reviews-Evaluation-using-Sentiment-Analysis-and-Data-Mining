These jeans were great. I bought them in Muse which is a real deep blue with a soft hand and just a bit of stretch. The only complaint I had was the belt loops. They are huge! I don't remember how big now because after wearing them once I took them to my tailor and for $4.00 they shortened them for a normal size belt. Sadly I only wore these 3 times. I took them to my local cleaners and told them specifically to dry clean them. Instead they washed them. Now they are skin tight. So be aware (as with most blue jeans) they will shrink in the wash. Hopefully they will pay me for a replacement pair and my alterations so I can order a new pair because I planned to wear these with sport coats all winter.
