This is my first adventure with WIGWAM socks, and if this were the dead of January I'd be singing their praises.  As the sock is much heavier than what I've been used to over all these years I can tell I'll have more than sufficient insulation to keep my feet comfy when it gets bitter cold outside.  Unfortunately, at this time of year, when it's stifling hot, by the end of the day my feet are broiling inside my dress shoes.Other advantages I can readily ascertain with these socks are their durability, and, when my shoes are off, how remarkably comfortable they are.  This WIGWAM is going to last and last and last, which is a far cry from what I've put up with before.  Plus it looks terrific.  When it's hot outside I'm going to have to switch to a lighter, thinner sock, but when the cold stuff hits, I'm looking forward to the comfort and elegance of WIGWAM MEN'S AT WORK SOCKS. My tootsies deserve them!--D. Mikels, Esq.
