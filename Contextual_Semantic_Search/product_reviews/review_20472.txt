I ordered these sweat pants for my 12-year old daughter to wear for PE class on cool days. They are a very generic (unisex) fit and absolutely unflattering. I realize sweat pants are not generally a fashion statement, but these sagged at the backside unless the waistband was pulled up to her chest. These went straight back to Amazon & we will be ordering a few more pairs of the Soffe Football capris. Much cuter & better fit for girls!
