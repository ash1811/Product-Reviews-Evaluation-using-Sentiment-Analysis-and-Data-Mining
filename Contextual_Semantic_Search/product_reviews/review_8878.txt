The item itself is a poor quality item. The zipper is plastic, not a sturdy metal one. The material isnt good quality cotton. Its a thin sheer cotton, Not made to last. IMPORTANT - This item comes in a short and a long. I do not know why no one has mentioned this before. If you look at the sizes when you order, it does not say short or long. I would have needed and wanted a long. They sent me a short. Its horrible. This is the problem im having with the seller. They wont respond to my emails about this, I am fed up at this point. All in all, the items look pretty but are very poor quality, I understand why people stated their zippers broke, and the material is not worth what they are charging either..
