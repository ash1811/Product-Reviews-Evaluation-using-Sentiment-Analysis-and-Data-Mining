my girlfriend ordered this watch as a xmas gift in 2010.  and i used it as my daily beater till the summer months came and i retired it till it would be cooler again.  so after aprox 6 months of daily wear the watch has held up well.  while i did buy this on overstock then, i can't say for delivery time.  the crystal is top notch and has a few minor dings in it but its only noticable in direct light and doesn't effect viewing at all.  the bracelet also has some scratches in it as well, but they are minor and purely cosmetic.  while i don't dive i am rough on my things and this has taken abuse well.  from the shower, to pool, to hot tub, i wear it and forget it.  i think i'm within 15 sec a day, but accuracy isn't key for me, thats what i have a cell phone for.while i do enjoy not needing a battery, if you don't wear it for 2 days it stops.  if that minor quirk doesn't bother you its a great watch, or invest in a automatic winder.
