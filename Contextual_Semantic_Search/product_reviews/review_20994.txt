First off, I thought it was a pretty bra and fits nicely. It's lace so I didn't think it'd feel like silk but the fabric is a bit rough (for a bra) and I was concerned that it might be too abrasive against the girls.  So far it's fine but I'm not out jogging in it. I wear it for full days and no issues.  I'm a fan of the Olga line overall but this isn't my favorite just because of the fabric that's against the breast.  They could have lined it with a smoother fabric.  Otherwise, it's a nice bra that will last about a year (fairly average for a bra in this price range).
