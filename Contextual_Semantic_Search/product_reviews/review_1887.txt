I like wearing these earrings - they are simple and classic in design and since I require gold posts (get knots in my ears with other types of metal posts), the challenge is being able to afford multiple pairs and colors.  For $33, I am quite satisfied with these even though the stones are not as bright and darkly colored as the picture indicates (hence four stars for this truth in advertising issue).  The posts are sturdy and backs fit securely.  Peridote stones are translucent and free of visible inclusions.  The color goes nicely with my spring wardrobe.  Appropriate for all ages.  I'd highly recommend them.
