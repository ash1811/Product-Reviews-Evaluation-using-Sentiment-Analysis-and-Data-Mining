This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday.  Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well.  I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything.  My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking, the large is a little roomier.  Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too.
