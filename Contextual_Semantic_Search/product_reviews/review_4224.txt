I'm 49 and my body has recently changed so I've tried a few bras lately, and this one is the best. It lifts, covers my underarm-boob (as defined in Oprah mag), doesn't gap at all on my slightly smaller side, shows no seams, comes in skin-tone, is comfortable...I think that's my entire checklist. My second favorite was a Betsy Johnson demi-bra that was adorable but the seams show under t-shirts. I bought a few Calvin Kleins (before I discovered this Natori) that don't address "underarm boob." Nothing else in my size (32D) made the cut. Hope this helps someone.
