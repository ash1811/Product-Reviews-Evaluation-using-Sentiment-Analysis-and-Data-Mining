I've had this winder for a few weeks now and so far I am pleased with it's operation.  It is very quiet, and the four (4) timing adjustments will keep most automatics running properly.  Make no mistake, it is all plastic, and if you get a couple of years out of it, count yourself lucky.  The watch holding system is OK, but again, it is plastic and does not scream "quality".  It takes up very little desk space, and seems to work properly.Would I keep my high end automatics in it?  So far, no.  I'm testing it on a few SEIKO's, etc. and keeping track of the winder performance.  One plus besides the very quiet operation is the very low RPM of the winder.  Mine runs at 6 RPM, which is nice and gentle.For the price I paid, this is a good deal.  It is not an ORBITA winder by any stretch, but again, in this price range, you could do a lot worse.
