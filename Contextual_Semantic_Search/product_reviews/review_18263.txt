These slippers arrived as expected. They were the correct size, fit comfortably & were rather good looking for slippers. They are holding up well so far. I am a large person, over 6 ft tall & weigh well over 250 lbs & find the slippers comfortable. They seem to be well made & as I stated above they are pleasant to look at. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of slippers to wear around the house.
