They are pants and they are made my Hanes, but how thermal they are is debatable. For Mrs. Spudman and me the thermal pants are laughable in their lightness and baggy fit. The pants are so thin and light that they are not much heavier than a pair of pantyhose , something I shall not wear. I normally wear an extra large in most things, but these pants are so loose around the waste that only the sweatpants worn over them keep them up.I do like that there is an opening in the front for answering nature's call.  A disappointing pair of thermal pants, but better than nothing at all.
