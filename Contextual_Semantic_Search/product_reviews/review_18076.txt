I have a terrible time finding bras to fit. Even most 34AA bras gap in the cup on me. I'm 5'11" and have wideset breasts with a wide root, so finding a bra that is spaced out enough and has a wire that fits around the entire root of my breasts is not an easy task, especially since my breasts don't have much volume. I usually just buy bras and then completely alter them to fit better.I ordered the Timpa Duet Lace Underwire Demi Bra in beige in a 34A. My underbust is 28.5 inches and the band on the last clasp feels nice and snug. It doesn't feel tight or uncomfortable, just like it is supporting me. The straps are actually long enough too, I don't even have them lengthened all the way. The underwire might be a tiny bit too narrow for me, but I am bending it some which has widened it.My breast tissue actually fills out the cups! In fact, I could have gone up to a 34B. I really didn't feel like paying to send the bra back in the mail though. I also think the cups may give a little over time. I plan on ordering more of these bras in the future though, and when I do I will get the 34B.
