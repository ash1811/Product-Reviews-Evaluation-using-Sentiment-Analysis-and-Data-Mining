I bought these last year and tried them on - too small, but I thought perhaps they'd stretch out a bit.  WRONG!  I've been wearing them now - still almost new - for a month now w/ no luck on any stretching.  My toes are smushed all the way to the end and they hurt!  I even have a narrow foot, for what it's worth - not that the width would affect much.  Still - bummer..
