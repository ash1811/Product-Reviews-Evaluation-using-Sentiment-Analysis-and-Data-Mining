I wear slippers around the house whenever I am home so that I do not get my socks dirty. I don't like slippers without backs, as that means I have to pinch them with my toes to keep them on. These have great, textures bottoms, fleece insides, and keep my feet secure. My mom just tried them on and liked them so I ordered her a pair in &#34;chinchilla.&#34;
