I bought this chain to go with a St. Christopher medallion I was given.  The 24" length is perfect, neither too long or short.  The only problem I have with this product is that after six to seven months the links break.  Now I also keep it on 24/7 through showers and swimming.  It stands up very well to chlorine and soap ;  So I tend to think it has to be pretty durabl with what I put it through.
