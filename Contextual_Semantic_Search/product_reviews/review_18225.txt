I used to buy my husband Acorn brand slippers (the Romeo style). It wasn't a clog, but it usually turned into a clog by accident because my husband would slide his feet in and smash down the heel of the slipper. I went looking instead for a true clog, and was pleasantly surprised to find the Tamarac Scuffy slipper at a much better price, and the quality is every bit as good. He's now on his second pair. He wore the first until he finally wore off all the tread. He wears these for several hours daily, as he hates to go barefoot or walk around the house in socks. This will be the slipper I order for him from now own.
