I actually bought these for a two pairs of US size 9.5 shoes. They fit perfectly in one, and a little bit on the tight side on the other. If you are considering buying these for a US size 9.5 shoe, I would recommend them. I would not recommend them for a US size 9.0 shoe as they fit one of my shoes very snugly.
