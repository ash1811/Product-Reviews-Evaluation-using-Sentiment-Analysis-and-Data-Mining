I really don't like jackets (or winter, for that matter) so wearing a heavy one really never suits me well.  I'd rather throw on a sweater and a light jacket.The Dickie's jacket is very light but does a great job of blocking out wind and rain without overheating you.  It also has drawstrings on the bottom which are very effective at blocking wind. The material is better than most.  I can tell you for certain that one nylon jacket may be paper thin compared to another.  The nylon used here (or the way they sewed it) is much stronger and more durable.  The inside pocket is just the icing on the cake.  A convenient pocket for my cell phone that won't get wet?  Sign me up!Size-wise, it doesn't fit too snug, which is a great thing.  It's not too big, but not so exact that you cannot move around in it.  You can still enjoy full movement but you don't feel like you are swimming in it.Don't let the cost of this jacket fool you.  It's worth far more.
