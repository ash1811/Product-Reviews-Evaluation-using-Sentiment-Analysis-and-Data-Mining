These are one of my favorite shoes ever made!!! I have 4 pairs of Samba's but I didn't have the actual indoor soccer classic Samba's. They are a great shoe for work or just as an everyday sneaker and they last forever!!! The classics do have a difference then the other Samba's the tongue of the shoe is extra long like on a soccer cleat, it doesn't bother me I like the look but some people may think its a little weird. They are a little stiff until you break them in, but after that they are super comfortable!!!
