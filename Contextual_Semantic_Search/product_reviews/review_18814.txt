Pros:* Style - I got the Birch/Indian Ink/Latte and they look great* Arch support - the soles have a little bump at the arch which are a nice touchCons:* Soles - very thin, almost like walking barefoot* Price/value - I got these in the mid $50s which is a nice discount from retail but still a bit expensive for how much &#34;shoe&#34; you get. You are definitely paying for the style.Other:* Overall construction - not a lot of padding, the uppers and tongue are soft, but also very thin and light just like the sole. I don't know how comfortable they would be for prolonged activity.* Sizing - generally fine but the left shoe felt slightly smaller than the right which is annoying
