My 4 yr old son needed black shoes for a play he was in. I didn't want to buy dress shoes as he would not get any additional wear out of them. I opted for these black Converse. They were adorable, they fit him well - he is about a size 11 little kids but I ordered the 12 and they are fine with a bit of growing room.  He calls them his &#34;Chucks&#34; and thinks he's cool when he wears them...well, he is pretty cool - he has worn them several times since the play so overall, it was a good purchase.
