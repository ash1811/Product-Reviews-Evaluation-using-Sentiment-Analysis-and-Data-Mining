When it has came down to Citizen after all these years, they still definitely know how to really make excellent watches for everyone. But there are those that really don't want too many gimmicks in their watches. Fortunately, they can make that with this Eco-Drive Black Leather Watch. It doesn't have all the gimmicks that other watches have, keeping it simple with each tick of the watch, from its beautiful leather strap, to telling time with its built-in eco-drive technology by never running out of energy by natural and even your house lights in the living room. It really never stops ticking. It really is worth its money for anyone who wants a high-quality watch, without the strain from your wallet. I absolutely recommend Citizen as one of the best brand watches for all your everyday needs. This watch designed with a leather strap, does it all, and I absolutely recommend this for the man in everyday quality.Price: BConvience: B+Quality: B 1/2+Overall: B 1/2+
