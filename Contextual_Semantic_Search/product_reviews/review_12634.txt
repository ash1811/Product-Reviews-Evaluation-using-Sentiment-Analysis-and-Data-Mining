Every product I have ever bought by UA has always been of great quality.  I use this shirt to hit the gym and work on my massive guns.  I would get the sleeveless version but then none of the women in the gym would get their workouts in.Very light shirt, very comfortable, keeps you cool and dry.  These UA shirts and others like it that wick moist away from you and great to wear while working out, I dont get that sweat sticking to you feeling like you get with a cotton t-shirt.
