This is the best staples bra I've ever had.  It doesn't add bulk or push anything in a wrong direction.  In fact it doesn't push, it hugs the back and rib cage and provides perfect coverage without pinching or squeezing anything.  I didn't think it was possible.  I had it on all day and didn't pull it up once.  And it's beautiful, so if it shows a little in the lower cut top, it matches the skin tone and lace looks pretty, not tacky.  I just ordered another one in black.
