I have to agree with an earlier review that the waistband could have been better constructed, but it's exactly as the photo portrays it to be without any unpleasant surprises.I recently bought a few very light and thin sun dresses that I needed a little camouflage control on the bottom half and these are the perfect length for me (5' 2"), the perfect width because of the double slits for ease of sitting, and no lace that no one is going to see anyway.I'll try to post a Vanity Fair half-slip size chart to help others like me that were clueless about the sizing that isn't provided for half-slips. I generally wear a 14 and I'm 5' 2", I ordered the X Large which worked out fine for my apple shape.For whatever reason, the choice to upload a photo is disabled for this page item, so I'll try to list the Vanity Fair Half-Slip Sizing here (In Inches):Vanity Fair Sizing/  Bust/  Waist/  HipSmall...  32/  36-37/  26-27/  35-37Medium...  34/  37-38/  28-29/  38-41Large...  36/  39-40/  30-31/  41-44X Large...  38/  41-42/  32-33/  48-50XX Large...  40/  43-44/  34-35/  50-51XXX Large...  42/  45-46/  36-37/  51+
