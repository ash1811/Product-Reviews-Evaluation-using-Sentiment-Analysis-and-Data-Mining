These are good socks and Amazon has a stellar price on this three-pack of male hosiery. Wool socks seem to be more comfortable than I thought and are not as sweaty as I originally thought.

Despite its advantages, OTC wool socks are somewhat hard to find among men's clothing stores if you choose to go that route.
