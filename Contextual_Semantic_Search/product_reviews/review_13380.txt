I used to have the new age aviators that my ex gave me, but i always loved the original ones, so I sold those and bought these.  I LOVE the silver and mirror lens together...it's different than the normal gold and green lens.  They are light and comfortable and I feel badass wearing them.  I may never take them off.  The shipping took forever but it was worth it.
