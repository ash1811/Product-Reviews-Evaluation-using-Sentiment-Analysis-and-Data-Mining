I have worn keds slip-ons like this for years and never had this problem before.I don't know the technical names, but the height between the insole and the upper is so short I can't even get my foot in the thing! If you look at the picture where the "tongue" part is raised, this pair is flat. I even tried putting powder in the shoe to force slip it on and I can't get my foot in at all.Very disappointed and I feel like this may be a "second" or "irregular", not an actual Keds for retail, which would explain the lower cost as well.Very disappointed.
