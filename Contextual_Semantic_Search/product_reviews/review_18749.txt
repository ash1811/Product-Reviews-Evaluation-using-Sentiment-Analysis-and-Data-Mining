This is a really nice brassiere. But it had to be returned because the cups were too pointy and my breasts aren't. So the thing puckered. It doesn't take much error in stitching to produce this problem.How do I know there was a sewing mistake? Well, first of all, I sew. I've been making and altering my own clothes since girlhood, and that was a while ago. But even better evidence is that this was the second bra I ordered in exactly the same model and size (36D). The first one fits perfectly and this one simply did not. The first one, by the way, is a perfectly lovely soft purplish blue called blue ice. LOVE that one and plan to order yet another color despite hating to make returns. But Amazon's policy on these that they sell directly is excellent and takes the curse out of mail order. Yea!By the way, the description here says this is a "minimizing" bra. But I'd say it is not. It puts my bosom right out there where I used to be shy to have it. The design of the garment is really full - how to describe that? - there is a lot of bra so that it really encloses and holds the breasts, as opposed to ones that are skimpy.
