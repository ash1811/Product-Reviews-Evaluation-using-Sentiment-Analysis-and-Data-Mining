I was in the market for a slim, attractive, sophisticated and unique watch, and when I first saw the Skagen line I loved it.  However, the model I wanted was not availabe when I tried to find one.  Then I found a great choice - Now, I have nearly this same exact watch but from Skagen's secondary line - Grennen Denmark - in Steel rather than Titanium.  And I got it on sale for $30 one year ago.I will eventually find a Skagen watch similar to my first interest but I will stand by these watches as being very good quality and very comfortable, nearly un-noticeable on my wrist.  So if you like these look for Grennen to see what you might find there.  Save some $$.
