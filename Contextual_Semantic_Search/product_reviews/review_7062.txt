I've read the other reviews about these bad boys now being made in Mexico but they seem to be holding up okay for now.  I campare them to the irregular NIKE socks I've bought at TJ MAXX or similar.  These slide on nicely and are super comfortable.  I am going to buy more and also the short ones as well.  No problems here.
