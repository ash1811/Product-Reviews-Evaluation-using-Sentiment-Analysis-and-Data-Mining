As a retired pilot I have been a faithful wearer Ray-Ban sunglass since 1956.  However, the quality of the glass case is now very substandard.  Until recently the cases were reinforced on the inside by a tough shell nearly robust enough to withstand a heavy foot step upon it.  I now must wear prescription Ray-Ban sun and clear corrective lenses, which necessitates my wearing the case on my belt.  The case gives little proctection to these expensive glasses.  The cases are now very chintzy to the extent that after a few weeks of wearing them on my belt they have been easily crushed or torn off.
