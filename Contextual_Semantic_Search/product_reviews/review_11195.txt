Bought these shoes for our Hawaii trip as my husband and friend swear by them. As expected, able to hike through volcano terrain, water, without any difficulty. The shoes were comfortable and required minimum "breaking in". I loved the purple and gray color! Thick rubber soles protected feet well, toes fit in and did not stick out at any point. I really liked the style of these shoes as well.
