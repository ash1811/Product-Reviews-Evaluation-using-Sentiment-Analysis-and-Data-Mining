I am five feet 5 in,145 lbs. I got size b. They will hold tummy in for sure, it's very tight in belly. It rolls down and I do not have a thick waist, size 28.  Forget the hole for peeing, what a joke!!!  The rest of the garment is more like tight pantyhose, the kind that leggs  sells. It worth buying, but not perfect.
