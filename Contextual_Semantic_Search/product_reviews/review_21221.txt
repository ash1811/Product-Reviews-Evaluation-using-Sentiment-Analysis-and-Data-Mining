I found these shoes to be comfortable enough to wear outside of my Yoga class. The material is just like wearing your yoga mat and I almost forgot I was wearing them (well, not really). The price was right and the quality was better than I expected. The orange color (which I purchased) is a bit bright, so I will keep to wearing these in the summer and spring only.
