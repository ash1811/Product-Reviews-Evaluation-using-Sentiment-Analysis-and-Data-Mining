I keep a lot of my 6'1&#34; height in my torso, so I need tall shirts in general. These are great shirts for a person like me, though I will confess they were a bit larger on me than I expected. Then again, I got the 2XL.They're soft, comfy, and generally good. My one gripe is that the sleeves are a little on the long side, and the neck is a bit looser than I prefer.
