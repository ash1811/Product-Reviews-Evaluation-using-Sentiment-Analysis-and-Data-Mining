This is a very nice ring for the money. It does bend and get dents easily thou. Has a very nice polish and comfortable. I got this ring to wear after I had a baby to replace my wedding ring set. I ordered a half size bigger and the ring fits great. I think for the money, its wonderful for a great stand in ring or starter band.
