Well I was a little skeptical to order this necklace at first cause of some of the reviews saying they got theirs kinked and what not. But I took a risk and ordered it anyways......when I got the item it came in a secure box and it arrived super fast. Like really fast. I opened the box and took it out of the zip loc baggy and jewelry baggy it came in and it was super shiny and nice. My only regret was getting it in 20 inches, it's a little small but that was my mistake. I should've gone with a 22&#34; or a 24&#34;. I'll probably order again and hand this one to my lady. It is diamond cut cause it sparkles like crazy when the sun hits so I don't know what people are talking about theirs being dull. It's a nice little peice to hold a small pendant and at a good price so I don't know what people are complaining about.....
