My son wants to be Harry for Halloween and he also needs the costume for his book report and so I ordered this wand to complete his Harry Potter look.  I read all of the reviews about it, and I went back and forth on which one to buy, and I am so glad I went with this one.  I came in the box and is as pictured.  It is a nice wand, and it did not feel like cheap plastic. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.
