These have always been my favorite shoe and I have owned several pairs of this shoes over the last 20 years(in black, navy and white) and have always loved them. This shoe is perfect with pants or skirts and I found them comfortable to work in all day. The ones that I own have all had leather shoes that were from Enzo Angiolini.  These have plastic soles!.  When I saw them on Amazon I ordered two pair thinking that they would have the same type sole as that is what the description  read.  I also own this shoe from a brand call Partners (winter white , camel and brown) and they have the plastic sole but then they only cost $19.99 and I am no longer able to find them. I ordered both pair in my regular size and one fit fine and the other pair not only had a chip in the front of the plastic sole but also fit snug across the instep and the leather wanted to curl under.  I did keep one pair even though they have the plastic sole as it rains a lot in the northwest and they fit fine.  The other pair went back because of the fit and the chip .  Amazon needs to update the description from the sellers of this product to read that they have a manmade sole and not a leather sole.
