I love this brand of shorts which is why I gave it 3 stars. However, I misunderstood the description and when I click on different links to the item, it changes from Juniors to Girls. I understood Juniors to mean teenage girl age. As a 20 year old girl, I can easily wear a M/L in these shorts for Juniors/adults. When I got my package, I received a Youth Large instead. I had to give the shorts to someone else who could wear them because I needed them on a time crunch. This is a good brand, just a little confusing on the description.
