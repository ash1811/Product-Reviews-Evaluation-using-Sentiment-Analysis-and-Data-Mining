I'm on my feet 8 to 12 hours a day, and Rockports are very comfortable and without a doubt the best shoes for hard working feet.  I've tried various different brands, because they were cheaper in cost, but eventually come back to this same shoes.  These work well for causal dress and business dress as well.
