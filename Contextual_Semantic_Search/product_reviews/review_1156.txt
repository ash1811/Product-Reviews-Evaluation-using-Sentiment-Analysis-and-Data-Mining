I wish they had more colors!!!!!!. I am a 36DD and this bra actually makes me look smaller with better posture. I have been wearing Victoria secret bras for many years, but never get the support I need. The full size is very comfortable and the material is thin, which is what I wanted. I dont want to look larger.
