I purchased this jacket for my son to wear to school in the fall. I wanted something heavier than a windbreaker. This fit the bill perfectly. The sleeves are not lined with fleece but are not thin like a windbreaker. They are more of a light quilted material. This jacket is best for cooler temperatures. This isn't a thin type of windbreaker.
