I like my jewelry to be understated and, at first, I thought these would be too big. If they were, I'd give them to my sisters as a birthday present. They are just fine at this size. Sorry, sis! My backs are firm and the studs are long enough. I got all three colors at a lightning deal offer. I was sorry I was only allowed to buy one of each.
