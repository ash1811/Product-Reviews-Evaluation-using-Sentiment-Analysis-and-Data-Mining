THey are very comfy.WHen I first opened the box, I was amazed at how much Sherling fur there was.Naturally, it is gonna take some time to break them in.  My foot is on the wide side, not wide enough to require wide shoes.  FOr example, 9west shoes are to narrow for me.  I did not find them too tight.  I would wear them around the house before I wore them all day out.These shoes offer more coverage.  I have the Rylan which do not go up far enough to wear on chilly days.  I am in NJ and can see wearing these in the winter.  Where as the Rylan is not warm enough cause of the skimmer cut.  THe EMU cuddles also leaves my feet a bit chilly.  I think the higher cut on the foot should fill this orderIn general, I prefer the EMU shearling boots cause the go on sale and there is no difference.THeir version of this mocasin is not high enough and don't come in fun colors.Overall, I like the UGG concept, but buy the EMU versions at substantial savings.
