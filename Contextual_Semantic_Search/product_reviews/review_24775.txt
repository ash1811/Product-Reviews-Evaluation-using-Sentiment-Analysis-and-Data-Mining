Like a lot of folks I ordered too big the first go around.  I have a 38" waist and got the xl first...well the xl covers 39-44 or so.  The L covers 35-38 and is perfect.  It's not really urban camo, just the regular snow camo pattern from years back.  I'm glad to have found this pattern again,,,they match a lot of shirts and cover a lot of mess while working.  The look really durable and I'll probably get their vintage camo pattern next :)  Good stuff!
