I purchased these along with a set of Champion crew socks. I ended up returning the Champions and keeping the Gold Toes. I found that the material used in the Champion socks was a little thinner and not as cushioned as the Gold Toe socks. The insides of the socks also felt somewhat rough, and I was concerned that they might get rougher with repeated washings. The Gold Toe socks seemed to be better reinforced in the toe area. But one thing I liked about the Champion socks over the Gold Toe socks was that they came up about an inch higher over my calf. So one star off for length. It was a hard decision about which ones to keep, but I've been really happy with the Gold Toes and they've held up very well.UPDATE 1/10/11As I've washed these socks, they seem to get shorter and shorter (and I don't wash them on hot water or dry them on high).  The length was short enough to begin with, but repeated washings have made them even shorter.  I am now disappointed in these socks.  If you are looking for a true crew sock in terms of length, I would skip these Gold Toe socks.
