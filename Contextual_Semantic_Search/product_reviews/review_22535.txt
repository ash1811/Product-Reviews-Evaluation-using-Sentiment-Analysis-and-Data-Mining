After opening the box, my first impression was....imitation.It had a cheap, chinsey feel to it...unlike the other timepieces I own.But I figured I'd give it a try and see what happens.Unfortunately, you need to have a technical degree or be a nuclear physicist to figure out how to set the time, let alone the date etc....seriously, i had read in the reviews it was difficult to set, but the reality was much worse...The cheap feel, coupled with the difficulty in setting it, plus the fact that it's not a true chronograph deemed it worthless and i returned it the same day.
