My son is a big man and needs 4X and 5X clothes.  I ordered two of these and they were reasonably priced around $25 each.  I noticed they are more expensive now, however, they might even be worth a few dollars more than what I paid.  They are plenty large and warm, we do get a few cold spells in Florida and this will serve its purpose for him when he goes out on those cold nights.  You don't need a lot of coat here, so these are perfect for the few cool nights and mornings we get here.
