It's a winter hat.  It covers your head when it's cold out.  The brim is very small, giving it an unbalanced look if you're a grown man, but it does cover your ears well.  I'll wear it for snow shoveling and other outdoor tasks around the house, but probably wouldn't wear it around town.  It does not look quite as good in person as it does in the pictures on Amazon.
