I got this to smooth me out under some clothes. It does the job. It really holds you in. However, I have a hard time eating with this tight thing on. It feels like it affects my digestion. I do like that it creates a waist, but if you're expecting to completely hide your muffin top, you are mistaken. This pushes up your fat above the waistline a little.
