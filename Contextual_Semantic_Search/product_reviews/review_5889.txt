This is my favorite bra, I have had many of these in several different colors over the years.  I'm not sure if they have discontinuing this bra or not but it's getting harder to find.  I love the size range they offer.  I used to wear a 34 G in this bra but after gaining a little weight I am now a 36 FF.  Simple, sexy, supportive, and it gives me a magnificent decolletage, something a large breasted woman has trouble finding at times!
