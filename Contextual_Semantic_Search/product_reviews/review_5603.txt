I used this bag when we went to Egypt. It kept everything I needed without the extra weight of a purse. Plus, the color made it look like safari gear, which was cool.My only complaint was the enormous size of the cell phone holder. No one has cell phones that big anymore! I used it to hold sunglasses instead.
