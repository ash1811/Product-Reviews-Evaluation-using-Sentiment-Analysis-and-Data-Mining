These are about the size of my pinky fingernail 3/8&#34; X 3/8&#34;  and when the light catches them, they reflect all colors.  They are really pretty.  I have received many compliments on them.  If they are priced too high, I would not buy them (I think I had a gift certificate when I bought them) no matter how sparkly they are.  They are not made of gold.  Do not get THAT carried away with them.
