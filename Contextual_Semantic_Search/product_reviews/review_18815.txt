my dad used to play volleyball in mexico and his whole life from what i can remember he would always mention his tiger shoes and his tiger shoes from volleyball and we could never ever find them in the stores again because those shoes are authentic and when he saw them here he was so happy he told me he didnt care how much they cost to just get them for him!
