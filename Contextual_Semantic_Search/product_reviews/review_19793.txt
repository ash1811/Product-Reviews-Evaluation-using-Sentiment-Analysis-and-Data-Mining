Love these.  I was preparing to travel by air and wanted something compact for my luggage.  I wear an size 8 shoe and the large is perfect.  Haven't had them long enough to wash yet, but they are quite sturdy.  They have a stiff, synthetic sole, but the inside footbed is soft and so is the rest of the slipper.  Embroidery is cute and I feel look feminine.  They are very comfortable.  I plan to save them for travel.
