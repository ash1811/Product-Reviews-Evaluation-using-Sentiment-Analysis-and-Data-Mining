First of all, some of the photos show this watch as gray.  It is not gray, it is black.  The first thing that struck me about the watch, taking it out of the box was the rubber watch band.  It is suprisingly soft.  It is a very comfortable band.  The second thing was how light the entire watch is.  I usually wear metal diving watches with metal bracelets.  By comparison, this watch almost floats on my wrist.  The illumination works as advertised.  It is bright and stays bright continually.  The gas lights are on all the hands, including the second hand, hour markers, and one on the bezel.  The gas light at the 12 position is redish-orange, making it easy to orientate the watch in the dark, a nich touch.  The gas light on the bezes at the nominal top is at right angles to the bezel, another nich touch.  None of the gas lights need to recharge with an external light source, no need to push a button, they glow all the time.  I got this watch for the illumination and it rates a 5. No doubt about it.
