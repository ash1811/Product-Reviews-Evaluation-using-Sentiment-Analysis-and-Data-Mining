These are a must in humid climates. I ordered some long sleeve ones too. There are lots of pockets on the chest so it &#34;looks&#34; very much so like a fishing shirt. If that is okay, then you are fine.  Columbia makes some others that have less or different pocket style.  My Tamiami II long sleeve one has better pocket designs.  Color is a big factor in cost which is weird, but price can vary as much as $10-12 per shirt based on color despite Amazon being the seller.
