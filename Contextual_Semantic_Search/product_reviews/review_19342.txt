Got the size 8 for my daughter who is a measured 8 and had to return for this 7. She has been wearing Uggs for a few years and remains her favorite boot besides her Lee riding boot. For me I have to insert orthotics because otherwise there isn't an arch and my back would never hold up. I love them too!
