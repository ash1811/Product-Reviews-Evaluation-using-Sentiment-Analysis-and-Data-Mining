I really like these.  I have orders some for all of my shoes.  They provide a nice smell.  The only problem is that they don't list the size on them.  I have some shoes that are a smaller size and have ordered different sizes of shoe trees.  I get them mixed up and try to put the larger trees in the smaller shoes.  If they would stamp the size in them it would be better.
