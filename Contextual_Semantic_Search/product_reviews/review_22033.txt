I was very pleased with this purchase. It has now been three months and it has worked flawlessly. It is a beautiful timepiece modeled after the ever-popular Rolex Submariner. It looks great and works quite well. As with many automatic watches in this price range, it does tend to gain a minute or so every week or two. It is rated for over 600 ft in water depth resistance. I wouldn't know about this as I am not a diver. I do wear it in the shower, washing the dog and have immersed it in the sink while washing dishes. You can buy a fake Rolex that looks similar for about $100, but I have seen them and these fakes are nowhere near the quality of this 8928 Pro Diver from Invicta. If you want that classic Rolex Submariner look without breaking the bank, this is the way to go. I was so satisfied, I bought another larger, more expensive, battery-powered  Invicta Pro Diver Chronograph a few weeks later. It, too, has run flawlessly.
