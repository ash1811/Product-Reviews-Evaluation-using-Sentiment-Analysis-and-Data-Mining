I used to lose all my watches at the "Red Zone" area in Amsterdam when, well, you know, I'd leave them on the nightstand and forget about them.  It got to be expensive and I was always late for the tram.  Now these Timex Men's Watches allow you to keep time for about 3 or 4 years without worry.  The light and strap start to get ruined, but they still keep time.
