I love these bras. I've bought them in all different colors. The only thing that I can complain about is the fact that the underwire tears through the fabric. I've had to sew all of them. They're thin and comfortable. I'm quite busty with a small rib cage and it's hard for me to find bras that fit but these are my favorite.
