I have been relying heavily on the reviews of others, and start with the best reviews and work my way done until I find a nice balance of positive reviews/price/features. This is a case in point. These were far beyond what I expected to pay for quality eyewear. The style compliments my bald head, and looking through them makes colors seem more robust! My daughter even took to them.Great buy!
