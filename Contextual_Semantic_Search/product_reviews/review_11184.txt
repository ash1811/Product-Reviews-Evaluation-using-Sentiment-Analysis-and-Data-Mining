Keens are being manufactured so that they are much more narrow than they have been in previous years. This makes it very difficult to figure out your correct size.I'd originally ordered a pair to replace the pair I've been wearing for three years now in the same size only to find that they felt and looked like they were a full size smaller both in width and from heel to toe.Be careful of who you purchase from on Amazon for this reason. I purchased from &#34;ShoeSurfing&#34; who Does Not Pay For Return Shipping on their shoes. They only provide a generic label to fill out so that you can pay the shipping yourself. This was particularly misleading because according to even the shipping invoice they are supposed to follow amazon's return policy.
