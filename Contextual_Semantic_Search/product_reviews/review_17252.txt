I bought this as a replacement for my other order.My size is usually a 10.5 and i ordered such. When that arrived it was loose and uncomfortable. This made me order another pair half a size smaller. The second order arrived and it was great in terms of comfort and perceived quality.So if your going to get one, try a smaller size first to prevent hassles in returning.Since i live overseas i cant return this without taking a big hit on shipping thus the 4 stars instead of 5
