I'm probably just wasn't familiar enough with ballet shoe sizing so the original size 7 for a 2 year old who wears a size 7 shoe, couldn't have been wedged on even if I tried. I returned for a size 9 which was a touch too big, but a couple of cotton balls in the toe fixed that. an 8 1/2 would have been perfect, but unfort. I don't think ballet shoes come in half sizes. Otherwise, the quality, etc. were great for the price.
