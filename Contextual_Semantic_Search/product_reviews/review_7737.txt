I just received my Propper multicam pants today.  I wasnt expecting them so soon, i figured it would be a few more days, but it came much faster than i expected.  I went by Proppers sizing chart, which i found online,  the sizing chart was right on target.  Im 5'10" 170 pounds and the medium regular fits perfectly.  Going to order more Propper stuff soon.
