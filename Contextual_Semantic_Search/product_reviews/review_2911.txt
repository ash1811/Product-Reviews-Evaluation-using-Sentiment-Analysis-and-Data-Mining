I buy KEENS every summer for my daughters.  The comfort and arch support are wonderful in these shoes.  I like this style particularly because there seems to be less material - my daughter's feet sweat a lot and get very hot so less material allows more air to circulate which makes her happy.  Speaking of sweaty feet, these shoes can easily be thrown in the washing machine for cleaning :-)
