I purchased a few of these in several colors to keep my warm at work. I am usually cold, but not anymore. The colors are sharp, they are a good fit (I'm a 38 short and got the large) and I actually like them so much I got the same colors in the short sleeve style for the summer. I also feel it's a good price, since the short sleeve shirts cost the same.As for the fit - I purchased a medium and a large. I usually wear a medium, but both shrank so much I decided to go with the large. The large shrank down to a loose medium, but the medium was a little too tight for me. I have put on some weight since my last purchased, so I think I am a large now. But I wanted everyone to know that they do shrink - big time. Plus, with the heavier material it's hard to get them over the shoulder as the material doesn't flex as much.
