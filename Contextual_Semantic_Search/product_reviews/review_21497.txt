Well, actually kindergarten. He started wearing boots all year 'round and these are his favorite by far. We were buying up every color department stores had to offer, but these are much better quality and for the same price. He loves them so much, I bought a pair in &#34;mommy&#34; size so we could be matching. (Don't know how he feels about that...) But, I am happy!
