These are the slippers I ordered but mine did not come with the pink satin strip, which is disappointing as the accent make the slippers much prettier.The fit was fine but they were not that cushioned.  In just a few months time it felt like I was walking on just the hard rubber sole.  They keep my feet off the floor and do fit so they'll do.
