I received my FIRST pair of Skechers and tried them on. They fit great! Not a complaint to be found on this product. Size is great, maybe a smidge on the wide side and I ordered the regular size M size. They are very comfortable and I always can tell immediately after putting on a pair of new shoes. These are a great pair of shoes. Glad I purchased them and at a good price as well.
