I`m work for SCC inc. (RF microelectronics R&D;) as production equipment maint. eng. I have to walking trough manufacturing facility all day long - up to 1,5 shifts. In this case shoes  selection look for me extremely important. My old Pazolini boots give up last month and I was try to buy (something less expensive) like Rockoport or Dockers.  Dockers was looking  more attractive and better equipped for lowest price.Conclusion:  Great looking, solid build, pretty comfortable and !!!Woa!!! waterproof!!!. Great stuff for this price.Just place order for one more pair in brown color.
