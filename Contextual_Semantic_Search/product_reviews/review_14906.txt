i don't get the negative comments, this fit me perfect. i am female and got a size small in mens in juniors i wear L. this was made well. warm and soft. i looked around the sweater but there were no rips, nor threads loose. I adore it and want to order another for my Vocaloid cosplay and alter it :)
