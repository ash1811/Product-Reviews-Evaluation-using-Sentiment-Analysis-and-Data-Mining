Here I thought they only made clothes. LOLI usually wear a 13M, but my old ones were feeling tight. I ordered a 14M and they are so much more comfy.By the time I put socks on and a Gel insert in them, they should fit perfect.The uppers are a heavy, quality leather. What a nice surprise for something not made in the USA.The soles are a gummy type, soft manmade material. It is approximately 1/2&#34; thick.They should provide me with lots of wear. Time will tell.At present, I am extremely happy with my purchase.
