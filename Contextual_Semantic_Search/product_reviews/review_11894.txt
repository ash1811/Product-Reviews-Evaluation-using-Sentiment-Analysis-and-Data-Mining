Okay, folks, there is something you need to keep in mind when buying shorts or trousers. Most companies label a waist size as two to four inches smaller than your actual waist size.  That is, your waist may be 40 inches, but when you go to Old Navy, their size 38 or even 36 may be what fits you.  It makes you feel better about shopping there, because it makes you feel thin.  Dickies, though, makes clothing for work uniforms, so an HR rep will take a worker's measurements and then order clothing accordingly.  So when you buy these shorts, take your actual waist measurement OR order two to four inches bigger.  I ordered four inches larger than the jeans I bought from Old Navy, and these shorts are a PERFECT fit.  Wonderful.  A bit baggy, which is cool with me, and they're really sharp looking. The colors are deeply saturated and vibrant, and the fabric, while stiff, is soft on my legs.  It's not a bad idea to get yourself a Dickies belt, either, because a lot of belts designed for jeans won't fit through the Dickies belt loops.  The Dickies belt also helps to keep the waistband from folding down.Also, I was sceptical of the cell phone pocket, but it really is quite useful.  In short (no pun intended) I give my wholehearted endorsement to these shorts.  I bought three pairs!
