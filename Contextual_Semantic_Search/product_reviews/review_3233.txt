I bought this one bra on a trial basis. I was worried since many people said it was so thin you would need to have a cover for nipple area. Well, yes if you are wearing a thin shirt this might be an issue. But the fit and comfort FAR outweigh that issue for me. I bought one in white and black I love them so much. Worth every penny and then some. The fit is perfect, the support is great, the fact my shoulders are not being dug into as this doesn't sit there---I love that. I wear a 36C so not like I'm huge and need alot of support. Just enough to help keep the girls in their place. This bra does exactly that.
