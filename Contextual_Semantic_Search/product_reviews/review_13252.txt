I bought this and it is true to size, fit well in the size I normally wear. The bad thing is the wider straps. Yes, they're padded but it seems the padding in them is more on the back of the strap instead of on the shoulder as it looks like in the picture. It's comfortable but the wide straps really show when wearing it with tank tops or sleeveless shirts or dresses. Great coverage in the front, though. Wearing it with a somewhat tight or sheer top is fine - it hides what needs covered. I'd buy it again for the right price.
