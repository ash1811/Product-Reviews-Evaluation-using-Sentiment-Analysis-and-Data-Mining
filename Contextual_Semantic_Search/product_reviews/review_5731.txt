These fit true to size.. I ordered a medium (fyi, i'm 5'6 and 125 lbs). The rise is high but that's what I want in a cold gear pant.I want to keep my mid section as warm as it can be. They feel great and keep you warm on freezing cold runs.Definitely keep these in mind if you are looking for warm tights!
