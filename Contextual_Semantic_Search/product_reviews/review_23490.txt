I admit I bought 2 pair because I liked the look. Yeah &#34;Duh!&#34;. I took a chance and it paid off. The fit is good even for my big head. I feel they can make ANYONE look cool. Cuts down on the glare very good. I am using these for daily walks. Light weight and fit great. No moving or falling off. Color is Niiiice. Glad I bought 2 pair :-)
