I've been buying these for years, and the quality is all over the place.  Sometimes they are thin; sometimes they are thick.  Sometimes the collar lays flat; sometimes it looks awful.I finally got sick of them, and paid a little more and got the Dockers t-shirts.  They are infinitely better and worth the extra cost.
