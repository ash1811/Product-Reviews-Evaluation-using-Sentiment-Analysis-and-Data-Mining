These have so many great uses here in the tundra.  We all have a pair and use them to run outside to take the dog out, check the mail, run out to the car, etc.ALthough I wouldn't wear them for too long at a time because they are rubber and your feet will sweat, I have run to the store and to get gas with them on many times.  Every member of my family loves them.
