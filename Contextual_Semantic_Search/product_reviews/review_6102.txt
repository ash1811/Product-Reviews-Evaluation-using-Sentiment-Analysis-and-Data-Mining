Lighter weight than I thought it would be. So it shouldn't wear you out just wearing it.Had good quality seams but would like more rows of stitch for work grade use.6' and it was right height with boots.Over the shoulder chest release is lighter weight and ok to operate.False fly in front and fabric wasn't laying flush drawing attention.Two chest pockets with solid secure snaps.Plenty pockets and generous side hand pockets.If you have a broad chest you may want to order larger size than normal. 36-38&#34; waist 52&#34; chest. I ordered 38&#34; and was snug at handle and rib area causing awkward securing of eye/buttons at waist.Would recommend this to Light to Medium weight work duty.
