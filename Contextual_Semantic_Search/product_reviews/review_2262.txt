I bought these for my husband, who is a 31-year-old with an athletic build. They fit well, look modern and are versatile - can dress them up or down. The color is nice. My only warning is that you must wash these jeans before sitting anywhere in them - they left quite a stain on one of our suede chairs - I still have to try to get that out. We bought another pair because he liked them so much. The really great price sold us.
