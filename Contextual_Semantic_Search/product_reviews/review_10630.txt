My elderly Mom has lost much of her finger dexterity and could no longer use a watch with a buckle or clasp.  She also didn't like the look of most watches that came with a "stretch" band.  This was the perfect gift for her. The watch and the band are attractive and with the removal of three links, fit her perfectly.This watch would not be great for a person with poor eyesight since the dial and hands have little visual contrast.
