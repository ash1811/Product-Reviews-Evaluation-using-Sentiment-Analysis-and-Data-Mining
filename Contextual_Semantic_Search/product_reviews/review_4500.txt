The shirt is attractive, fits great without being baggy!  Most shirts today are not form fitting, but have much excess material that makes them look like sacks.  The Dickie hugs the body and looks really great.  I love the six medium sized in various colors that I purchased.  What I love the very most are the two pockets which most shirts don't have today.  Try them, you'll buy them!
