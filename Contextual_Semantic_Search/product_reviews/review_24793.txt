These sunglasses are easily worth the $10 or so. My wife lost her last pair of ~$30 sunglasses like these and honestly she can't tell a difference between them. Build quality is fine and the hinges are strong and actually need to be broken in they're so tight.All-in-all, if you need a cheap pair of sunglasses, you could spend way more than you need to! But not on these!
