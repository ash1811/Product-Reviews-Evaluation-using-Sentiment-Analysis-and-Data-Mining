I am and have always been a fan of Carhart. A great selling point for me is the fact their clothes are durable and hold up to the abuse I tend to dish out frequently. I also like the fact they manufacture numerous color choices and styles. Thanks Carhartt for creating tough clothes that remain with you a long time and Amazon for carrying their line of clothing.
