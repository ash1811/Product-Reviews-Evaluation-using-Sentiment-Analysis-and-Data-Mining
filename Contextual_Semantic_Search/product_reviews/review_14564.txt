These were recommended by my physical therapist after I had my foot reconstructed.  I really don't like them because they are bulky and heavy.  I just don't like all that stiff weight on my feet, but maybe that's my preference.  I don't find myself drawn to them when I go looking for some shoes to wear, and they end up sitting in my closet.
