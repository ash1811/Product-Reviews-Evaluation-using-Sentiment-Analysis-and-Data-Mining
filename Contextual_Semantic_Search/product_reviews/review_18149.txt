When the shoes arrived, several of the waxed ends of stitches were sticking out sharply to poke me. I pushed them down, but a few still irritate after walking in these shoes for over an hour. The seams also pucker inwards and hurt.The dye on the leather still rubs off onto skin, and fibers come off the inside and off the laces, even though I have worn these several times, and worn them in water twice.There is no support or cushioning. The heel has a hard leather lining, but the front feels like there is nothing between your foot and the rubber outsole besides one sheet of leather. Did my pair just come with insoles missing or something?The toebox is narrow.Around where the instep is, there is a noticeable odd step down to the front of the shoe from the heel.What attracted me to this shoe were the interesting colors and aesthetically pleasing shape, but I found that these were the only good things. The leather is of high quality, but who cares if it has been sewn together with careless stitching?I will not wear them regularly; hopefully they'll at least last a long time to make up for the price. I'm pretty surprised that anyone has found these comfortable enough for daily use, as they don't have any more support or cushioning than sturdy rubber sandals.[Edited on 2012-10-02]I wore them in salt water on the beach and they shrunk significantly and became stiff after being in the sun. Can no longer wear them comfortably, because rinsing with fresh water did not help. Now I wish I had gone a half size up.
