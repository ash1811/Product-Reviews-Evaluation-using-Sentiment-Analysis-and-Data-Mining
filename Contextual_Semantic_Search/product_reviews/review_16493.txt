This is my first purchase of Dickies t-shirts.  The shirts themselves are well-constructed, high-quality garments.  The cotton is quite heavy (too heavy for FL in the summertime).  They run quite large, yet the neck is small in comparison, and constrictive when worn.  I would return these if I could.My husband and I much prefer the Hanes tagless tee:Hanes Heavyweight Tagless Pocket Teeavailable here on Amazon.
