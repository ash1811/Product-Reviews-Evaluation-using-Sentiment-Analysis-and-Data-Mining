They're comfortable and warm, but whether or not they're also durable will only show with time.  They appear well constructed, and there are no parts, threads or tabs flapping in the breeze.  The sole edge rides high on the sides, and the grip is quite good.  I use mine to run out and grab the mail in cold weather on slippery surfaces, and in light snow. So far, they've proven to be very good under slippery conditions, including the wet linoleum floor of the kitchen. They appear to be sized properly.
