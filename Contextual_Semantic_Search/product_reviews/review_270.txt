We purchased these shoes for the girls in our bridal party as they were wearing Latte dresses. The boys wore black to match their suits. I wore white, and my husband black.The high-tops were a better choice so short socks could be worn by the ladies and the boys didn't have white socks peeking out under their pant legs' hems.All arrived quickly and in one large box.
