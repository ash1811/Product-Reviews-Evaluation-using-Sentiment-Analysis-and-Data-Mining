As others have said, these are plain old-school jeans.  Built like a tank, probably going to be tough to tear up.  Wash them first though, or you'll think you're wearing sandpaper... And wash them by themselves, or with other dark clothes, at least the first few times-they bleed a lot of blue at first.  For the price, this can't be beat. Sizing was perfect as well.
