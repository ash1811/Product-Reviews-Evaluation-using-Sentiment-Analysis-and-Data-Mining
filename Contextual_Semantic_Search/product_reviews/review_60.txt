I purchased this costume for my 6-year old grandson for Halloween 2011.  It arrived one week earlier than expected, and I was happy about this.  My grandson absolutely loved it!  I'm glad I ordered the larger size (Size 8) because it barely fit him. The material was durable and well made, I think.  He's worn it many times just to play in since Halloween.  I was happy with the purchase which was worth the dollars I spent.
