This bra is as good as it gets with over (not under) wire for DD. It provides a good hold and could be worn all day. I bought a size larger, but feel that material is stretching, should of stuck with my regular size. There is no real separation though, which can lead to skin irritation. I prefer Everyday cotton bra for everyday use. Not sure why they put wire on top of the cups...
