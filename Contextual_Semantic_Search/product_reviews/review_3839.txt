This waist cincher was exactly what I expected.  It is well made and fits true to size.  Great for wear with garter stockings and gives that little extra waist cinching that I was looking for.  It is not to tight and allows me to move freely no binding.As an Amazon Prime member I received free two day shipping on my order and it arrived on time as I expected.
