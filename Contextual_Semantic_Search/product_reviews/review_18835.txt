I generally wear a 8 1/2 or 9 narrow shoe.  I have absolutely not been able to find sandals to fit my foot this year in any department store.  The stores that carry Bass, Clark, Naturalizer never have the narrow widths.  I ordered these sandals  in an 8 1/2 narrow.  The width is perfect.  They are just long enough.  They are very comfortable, look nice and the price is wonderful.  Think I need another pair!
