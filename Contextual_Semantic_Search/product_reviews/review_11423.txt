Wow, this watch looks better in person than it does just by the picture. I am VERY happy with it.EDITED TO ADD...I bought this as a Christmas presant for my Husband.  Steve is a huge man, Nothing fits him.  His Jacket is a 4xl tall.  He has a 40 inch inseam.  He has to get 5xl gloves.  However, this watch slipped right over his hand, and clasped over his wrist withought any adjustment.  It might be a litle tight if anything, but if you have a large man in your life, this might just fit his wrist.Christmas day, we were at Mount Vernon, and no less than 5 people commented on it.  It is truly a nice watch.
