I like the hat and it looks good. It was a great price especially since it was shipped all the way from China where it was manufactured and arrived to my address in a good time frame. I wore it right away, but got it dirty from messing with the automobile. I washed it twice since I got it. Machine washed. It came clean like it was brand new, but the material started kind of ragging out and showing wear that I feel it should not of been showing at two washings. It did keep its shape. It still looks good, but it just looked kind of rough as far as some spots of the material.I like it enough how ever, I would buy another one. So in my opinion it is a good product.
