Its nice that it can adjust to any size waist and in any belt loops.  The only problem is that it doesn't stand up to a lot of body movement. If you are lifting and turning and squatting, and all together putting a lot of stress onto your belt, it starts to lose its grip.  As a regular day to day belt though its great.
