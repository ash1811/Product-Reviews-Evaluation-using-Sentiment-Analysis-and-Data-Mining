Alrighty...plus size/queen size people don't always have thin, long legs...I have thick legs and a smaller waist...these stocking were so tight at the top of my thighs, it hurt. I have had this issue with leg avenue before. I think this company needs to research queen size. I am usually a size 1x...these stockings should have fit.
