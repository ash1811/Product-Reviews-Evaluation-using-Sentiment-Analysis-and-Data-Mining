I ordered one that is 2 sizes bigger than mine because I was worry it could be too tight, I am happy with the fit although need the right bra, even if I have a good breast :) still need to fit at best the little extra space since I've gone 2 sises up to make sure not to show my belly!need also something under cuz it is see through !!!
