I really like the look of the rainbow sandals and people are raving about its comfort and build quality, so I bought a pair. However, I had to return it because of the sizing.  I'm a 8.5 to 9 depending on the shoe so I bought the women's large. When I tried them on my feet were sort of hanging off a little at the sides.  My feet are about average width and I really thought for a bit on whether or not I should just keep them.  I ended up returning these and actually visiting the rainbow store. It turns out that the rainbow men's small was just right for me.  So if your feet aren't particularly narrow, I suggest getting the men's pair.  They really aren't that much wider than the women's, maybe a quarter of an inch. Just enough space for my feet not to hang over the edge.
