Considering I didn't pay much for these, I wasn't expecting much. Arrived a day early, but when I tried them on I noticed how stretched out they were when I took them off. I don't have incredibly meaty legs or ridiculously long legs, but they stretched out far more than I had expected them to. I've paid about the same for better tights- they'll do, but I don't think I would buy them again. You get what you pay for. I must admit that, being a ginger, I have a hard time getting tights that are close to my skin tone, but these were almost spot on. For those of us who don't tan often, the color is just right.
