These have held up well for my daughter's dance class. She is four and is hard on tights, so they are often washed and dried. They have yet to run , and occasionally make it to daycare, where she plays in the them all day out in the woods and on the playground.Our daughter is about a size 5, and I am not sure these will fit her at 6 years old.
