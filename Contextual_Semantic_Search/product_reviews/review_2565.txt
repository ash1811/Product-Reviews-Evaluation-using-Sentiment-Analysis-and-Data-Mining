These shorts are super comfortable: not too thick or too thin. I wanted something a little more modest to exercise in. The length on me (an average height woman) is exactly as pictured, slightly above the knee. However, they still look like women's shorts, which is what I was going for. Also, these do not ride up as I walk or hike like some shorts I've had in the past. I'm considering purchasing another pair for when these are in the wash.
