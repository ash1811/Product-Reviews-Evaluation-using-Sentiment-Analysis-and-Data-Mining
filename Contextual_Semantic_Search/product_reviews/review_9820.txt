For the past 3 years I have had to replace something in the Fossil watches that I've purchased for my husband.  Envitably he succeeds in breaking/damaging something on the watch and I'm forced to trek back to the store.  Worst of all, the batteries never seemed to last very long.  That's where this watch has been a blessing.  I no longer have to worry about getting the battery replaced.  It's seems very well made and even my husband, the watch eater has trouble damaging it.  He's very happy with the design and feel and receives many compliments a day.  I hope this is the last watch I have to buy.
