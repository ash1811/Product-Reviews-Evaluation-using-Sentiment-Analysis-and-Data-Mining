These shoe are holding up so much better than my 1st pair of Skechers...Have a look at the toe material on the front. No troubles with the sole peeling off the toe ever. I wear these 5 days a week 10-12hr days and no issue. Starting to flatten some and will replace the insoles..Just ordered 1 more pair that is similar with the same toe design. 300lb with flat feet and I like them.
