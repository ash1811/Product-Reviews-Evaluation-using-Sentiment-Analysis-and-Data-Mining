Pros:WarmEasily fit over bootsSnaps and heavy duty zippers, no velcro that can wear out.Waterproof.Long enough to cover the top of your boots to prevent snow in the shoe.Overalls so they can't fall down. And the slide lock on them is awesome and unlike snaps has 0 chance of coming undone without your help.Bib so if you make any overhead reaching motions and your jacket slides up you still have the bib to protect you from the cold.Deep pockets large enough to accommodate gloves.Run a little large so you have room to wear a shirt, under shirt, and hoodie easily and still have room to zip them up.Cons:I can only think of one and that is that they don't have any kind of belt feature around your ankles. If you could fasten these up around boots it would 100% prevent any chance of snow getting in your boots and they would be perfect. Either way it only cost a few bucks to have a tailor put a few belt loops on the ankle area but it would have been nice if they came like that.Overall: Best snow pants I have ever had and I don't doubt they will last a long long time.
