The past month or so, I've really been splurging as much as I can afford to on new bras in my new, 'real' size.  So I've tried out three different brands so far, and my most recent addition to my lingerie drawer has been the Panache Tango II balconette Superbra.  What can I say?  It is absolutely the most comfortable bra I have ever worn.  EVER.  Online, the bra does get mixed reviews--you either love it or you hate it, apparently--and I've read speculations that it all boils down to shape, not size.  Personally, I am "fuller on the bottom" and ever-so-slightly wide-set, and the shape I find my Tango II gives me is outstanding.  It has a muted retro vibe going on, I wouldn't call the shape "pointy" like some others have, but it's not the round look that is so popular nowadays, either.  I don't mind that.My Tango II in 'nude' was a gamble of a purchase, I thought I might be a different size by Panache standards and I was right--so it fits perfectly!  (Note: The first bra in my 'new' size that I purchased for myself, online and with my eyes closed, was of a brand that runs small in the band.  I ordered a 30 and have been wearing it often, but I read later the brand's 30-sized bands "fit like 28" and so suspected I'm really a 28 to most other companies' sizing systems [and up a cup size, of course].  So at least with my Tango II, my musings and additional, awkward self-measuring sessions worked out to my benefit.) I am so happy, it is a well-constructed bra that doesn't dig in, it "breathes", and it's lovely to look at and wear.  Granted, I've not worn it yet under a white shirt but under a knit top that can be slightly see-through to other color bras, my Tango II was invisible, even with the pretty embroidery.  So it is highly recommended lingerie, at least by this new Panache fan.
