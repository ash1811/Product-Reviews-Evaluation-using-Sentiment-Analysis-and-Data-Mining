These sneakers are supposed to be for walking but there isn't enough cushion for me to walk very far in them.  I bought them to wear to work on days when I don't want to wear dress shoes.  Maybe it's me but I am finding it hard to buy shoes, most of the time they are either too small or fall off my feet.  These sneakers are comfortable enough to wear to work but my feet still slip in them, however since they are sneakers I don't walk out of them.  I have custom orthotics for my shoes due to foot & knee issues so buying shoes can be a challenge.  I will keep these sneakers and wear them since they fit the bill for me and they are comfortable but I can't give them a glowing review.
