I love these sandals!  They are like walking on Memory foam!  I&#8217;ve worn them all day at Disneyland and haven&#8217;t had any more foot soreness than if I had been wearing my tennis shoes.  Amazing!  The only weird thing is the first few times they got wet, they foamed.  It was similar to soap bubbles squeezing out of the soles.  Not sure what that was about but it doesn&#8217;t seem to have any long-term effects, as I have had my first pair for over a year and they are still in great condition!
