Our family's experience with Caterpillar shoes began when I found a new pair of sturdy Mary Jane's at a yard sale. I learned later that the same company makes construction vehicles and machines and is well respected in the industry.My son works in the trades and is legendary in how tough he is on clothes and shoes, but I decided to give the Caterpillars a try. This is the second pair I've bought him and both pairs have held up well and longer than other boots with a higher price tag. The soles are sewn, not glued, which is a sign of quality and the leather is thick and sturdy without being stiff. Caterpillar also provides a good selection in soft-toed boots which are essential for electricians and anyone working around electricity. Steel toes do and will conduct.These run true to size and we generally get an additional threes to six months of wear above other brands. I'm also told they are comfortable. Price, quality, selection, durability and comfort...Caterpillars have it all. Highly recommended work boots.
