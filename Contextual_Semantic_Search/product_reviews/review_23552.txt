These are my first Easy Spirit sneakers and I really like them. They are very lightweight and cushy. I like the laces as well - they are sort of an elastic with plenty of give, but they stay in place. I wanted a pair of shoes I could wear instead of riding boots when just working around the barn (and not riding, these are NOT suitable for riding). As the summer wears on boots get very hot to wear for long periods. These sneakers have been good at keeping my feet comfortable in 100 degree temps so far. Additionally, they don't slip and the width is perfect with socks. I would totally buy these again at some point.
