This watch by invicta has been around for several years and is a true classic. I own the Silver/black version of this watch and it has proven to work without flaw. My experience on this particular order was quite unusual. I originally ordered it directly from Amazon.com from there stock. The price was right at $59.00, which included the 25% off and free 1 day shipping. The order arrived the following day and appeared untampered. I opened the box to find the classic Invicta yellow watch box. I noticed what appeared to be black smudge marks on the case (prints). I opened the box and low and behold, there was no watch! I immediately called Amazon and explained what happened. They were just as puzzled. The watch through Amazon was no longer available; however, one of the marketplace sellers that sells through Amazon and fullfilled by Amazon had it in stock. Although the price was about $40.00 more, Amazon ate the cost and sent it to me UPS next day air. It arrived today and when I opened the box, there it was! The Invicta box was smaller than the usual watch box and they did not include a cleaning cloth. The watch itself is very detailed and shows the quality of an Invicta Automatic. Although I was upset with my Amazon experience, I was please with the way they immediately remedied the problem.
