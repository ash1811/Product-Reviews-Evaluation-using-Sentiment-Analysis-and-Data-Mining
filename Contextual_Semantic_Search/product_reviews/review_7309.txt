After reading the reviews, I purchased the shoes 2 sizes up, and they just baty fit. I am hoping she breaks them in as she wears them. My daughter is 3.5 and wears a 7-8 shoe depending on the brand (usually a 7). I bought the 9N Toddler. They really are adorable, though, and if she grows out of them, I'll just buy the next size up, sonde I now have a feel for the sizes.
