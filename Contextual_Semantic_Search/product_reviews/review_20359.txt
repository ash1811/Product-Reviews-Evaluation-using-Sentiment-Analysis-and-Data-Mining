This wand is exactly the same as the one I got in person at Ollivander's shop in Universal- Without the lines!  It  comes in  the same exact box with the beautiful ribbons. It is a great quality, it really feels like a wand, magical and with substance. This does not feel at all like a toy, but more like a collection piece.
