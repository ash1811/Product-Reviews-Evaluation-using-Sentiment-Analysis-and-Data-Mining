Typical of Levi Jeans, these are a bit stiff but after you break them in they will become a favorite piece of your wardrobe. They fit perfectly. Not too big...not too small. The only thing is that when you use the bathroom, a bit of work needs to be done before relieving yourself. Great purchase. Fair price.
