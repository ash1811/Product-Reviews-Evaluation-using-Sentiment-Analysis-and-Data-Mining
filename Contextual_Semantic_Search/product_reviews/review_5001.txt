Let me preface this by saying that I own 5 or 6 pairs of the ExOfficio standard briefs, and I absolutely love them and gave them 5 stars.However, these don't measure up...literally.  They don't provide any support for your package, and you will be bouncing all over the place as you would with a standard pair of boxers.  I ordered mediums, just like the regular briefs that give me fantastic support, but the boxer-briefs have the crotch hanging much farther down, so you might as well be wearing boxers.  The thighs fit right, so it's not a matter of going a sized down, because then the thighs would be too tight.I bought these for my cross-training class at my gym so that when I was doing crunches and other exercises where my legs are up in the air I wouldn't be flashing my bright white upper thighs to the class, but I also don't want to have my stuff flailing all over while we're doing jumping jacks and whatnot, so I'm now having to wear these over a standard set of briefs to accomplish that goal until I can find some other boxer briefs that actually provide support.If you're moreso looking to wear these instead of boxers with everyday clothes where you're not worried about twisting your boys and getting testicular torsion, then these could be great for you.BOTTOM-LINE: Don't buy these for athletic support.  The ExOfficio standard briefs are an excellent choice if you don't care about covering your thighs.
