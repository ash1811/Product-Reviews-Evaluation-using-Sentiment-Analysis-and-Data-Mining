This is better than the Champion baseball belt.  The color is off though.  I ordered maroon and it looks brown.  The buckle is also smaller than Champion's.  And the overall length is longer.  I don't need it that long.  But what's nice is where the metal sizing clip ends up due to how long it is overall.
