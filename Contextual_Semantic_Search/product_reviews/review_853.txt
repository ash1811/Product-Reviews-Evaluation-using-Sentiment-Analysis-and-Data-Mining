Lovely fit, stayed on my shoulders, soft cool material and went through the washer-dryer without a problem. What is not to like about this night gown?  The length is perfect for me, although I'm 5'8&#34; and it comes a bit below my knees.  The flowers are very feminine.  Choose purple and save some money!
