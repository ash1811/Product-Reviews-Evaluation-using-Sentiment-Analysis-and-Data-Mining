it's a g-shock.  you probably will lose your arm before this watch breaks.  analog dial g-shock looks cool.  the minute hand moves 1/3 minute every 20 seconds.  it has power management features, if you put it away for a while the display turns off, the hands stop.  when you pick it up or push a button it wakes up and the hands reset to the correct time.  fun to watch.  starts conversations with guys who like g-shock watches.my only complaints:backlight is bright enough to light up the illuminated hands a little but it's nearly impossible to see the lcd display using the backlight in the dark.face is small for today's fashion trends.stopwatch is basic, hard to see, not a primary feature
