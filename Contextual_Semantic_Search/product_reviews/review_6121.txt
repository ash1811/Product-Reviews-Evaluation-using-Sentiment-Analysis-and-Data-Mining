I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China.  I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered.  They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed.  I received the pants and they were made in China and didn't fit anything like the other 3 do.  I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS.  The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it.  This was emailed from Zac.  I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number.  I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon.  I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account.  Fortunately, I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June.  If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city, I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in.  I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in.
