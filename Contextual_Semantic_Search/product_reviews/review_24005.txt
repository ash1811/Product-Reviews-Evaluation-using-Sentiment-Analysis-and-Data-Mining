Altogether I now own 7 pairs of Dickies scrub pants, 4 are part of a scrub set. They are well made, colors don't fade, seems don't come apart, material holds up to repeated washing and the rigours of my job. I purchased a few cheaper scrubs to save some money and ended up regretting it. You really do get what you pay for. I now use the cheap scrubs when I am painting or cleaning. No more cheap scrubs for this girl, paying a little more for scrubs that will last longer and fit better saves money in the long run. I have never regretted buying any of my Dickies scrubs and I will buy more in the future
