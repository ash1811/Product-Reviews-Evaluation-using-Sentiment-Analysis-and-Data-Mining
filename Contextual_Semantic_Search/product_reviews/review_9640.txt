I grew up wearing Levi's but bodies change.  If I purchased Levi's to fit my waist they were too baggy in the seat so about 5 years ago I switched to Wrangler's Cowboy Cut Slim Fit Jeans, problem solved.  High quality, great fit (no saggy butt) and very reasonably priced.  Good color selection and now that I have my size down Amazon delivers them to my door.  Sweet...
