The sizes are very inaccurate, but I can't dock it any stars because of the fact that hats are just about like shoes.  Different brand/different interpreted size.  Nonetheless, the quality of Kangol remains to be one of the best in stylish hats still on the market.  I've purchased several hats from Amazon & department stores, and I know that when I buy a hat from Kangol, the quality is always going to at least meet my expectations, if not surpass.  Well done!
