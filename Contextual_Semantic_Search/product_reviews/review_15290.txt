these overboots seem like they are well made but lightweight. they are a little pricey. they're just the thing for a wet day at work.UPDATE!!! i bought these boots in late spring and haven't used them due to a dry summer. they have sit on my covered front porch for six months. i got them out this morning after a rainy night and put them on over my shoes. they have dry rotted and had holes and cracks in them. turns out that they are JUNK.
