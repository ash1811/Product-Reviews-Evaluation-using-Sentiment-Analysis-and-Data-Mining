I'd give the watch five stars, and the band maybe two stars, or possibly three considering it's not like it fell apart, unlike some of the Timex men's watches.  It sure has faded, though, from a pretty blue to kind of grubby looking gray.  Unlike the reviewer who said her watch faded from the chlorine in the pool, I think mine has just faded from use and exposure to sweat and body oil, since it's faded on the inside of the band as well as the outside.  I rarely swim, and use my watch mostly when running.That said, I like it enough that I recently bought another one with a black band.  I am no electronic whiz-kid when it comes to watch functions, and this is the first chrono I've had that doesn't cause me to say "*^$@*!!" when trying to actually get it to do something besides just tell time!  It's very easy to use, even while in motion.  The numbers are easy to read and the alarms are audible in a noisy environment.  Overall a good functional product with a disappointing band.
