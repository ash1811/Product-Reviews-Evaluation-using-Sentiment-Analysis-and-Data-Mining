I love the color but this is not going to be my favorite Playtex bra.  First of all, even after soaking and washing, it has an odd rubbery aroma that other Playtex bras do not have.  Second issue is that the bra straps cannot be adjusted as tight as on other Playtex bras so I cannot adjust the bra so that the cups are filled properly.  There is a bit of fabric fold over at the bottom of the cup. I can put up with it but will not buy this style again.3-12-13 update.  I have soaked it overnight, washed it over and over again and it still smells like rubber and sulphur, especially when I wear it on a warm day.  The odor is coming from the elastic band not the cups.  With the advent of warm weather, I am thinking I will just trash this bra and write it off to experience.  Hard to believe Playtex didn't notice the odor before they started using this material.
