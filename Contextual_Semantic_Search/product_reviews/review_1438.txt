I bought this sock to wear with my rain boots in the winter. It has lots of cushion and I have had no blisters after wearing them long hours. This sock fits my foot well, but is not as binding as other Experian type Thorlos I have worn. The extra cushion on the bottom is really nice, and I have been wearing them around my house as a slipper sock. Only buy them if you have extra room in your shoe.
