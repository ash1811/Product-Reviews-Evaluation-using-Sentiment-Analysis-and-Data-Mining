These "boat" style shoes are not waterproof though the leather seems to have a water-repellent coating.Why the boat shoes are not waterproof:After about three wearings, the plastic bottoms start to get slightly loose from the leather part in the front.Therefore, if you walk around water or rain, water comes in the front part of the shoe so that the leather footbed under the ball of the foot will be wet. When this occurs, it takes several hours to dry.I have tried the Sperry Authentic Moccasins in both classic white bottom as well as Sahara color and have had the same issue.
