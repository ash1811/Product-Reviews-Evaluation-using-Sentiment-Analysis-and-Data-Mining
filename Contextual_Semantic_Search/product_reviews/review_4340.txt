Finally!  A wallet that holds everything...money, cards, checkbook.  Not only does it hold all my cards (credit, medical, bank, insurance, car registration, license) there is also a place for coupons, paper money and coins.  It holds everything, and is very well made.  No gaps, no loose zippers.  I don't know how time will affect it, but so far, it's doing fine.
