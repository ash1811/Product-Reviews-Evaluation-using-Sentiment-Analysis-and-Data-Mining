Purchased these as a replacement  of my old slap 2 sandals. They are every bit as comfortable but the sizing is very different.  I usually wear a 9 but these seem a little small, next time I will pay more attention to the sizing. The only other thing I can comment on is that after wearing them, there are white marks where my feet are and it seems to be permanent.
