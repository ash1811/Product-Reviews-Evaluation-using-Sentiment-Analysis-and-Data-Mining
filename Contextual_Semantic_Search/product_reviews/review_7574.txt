1st, let me say I like this hat. I researched the size on Kangol's website, then measured my head. My head is kinda big so the one-size-fits-all things usually don't work. From their size chart, I decided Extra Large should work & it does. Perfectly. I've never had a Kangol hat before but I usually wear flat hats. This one is now one of my favorites. It does vent well. I have other so-called summer hats that don't vent at all. This one does. The only thing that was a slight disappointment is the color. Various websites show this hat being bright red to dark red. Kongol's site shows it to be a bright red but calls it Scarlet. Let me say it IS Bright Red. Folks will hear you coming. I was hoping it would be a subdued red to match the color on my Jeep. But, it's still a favorite because of the comfort.
