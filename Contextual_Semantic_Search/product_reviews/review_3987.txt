I've grown frustrated by the lack of good quality/reasonably priced jeans in the market today.  At some point, the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar.  Don't remember exactly when that happened, but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic.  Over time, they stopped making the style I grew to rely on.  This created a 7-10 stretch where I couldn't seem to find a good pair of jeans.  Most recently, I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced.  When those began to fail, I tried Levis again and bought these.  For a third of the price of Lucky Jeans, these Levis boot-cut jeans are really nice.  They have a really substantial feel/weight to them and I couldn't be happier with the purchase.  I was so pleased, I ended up buying a second pair.
