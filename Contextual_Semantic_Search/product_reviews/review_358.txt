I have wanted Green chuck taylors for the longest time!  I got these right away and loved them!  They are the bright kelly green as pictured.  I am a women's 7.5 usually, but 7's fit perfectly.  I was also really happy with the price this seller had it as.  Anywhere else seemed to be $60 or more!  Can't complain about these shoes at all except that I'm worried about getting them dirty!
