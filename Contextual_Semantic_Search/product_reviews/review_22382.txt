These are on the small side...my foot just barely fits. I have been buying Reef flip flops for years and usually start the season off with at least 3 new pair, but I'm not going to count this as one that I will be wearing away from the house. Though still very comfortable, they just look like I'm wearing my daughter's shoes.
