This longline bra is surprisingly comfortable.  I was afraid that in order to obtain the desired shape, I would have to sacrifice comfort, but that is not the case with this bra.It provides that beautiful shaping that is iconic to the styles of the 1950's, where women had a perfect hourglass figure due to this type of shapewear.  I love it, and highly recommend it.
