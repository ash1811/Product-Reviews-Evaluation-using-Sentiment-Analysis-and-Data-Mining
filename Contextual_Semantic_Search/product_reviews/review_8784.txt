My 15 year old daughter has bad posture so we thought we'd try to correct it by purchasing this bra, as braces and other gadgets are not recommended by doctors.  This bra is very lightweight & does not offer enough coverage or support, and my daughter hates it.  She has to wear it with another bra to get the coverage and support she needs.  The strap design is created to try to remind ladies to stand up straight, but it's not really working for my daughter.  Overall, a waste of money for us.
