This watch is awesome!! I think this is around my fifth automatic diver from Invicta. The watch is beautiful!!! The things I have noticed are a different movement. It is not the Myota movement anymore, the Myota was 21 jewels and the rotor was plain with just the name etched in it. This movement is 24 jewels and the rotor is engine turned (or &#34;jeweled&#34; ) and it is pretty. The screw down crown threads seem &#34;rough&#34; compared to my old watch, not smooth when tightened. The bezel is smoother than the old and the superluminova is very nice. The band is the same and I wish Invicta would make this a &#34;diver&#34; band with the wetsuit extension. This is the cheapest price I've ever paid and probably the best watch so far
