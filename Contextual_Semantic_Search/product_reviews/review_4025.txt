These T shirts are thin (which I personally like) and fit great. I love the colors too, the images here represent the real colors well.I got two of these, one last year one this year and they keep the color even washing repeatedly in hot water.I am 5.5 tall, I got an S and it was right in length but too large so I just washed it in hot water and dried it in the drier at max temperature (I got the 100% cotton one). This way it would get like a XS, which fits a normal size woman.
