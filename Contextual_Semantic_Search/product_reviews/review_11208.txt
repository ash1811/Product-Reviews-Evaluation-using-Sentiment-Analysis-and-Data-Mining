I've been wearing KEENs for quite a few years now and wanted a new color. My old ones that are still going strong are the Navy/Black ones and these new Bluestone/Grey combo provides for a lighter shade of that doesn't clash with the wardrobe. These KEENs are the same good quality of my old ones and fit just as expected. You cannot go wrong with this shoe model.
