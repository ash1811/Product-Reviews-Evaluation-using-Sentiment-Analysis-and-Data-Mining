These sandals are great! Getting used to the feeling of the massaging pegs took me no more than 5 minutes, but walkig on them was never a problem, funny sensation at first, like somebody tickling your soles. I read the reviews about using socks first, but I had no need of that. Your soles stay kind of sensitive for some days, even when using other shoes, but nothing near to pain, and you soon get over it. I must point out that the upper strap is fabulous! Very soft on your feet, I have a slighty prominent side bone in one of my toes and hard textures really make my life miserable. These sandals feel as if you had nothing on your feet... or perhaps being aware of the sensation in your soles makes you ignore everything else! ha ha  just kidding!  My feet are wide and the size I got -7 W- was just perfect!
