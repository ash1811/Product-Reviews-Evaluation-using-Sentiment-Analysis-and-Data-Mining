Fits too large for me. I should have got a medium which would probably fit close to perfect. The quality of the shirt is good for the price paid. It can loose it's softness after only a few washes. I would suggest a lower temperature setting when you're washing the shirt. It has a pretty big tag on the inside of the shirt which can be annoying at times. I will use this as a night time shirt for when I go to bed. Overall it's okay, but don't expect too much from it.
