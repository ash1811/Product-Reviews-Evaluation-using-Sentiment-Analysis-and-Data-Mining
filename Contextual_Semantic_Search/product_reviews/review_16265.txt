This is a great product! The strap is long, but since my husband and I both use it, it was no problem to wrap the extra length. Great place to keep passport and spare money on your travels. Did not find it uncomfortable at all. Was no problem wearing under my clothes. When it ever wears out, I will purchase the same!!
