good thing I bought three in different colors. my husband hasn't worn any other shirts since these came! they are well made and the fabric is nice and soft. and they are tagless which is a big selling point for me. the sizing is true and the arm holes are roomy so no pinching in the armpits. I would recommend Hanes sweatshirts to anyone looking for comfort and quality workmanship.
