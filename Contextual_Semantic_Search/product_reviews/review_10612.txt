I purchased 2 of these watches, this one with the gold face and also the one with the red face. I have the same concern with both watches that pertain to the band. The tiny 'arm' that inserts into the holes appears to be very fragile, like a thin piece of plastic instead of metal. The watch itself is great. I like the size, design, and terrific color of both watches, but again, if the tiny 'arm' in the band snaps I doubt if a replacement band can be easily found.
