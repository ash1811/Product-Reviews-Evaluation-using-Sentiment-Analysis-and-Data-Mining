This is an attractive necklace at 36&#34; for $25. It goes with any outfit and any occasion. If it was offered at a discount when I bought it a year ago, I think I would've bought more to create a multi-strand look with my outfits. Overall, the necklace was okay but the pricing could've been cheaper. Definitely, 3 stars.
