When I was at the Champion outlet, I had the opportunity to try on this bra in medium support and the maximum support version, The two are sized differently and I found the medium support to be much softer and more comfortable. I wear this bra for tennis and it works well for a girl my size although others may want more support. I like that the straps are smooth and don''t dig into my shoulders.  I like that it doesn't spread out my breasts to my underarms or look like a &#34;boob loaf&#34;! The double dry material is also great. I am now wearing these bras under my scrubs at work and I stay cool and comfortable.
