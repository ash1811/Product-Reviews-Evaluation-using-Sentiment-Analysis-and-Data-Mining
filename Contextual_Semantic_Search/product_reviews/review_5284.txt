As others have said, the sizing of these is remarkably inconsistent.  I bought two pairs (in different colors) and each fit differently and ran small.  The waist wasn't tight at all, but the legs/thighs were and thoroughly diminished the possibility of actually using any of the pockets and cargo pockets.In addition to small and inconsistent sizing, the pants just do not seem well made at all.  I've seen similar generic/no-name cargo pants sitting on the racks of places like Ross, Marshall's, etc., for far less that were made far better than these.  The fabric is thin and the "vintage" aspect is simply another way of telling you that these have been washed with pumice stone (I found a couple in the pockets of the ones I received), which only add to the general feeling of how low-quality the fabric is.  If it was low-quality to begin with, in this case, washing it with pumice stones does nothing to help it and only showcases how low-quality and non-durable the pant is.Returned mine.
