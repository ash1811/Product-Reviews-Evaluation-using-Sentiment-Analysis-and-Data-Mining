I bought these after reading the reviews and found them to be no better than the cheap Hanes socks I got at Walmart.  I used to buy the White Stag socks at Walmart and they were WONDERFUL!  Unfortunately, they aren't making them any more.  I'm still looking for socks that were as comfortable as they were.  THESE are NOT worth the money.  I'll keep looking!
