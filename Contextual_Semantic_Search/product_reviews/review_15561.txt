I got these slippers to wear at my daughter's wedding reception.  I broke my little toe the week before and knew I'd never be able to keep shoes on the entire night.  I couldn't find anything to match my dress, so opted for the white.  They're very pretty and comfortable.  I'm now using them as my everyday slippers.
