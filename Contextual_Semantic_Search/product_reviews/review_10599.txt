Comfortable, size is true and I have been wearing them almost every day to work with slacks or jeans.  I was afraid at first they would look 'fuddy duddy' but they look great.  Love a great leather shoe... classic style and well made.  My mom saw them and wanted a pair too.  They are not fancy shoes and no one will say &#34;oh how cute&#34; but if you are walking around the office all day and you want comfort, these shoes are perfect.
