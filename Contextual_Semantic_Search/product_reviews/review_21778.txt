I bought this bag to carry my Microsoft Surface RT.  The Surface (with touch cover) fits perfectly, with room for a medium-sized book and some paperwork.  The outer pockets are small, but large enough to hold a power adapters, a set of ear-buds and a small mouse or other small peripheral.  The outer pockets seal with Velcro flaps and are pretty secure.  The large pocket has a buckle that's not as secure as I would like, but not bad.  It has never opened unexpectedly on me, but seems like it might and I check it regularly.Note that this bag has NO PADDING of any kind to protect electronics, so weigh that factor when considering it.  I took a pad out of another computer bag and put it in the bottom of this bag, just in case I get careless with setting it down on a hard surface.  I'm satisfied with that, but again, factor this in carefully if you plan on carrying electronics of any kind.
