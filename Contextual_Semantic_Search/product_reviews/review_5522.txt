I bought these Cargo Pants for my hubby.  He need something with a real pocket to hold his RFID blocking aluminium wallet because it had a habit of slipping out of his regular pant's pocket when he sat down.  Well, these Dickies Cargo Pants sure do the trick!  They came well-packaged in a shipping bag, protecting the package from the weather.  They arrived on time and I received a nice follow up e-mail from Mike, the owner of Elite Hero, the company providing the product for Amazon, making sure everything was up to my expectations and if not, what could he do to fix it.  Great service, nice touch in an all too impersonal world.  Thanks, Mike.  And, thanks Amazon for helping to bring us good companies, like Elite Hero, to do business with on an easy-to-use platform.  Makes my shopping experience a whole lot easier!
