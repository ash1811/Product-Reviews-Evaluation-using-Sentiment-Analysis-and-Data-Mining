I live in Japan and have trouble getting clothes my size. I teach small kids and do a lot of close action with them.  Jeans are great for this and these Jeans fit like, well, Wranglers. I don't know why, but Wranglers have always fit me better.  I couldn't get them shipped directly to Japan (I don't know why...) so they were reshipped from a forwarding company. New jeans are usually stiff, but these are soft on the kids bare legs. They're even soft on MY bare legs.  They arrived here before the scheduled US delivery date. I like that a lot. It's my policy to NOT give perfect scores, but I'd be forced to give these 4.5 Stars.
