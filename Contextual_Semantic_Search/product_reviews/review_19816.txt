I got these 5 days ago and I have been wearing them non-stop. I guess I didn't read the sizing correctly, as I got a medium and I wear a size 8.5 shoe.  Medium = 6.5-7.5 in these slippers, but they still fit me.  SO comfortable and not bulky like most slippers are. Definately buy these! :)  They are a great price!
