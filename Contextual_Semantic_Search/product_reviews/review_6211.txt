I had a pair of shoes like these that I wore until they nearly fell apart. They were so very comfortable, and worked well with different types of outfits, including shorts and capris. The only problem, (which other people have mentioned), is that they do tend to run narrow, so I would suggest buying them a width wider than you normally do.For a relatively inexpensive shoe, I think that they are a great value.Addendum: I now have three pairs of these shoes, in different colors. Except for the times that I need to wear sneakers, I find that I am wearing a pair of the sandals, to the exclusion of all my other shoes.Update: I now have four pairs of these shoes. No matter what I am wearing, I seem to always go back to one of these "Mimosas".
