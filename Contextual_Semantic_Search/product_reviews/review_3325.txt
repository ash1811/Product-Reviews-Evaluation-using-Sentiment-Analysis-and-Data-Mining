I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS AN ALL TIME GREAT BRA.  BEING A SMALL WOMAN..:) BUT DD'S, I REALLY HAVE A HARD TIME WITH BRA FITTING.  I HAVE RECENTLY DAMAGED A NERVE IN MY BACK, SLOW TO HEAL, AND BRAS DON'T MAKE IT ANY EASIER, BUT, THEN AGAIN, I CAN'T GO BRALLESS SAD TO SAY I WOULD RATHER.....I STARTED WEARING THIS BRA AGAIN, BECAUSE OF THE COMFORT AND SUPPORT, IT TAKES THE STRAIN OFF MY NERVE DAMAGE IN MY BACK.  IT DOESN'T GIVE A ROUND SHAPE THAT I PREFER, BUT, I WILL LIVE WITH THE (DORIS DAY) LOOK AS LONG AS I NEED TO BE COMFIE, AND SUPPORTED.THIS IS A REALLY NICE GARMENT, I TRIED WACOAL AGAIN, WENT TO BE FITTED, JUST O.K., THEY DON'T REALLY IMPRESS ME.....TOO PRICEY, AND I TURN OVER MY BRAS EVERY 6 MONTHS, WEAR THEM INTO THE GROUND SO TO SPEAK.  DON'T WE ALL, SO, $60.00 TO ME IS A BIG WASTE OF MONEY, I LIKE TO OWN AT LEAST 3 MAYBE  4 OF THE BRAS THAT ARE GOOD FOR MY BACK AND SUPPORT ME.  I ALSO LOVE A GOOD SPORTS BRA, BASIC......I ALSO LIKE THE BALI MINIMIZER, LILYETTE MAKES A WONDERFUL MINIMIZER FOR TIGHT T'S., BALI'S PASSION FOR COMFORT IS GREAT, BUT, SAD TO SAY, SINCE I HURT MY BACK THAT ISN'T WORKING OUT TO WELL...GOOD LUCK LADIESTHANKS.....
