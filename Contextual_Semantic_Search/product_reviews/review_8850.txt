I'm very pleased with this night gown (I just got it and I slept in it last night). It's pretty and flattering. It's also long enough for me (I'm 5'5&#34; and it hits just below my ankles). It has a very pretty bodice....I will likely buy more...(Perhaps the gathering of the skirt is a little full and would be more flattering with less gathering & material - but this is a minor issue.)
