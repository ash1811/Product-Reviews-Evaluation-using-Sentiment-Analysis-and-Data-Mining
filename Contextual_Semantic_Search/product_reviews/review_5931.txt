I have bought 3 or 4 different colors in the shorts and the Paratrooper pants by Rothco and all of them are made extremely well.  Great stitching and super soft/comfortable material.  I believe they are stone washed and man that made these things very nice to the touch.  But they are very durable!Check out a pair in your favorite color and I bet like me you will buy more of them.
