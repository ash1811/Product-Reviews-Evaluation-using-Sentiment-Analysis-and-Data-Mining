Now that I have washed them several times I can comment that these jeans are so well made, sturdy and well worth the money. I've probably washed them four times on &#34;heavy&#34; since my husband is a contractor and sure gets the jeans dirty. But the Levis still look brand new! Of course, I would recommend steam ironing them (with the crease) right away. This seems to set in the color and the crease then you never have to iron them again!
