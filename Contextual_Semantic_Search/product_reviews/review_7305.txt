We had this shoe last year for my my daughter's first ballet class, and it was perfect.  This year we ordered her size and they were too big, so we went down a half-size.  She thinks that they gap at the sides too much, but I did not want to go through another return.  We had the &#34;M&#34;, but maybe the &#34;N&#34; would be better.
