Ordered this to open my husband's sports watch because it had the indents in the back that had to be turned.  He followed the directions and opened it easily with no problem.  Saved taking it to a jeweler to change the battery.  Would highly recommend for all waterproof watches that have that case that does not pop off with a knife.
