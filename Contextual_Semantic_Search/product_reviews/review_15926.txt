I use to wear Thorlos (when they were a bit cheaper) but somehow forgot about them. Now years later, with foot and knee problems, I've rediscovered Thorlo Cushioned Crew Walking Socks....and am VERY happy!! I have to wear special walking sneakers and with the Thorlo Walking Crew, they make a perfect team for my feet. Comfy, stretchy, soft, cushioned socks- what more could your feet want to wear before they go into shoes or sneakers???!!! Make sure you read the cardboard package re: washing/drying instructions to help extend the life of your Thorlos. Also as Thorlo says, make sure your wearing the right sock in the right kind of shoe to ensure the proper fit. I've thrown away all my other crew socks and now own 7 pairs of Thorlo Walking Socks. My feet are finally happy feet!!
