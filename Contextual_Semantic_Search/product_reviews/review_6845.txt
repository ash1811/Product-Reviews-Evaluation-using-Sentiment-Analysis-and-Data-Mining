These socks are thick, good quality and held up fine in the wash.  I bought them partially because I had heard that Gold Toe was an American manufacturer.  This is no longer the case.  That being said, I'm very pleased with the product.  I'm surprised that other reviews are reporting that the socks are too small.  I don't find that at all and I am a healthy weight.  These are not sized like diabetic socks - which tend to be extremely wide and very, very soft and stretchy.  I was looking for everyday wear, not diabetic, so that wasn't a problem for me.  I wear a 7/7.5 B, which is the most common shoe size for American women and if anything, the socks were just a little big.  I would buy this product again.
