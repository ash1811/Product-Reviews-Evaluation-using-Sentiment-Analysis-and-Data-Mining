These are kind of a cross between jeans and formal pants, so I love them! They are technically labelled as "pants," but people could easily mistake them for jeans. I'm actually wearing them right now, and they're quite comfortable. I would recommend this. I've been so pleased with Amazon's selection of clothing!
