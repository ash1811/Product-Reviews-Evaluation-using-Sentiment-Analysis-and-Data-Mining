I read all the reviews and was a bit stressed out over picking the right size (I usually don't buy clothes without trying them on first).  I'm size 8, medium, 5'4", 130 lbs and the medium fits perfect.  The sleeves are a little long - but that's better than too short - am I right about that - especially if you are an active person?  I really like the outer zippered pockets and the two inside (unzipped) pockets because I don't like carrying a purse if I don't have to.
