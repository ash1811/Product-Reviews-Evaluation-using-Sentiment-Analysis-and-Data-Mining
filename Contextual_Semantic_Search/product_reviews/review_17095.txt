Im very comfortable with how wearing this shirt feels. Im 175 lbs, 5'9&#34; height and 36&#34; chest, following other people's advice I ordered L size and it fits awesome! In the beginning it took me a good 10 minutes in the cold weather to start feeling comfortable, last night I ran 5 miles in a 46F weather and I tought it probably didn't work but after a while I felt alright.
