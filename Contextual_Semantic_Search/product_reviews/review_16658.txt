I was surprised at how well these shoes are made and how comfortable they are.  I was wearing them around my house because they are as comfortable as slippers, but they have a way better tread than slippers.  As I am a nurse who stands on my feet a lot, I can't wait to wear these to work.  And just as they said, you can wear these shoes bare footed and they are just as comfortable as if you were wearing socks with them.  I will definitely buy Jambu shoes again.
