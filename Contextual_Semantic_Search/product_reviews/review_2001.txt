These earrings are very well made, and they are great for people who have allergies to other gold earrings.  I have had many gold earrings that I could not wear because they irritated my ears, but I have worn these earrings several times and I have had no problems.  They have a nice shine to them, and I really like the way they look--dressy or casual.
