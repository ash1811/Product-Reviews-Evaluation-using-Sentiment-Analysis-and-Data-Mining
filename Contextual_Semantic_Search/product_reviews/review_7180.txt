I'm a size 12 or 13 shoe and I bought these because I was having trouble fitting into socks that were made for shoe sizes up to size 12.  I bought these extended size because they supposedly fit up to size 16 shoe.  I was worried they would be way too big but in fact, I would say these barely fit my feet.  I would think someone who was size 14 and up would still find these small.Other than that, the socks are fine.  They're still pretty thin... even on the 'cushioned' bottom part of the sock but I wasn't expecting a lot of cushion at this price.
