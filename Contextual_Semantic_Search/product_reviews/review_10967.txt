I highly recommend this hat. It really covers your head very well providing good protection. The rim is wider than I expected so the hat really looks bigger compared to other hats even though it is a medium size which fits snuggly on my head. Remember this fact..If you don't like very wide looking hats this is not the hat for you.However, that said, the construction, build quality and features of the hat (the ventilated mesh and the Coolmax inner band really works well in preventing sweat fromaccumulating in the band surrounding the inner part of the hat. Overall, great hat for the price.S.F.New York City
