I really don't get it! I always order the same size sweat shirts and hooded shirts from Hanes but somehow the sizes are always different. Also this batch had the label, the previous ones had no label, just the print inside. I am kind of picky how these (for me oversized) shirts fit, and unfortunately these are just BIG. Shoulders are wider, waist band is wider and they just look as if I wear something from my &#34;big brother&#34;. Hanes might have different factories and some just cut larger.
