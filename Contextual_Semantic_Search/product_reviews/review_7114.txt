Very disappointed in Gold Toe.  Even for an extended size it runs small and no different than regular after washing!!!!!!  The weight or thickness is not nearly as good as when they were made in USA years ago.  So very little choices out there for size 14 feet. The idea of shoe size and sock size being different is so ridicules.  I hope someday a manufacturer comes along and teaches Gold Toe that market share should not be determined by lack of competition but quality.  The only reason China didn't get the manufacturing taken away from Mexico is the shipping and taxes.
