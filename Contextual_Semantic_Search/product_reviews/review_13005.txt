Of the three different bras I bought, this one was my favorite. It is pretty, comfortable, and it looks good under my clothes. Wearing this bra, I feel confident and supported. I am a stay-at-home mom, and little things like lacy bras are a nice treat for me! Plus, it stays comfortable all day long.
