The shoe looks as described at Amazon.  I really wanted the 12 1/2 size but it would not have been eligible for the free shipping and two day delivery because Amazon does not stock that size but can get it from another store.  The shoe is tight but is not uncomfortable even after long periods of standing and walking around.  I think I will like this shoe unless it has traction problems on wet surfaces.  Other reviews don't seem to indicate that.
