I had no idea these were soft footbed style.  Before buying here check the official Birkenstock site to see if you will be getting the soft style.  I have foot / ankle issues and need the firmness of the original style.  The soft runs much more narrow as it has the additional padding - or - these were narrow and not marked?  I am waiting on a pair of potent purple to arrive.  These have already been returned.  The length seemed to me the same as the Gizeh thong style which I love.
