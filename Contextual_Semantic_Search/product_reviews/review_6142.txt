I ordered the pink suede shoe...ShoeMagoo via Amazon....BIG MISTAKE.  The fake Bandolino arrived in a brown box,..not the Bandolino shoe box I usually get....the shoe is faded pink.almost like dirty cotton candy. Then I'm comparing the shoe to another shoe I have (same style different color) shoe is visible short, uneven, faded and the peep toe is uneven.This clearly was a fake Bandolino shoe from Shoe Magoo. Shoe Magoo has a note in the box that tells you never contact Amazon for order issues contact Shoe Magoo...umm no that was a red flag right there. Needless to say the fake filthy shoe that had been glued together with school childrens glue was returned. I contacted Amazon and they apologized for the sellers poor quality.
