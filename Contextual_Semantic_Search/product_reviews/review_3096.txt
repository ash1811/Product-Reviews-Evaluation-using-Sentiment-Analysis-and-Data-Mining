This is my favorite sweater these days. The simple gray color goes with everything. I dress it up by throwing a scarf over the top, but it also has a pretty design down the front as well. If you have specific questions (length of sleeves, style of buttons, etc.) feel free to contact me through my website.Here's the scarf I bought to go with it:LibbySue-Tone on Tone Small Triangle Shape Shawl Scarf with Lace Fringe
