I bought the Dopp to replace a Columbia wallet that was coming apart after several years of use. I'd changed to a front pocket style wallet to minimize back pains etc caused by sitting on a lump. The Columbia accomplished that but in jeans sometimes seemed a little big in the front pocket. This Dopp is about the smallest slimmest wallet I can imagine. It is well made with quality leather and stitching. But before buying read the description carefully to be sure you can fit in all the cards and cash you routinely carry. With slots and pockets you can carry 6-7 seven credit/store loyalty cards--beyond that they are so tight they difficult to remove. The opening for bills requires you to fold them in half so if the cashier gives you back a wad of smaller bills it will be a tight fit. The ID window is nice. But if you, like me, carry a minimal number of cards and little cash, you will appreciate this trim wallet that easily fits in a front pocket of even tighter fitting pants. In fact you could carry it in a chest pocket of a shirt.
