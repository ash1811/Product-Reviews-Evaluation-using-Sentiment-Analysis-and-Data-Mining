I bought this socks for my morning walks - I usually go for ~2.5mi walk in the morning- and they were just ok. They do add some extra cushioning during the walk and keep my feet dry but because they are thick, make my shoes feel tight. I like the protection I get for my skin but not sure it's worth it... might be better for colder days...
