These pants are tried and true. With the double knee you get more room to work with. Most of these pants are made for guys without a full figure (big thighs). I find them nice and room in the legs. They wear evenly after awhile I've notice I just need to replace once a year at most. They are worn 260 days out the year while only showing wear in between my legs due to rubbing.
