Ordered this, my umpteenth Healthy Back Bag, as a tiny accessory to hold my stuff when we go out to dinner. It's the perfect size, unobtrusive, tastefully black, works with anything I wear. Neither too little, and definitely not big. Holds my Blackberry, a notepad, pen, my sunglasses/change of glasses, and a sundry thing or 2.Love it.
