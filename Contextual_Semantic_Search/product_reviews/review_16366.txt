I have worn Bali bras for years and just love them. However Style 3372, called a "Gel Spa Closure" is similar to the style I have always used....BUT: the edge seal of the "Gel Spa Closure" is welded (rather than sewn with tread) and is razor sharp. It actually grazed my finger as I tried to secure the hooks, and it was very uncomfortable to wear. The sharp edges irritated my back.  (Amazon instructions allow returns only for unopened products.  As I really had to take it out of the package to discover how uncomfortable it is...so I'm stuck with it. Thank heaven I paid an Amazon price!!)  Other than the 3372 product,  I'd recommend Bali products.... I've been buying Bali products for 26 years and this is my first complaint.
