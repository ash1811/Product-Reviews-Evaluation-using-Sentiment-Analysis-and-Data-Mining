I use this while snowblowing in Alaska. Nice and toasty inside, wearing pants and a T-Shirt. Impermeable to wind and snow. Tough.Sizing is tricky, I used other's reviews to guess my size (sizing charts are all over the place and even Carharrt's website is not that helpful).I am 6ft tall and 160lbs.  36 Regular fits absolutely perfectly.
