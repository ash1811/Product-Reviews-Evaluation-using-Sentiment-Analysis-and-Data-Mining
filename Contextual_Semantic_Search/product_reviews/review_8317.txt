I bought this watch for my father. He has small wrist and this watch's size is just perfect for him. He saw my automatic Seiko and wanted one, but did not want to deal with resetting the time, which happen often if you don't wear it for a couple of days. I searched everywhere, and only Invicta makes one that looks like it.I can't believe it when I opened the box. The watch is gorgeous and the band of very high quality. No wonder about all the raves of people who own this watch. You woud never think the watch costs under $100. I am now considering buying one for myself! I am extremely happy with this purchase.
