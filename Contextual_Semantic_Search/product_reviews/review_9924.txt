I bought five of these tank tops for my son the beginning of summer and he loves them. He's a tall guy, 6 ft., and really appreciates the extra length as he tucks them into his jeans and that's actually where they stay when he bends over. The quality seems good, especially for the price, and they wash well without shrinking. Even if they would only last one season, they would be well worth the money. But after washing and wearing them as often as he has already, we have a feeling they will last a lot longer! More colors would be nice!
