I purchased these for my daughter's hip hop dance competition routine. Pricey but very good quality. All white. These are stated in men's sizes so be sure to convert to women's. For example, men's 3 is women's 5. There is a chart listed either by seller or on Converse website for reference. These worked out well and hopefully get to use next year for the competition routine so we can get return on our investment. $70!
