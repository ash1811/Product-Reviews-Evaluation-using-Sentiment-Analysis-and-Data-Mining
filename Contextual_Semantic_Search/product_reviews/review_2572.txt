Very silky, fits well and is attractive.  The knit is light but strong and I will enjoy wearing it.  I am 5'9&#34; and the large fits well with plenty of length in the body and sleeves. I usually wear a medium but I didn't wnt to have to struggle into the pants and shirt so I bought larger and they are close fitting without being tight. I like the extra length on my long arms.
