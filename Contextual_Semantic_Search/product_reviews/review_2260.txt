I love my 501's.... isn't that how the saying goes?These have to be the best fitting, most comfortable jeans ever made....I've tried several brands of jeans ~ from CK to no name brands.... and nothing wears like a pair of LEVI jeans.  Within the levi jean line, I've tried different styles from the 550, 517, 505, and 501.... and the 501 are the ticket!Well made, and great fitting on the "average" body....
