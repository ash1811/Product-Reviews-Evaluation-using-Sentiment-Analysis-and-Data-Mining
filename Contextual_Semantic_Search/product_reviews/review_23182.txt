This shoe was very cute and seemed to be super comfortable but I ordered 2 or 3 sizes too big. I'm not sure what happened. I thought I read the sizing right but maybe not.  I even let a friend try them on that has a bigger foot than me and she couldn't wear either.  Again this may have been my fault so double check the size before you order. With all that said I do think that I'll be ordering another pair because they did seem to be very comfortable and they looked great. The size just needs to be perfect for these shoe to fit right.
