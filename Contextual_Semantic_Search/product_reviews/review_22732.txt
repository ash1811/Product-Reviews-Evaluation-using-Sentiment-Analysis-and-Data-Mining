I got these for my toddler to wear with his snow boots. I got the XS and they fit my 18 month old with just a little room to grow and he normally wears a size 6 toddler shoe. I am very pleased with the quality and fast shipping. I wish I had bought another pair, I'm sure we will misplace at least one of these socks before we even get any snow.
