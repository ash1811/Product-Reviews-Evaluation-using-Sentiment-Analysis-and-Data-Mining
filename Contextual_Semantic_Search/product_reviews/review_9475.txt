I love these and they are my 3rd pair. This 3rd one seems to fit a little snug across the top, but I do have abnormally large feet for a size 14.  I have a 5E foot and they fit well in the width. They are very soft and cushiony. My original pair, I wore out the microsuede completely, and the others I covered in paint. I have this new pair and I would always hope I could get these. I go out for walks in these and my feet don't hurt afterwards. The footbed provides excellent support on my big feet. I would recommend for anyone to try that likes soft to the touch and solid support flip flops. They aren't so great for the beach because the sand breaks down the suede and if the suede gets wet, it leaves a less than desired dry time.
