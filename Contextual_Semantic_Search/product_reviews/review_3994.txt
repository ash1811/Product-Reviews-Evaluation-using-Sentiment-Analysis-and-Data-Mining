I bought a pair of 527 Levi's at 42x30 and I'm losing weight and wanted a tighter pair so I bought these in 40x29. They are still a bit snug, but that's what i expected and should be able to wear them soon. I usually wear 30 or 32 length, but I knew from the 527s that these are cut long, so the 29 is about right. They are softer than expected and look good!
