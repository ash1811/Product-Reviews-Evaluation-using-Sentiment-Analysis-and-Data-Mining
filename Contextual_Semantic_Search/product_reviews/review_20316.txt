I do not expect a cotton turtleneck to retain its color for many washings but I do expect better than the one washing and faded new turtleneck which is what I got with these Port Authority shirts. With Landsend it takes 20 or more washings to get the fade I saw after one cold water washing of this shirt. Landsend is out of stock until July so I took a chance on this shirt in navy and it turned out to be a mistake.
