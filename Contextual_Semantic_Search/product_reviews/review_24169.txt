These shoes didn't cost much, and there's reason: they're not worth much. I'm not saying they're bad, just Ok.These are the kind of leather shoes that always manage to look like vinyl (they're supposed to be leather); that don't quite ever break in properly; that grip, but not enough; that fit, but a bit clumsily; that aren't hot, just not comfortable. And The support is just all wrong. A six inch boot is problamatic to start with, so the collar (at the ankle) has to be made well: These are too wide, as is the last hieght inside the shoe, from the top of the toe to the top of the toe box, to the arch; just too roomy in all the wrong places, and my feet are dead average. I wear them, they look fine, but if I dont lace the last two lugs (from the arch to the ankle) outside, the collar will eat my ankles alive. In the end, I'm afraid they look and feel cheap.
