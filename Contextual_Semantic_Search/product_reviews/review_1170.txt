I'm a reformed chubster so I'm still packing flab galore. I bought this to wear with a semi-fitted dress and shrug. Not exactly revealing, but I felt I needed the protection. Looked fine and liked the way this felt. It was not confining or uncomfortable. Did a good job and I felt confident.Yesterday it was frigid so I decided to use this as an extra layer under my jeggings that are fitted. I wasn't thinking in regard to hiding anything. I just wanted to stay warm. Anyway, when I put the jeggings on I thought they seemed baggy or loose. They've always felt fitted. When I met my friend for lunch she asked me if I was still losing weight because my pants were loose fitting. Ditto for my husband.Spanx work, but darn if I can explain it. They go on easily. While they are fitted to conform to the body they don't feel tight. They are comfortable enough that I forget I'm wearing them.I ordered a medium and since I normally wear an 8 or 10 they are true to size. I have friends who wear plus sizes and tell me the size they wear are consistent with the garment sizes they normally wear.I either hand wash or wash on a gentle cycle using Woolite and air dry. Just went out and bought two more pairs in tan and black. Can't put a price tag on confidence.
