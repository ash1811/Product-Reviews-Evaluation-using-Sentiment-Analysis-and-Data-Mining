Great glasses.  Fit perfectly.  I'm a pretty large headed guy and the 55mm's fit perfectly.  They are authentic &#34;Made in Italy&#34; units with the RB watermark on the lens.  I thought they might be a little &#34;too lightly tinted&#34; for sunglasses, but I live in San Diego and they are GREAT sunglasses.  Super happy with them!
