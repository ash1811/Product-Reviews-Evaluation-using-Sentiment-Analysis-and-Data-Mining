I bought 2 pairs of dark blue 511s at Kohls.  They were on sale and with a 30% discount coupon they cost me thirty-one dollars each.When I lost weight, I bought new 505s but they were quite baggy (even though the 505s are now cut tighter than they used to be).Then I bought 514s and while they're cut way smaller, they still get a bit baggy after wearing them for awhile.My wife is complaining that there's too much fabric around my butt so back to Kohls.I try on the 511s and they're too tight around the waist even though they're also 30" waist.  I have to get a pair 1" wider around the waist.What I don't like about the jeans is that they're designed to be too long.  Check out Levi's photographs -- the jeans are bunching around the shoes.  Hey, if I was 16 years old, that would be way so cool.  But I ain't that young and it looks stupid and sloppy on me.  I sometimes wear jeans with dress loafers and sometimes with a sports coat. I'll bring them to a tailor and alter the length.I wear the 505s around the house since they're roomier but I look 20 pounds heavier. Ever anxious to keep wiffy happy, I change to better cut jeans when I leave the house.The material is very, very thick and stiff.  I found the material uncomfortable so I turned them inside out and ironed them to remove the wrinkles that chaffed my skin.The Levi jeans I bought are made in Mexico and have the Levi's logo on the inside pockets.  My wife also had great success with her Levi jeans that were made in Mexico.Because of the variations between all of the models, you really have to try them on in a store.  And even with the same model number, there are major style differences.  Some are stone-washed, some fabrics are very thick, others thin.  Try before you buy.
