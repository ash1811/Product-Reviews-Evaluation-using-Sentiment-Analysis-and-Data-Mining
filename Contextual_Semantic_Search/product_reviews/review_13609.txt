These slippers feel great. They are so soft and warm. I ordered the size 8-9 since I am usually a 9. I was pretty sure 9-10 would simply be too big. I don't remember if 8.5-9 wasn't an option or simply not available, they would probably have fit better. I just wish the sole would be a big softer. It's stiff and quite loud on non-carpeted floors.
