We live in a place where we often have a foot of snow on the ground for 4-5 months of the year.The good:Very sturdy and easy to install. The metal seems substantial enough to last.Cleans the gunk off boots and should easily keep the amount of snow off of our waterhog carpet at our back entry door.The bad:Rusts easily. I suspected this thing rusted rather easily looking at other peoples scrushers. I thought that I would add an extra coat of Rustoleum at the beginning of the this season to prevent it from rusting as easily. However.....When I removed the brushes it was already rusting in various spots before my new scrusher has even seen outside duty. This is not ideal and makes me feel like it is lower quality than I had anticipated.Normally, I expect that metal will potentially rust over a winter in the snow belt. The environment isn't very kind to metal things in our neck of the woods so I already do yearly rustoleum duty to slow the damage down on various metal objects I have. But,I don't expect a new item to be rusting in a few spots right when I buy it.I wish things could be made the way I imagined they were 20 years or so ago, when I was younger. It seems like powder coating should be more substantial and complete. Perhaps it is a sign of our age, but I yearn for better quality and longevity.These days, it seems that in order to give things longevity, I have to do a lot of prevention and maintenance myself. Not a big problem since I am used to it to a degree, but I hope for more.
