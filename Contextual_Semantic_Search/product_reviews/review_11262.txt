After the new budget backpack I bought for my teenager broke the third week of school, I bought this.  I love JanSport. I bought one in 1993 when I was in college and my younger kids still use it to haul their stuff around. The thing is indestructible.I got it in black because I was going to surprise my son and I didn't know which colors/patterns he'd be okay with carrying. The mistake I made is that everyone in his school has the exact same black backpack.  You may want to consider another color to make it easier.Overall he loves it. He can fit all of his books in it. He hasn't complained about anything on the backpack. Maybe in 20 years he will still be using it for something.Gotta love JanSport!!!
