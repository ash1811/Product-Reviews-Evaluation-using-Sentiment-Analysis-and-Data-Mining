I'm a tom-boyish, horse-riding woman who, though I have adequate curves in all the proper places, prefers men's jeans.  I checked a number of name-brand sites and came up empty for 29" waist, skinny-leg jeans...  "youth" tends to stop at 27", men's start at 30".  Amazon.com came through for me with a pair of Levi's, and at a sale price.  They fit great; I'm delighted.
