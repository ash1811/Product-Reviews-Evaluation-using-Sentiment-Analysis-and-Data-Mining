I decided to try these slides because Amazon stopped carrying the Calissage style that I have worn for years. They are terribly uncomfortable. The little prongs or spikes (or whatever you call them) on the sole dig into your feet. They also break off and I wound up finding them all over the house. I threw them in the trash and bought 2 pairs of the Calissage from Adidas directly.
