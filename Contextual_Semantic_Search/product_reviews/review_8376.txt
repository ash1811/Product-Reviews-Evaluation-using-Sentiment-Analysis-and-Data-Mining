I didn't realize I couldn't adjust the straps, that's my fault. I'm a DD but my breast are kind of high (not dropping just yet) so it feels like I don't have a bra on, and not in a good way. I bought a 36DD and I don't feel like I have any support, there is no way I could do any type  of &#34;sport&#34; in this bra. I'm giving 3 stars only because it may have worked if I had ordered a smaller cup size....But that's not my fault.
