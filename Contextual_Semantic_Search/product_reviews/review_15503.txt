When I had my daughter 3 years ago I LOVED Spa Silk onesies because they were so soft and high quality.  It seems that Spa Silk's level of quality has gone down a bit.  They are still nice and soft, but I ordered 2 packs and found loose threads on both.  I am hoping they won't unravel after being worn more.
