I am a solid 32DDD. I've been measured and that is the size of bra I wear in brands across the board. This bra has this weird extra nipple room that I did not need. I'd probably be able to fit a tablespoon in there and fill lit perfectly. It isn't that the cup is too big, it's only this extra nipple space. The bra is also scratchy. I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and wash it a few times before I go to put it on again. I cannot wear it with t shirts or thin dresses because of this extra nipple room, and because it does create sort of a torpedo effect. I wouldn't compare it to the torpedo boobs you'd see on Marilyn Monroe and the likes, but it definitely does give a point to the breasts. I will only be able to wear this bra with clothing that is thicker, like sweaters, or dresses that are double layered or have thick material. I also ordered Wacoal La Femme Contour Bra. This bra is AMAZING. The Bali Bra in my size has 4 hooks and very large straps also, the cups go very high on the breast, covering almost the entire breast, making it illogical to wear with anything that shows even a little chest (not breast) because the bra is visible. The Wacoal bra is unbelievably comfortable and only a tad bit more in price.
