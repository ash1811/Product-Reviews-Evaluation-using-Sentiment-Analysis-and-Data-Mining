This is a beautiful nightgown.  The fabric is a nice weight, and not at all see-through.  I usually order nightgowns one size larger, so I have room to move when I sleep, but this nightgown is very roomy.  I had ordered one size larger than normal, but had to return the gown, and get my normal size.
