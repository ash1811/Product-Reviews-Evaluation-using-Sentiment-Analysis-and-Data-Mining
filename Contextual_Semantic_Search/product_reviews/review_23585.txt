One word: super-comfortable! I was desperate for sneakers to ease my usual 4-5 mile daily walks. I purchased these sneakers (Amazon Vine membership played no role) based on 2 factors: my previous positive experiences with Easy Spirit shoes; and, the strength of the uniformly 5-star reviews here and elsewhere. No break-in period required. No lie-- the day these arrived, I put them on, strapped on myGarmin Forerunner 310XT Waterproof Running GPS With USB ANT Stick and Heart Rate Monitor, dropped my iPhone into my waist bag, hung myLG Tone - HBS-700 Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orangearound my neck, then eased through the door. ** 7 ** miles later, I was back home. Folks, that's a first, as I had never before cracked beyond 5 miles in one clip. Probably would have kept going, if I hadn't exhausted my water supply. The following day, 8 miles. Nuff said. (FYI: mid-50s;  flat arches & mild over-pronation. Terrific support.)There was one little irritant. The section of the foot, directly under the shoe-tie area, gave me a very mild throbbing sensation one day. I tend to tie my shoes very tightly. That problem was completely resolved withLock Laces.(Aside: Why the 310xt AND iPhone? Because I finally realized that iPhone (& Droid) apps grossly exaggerate calorie burn. The 310xt calculates calories expended by heart rate, yielding a more accurate picture. Hey, this now-former couch potato, & admitted geek, needs/wants truly viable data, so I can track genuine progress.)
