As another reviewer mentioned, it's hard to find an XS girdle/shaper and this one certainly does the job of taking away a couple inches off my waist to look great in wedding dress. However all of the cinching is at the waist and perhaps not enough in the hip area which gives you an almost unnatural silhouette: tiny waist, big hips, flattened top of butt - my torso and hips feel a bit like 2 sausage links separated at the waist but on the good side it gives you a very 50s  bombshell figure under the RIGHT type of clothes. I don't recommend wearing it under fitted or slinky clothing, for me that looks a little bizarre and you can clearly see the hooks. But it is perfect under layered clothing, much like a wedding dress!
