With so many women complaining about the same thing, I wish Playtex would listen.  I have worn the same bra for over 20 years but having had back surgery, the scratchiness of the closure makes it impossible for me to keep this bra on for any length of time.It has the right amount of fiberfill and the shape of the cups gives you a nice shape - not looking like a cows udders.  I am only a C cup but other brands make me look like a DD.  This is a nice contour.  That is why I continued to purchase it.Also, wish it came in more colors.  Even the taupe is hard to find.  Gives us some other choices to look pretty with nice colors, or even black to go under things that might be a little show through.If you can get past the back clasp, you have a great bra.
