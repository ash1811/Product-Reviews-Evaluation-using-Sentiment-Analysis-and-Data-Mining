I previously purchased this identical shoe in a different color (brown).  I was a very durable and well fiting shoe.  Although they are supposed to be the exact same shoe, the black one fits a bit higher at the top of the back of the ankle and rubs a bit while wlaking. It is irritating to walk a long distance.  I've worn them several times and I am still waiting (hoping) for them to break in.  I think these shoes may be made by different suppliers, in different countries.
