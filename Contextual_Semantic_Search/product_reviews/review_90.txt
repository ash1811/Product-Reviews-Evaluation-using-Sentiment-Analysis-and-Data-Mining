There's nothing special here, but this is what I expected.  It's very light weight, and I suspect it wouldn't hold up to much abuse, but hard to beat the price.  My only real complaint is that the zipper pockets are only barely big enough for my passport, so it takes more concentration than I'd prefer to use them for passport storage.
