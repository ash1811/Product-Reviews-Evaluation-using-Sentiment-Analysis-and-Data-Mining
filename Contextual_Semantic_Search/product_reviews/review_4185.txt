This is a very nice bra and provides great support, but the shape does not work for my body. I have wide rooted breasts that start at my underarms. Therefore i need wide underwires so that i dont get stabbed in the armpit and have awful sideboob. This would work for someone with less body fat, or breasts with narrower roots than mine. I had to go with Elomi and Goddess brand as those are shaped better for plus size women.
