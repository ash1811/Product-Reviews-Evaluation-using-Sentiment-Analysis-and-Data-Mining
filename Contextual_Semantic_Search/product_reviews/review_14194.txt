Dock-Siders are a must for every man's wardrobe.  They are versatile enough to go from the boat launch to lunch to the beach.  I find myself using these more and more for casual outings morning, day or night.  They are my go to shoe when running errands and look great with jeans, khakis or shorts.  The are comfortable with or without socks and durable enough to standup to the elements.The one thing I find lacking in the shoe is its cushion.  I find I need to use inserts (I use a pair pf Lynco insets with all of my shoes - so it could just be me), without them the shoe is too hard on my feet and knees.As I mentioned this is an essential style element for all wardrobe, this particular pair were a gift for my Father-in-Law, whereas the pair I use are a lighter color and show a bit more wear and tear.Clearly these shoes are not a replacement for dress shoes, but they are a classier alternative to sneakers, sandals or flip-flops - when you want to be causal but still sharp.
