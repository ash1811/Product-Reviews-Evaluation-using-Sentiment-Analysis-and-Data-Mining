I will add my raves to the masses here. This is a superb shirt. THICK cotton, wears well.  Like most thick Carhartt shirts I wear a large (and in cheaper t-shirts I wear an XL due to shrinkage).  With the "cheapening" of almost everything on stores shelves these days, it's nice to get real quality. When I wear my Carhartt, it just feels.....right.
