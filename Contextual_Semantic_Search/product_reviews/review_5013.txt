I just returned from a year-long trip that took me around the jungles and beaches of Papua New Guinea, and this product was part of my pack.  These things take the heat and humidity without a second thought and managed to keep me dry and fresh every day for an entire year.  The material wicks away sweat and keeps everything happy underneath.  They also look nice enough to show off in the bedroom.I had a friend join me in PNG for a few months, and he brought a few pairs of cotton boxer briefs.  A few days in, his swamp butt go so bad I finally loaned him two extra pairs I was saving just in case something happened to the ones I was wearing.  He was a convert by the time he left and went home and immediately bought several more pairs to wear back in the USA.  These things save lives, people.  Get a few pair for your next trip abroad.  Your junk will thank you.
