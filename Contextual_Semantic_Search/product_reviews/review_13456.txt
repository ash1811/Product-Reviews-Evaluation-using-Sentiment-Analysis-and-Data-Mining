I'm a big boy, 4x should have covered me with some room. Was so tight I couldnt even sit down. Material is very light weight, in the light I could see through the camo shorts. Probably would not have held up many washes... Very disappointed with this order! I shall continue to search for the perfect "fat guy" clothes!
