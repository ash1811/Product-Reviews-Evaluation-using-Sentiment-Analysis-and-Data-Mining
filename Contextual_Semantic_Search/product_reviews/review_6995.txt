Bought these for a 12 yr old who wears size 7 1/2 shoes.  He outgrew boys sizes and needed bigger socks.  These worked out perfectly.  They do seem way bigger than his old (boys) socks but they work well with his current tennis shoes and are even good with his dress shoes.  I bought 3 packages and will likely buy more if the washer/dryer eats any of these.
