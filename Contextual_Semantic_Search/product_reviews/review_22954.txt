The thick soles and available wide width sizes drew me to this pair of Oxfords.  While Rockport Men's Northfield Oxfords address both of these critical requirements, I find them lacking style.  The product photos are accurate but they shoes just seem more drab when they are on your feet.  In fact, they remind me of the shoes my elementary school janitor wore. That being said, I appreciate the thick soles, which are quite beneficial when navigating puddles and slush.Despite having the thick soles, the shoes are quite light.  My previous thick-soled shoes, the Kenneth Cole Building Block, had much better aesthetics and significantly heavier soles.  Unfortunately, these are no longer manufactured. Other thick soled alternatives included Lugz, Doc Martins, GBX, Timberland and a much more expensive shoe-boot by Allen Edmonds.  In most cases, the designs were over the top, making them unsuitable for business casual attire.If you seeking a little extra height or merely just want to avoid puddles, these shoes are worth a look - especially if you are seeking a plain design that represents a muted low-key style.ProsThick solesWide widthsLight overall shoe weightConsPlain drab design (not split toe or square toe)
