I would wear these everywhere all the time if I could. They are basically house shoes, but I wear them out and to work on casual days. They do not have a sole on them so the bottom is the blue suede.  I've worn them enough to wear in the bottom and I just don't wear them when its wet out. I would have gone with a moccasin with a rubber bottom but they just weren't a cute or comfortable.
