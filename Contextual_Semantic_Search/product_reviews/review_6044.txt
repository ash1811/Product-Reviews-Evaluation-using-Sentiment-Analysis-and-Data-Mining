My 90 year old mother had worn out her 20 year old shoes and was gluing them to make last because she like this style so much and could not go shopping. I caught her in the gluing process and told I would get her some new shoes. I searched on line and found the exact style. First pair was too small but the exchange was easy and the result is to her great joy.She proudly wears them to church and bingo each week :)
