I bought this, but it is too large for me. If I put anything in it, it is very visible under my shirts. I ended up buying a runner's belt with a pocket and that works much easier to strap around my upper waist. I also didn't like the idea of the string around my neck being visible. Thought of it getting caught or someone seeing it and pulling it.
