I've been searching for affordable blue diamond earrings for a couple of months. I was hesitant due to negative reviews. I'm so happy I took a chance on Katarina 1/2 ctw studs. They were well packaged so the inner gift box wasn't damaged (though I could see where the tag was removed from the bottom). Very nice inner box. I was thrilled when I opened the box! They are a lovely shade of deep (not dark/dull) blue. You do get very slight hit of green in lower light. Beautiful, true, brilliant cut, they relect the light & sparkle. Rated as I1. Under 60x magnification I can see the expected inclusions (very small!) but they are NOT naked eye noticeable. {I have a blue diamond ring with very tiny stones. Under magnification the inclusion are horrible & one even has a chunk out of the top table! They too were rated I1!} I feel the earrings I received were much nicer. They look great in my second ear pearcing, not too big, 1/4 ct each is just right for me. I do not believe I could have found a better deal or been more pleased with my purchase. If you are familiar with blue diamonds, you will be satisfied.  As for the negative reviews, I would have contacted them & gotten a replacement.  I also received an offer for liking them on facebook. I received the email for the credit the day before they arrived in the mail. Nice!  The only thing I would want would be screw post/backs. Can't have everything for the price.  I'm very happy with my purchase & would recommend them to anyone searching for affordable blue diamonds.  Love 'em!
