>>I purchased this same item from another seller on Amazon. The price may differ, but the Duro-Med product is the same.&lt;&lt;Bleh. After hunting around, I thought I had found a decent shoehorn for a good price. At a single Jefferson, it seemed too good to be true. It was.I wanted to replace a lost shoe horn with something a little nicer and this sounded like it would fit the bill. Instead, the upper handle grip came off the second day and now pulls off if tugged on too much. Some epoxy will likely fix this but still. Secondly, the spring hinged "horn" is way too flexible to be truly useful to leaver a foot into a show. It works, but I have to hold the column just above the spring, negating the benefit of the long handle. Lastly, the flimsy spring seems to be loosening and the horn part is ready to fall off. All in all, a waste of ten bucks.I suggest doing yourself a favor and getting the simple yet sturdy and effective2 Long Black Plastic Shoe Horns (18.5"). That is what I was replacing and what I am going back to.~ Kort
