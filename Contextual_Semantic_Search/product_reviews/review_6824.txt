They mean over the calf and to the base of your knee (I'm 5'11&#34; and my legs are long for my height)  so I usually roll the top down a few inches.  I love Gold-Toe socks, but next time I am going with the crew cut.Also, after a few washes, the elastic sort of slackens up a bit, and now some of the socks will droop a little when worn for a couple hours.
