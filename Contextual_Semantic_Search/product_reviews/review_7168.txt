I tend to buy Gold Toe socks whenever possible. I have always found them to be the most comfortable, well made socks available.  I recently bought a three pack of pairs of Gold Toe "No Show" men's socks at a local retailer and loved them.  So when I saw these six packs available through Amazon at an even better price I jumped all over them.These ARE NOT necessarily the same Gold Toe socks you will find at several brick and mortar retailers.  You need to check the actual product number, as apparently Gold Toe has several similar products but with distinctly different quality.  They are Gold Toe, and they look about the same, but the edge around the opening is slightly narrower than the ones I bought in the store.  No big deal I thought - so they are sewn slightly different.I have an average man's foot,  about a 10 shoe size, normal width, etc. Typically I put on socks and they fit.  I have seen other reviews where people like these socks and mention wearing a 12 or 13 size shoe, while people wearing a 9 1/2 or 10 1/2 complain about the socks....so maybe they run very large.Simply put, these are absolutely the worst fit of any sock I have ever owned.  They slid down off my heel repeatedly.  I tried several of the pairs I bought (about 4 pairs out of 12) and they were all the same.  They tend to slide around, not as if they are too big but just as if they aren't made right.  They also are somewhat thinner than the Gold Toe 'No Show' socks I bought in the store.The good socks I have are a Gold Toe 2247P.  These are a model 656F.  The 2247P may be very slightly higher on the ankle, but the difference in quality is like night and day.What a disappointment.  I returned them.  Fortunately, Amazon is awesome and offers free return on many apparel items, as well as free returns when something is defective.I'd avoid these socks, or take a chance knowing you can return them.
