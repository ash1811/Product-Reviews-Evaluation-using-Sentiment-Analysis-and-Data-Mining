I received the boots today - the color is aptly names because it is truly like curry - almost an orange.  The boots are of a yummy quality leather and sturdy heel, Frye quality stamped all over it.  I have another pair of Frye Carsons (sapphire) which are cute and funky and fit better than this 10.  This particular pair seems more like a 10-1/2 and just too big,  They would work for me if I wore thick socks, but since they're mid-calf height and casual, I'm planning on wearing only with thin socks for the summer.  So back they go, in spite of the fabulous price here on Amazon, and the great customer service.
