I knew ahead of time, based on the reviews, that this would run small, so I ordered a 12 month size for my 6 month old son. It fit perfectly, but there is no way he would have been able to fit his own size, and he is only in the 30th percentile for weight. As long as you keep this in mind when ordering, you'll like this swim diaper. It does the trick! Granted, our son has only ever peed in it, so I can't speak to how well it holds in a blowout. It seems comfortable on him and is well made. No complaints thus far.
