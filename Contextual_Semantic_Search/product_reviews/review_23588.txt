Let's see, this is the third pair of these particular shoes. They fit great and wear well. While I have a narrow foot and usually wear AA or Narrow shoes, I usually just buy the B withdth Easy Spirit and they work fine. But this time I did find them in Narrow which I bought. They fit true to size. They work fine but I think the toe box is a little too narrow for me and next time I'll go back to the B width. Excellent wearing shoe.
