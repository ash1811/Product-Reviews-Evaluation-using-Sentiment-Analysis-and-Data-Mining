I first got these shoes when I was considering buying some Tieks and I wanted to talk myself out of it.Although these shoes are not as comfortable as a pair of Tieks, they are very pretty and bright, and they ARE pretty comfortable. I walk around constantly at my job, and my feet never get tired in these like they do in cheaper flats.I already have my eye on another pair of Sam Edelman's - I think these are going to be my new go-to brand of flats. At a fraction of the price of Tieks, these are a great alternative.
