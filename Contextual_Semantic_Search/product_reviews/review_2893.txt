I am so glad that i listened to the reviewers.  I am a true size 10 in all my shoes but ordered a half size larger for these and i am so glad i did that!  These fit perfect!!  I wore them last evening on a bicycle night ride and it was muddy and wet - i showered with these shoes on to clean them off and they are as good as new!!  I want to wear flip flops while biking but that's unsafe so i found these are even more comfortable because they give support , let air in for coolness and have toe protection too - plus they look really sporty!
