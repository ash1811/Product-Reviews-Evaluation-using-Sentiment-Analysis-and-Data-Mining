My dress shoes always need attention.  I'd be in meetings, flying on planes, riding in cars and I was always banging my shoes on something.  Using a good shoe polish to recolor a scuff and put a gloss onto your shoes can make a real difference in how you look.  Another advantage is that polishing your shoes often also helps to waterproof the leather and keep it in good shape.I like to use a good paste or cream polish and a horse hair brush to get a high gloss.  Part of your appearance is your shoes and taking care of them means you care about how you present yourself in front of others!Kiwi is a good brand and I recommend it!
