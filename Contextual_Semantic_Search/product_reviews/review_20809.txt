I've been trying for ages to find a replacement for the perfect cami I had several years ago.  This runs longer and more snug than I would like, but I really need a navy cami, so I'm keeping it, even though I'm not completely happy.  I am only 5"1" and this covers my butt, but I've found most camis made now run this longer length.  We petite women lose out, it seems :(  This also runs small - I usually wear a large, and this was XX-large and fits very snug. Order up from your regular size!
