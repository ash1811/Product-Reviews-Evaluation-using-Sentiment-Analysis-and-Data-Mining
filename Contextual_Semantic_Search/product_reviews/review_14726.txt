These were the slippers I have been looking for. I love Isotoner slippers! I always have at least two pairs ....one to wear while I wash the other pair. My last pair was about to fall apart(after about three years and constant washing) when I found these. Thanks, Amazon for offering these wonderful slippers at a great price!!
