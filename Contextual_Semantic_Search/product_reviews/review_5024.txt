-I love it, they wash and dry easy.-They last 3 years a pair for me.-They dont stain-adios skid marks (not that i ever had them)-they dont stink from after fart.-they fit snug and keep everything down there where it should be.I bought them for hiking the mountains but now they are an everyday wear for me.  I will not wear any other undergarment and havent in about 4 years.
