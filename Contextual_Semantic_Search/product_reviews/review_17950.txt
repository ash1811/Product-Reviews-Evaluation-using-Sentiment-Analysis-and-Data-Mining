At first, I laughed at all the insanely positive reviews over some socks.  Socks really don't excite me.  In fact, most clothes don't excite me.However, these socks are fantastic.  I got really sick of the traditional crappy "dress sock" that is all looks and made of about 1/1000th of an inch of material, providing 0 comfort and 0 warmth.So I bought these.  Wow!  I am not excited over a piece of clothing.  They are soft and thick, but they don't make your feet sweat.  I love them.  I wear them now all the time as long as I'm wearing long pants.  Perfect for jeans or dress pants.Ordered a 2nd 3pack, and I'll probably keep on ordering them.  The price is right!
