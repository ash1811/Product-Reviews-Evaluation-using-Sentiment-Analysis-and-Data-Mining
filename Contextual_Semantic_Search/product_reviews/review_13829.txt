Originally I ordered this jacket in black and was surprised when the jacket arrived and was camouflage.  I contacted Daybreak Enterprises and they instructed me to return it and reorder.  I was disappointed because I recall selecting the black option, but when I reordered and the black jacket arrived I was very impressed.  Thick heavy quality, no issues with lint and cotton machine washable.  I have not washed it yet so I don't know how it will perform after washing and may edit my review.  It looks great on!  I am female so I thought the black would be the least masculine option and more dressy.  It is a casual jacket, but It's one of the nicest casual jackets I now own.  Still waiting on my credit from Daybreak.
