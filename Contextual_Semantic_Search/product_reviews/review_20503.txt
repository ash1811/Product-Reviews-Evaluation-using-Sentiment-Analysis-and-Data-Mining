I've been losing a lot of weight since last summer.  I've gone from size 50's to size 44's from this company so far and plan on going lower.  I must say that the size 50's would wear out and "flake" on the outside pretty fast, but wouldn't break.  The 44 is not flaking at all and is wearing very well.  A shinier version of the belt as well.  Maybe the material quality changed suddenly, or they're using lower quality materials for the longer belts to compensate for keeping them the same price.Either way this belt is great, not as "fancy" as more expensive belts but at this price you couldn't ask for that.  I like these for standard use with my casual attire at work.-Drake
