When I first received the watch, I've got to admit that I was a bit disappointed (it was that ugly canvas watchband).  However, after wearing the watch for several weeks and replacing the band, it's become my favorite everyday watch.  It has a casual and dressy look and feel.  At a price point of $117, it's an excellent value!The features that I enjoy about this watch:1)  The watch is a lot thinner than I expected.  Some guys like a BIG HEAVY watch.  I don't.2)  No battery.  This can be costly to replace and the battery always dies when you don't want it to die, e.g., on a trip in the middle of nowhere.3)  The hour and minute hands illuminate very brightly in the dark.4)  Second hand sweep that works exactly like a stopwatch.5)  It looks and feels damn good on my wrist!Features that I don't like:1)  Like every other reviewer, I found the canvas watchband to be ugly.  I replaced mine with a "Swiss Army-type" rubberized band that is smooth and looks dressy ($8.00 to replace).  Don't replace it with a rugged Timex "Ironman" or Casio watch band since it won't look good.2)  The three smaller dials are too small for my old eyes; however, that's my problem.  Bigger dials aren't possible without making the watch bigger.In conclusion, I give this watch two thumbs up.  I deducted one-star for the ugly canvas watchband.  However, replacing the canvas watchband is easy and cheap.
