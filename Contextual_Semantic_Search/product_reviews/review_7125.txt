As we all know it is very hard to find good durable socks. Look no further! I had these when I was a kid and can't believe it took so long for me to back to them. They fit great (I'm a 10 1/2 - 11) and have just enough thickness. I tried Wigwam, which were OK, but were a little too thin and a tough uncomfortable in the toe. These are great.
