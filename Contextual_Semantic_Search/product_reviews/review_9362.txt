I weigh 98 pounds, at 5'2', and these are so tight in the waist they make me feel sick. I have to fold the top down to my hips, Something can be snug without strangling. I think this must have been a mistake, except leggings by this company are very small waisted too. When someone whose weight doesn't top one hundred pounds can't wear the pants comfortably, who can?
