For the price the wallet is good.  I was looking to replace a Slimmy (more expensive) wallet, and this will not be my new wallet.  It is bigger than most wallets in its dimensions, in order to have room for three credit cards.  If you have pants with small pockets the wallet will jut out or poke your leg.  The wallet does not close securely.  It looks like it would have enough room for quite a bill roll, but if you only have a few bills they may fall out.  Quality does not seem great.I prefer Slimmy wallets, but they also have a quality issue.
