Okay, so I wear cotton granny panties,  It's my fanny and I like 'em!  These are pricey but worth it:  such fine quality cotton, not really 'suede' feeling, but a thicker and very soft smooth fabric, care to hems and stitching, and the soft lace trim at the waist is not itchy, doesn't bunch, and indeed looks and feels feminine.  They've only been through a few machine washings and dryings, but they come out looking just lovely.  Yeah, I should hand wash and drip dry, they'd probably last until my last breath on earth, but .....  these are durable goods and they handle my abuse quite well.
