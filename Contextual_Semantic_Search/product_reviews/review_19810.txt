Buy them in the summer, when they're cheaper -- the price always seems to rise near Christmas.In Phoenix, I don't need big old sheepskin-lined boot-slippers on my feet.  These are fine.  They're so comfortable that I've worn through several pairs of them.  Fit great, do well in the washer and dryer.  My one and only complaint is a flimsy sole.  On the other hand, I wear them on the concrete patio and even out on the rocks in my yard, which is not the best use of the slippers.  They put up with my abuse pretty well.  Would definitely recommend them, but probably not for really cold weather.
