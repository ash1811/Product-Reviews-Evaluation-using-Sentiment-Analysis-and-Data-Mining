This is the belt I wear for work and it's nice enough and durable enough to work out nicely.  The belt comes very long so you will probably need to cut and burn the end to what ever length works for you.  The belt is not good for attaching holsters or radio's as it is a pull through tightening type belt and it will loosen.  This loosening is my only problem because for work I carry a lot of items attached to my pants and in my pockets making my pants heavy with flashlights, tools, knife, locks, and radio.  As I walk the belt will begin to loosen and I find myself tightening it frequently throughout the day.
