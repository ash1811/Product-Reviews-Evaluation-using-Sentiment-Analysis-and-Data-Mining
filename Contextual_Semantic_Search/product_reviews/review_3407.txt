Itching "down there" is NOT cool.  After recently developing a latex allergy, I was miserable and desperate.  After all, there aren't many places where I feel comfortable going commando.  I found these Lollipops by Googling "latex free underwear."  I couldn't wait for them to arrive.  I wore them the very next day. Instantly itch-free!They are definitely grannie panties, hence four instead of five stars.  They're not attractive.  The waistband rests well above my navel, and I could probably stretch it to my head if I tried.  But, Jimmy crack corn, 'cause I don't care!  I can work all day and never give my underwear a second thought.  Unless you've been there, you have no idea how liberating that is.  So, if you are latex-sensitive, weigh your choices.  Itch or grannie panties?  I've made my choice.  Lollipops forever!Note: If you are allergic to latex/elastic, be sure you order the LEG BAND brief.  There is also a Lollipop brief with an elastic leg.  I accidentally ordered those and had to send them back.
