Sometimes it doesn't even feel like I'm wearing these.  I've slowly bought enough pairs over time to make these my daily underwear.  They are tight at the waist so they don't come down when you sit down, but not so tight that it leaves marks (like compression shorts sometimes do).  The material is soft, flexible, breathable...just perfect.Highly recommend these.
