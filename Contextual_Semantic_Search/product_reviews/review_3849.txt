this was my first time buying one of these.. I didn't know what to do because I was between sizes (the waist measurements of LARGE and the hip measurements of MEDIUM... no ideea how that happend..)  I have a 30 in waist and 38 in hips.. Fits great!! (medium) almost 50's still hour glass look.. that's not really my thing but the hubby loves it so that's why I gave it 5 stars ;-)
