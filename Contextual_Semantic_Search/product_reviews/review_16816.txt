These have a nice, thick cotton fabric, and are very well put together. They are fairly loose fitting, as you would expect from a work shirt. They have a very soft and comfortable feel.The pocket is nice and sturdy, and has a small leather patch (about 1.2 x .6 inches) that furnishes a perfect place to clip in an ink pen. The front has two buttons, and the top one makes the neck quite snug. I usually leave that one unbuttoned, but in cold weather, it would be helpful.I got two, the forest green and oatmeal heather. I do a lot of airplane travelling, and these are perfect for that. They keep me warm on the flight (that air at 35,000 feet is always cold), and the pocket gives me a place for an MP3 player or whatever needs easy access in those narrow airplane seats. I also wear them as my daily knock-around shirts in fall thru winter. They're even nice enough for casual office settings.
