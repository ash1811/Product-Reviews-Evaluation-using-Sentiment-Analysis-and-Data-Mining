My husband loves that they are durable, but lightweight. They fit true to size. Be ready to reinforce the button though - it just seems like the minimum amount of thread was used to secure it to the pants. Just takes a few minutes, but just want people to be aware when they purchase that they might want to secure the button a little more.
