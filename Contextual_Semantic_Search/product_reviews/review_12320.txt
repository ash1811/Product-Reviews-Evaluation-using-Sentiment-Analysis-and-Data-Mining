I ordered a size 6 but I am a size 6.5. I think my feet are average width, not thin and not wide. So for me the show fit very well. Throughout the day of wearing them, one foot started to pinch but it was not too bad. The shoe fit well, coloring may come off on to your pants for a while. I'm 5'3 and my weight fluctuates between 120 and 110 yet the shoe pulled up to calf length and fit snug and comfortable. I can't wait until Autumn!
