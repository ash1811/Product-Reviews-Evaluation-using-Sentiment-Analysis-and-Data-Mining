My husband is 5'9" and wears a 36x32 in pants. He already had a pair of UA pants in XL which were very baggy, but the length was ok. I heeded the warnings after reading the reviews here and ordered a size smaller and bought a Large. The length is crazy long and the waistband is extra wide. It looks like these were made for someone 6'6"! They will be returned.
