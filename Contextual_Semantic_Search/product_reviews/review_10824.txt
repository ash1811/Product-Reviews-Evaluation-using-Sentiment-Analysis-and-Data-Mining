I really wasn't sure what to expect, as many of the other reviews mentioned man-made soles (not true) and poor quality (also not true). I wanted a relaxed dress shoe for every day at the office. these are perfect. they looked great when they arrived and only look better with wear and break-in (which is happily minimal). the are high- polished and look executive smart. all- leather uppers and I am happy to report LEATHER SOLES! the heel is a composite but appears to be wearing fine (now having the shoes for a little over a month). on certain high wax vinyl flooring there is a squeak if you shuffle as you walk. Appears to be the heel flexing. I solved this by picking my feet up as I walked, which also seemed to relieve lower leg fatigue in the process. the only head shake I have about these shoes is why they chose to put in man- made foot bed inserts when the rest f the shoe is all leather and of high quality. It's wearing fine, but its obviously much lower standard than the rest of the shoe. Other than the foot-bed materials (still comfortable, and I'm a large man with a size 14 foot) I have no complaints. they are FAR better than Kenneth Cole shoes, and look far classier as well. If you cannot afford Allan Edmunds, give these a try!
