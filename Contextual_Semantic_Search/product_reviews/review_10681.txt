The white color that I have to wear is see-through. A classmate wore undergarments with pink stitching and you could definitely see. These should be made thicker. I bought white tights to wear underneath, but it made them uncomfortable to wear. Also, these aren't for people who have big butts, as your underwear show when you sit down.
