Pretty much every construction worker seems to own a pair of these, in classic Carhartt brown. Every semi-feral hobo kid seems to have these, or the overalls, or the double-fronted ones in black (to hide the dirt.) I wear them because they're the hardest-wearing, most comfortable work pants for the money, very close to the gold standard (Duluth Trading Company edges them out on quality by half a notch, but their stuff costs more.)Not only do the pants last longer than the GAP and Dockers pants, they also meet most peoples' contemporary standards of casual attire, and don't look out of place with a polo or Oxford shirt. Once broken-in, they're quite comfortable, with a loose but not baggy cut that can fit over a pair of long johns without chafing in cold weather. They've made jeans obsolete in my wardrobe, being tougher and much better-looking street clothes. Good stuff--buy a pair if you haven't already.
