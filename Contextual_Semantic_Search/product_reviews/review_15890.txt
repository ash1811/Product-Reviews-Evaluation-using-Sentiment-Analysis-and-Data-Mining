I bought a pair of Thorlo's several weeks ago, and I liked them: even though they're waaaayyyy pricey.  These were a better price, though still expensive for a single pair of socks, but they're not as thick as the other pair I have.I wear size 11 to 11.5 boots.  But, since I knew from the previous pair that Thorlo socks are a bit on the small size, I ordered the XL (size 13-15) socks this time.  These are a MUCH better fit.  The &#34;calf&#34; part are a bit longer than &#34;normal&#34; over-the-calf socks.  However, the only thickness/padding on these socks is on the bottom: from toes to heel.  The rest is as thin as you'd find on dress socks.They wear well, but I haven't washed them yet, so I don't know how they hold up after a wear and wash.  They're comfortable and, since I wear them over long-johns, the thinness isn't an issue
