These sandals looked so beautiful and would have gone with anything, but the cut was not at all right for my foot. In order for my big toe and second toe to be positioned correctly to hold the leather, my toes were pitched to the the very front of the sole so they looked too small in the front but too big in the back. If I had gone a size smaller, I think my toes would have hung over and I do not have long toes! I spoke with my niece who has very different feet than I do and she had the same experience. My advice to anyone ordering online is to try them on in a store first.
