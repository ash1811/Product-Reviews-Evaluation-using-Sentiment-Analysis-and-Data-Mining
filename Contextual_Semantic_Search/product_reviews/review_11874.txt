My brother has a pair of these shoes and loves them. I had my eye on them for awhile, and finally bought them on cyber Monday. I got them for $75 which is a steal. They were not as comfortable as I would have thought out of the box, but now after wearing them for several days they feel amazing. The leather and stitching looks great. I can wear them with a variety of clothes. They almost feel like I am wearing slippers now. I love these shoes and would buy them again!
