I ordered these shoes as I love Birkenstocks and wanted a closed toe shoe.  I did order a size up from my usual size, because I intended to wear heavier socks with these shoes.  They are a little wide and a little long.  At the same time, the area by the toes seems a little tight.  Maybe it's my feet or maybe that's how they are supposed to fit.  I find the sizing to be confusing, and some of the pages to be even more confusing.
