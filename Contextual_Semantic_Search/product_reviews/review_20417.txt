True to size & and also pretty pjs.  Just the right length in both legs & sleeves.  The elasticized waist has just enough give to be comfortable all night long. These are well made pjs & hold up to lots of wear & journeys through the washer & dryer. The color azure stays the same forever.....no fading.  Vanity Fair sleepwear is always a good buy.
