The Citizen Watch Company (originally Shokosha Watch Research Institute) has been around since 1918, and since that time it has been renowned for its excellent products. This beautiful watch is part of the Eco-Drive range, which is powered by a tiny solar panel, which is cleverly hidden under the face. Also, giving the watch its glitter is a number of wonderful Swarovski crystals. Swarovski has been making jewelry-grade crystals since 1892, and their consistent quality has kept the company going through wars and the rise and fall of empires.So, if you want to buy that special lady in you're a beautiful and useful watch that she will treasure for years to come, then get her this watch. It is a treasured part of my jewelry collection, and I love the man who gave it to me!(Review of Citizen Eco-Drive Women's Silhouette Crystal Watch #EW8464-52D)
