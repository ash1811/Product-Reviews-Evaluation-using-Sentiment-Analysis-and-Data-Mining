I use this product as a base layer and like to pile other layers on top. This shirt allows my skin to breathe which makes it in my opinion much better than the synthetic base layers.Silk is a very good insulating fabric very lightweight and great to wear under many layers.One thing I have noticed about the top and especially the pants that can be brought separately is that I feel it does not run true to size.I suggest buying one size smaller than the sizing chart implies.
