This is lingerie but nothing more. Don't think you can use this as any kind of cover up, even in front of your immediate family.The top &#34;v&#34; cuts down to the bra line and there is a slit in the front that runs from the floor all the way to the bottom of the bra line. Both the chest area and &#34;skirt&#34; are very sheer so you can see underneath. If you are going to wear full pajamas under or just want to be sexy this works, but I think it's a bit overpriced for something that has such a limited use. the area around the ribcage is form fitting so it looks nice on pear or hourglass figure types because the bottom billows out.
