we bought this for our 1 year old son and this works great. the first time we used was at a lake and i didnt realize until i took him into the cabanas to get changed that he had pooped! nothing leaked at all and you would have never known. i felt bad that i hadn't realized it but it definitely worked! one pair is fine for us as we don't swim ever day.
