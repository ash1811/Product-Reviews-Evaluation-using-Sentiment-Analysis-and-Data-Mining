I bought the watch from Amazon direct and paid extra for overnight shipping.  Although the watch did not arrive overnight, I am quite pleased with the price, and quality of the watch.  This is a must have timepiece for an Seiko or Dive watch collector, or someone who wants good quality heavyweight watch for less than $200.00.  I also bought the Black Monster at the same time, and that is equally as nice.  I have purchased from Amazon a few times and the experience has been good, I will continue to use Amazon unless something goes amiss.  My only issue is the amount of processing time until shipment happens.  And I don't mind paying for overnight if I want something the next day, but I want it to arrive the next day. That's it.
