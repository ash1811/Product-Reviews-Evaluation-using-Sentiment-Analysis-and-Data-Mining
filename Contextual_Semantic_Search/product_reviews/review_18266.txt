I ordered these for my guy who is always cold. His old pair of slippers were floppy, thin, and had seen better days. Out of the slew of choices on Amazon, I chose to get him these based on other reviews that said they might even be too warm. They are also reasonably priced and didn't look as if they'd fall apart after a month of wear. I'm really happy I chose these because he is too! He now wears them when he's home and says they are the warmest, most comfortable slippers he has ever owned. The quality and construction is even better than I expected. They are super soft, but still sturdy. The soles are really nice and don't squeak as he walks on our hardwood floors. He's able to wear them outside without putting other shoes on and without fear of them being ruined.They come wrapped in a shoebox and don't have any weird plastic smells. They also don't seem to fuzz up his socks and the fuzzy lining stays plush during wear.All in all, total win!
