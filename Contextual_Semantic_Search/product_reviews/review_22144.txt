Good quality. How well they fit depends on your foot shape; if you're the kind of person with a heel that splays out a little these will be perfect.  My heel is pretty much shaped like it was at 16, and I could use a little higher back to help it stay on, like 1/4&#34; more.  As it is, while they're nice, no long walks for me, because I have to scrunch my toes a little to keep them on.My intention was to buy a shoe I could wear barefoot.  If the heel stayed on this would be perfect, but because my feet slip out I need the added friction of socks.  So I always look slightly tacky when I wear them. Not that terrible except when going someplace with the kids.They are stunningly light.  Almost weightless. A good shoe for the carry-on bag.
