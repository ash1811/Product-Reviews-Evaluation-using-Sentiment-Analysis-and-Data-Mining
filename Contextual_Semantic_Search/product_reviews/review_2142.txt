This is a nice kids watch. My son loves the lizards that go around the bezel as the seconds hand. I noticed it wasn't keeping time so I put a new battery in it. Same thing so we're returning it. Too bad. We all liked it. My opinion is still not negative because I think it's likely we got a bad unit otherwise everyone would be on here complaining about it.
