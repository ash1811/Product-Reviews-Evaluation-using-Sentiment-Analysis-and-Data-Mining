I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this item, for the price it does what it says, keeps your head warm and gives you some protection from the wind and solar glare with the visor. It is a very snug fit , but I'm hoping that it will stretch after wearing it a few times. I would recommend you don't buy this for anyone with a large noggin or a lot of hair like myself.
