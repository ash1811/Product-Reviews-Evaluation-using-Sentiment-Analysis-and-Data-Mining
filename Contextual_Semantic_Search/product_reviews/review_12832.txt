I got these in dark gray because I have a pair of dark gray pants that are too large and do not have belt loops.  These did the trick!  I tuck in a black or maroon button up shirt and the grey looks nice against both of those colors.  I always get compliments on them when I wear them.  They make an X shape in the back and are very stretchy and adjustable.  I am a very petite woman at 5'1 and I adjusted them to fit me.  The metal adjusters hit my chest though so if you are extremely tall, I am not sure how they would fit you.
