I don't recommend these to anyone. Bought the correct size, tried them on my daughter, asked if they felt okay and she said yes. Took her to the beach and she wore them the whole time. Never complained about her feet once. When we got to the car I took them off, and saw two HUGE, angry, red, blisters on the inside arch of each foot. About the size of a quarter on a two year old's foot. That's a big blister for an adult foot. It took about 2 1/2 weeks of intense and careful treatment to heal them. She cried whenever we put her normal shoes on. I tossed the shoes out and never put them on her again.
