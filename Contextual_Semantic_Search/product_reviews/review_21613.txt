I gave this product 5-stars because I am a huge fan of UGG and its products.  I am a 8.5 but always order a size down to prevent buckling in the for portion of the boot.  I am also a wide calf girl and these fit like a glove.  I like the Sand color because you can easily clean and they are neutral color for all of you outfits.  The shearling will preserve your body heat so yes you can wear these 365 days a year. The tall boots are best for fall and winter and the short for spring and summer.  These boots are where function meet fashion.  Grab a pair or two.
