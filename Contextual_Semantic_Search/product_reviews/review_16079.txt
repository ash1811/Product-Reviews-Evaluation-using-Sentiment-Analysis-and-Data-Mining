I own at least 30 Invictas and love most of them. However, their current rage for their most attractive styles is to make BIG watches, 46-50 mil and above.  I wanted something in the 42-43 mil range which is how this is advertised.  I also liked the fact that the movement was apparently the Myiota movement I have in several of my Invicta automatics. Excellent durable movement.  THIS WATCH IS NOT 43 MIL IT IS 40 (I already own one in 40 mil with a nicer dial) AND IT DOES NOT HAVE A MYIOTA MOVEMENT.  Sent it back disappointed. By the way, I do own a 43 mil Invicta in brown with a Myiota movement so I know they make or at least made them.  I'm growing wary of the new Invictas -- not just size wise -- they are looking somewhat cheaper in quality to me these days.
