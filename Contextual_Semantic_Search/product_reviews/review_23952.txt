Basic scrubs, but somewhat disappointing purchase because the listing doesn't state that they are giving you the EDS variety.  These are good solid scrubs that hold up well to wear and tear.  But beware if you are on the heavy side, the material has no stretch at all, until the normal scrubs.  So while I can normally wear a medium, these are uncomfortably tight.Good quality overall and fast shipping, but be careful with the sizing.
