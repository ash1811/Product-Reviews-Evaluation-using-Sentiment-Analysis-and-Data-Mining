First, this wallet is falling apart after virtually no use.  Every time I pull out one of my cards, a leather flap pops out (see product photo that I uploaded).Also, I was shipped a black leather wallet (not dark brown--black, and definitely different than the picture on the product page) despite ordering a brown one, and they don't even offer black wallets on this product page (at least, not as I write this.Based on the many positive reviews, perhaps I just had bad luck, but at the very least it looks like quality control for these wallets sucks.
