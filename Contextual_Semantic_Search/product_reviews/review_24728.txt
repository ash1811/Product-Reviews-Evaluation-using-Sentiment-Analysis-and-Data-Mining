I wear size 11 tennis shoe so I ordered a size 11 sandal. They seem to be rather tight at first and I was worried that I should exchange them for a larger size. However, after a week of walking in them, they seem to have stretched out and are now very comfortable. If you like your sandals a little looser then you might want to go with a size up from your sneaker size.
