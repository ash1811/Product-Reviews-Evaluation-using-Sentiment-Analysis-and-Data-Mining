These shoes were comfortable when I first tried them on, but when walking I noticed my right foot leaning inwards and upon closer inspection the right heel dips down slightly.  Are they seconds or did I get a dud pair??  Also, I got blisters on each foot the first time I wore them, which was extremely painful walking back to my car 1.5 km away after work! I didn't think I need to wear socks.  I'm keeping them as they've been worn otherwise I would return them.  I'm hoping I'll get used to the heel leaning part and the blisters won't be an issue once they're worn in.  They do look nice though and were initially very comfortable, hence the 2 stars.
