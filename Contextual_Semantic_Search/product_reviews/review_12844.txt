I picked up two of these pairs of jeans for my husband in size 34x34, one in the light stonewash color and and the other in the color called inspector. I bought them both at the same time from Amazon, and they were even delivered in the same package. However the waist in the light stonewash color jeans was about a inch smaller than the one in the inspector color. I'm guessing this is just variations in the sizing, but it something to keep in mind when buying them. You may buy a few pairs of the same jeans and find that the waist of each pair fits a little differently.The light stonewash pair is a nice Levi's color, not a 1980's stone wash. Just a lighter color of denim with white and blue color variations. It's subtle, something you would wear. Not something that looks like it came out of the attic from 25 years ago.The inspector color was my favorite. It's a great medium blue. Not dark by any means, but also not a light color. Inspector comes looking like the perfect shade of blue that will go with anything. Can be dressed up or working-in-the-garage casual.The Levi's 550 jeans are perfect if you're looking for regular basic jeans (not skinny jeans for guys, not boot cut for guys, etc). They're great for anyone who wants just basic fitting jeans, similar to the the straight leg style, but looser in the legs, which is perfect if buying the straight leg style is too tight in the legs for you.  It's the kind my 33 year old husband likes, and also my 61 year old father.
