My four year old son is in love with choppers/ helicopters, he actually spotted the chopper in this watch and asked me for it. When we opened the gift on Christmas morning, we were surprise to see that the chopper is actually going around in a circle. He was so happy to see it as well as the band is so soft and fits his hand so comfortable. I think it 's a great gift for a young boy now learning to tell time.
