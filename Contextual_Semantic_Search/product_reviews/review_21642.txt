I had a pair of Simple shoes before and really liked it. So I bought this second pair of Simple. The material and design are excellent as before, however, with the same size I could barely fit my feet in these shoes. Later I found it is because of the shoe pad. The shoe pad is soooooo thick that it makes the space inside much smaller than it should be, although the outer length of the shoes is not off by much. Therefore, you might want to order bigger than you usually wear for this model.Another issue is the water leaks. Not only from the top, but also from the bottom!! I know it sounds a good idea to make the rubber bottom from used tires, but at least they should be somewhat water proof... Not recommended unless your place doesn't rain much.
