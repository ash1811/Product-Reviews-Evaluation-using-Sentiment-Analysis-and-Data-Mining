I am not sure if this does what it says it does....I mean...I have an ultra sonic tank and I use this stuff but I can't always get it to smell right...my watch smells like sweat when I don't wash it...stainless band...this stuff makes it smell alright for a day...but so does water, but I leave everything in there from when I go to sleep, then when I wake up, I put it on after it dries...but I don't know, I don't have anything to put this up against...but if I run out...I might buy it again..like i said...a day...and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg :)
