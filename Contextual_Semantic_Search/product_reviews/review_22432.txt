Very solid watch.  Easy to real dials, and the luminous hands are easy to see in the dark.  This is a watch made for some fairly serious scuba diving.  Its nickname is the &#34;Orange Monster.&#34;  A quality watch that should last a long time.  Shop around though.  I doubt you'll find one for less than $185, which is what I paid.  Well worth it, though.  I strongly recommend, though, you also puchase a winder for it if you are not going to wear it every day.  Look for a sale on World of Watches.  They're normally $70, but you can get them for half that if you're patient.  I also recommend you get one with a metal band.  It has a number of nitches on the clasp, so it's easy to fine-tune the fit on your wrist.
