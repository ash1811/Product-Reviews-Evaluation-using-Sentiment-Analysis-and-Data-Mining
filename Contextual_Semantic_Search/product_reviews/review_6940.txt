Gold Toe fluffies use to the be only sock that would last a decent time for my husband; not anymore.  We got in on a deal from Amazon, that offered 12 pairs for a wonderful price.  He now wonders if they were selling seconds because they wear out in no time.Just like everything else, a company gets you to like something and then sends the quality all the way down the sewer.  We are on the hunt for a better brand of sock.
