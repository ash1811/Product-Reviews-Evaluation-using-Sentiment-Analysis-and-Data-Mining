These shoes look really nice, fit nice, feel great on the feet.  So, what is the problem?  DEFECT IN MANUFACTURE - the rubber sole on one shoe developed a light spot, this became a &#34;blister&#34; very quickly, blister broke open, large hole and long, jagged tears grew from each side.  ONLY WORN INSIDE - I returned these and will not buy this brand again.
