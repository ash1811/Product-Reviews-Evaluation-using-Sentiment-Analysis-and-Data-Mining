I bought these exclusively to wear inside of slightly tight boots. Over the past year of use, I've been expecting these to break down at a couple of pressure points at the toe, heel, or along the sides of the ball of my foot, due to the difficulty I have sliding my foot into these boots. But they've been great, with no poke-throughs or threadbare spots to speak of.My complaint is that the elastic on some is beginning to break down, leading the sock to collapse inside of the boot, which is about as uncomfortable and annoying as a sock collapsing while wearing a normal shoe, and then some. But this, I confess, is a common problem for any dress sock to tackel when challenged with the calves I come equipped with, so I'm only knocking them one star.The wool is sufficiently thick to give me limited insulation and cushion inside of my non-insulated leather boots, without being either overly warm nor overly thick. Maybe not the best sock for really cold nights outside, but for my use, I'll vouch for them down to the 30's.I'd definitely buy these again.
