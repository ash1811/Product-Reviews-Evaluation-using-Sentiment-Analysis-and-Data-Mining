The pants arrived quickly and without any rips, stains or damages. The pants were a little bit too big when I took them out of the package but they fit perfectly after I washed them once. I've only worn them as work pants 9-10 times but so far they are very durable, not too warm, and the pocket on the lower right thigh is very handy to hold a knife, pen, box cutter, flashlight, or many other things. I would absolutely order another pair of these if I needed to.
