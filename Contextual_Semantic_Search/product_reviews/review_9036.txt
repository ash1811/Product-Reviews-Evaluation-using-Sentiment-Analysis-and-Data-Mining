I bought these in 29 waist  and length is 32 should have been fine in length but they were to big have to wear belt and way to short I feel like high waters. I have bought these in this before at the stores and they were never this way to big around waist and way to short in legs. I will ever buy these again. Yeah I would recommend because maybe they fit others better than me.
