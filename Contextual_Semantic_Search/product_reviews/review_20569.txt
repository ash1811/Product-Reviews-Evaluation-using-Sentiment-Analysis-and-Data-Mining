After joining a water fitness class, I quickly realized that my toes were getting scraped on the bottom of the pool while I tried to do the exercises.  I tried a cheaper shoe from Wal-Mart and they helped the bottom of my feet but did not have the close fit to my foot that the Speedo shoe does.Update Aug 3 2013-  After wearing these 5 times a week for an hour each time since early May, the tops of the shoes are disintegrating the way a swimsuit that is not chlorine resistant does.  Maybe they should only be worn in salt water, ie, walking on the beach?  Not a shoe that I will purchase for chlorine pool use in the future.
