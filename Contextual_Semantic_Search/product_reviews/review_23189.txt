If this bra had fit, I still wouldn't have kept it. It is, as with all microfiber (aka Tshirt) bras, very stretchy, so I always order a band-size down (32 instead of 34). However, the cups are HUGE. I was looking for a demi bra - or something with less coverage than this. It is more a 3/4 or full-cup bra when I get the correct size, and that isn't for me. If you want a demi bra, get something else. Also, the shoulder straps are set for a frame larger than mine. They barely rested on the edges of my shoulders, and I am NOT a small girl there. This bra would definitely be visible around the edges of most summer tops - tanks, and other tops that show the chest or are sleeveless.
