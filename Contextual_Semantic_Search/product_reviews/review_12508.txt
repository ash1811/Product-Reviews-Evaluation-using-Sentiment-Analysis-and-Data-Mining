I love these Keds.  I don't understand other reviewers saying that these keds are made cheaper than in the past.  These are the &#34;original&#34; Keds from long ago past.  Keds made a fancy version with plusher interior lining years ago, but those were not original!  These couldn't be cuter and Amazon offers the best price out there.  I'm happy with my purchase.  I ordered size 6 c/d as my foot is a bit wide.  They ran at least a half size large but I don't know if that's because I ordered in wide.  Anyway, easy exchange, ordered half size smaller and they are perfect with room to wear socks.  Again, love my purchase, love my Keds.
