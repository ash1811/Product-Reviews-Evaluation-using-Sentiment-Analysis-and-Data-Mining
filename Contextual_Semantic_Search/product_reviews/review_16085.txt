What a handsome and rugged watch this is.  Looks enough like a Rolex to turn heads.  But the real reason to own it is the solid feel it provides, the excellent time it keeps, and its fit and construction that makes it a watch to wear during outdoor activities as well as an attractive timepiece to be worn to any informal and formal occasion.
