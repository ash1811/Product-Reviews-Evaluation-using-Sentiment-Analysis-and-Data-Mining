This Jerzees Pullover Hoodie fits well and is good quality for the price. I like that it is soft right out of the package and is comfortable to wear. The hood is decent and it could only be improved by being just a little bigger to help shield my face a bit better from the wind.Very pleased with this hoodie!Recommended!CFH
