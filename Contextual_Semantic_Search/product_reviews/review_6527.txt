I'll admit, buying gloves online is always going to be a bit of a gamble and for me this paid off.  Don't let anyone convince you however that &#34;they fit me so they will fit you&#34;. When you put sizing aside, there is still a lot to recommend this product.In colour, the gloves are a more buttery-yellow (than &#34;tan&#34; would indicate) and have a visible pebbled grain to the matt leather. The deerskin is remarkably soft and supple with a silky feel on the outside and a fine suede texture on the inside.The stitching is precise, uniform and well finished. Particularly of note is shark-tooth stitching on the wrist (palm-side) that conceals the hand-clinging elastic.Design-wise these are classic unlined driving gloves.  They feature the scooped racer-back, a Velcro-tab closure and perspiration holes along the back of each finger. The only Italian style-convention absent is the lack of knuckle holes and the designer price tag.Great gloves, good price - good luck
