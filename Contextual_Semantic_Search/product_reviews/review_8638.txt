Like all Vanity Fair panties, these are another soft and sleek panty which provides a bit more sexiness due to its low rise and double side straps. These panties fit perfectly, stay where you put them, and the sides straps do not dig into one's side in the least bit. They breath well, provide full coverage, and do not bind or pinch. The wide gusset ensures complete support and coverage for males. Both my wife and I love them. Another great panty from Vanity Fair.
