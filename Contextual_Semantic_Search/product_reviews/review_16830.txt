I got two of this ring for two of my sisters whos birthdays are in December.  I also purchased one with an amethyst, one with a sapphire and one with a peridot.  Now my mother, my three sisters, and I can have matching birthstone rings.  They are attractive and simple enough to be worn to work every day.
