I love this watch!  It's really pretty.  I love the gold and silver tone combination because it coordinates with all kinds of jewelry.  It looks more like a bracelet than a watch.  I bought a little watch link adjustment tool and had no trouble adding and removing links.  My favorite part of this watch is that it does not require batteries!!!!  I charged it in sunlight and artificial light initially and it's been keeping time perfectly ever since!  I don't even think about charging it anymore.  Just wear it as usual and leave it on the counter when I'm not using it and it's always automatically charged!  Super cool!
