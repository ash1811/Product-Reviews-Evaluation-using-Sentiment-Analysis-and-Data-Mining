The Color is a very good classic black -with a very little symphatic blueish part , not this boring overdied coalblack .Stitches are in another color for decent contrast and shows a good style.Bags and loop are roomy and practical- sit & cut is super !The material is for summer -see product dimensions ``lbs`` description- , good to work and wear in warm seasons.This Jean fit, is practic and look very good !
