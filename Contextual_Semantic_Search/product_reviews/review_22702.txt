I order ankle bracelet 4 years ago from Gem Avenue and it just brook. I never took it off and silver color never faded away. I wear a size 7 and 9' ankle bracelet fits me perfect. After the first one broke 4 years ago I purchase one in store (different brand) lasted 3 days. So I came back to amazon to re order same one. Item was shipped within 6 days and already using it. I love Gem Avenue ankle bracelet so much.
