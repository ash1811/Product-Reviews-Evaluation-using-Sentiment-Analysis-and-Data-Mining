I did not like these socks. They were not worth what I paid. They slipped off too easily. They are thin too, where I live I need them thicker. The only socks that worked for me were fisher-price socks, only problem is I can't find them anywhere. I do not recommend you buying these socks if your child always tries to take off his socks. The fisher price socks he can never get off. DO NOT BUY!
