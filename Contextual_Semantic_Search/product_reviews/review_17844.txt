I was lucky enough to purchase this watch for $50.00 bucks and have noticed that this watch has jumped back up to roughly $70.00 bucks.  Great G Shock watch!  Upon reading other reviews, was surprised to see what others were complaining about and how they've had somewhat a bad experience with this particular design?  Some were saying they didn't like it because the watch straps were pulling hairs around their wrist?  Hasn't happened to me?  They must be really hairy for them to experience discomfort?  If you're a fan of G Shock watches, then this might be one for you as well.  I noticed several other reviews saying they were having problems with the "Ani-Digi" design when changing the time on the first and second hand.  Some were frustrated because when you normally change the time on a watch that has a first and second hand, we're probably used to being able to move the hands forward and backwards.  On this particular watch, you can only move it forward to get to the desired time when you are setting it.  Since we're accustomed to a "twisting" motion of a knob to either move the first and second hands forward or backward to set the time, you'll have to press and hold down one of the buttons to chance the time.  Example, if it's 2:30pm and you went through daylight savings time and need to go back to 1:30pm, set time, and press and hold until both first and second hands cycle and set to 1:30pm.  It's not that hard to sit there and watch the hands move, but will it take more than a few minutes to watch the hands pass every hour, yes.  If you're an impatient person, then this watch isn't for you.  It this hard to do, no.  Overall, I think this is a great watch.
