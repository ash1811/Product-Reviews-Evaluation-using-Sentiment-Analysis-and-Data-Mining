These are really adorable rain boots.  They are very sturdy and my little one can pull them on alone with the handles.  The ONLY thing is they seem to run a tad large.  I ordered an 8, the size my son wears in all his other shoes, and they are way too long.  A size 7 would have been a better choice, but I decided to keep these as he will grow into them.  Overall, great boots!
