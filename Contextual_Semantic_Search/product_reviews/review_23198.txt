I wanted to make sure I had a chance to wear these before posting a full review.  So I wore these as my only shoes in Vegas for a week on vacation.  I didn't have any problems, and I walked a lot.Cons:- I bought the tan distressed.  They are exactly the color of the Copper Kettle versions.  I really had to check the stitching pattern to see that I got the right boot.  I was expecting the color to show up equivalent to a typical Timberland boot, so I had to deduct a star for that.- The bottom part of the boot looks and feels like good material, but the top part with the pattern looks plastic-y to me.  I haven't had any problems with it, but to some people this may look cheap.- The straps to pull the boots on are sort of...I don't know.  That is probably too nitpicky, and shouldn't stop anyone from getting these boots.Pros:- Affordable when it comes to boots.  I thought I was going to have to spend a couple hundred dollars.- Fit is great, and like others have said I didn't need any break-in time.  I could wear these right out of the box.- The bottom part is pretty attractive and they look good with my jeans- The sole is oil and chemical resistant so it is solid and I feel pretty good about them (I will wear the heck out of a pair of boots)If someone were looking for boots, I would recommend these.  I wasn't sure about buying boots online, but other than the color being off, this was a good experience.
