I bought these Vanity Fair underpants because of the great reviews but was disappointed. 6 is my usual size but these were a little small and the side seams pressed against my skin.  Maybe a larger size would solve this (?). I doubt I will wear them as the seams are annoying.I much prefer Warners &#34;Without a Stitch&#34; 6173.  A 6 was a good fit and nicer fabric.  I would give these a 5 star.  They appear as if they will last a very long time.  I have had one pair for about 2 years and they show no wear.  Fabric is a little heavy although luxurious feel.
