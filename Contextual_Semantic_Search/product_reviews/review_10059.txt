REVIEWS ARE VERY USEFUIL .SO HERE IS MINE!! WHAT A PRETTY SHINNY,VERY SHINNY BRACELET! i WEAR IT TO BED IN THE SHOWER AND HAD IT FOR A MONTH NOW IT IS STILL SHINNY AND ON MY ARM.  MAYBE i SHOULDN'T WEAR IT IN SHOWER I JUST LIKE TO SEE HOW STRONG IT IS. MAKES A GREAT GIFT, I BOUGHT IT MYSELF ,BUT LOOKED AT ALL THE REVIEWS AND THIS WAS THE ONE.
