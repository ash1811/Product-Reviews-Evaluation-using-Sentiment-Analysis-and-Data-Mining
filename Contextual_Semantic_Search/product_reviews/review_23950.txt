Seriously, I wear an XS normally - this XS could fit two of me in it. I'm not surprised by the material being rough and stiff; I have the classic Dickies V-neck scrub top and the material is the same and I actually find that that is what makes it more durable over time. As for Dickies yes, they normally run a little larger or baggier in areas, but this jacket really is absurd. If you are a small framed person, this will most definitely look like a large glades trash bag on you.
