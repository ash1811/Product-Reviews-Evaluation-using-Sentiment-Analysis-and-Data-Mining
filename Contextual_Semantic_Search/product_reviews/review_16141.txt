It didn't fit the Britax Advocate. Even though I feel really safe in the advocate it's a pain to haul, pain to get a cover for and a pain to sit next to when in a small back seat area.This case seemed really durable so I give it a 3 = just wish it came a bit larger to protect the monstrosity of a car seat that I own.
