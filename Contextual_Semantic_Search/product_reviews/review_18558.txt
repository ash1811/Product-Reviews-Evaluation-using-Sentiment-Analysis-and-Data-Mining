I wore this watch for a couple of weeks.  I never take my watches off, which has never been a problem with trusty ol' Timex Expeditions.  In truth, the band always wears out long before the watch does.  In fact, I've never had a watch wear out.  And I wear them swimming, hot tubbing, showering, bathing, everything.  But this one, the cheesy band broke in two weeks.  I just ordered a new band for it for 13 dollars rather than return it and I got a good deal on the watch but it still peeves me.
