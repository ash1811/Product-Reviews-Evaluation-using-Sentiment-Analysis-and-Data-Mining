I have a very old pair of Easy Spirit.  They were so comfortable, but finally showing some wear.  Needed additional colors and the prices on Amazon were the best I could find.  Shoes fit great and love the variety of colors.  They wear well and have a nice grip on the sole.  I purchased one pair in black and one in blue.
