I love Skechers shoes.  In fact I have 2 pairs of the Skechers D'Lites Opal mules.  I live in them and they are so comfortable.  BUT thinking the D'lites were comfortable so should these slip on shoes.  Boy was I wrong.  I wear a medium size 6. I ordered a size 6 for these shoes.My other Skechers are a size 6M.  It was so painful trying to get them to slip on my feet.  I have had other &#34;new&#34; slip on shoes that did not go on as tight as these.  When I compared the front of this shoe to my other skechers shoes, my other shoes showed a wider appearance as compared to these.  These were much narrower.  I may try a &#34;wide&#34; version of this shoe but not sure.  At any rate, I did not keep them and sent them back.  The size is not true to fit in my opinion.  Sorry Skechers you blew it on this style shoe for me.  I'll stick to your mules.
