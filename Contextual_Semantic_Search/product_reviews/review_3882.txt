Great medical bag-type toiletry bag--not your granddad's ditty bag for sure.  This is a serious I'm taking-off-for-a month-maybe-more bag. TONS of room, holy smokes, you could fit a small dog inside this thing. Hub loves the way it opens--the old-timey Marcus Welby flip-it-open-and-it-stays-open honest to Pete medical bag. Difficult to find.  If you're looking to go away for a long weekend, this isn't what you want, guys; that's your granddad's leather ditty bag (google it)--a far smaller version of this bag.  But the leather is sturdy and seems of good quality, the top snaps open as it should, and my guy can (and has) fit a month's worth of stuff in here.  The zippered bottom is a little weird, as it's so narrow; he uses it for Band aids, nicotine patches--flat things such as that.  A great big bag for a great long trip. Should last a lifetime.
