This review is for the brown leather version of these shoes (shiny, not suede). Though they ARE leather uppers, the finish on the leather is a plastic-like film that starts to peel over time. There is no way to repair it. Stripping it off doesn't work all the way either. The leather underneath the film is completely unfinished. I do not recommend these shoes for any purpose except maybe light occasional use.Too bad too, because the rest of the shoe seems well constructed.
