Thought we'd try this since it was on sale a bit cheaper than our New Balance shoes.  We are also becoming a bit disillusioned with New Balance quality in past couple of years.  These are comfortable and the fit is very good; but, way too stiff when walking and they make a lot of noise when you walk due to the stiffness.  Comfortable when sitting but that is not what we buy shoes for.
