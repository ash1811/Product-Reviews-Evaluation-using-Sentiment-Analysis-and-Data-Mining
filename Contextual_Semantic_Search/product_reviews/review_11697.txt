I have these mocs in both brown and black. They are amazingly comfortable, the perfect casual shoe with jeans. My only problem with the black ones is they turn anything you put in them black - socks, your feet. I'm hoping this eventually wears off, but for now I'm only wearing black socks with them.These shoes don't really have any arch support, so they wouldn't be ideal for long periods of walking. However, for driving, just hanging around, etc. they're tops.
