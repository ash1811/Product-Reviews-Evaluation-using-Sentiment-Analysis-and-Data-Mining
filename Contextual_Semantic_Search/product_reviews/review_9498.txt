I like this shirt.  It looks nice and is well made.  I like the snaps instead of buttons too.  It is a nice match for jeans and a brown belt.  The only problem I have had was wearing it the first time.  It is very stiff and got creases and ballooned spots all over.  When you get yours run it through the wash once after you try it on for size.  The collar is too tight for the top snap to work but I didn't buy it for a wedding anyway.
