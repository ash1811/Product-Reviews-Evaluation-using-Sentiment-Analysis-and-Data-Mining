Had to send these back as my husband has grown a little bit more than he thought. These pants are a perfect fit.I traded them for 34x30. So I would never buy any other brand. They will last for a very long time under a lot of workouts. The best brand for working pants I have ever bought. Came on time, nicely packaged and perfect.
