I've tried other Keen sandals but I've gone back to the tried and true original Newports in leather. Pure comfort from the moment you put them on your feet. Great for walking and hiking....in or out of water. I can wear them all day and my feet stay happy. I prefer the men's size 8 to the women's 9.5 for the wider and deeper toe box. A great sandal that lasts, making it worth the money.
