Dollar for dollar, these Wrangler's are the best value ever.  I've had numerous pairs over the years, and even though these are now made in Mexico, there are no noticeable differences from my American made pairs.  Wrangler beats Levi's (I usually wear 501's...or I should say "wore") in build quality...how do I know?  I am an HVAC technician, and on a daily basis, I wear my cowboy cuts to work in attics, crawlspaces, chillers, you name it...they wear out after three or four years of daily work use, but even then, they are still wearable (just fraying along the seams and couple holes at the knees..  All of the 501's i've used for work normally die within the first year or two.All of the cowboy cuts I own originated as the rigid indigo material.  My advice, if you go with the rigid indigo, is to wash them alone for at least the first two or three cycles...or you can do what I do, when you wash them the first time, just keep an eye on your washing machine's timer and keep cranking it back up to keep em washing for about an hour before the first spin and rinse.  Use good liquid fabric softener, then tumble dry them on high for about a half an hour.  This will take care of any shrinking that may occur, and dont worry, they are always a little snug after a wash but after one day of average work and activity, they fit perfect to size again.  After the first few washes, the rigid indigo is the same texture and color as the "prewashed indigo" you can buy.The only thing I do notice with these jeans is that the leg opening may be a little on the small size for anything other than western style or slip on boots.  When I wear them with my wolverine work boots they bunch up...so to take care of this I have a pair that I cut to fit over work boots and sneakers.Get these jeans, they are a classic fit, and last about a year or two longer than any Levi's 501s I've ever owned.
