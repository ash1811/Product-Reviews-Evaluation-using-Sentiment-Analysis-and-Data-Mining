just what i wanted, just in time for halloween. fit my 3 year old who is in the 30th percentile perfectly. there was definitely room for someone taller or shorter though....hard to get off to go to bathroom by himself. still wearing it 2 weeks after halloween. it does snag easy but you get what you pay for! the velcro on the cape is sewn on the wrong direction causing some rub on the neck...but superman forgets this very quickly :)  i will probably have to trash it in a few months but it was well worth it.
