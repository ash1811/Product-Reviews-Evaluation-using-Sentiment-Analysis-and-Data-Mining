I have been wearing these sneakers for over 10 years.  The last two pair that I ordered did not work for me.  It took me a while to realize that if i wore them too long the sneakers caused my back to hurt.  Just another one of those products that builds a great reputation and then lets the consumer down by lowering their standards
