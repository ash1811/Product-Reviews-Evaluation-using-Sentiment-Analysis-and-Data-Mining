I bought these to wear with jeans on the weekends, but they are too uncomfortable to wear. Very stiff. I'll try washing them with fabric softener, but I think they're just a waste of money. They pinch all the way around even though they're a little big. I tried adjusting the string, but no luck. Wouldn't buy again, and wouldn't recommend.
