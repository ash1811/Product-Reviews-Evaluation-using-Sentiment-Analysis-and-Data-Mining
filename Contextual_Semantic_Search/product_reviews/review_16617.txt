At 50yrs old ive worn my fair share of jeans. Some better then others? Of course Being a blue collar outdoorsman i dont realy shop for fashion in buying jeans they have to be a good fit for the application wear well and of course be a good value. These pants do all of that and more ive purchased 4 different Riggs styles of pants and they are in my opinion superior to any jean out there. That goes for Dickies levi and carharrt. They all have there place but in work jeans Riggs has no competition these pant wear like no other. I know many guys like myself are brand loyal and thats fine but ill bet the bank you try a pair of these and you too will see what im sayin. They have alot in both features and style all have very deep pockets and some signature design for style i even have a pair with sewn in buttons on the inside for suspenders to prevent the old carpentars crack from peakin out  And true fit to size they even offer in between sizes which are hard to come by these pants are also good as everyday use too they have a certain style about them. Two slight draw backs though and dont let this sway you from trying a pair. In store shopping at least in my region which is rural Upstate New York they never heard of these pants so mail order is my only option Second they are a bit pricey when you can find them. But with amazon the pricing is the best ive come by and if you shop amazon they have free returns if your not happy. All in all like i said try a pair for work or pleasure youll be glad you did and if you agree drop me aline id like to know i helped you with your choiceRick
