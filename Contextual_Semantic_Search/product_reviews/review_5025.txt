I like these a lot.  These briefs are comfortable, lightweight, and quick drying.  The black is true black, but the charcoal grey color has a hint of blue/green in them, not really what I would consider charcoal grey, but that's a personal preference on the color.  As for the quality, hopefully they'll last a long time.
