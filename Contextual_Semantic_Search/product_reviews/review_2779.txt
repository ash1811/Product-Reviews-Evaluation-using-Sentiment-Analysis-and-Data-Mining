The watch looks awesome, it has a beautiful mother of pearl dial. Functionally it is worth the purchase. I had a tiny glitch, the strap pokes and scratches my wife's hand whenever she wears it. I am yet to find out why this is happening and if I should file away the sides.Any ideas can help.Love the watch, no the strap.
