The problem with these socks is that one of the pairs is tight, the other one is looser and comfortable, and the third one has a tight upper rim?! Seems like they are not cut with the same pattern...Quality control issues at the factory? The same happens with the fabric. They could be the best socks around, but, for now, they are far from there.
