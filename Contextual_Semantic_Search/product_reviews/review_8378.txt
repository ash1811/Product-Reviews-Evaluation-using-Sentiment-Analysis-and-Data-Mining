I love these bras.  I'm an outdoorsy sort of gal, but I also need good support and minimization on a daily basis for work.  These bras absolutely fit the bill.  Comfortable, soft, fits extremely well, and holds well.  I use them for work, hiking, daily cycling, and daily living.  The only thing I don't use them for is running.... I have specific running bras for that, but I bet these would work on someone who is smaller than a D for running.I was extremely disappointed to learn Kohls wasn't carrying this bra anymore, but luckily I found it on Amazon.  I can't imagine switching to a different bra or looking for a new bra.  These are literally perfect.  Worried about the underwire?  So was I.  You can't feel it.  At all.  Don't worry....  you will be happy!
