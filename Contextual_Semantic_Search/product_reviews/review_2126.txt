had my first pair of 801's for about seven years and hope these will last as long as those did. these are my cooking shoes, which i do a lot. hated to get new ones but it had become necessary! love them so far. i highly recommend the more expensive 801's over the 400's that they sell - a world of difference in the support and fabrics used.
