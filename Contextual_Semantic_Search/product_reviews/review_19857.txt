I've worn this bra at least 20 times so far and the adhesive is still as good as new with careful cleaning.  I just use liquid dish soap and lukewarm water.  The next one I order will be a cup size larger than my normal size though.  The cup size that corresponds to my own is just small enough to give a slight "bullet" looking effect.  A larger cup will look more naturally rounded I think.  Overall I am very pleased however, the quality is great.
