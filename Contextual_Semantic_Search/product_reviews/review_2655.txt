I haven't seen an analog Timex Easy Reader priced this low for the past five years.  It's the perfect professor's watch because:1.  Only professors wear them (students have abandoned wrist watches in favor of cell phones, iPods and other digital devices).2.  Besides providing that dependable Timex time, it offers both the day of the week and the date (I'm just beginning to master the year and month without assistance).3.  If the watch is misplaced (the difference between a professor and an elephant), the cost of replacement is not prohibitively high.  (The same goes for repairs which, once you've factored in the drive to Walmart, are also not cost effective.)Thank you, Amazon.  Life is perfect.
