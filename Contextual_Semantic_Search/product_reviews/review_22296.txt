Usually I would NEVER buy shoes this expensive, but I am sooo glad I did. These shoes are extremely well made and are going to last a long time (Unlike my other crappy shoes like toms, flats, etc). They add a hint of masculinity to my wardrobe (not too much). I recommend wearing them with skinny jeans and a sweater. So CUTE! They are really comfy to wear if you'll be walking around for a long time. Although, I recommend breaking them in first before going on long excursions. I didn't, and it resulted in a couple painful blisters, due to my stupidity. I usually wear a 7.5 or 8, but I got a 7 and they fit PERFECTLY. And most importantly: they were approved by the boyfriend. YAY!
