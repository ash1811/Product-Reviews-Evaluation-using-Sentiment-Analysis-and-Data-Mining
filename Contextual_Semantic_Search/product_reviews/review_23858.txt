I recently purchased this pair of Wayfarers and a pair of Ray-Ban Aviators.I can give the same review to both pair of glasses and that is, that I have  nothing negative to say about the glasses.The construction seems to be durable since the frames don't rack under torsional stress and the hinges have a very solid feel. They sit very comfortably on the nose and aren't too tight behind the ear.All of the designators of authenticity are there, as is to be expected with a pair or Ray-Ban's sold by Amazon.Overall, I would suggest to a friend and would have no issue with buying another pair again in the future.
