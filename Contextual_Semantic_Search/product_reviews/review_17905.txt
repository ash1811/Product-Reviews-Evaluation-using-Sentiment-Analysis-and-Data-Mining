We first came across these in Cambridge, England, and man, did they help the ol' feet. It was great not being dependent on cars, exploring the historic city in the deepening dark of November, Christmas lights glowing in soft rain, and searching the Farmer's Market for simple meals. But our feet got extremely tired wandering about streets paved with extremely hard cobblestones. These socks helped. Highly recommended!
