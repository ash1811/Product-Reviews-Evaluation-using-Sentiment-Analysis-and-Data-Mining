This is my every-day watch.  I love the ease of the elastic band, and I am not concerned if I need to throw it in my purse, or leave it on a table.  It was so reasonably priced that I don't need to be so careful about it.  I wear it with good gold, and you really can't tell the difference.  I like that it has a little bit of silver on it, too, so I can wear it with silver or gold.
