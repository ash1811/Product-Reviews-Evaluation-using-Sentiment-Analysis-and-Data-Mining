I must admit these are the first pair Of Wrangler jeans I've purchased primarily due to TV ads and secondly price.The fit is comfortable but the waist is a tad higher then I'd prefer and surprisingly, the inseam seemed a bit longerthan the 36 inches I'm used to at 6 foot 5 inches tall. Hopefully their longevity will equal the value.
