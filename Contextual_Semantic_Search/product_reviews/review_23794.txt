I have purchased 2 of these through Amazon. At an average cost of $90.00 I would have expected quality.The plastic is light and creeks when you open that glasses. You get the distinct feeling that it is not very flexibleand will snap.It is said to be made in Italy !!! I really doubt it. If it is authentic, I really feel for Rayban falling so far below standard.My advise to you, is to pay more, go to a shop and feel the quality before you buy. You are not getting a bargain from thisAmazon seller.
