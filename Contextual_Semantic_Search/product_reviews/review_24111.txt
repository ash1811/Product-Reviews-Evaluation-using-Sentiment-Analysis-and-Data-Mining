I've had a couple pair of the cotton version of these for a while. I needed some new ones and decided to try the micro modal. These are so good that I'm replacing all of my underwear. I know, that sounds silly, but these are really that good. The micro modal breathes and wicks better than cotton. My wife has even started pilfering my dresser when she goes horseback riding.
