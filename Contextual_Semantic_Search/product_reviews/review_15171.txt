I like the Beefy-T and have worn them a few years. Hanes has been a good brand for me but I wasn't that happy with this batch, I bought 3 of them. They say they're "preshrunk" but something went wrong here, I washed them in cold water, as I do all new clothing, and they SHRUNK! How the heck does that happen in cold water? Oh well, I need to shed a few pounds anyway. It will all work out!
