I purchased these in 52 mm from Amazon because I'm a petite girl and based on the reviews here, 55 mm seemed too big for me. When I received them, they fit my face OK but then I went to Sunglass Hut to try on the 55 mm and that one looked even better! Everything else about these Ray-Bans (quality, the way it looked) was great except the size. I decided to exchange my 52 mm for the 55 mm. Amazon told me to return my old pair and make a new order. However, the price increased only a week after I purchased mine and Amazon was very nice to honor the old price that I paid. I love Amazon! I would recommend trying it on in store before buying if possible.
