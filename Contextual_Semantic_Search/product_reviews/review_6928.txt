I am convinced gold toe is the standard for sock quality, I don't know how they do it at this price range! The quality is great, they fit me perfect, I don't know why people complain about the size, the problem is probably them. The socks are obviously made for the average foot, if they don't fit you right, its not gold toes fault you have abnormal foot measurements.So if you feel you are abnormal, don't order these and bash them for the way they fit you, but for the quality, comfort, durability, etc
