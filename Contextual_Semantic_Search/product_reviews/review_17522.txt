I wear a 7.5 but had to order a size 8. These shoes are amazing. They have a little more coverage in the toe which makes them more comfortable as far as where they hit the sides of my feet. I own these in three colors and they are perfect for worm, where I am on my feet all day. I tried on so many ballet flats before finally finding this great shoe!
