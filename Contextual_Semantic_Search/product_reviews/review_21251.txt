This sandal is great! The fit is good and sized correctly and the material the footbed is made out of is comfortable and just thick enough to give that perfect &#34;cushion&#34; when you walk. The straps are of good material and fit comfortably right out of the bag. No having to wear this sandal to stretch it out before its comfortable. I will be ordering more.
