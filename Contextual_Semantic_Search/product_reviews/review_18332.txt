Alright, don't look at me cross-eyed.  We do a lot of entertaining.  I also work and have three kids, so most of what gets cooked happens the day of.  The most productive time is before the little ones are up and annoying -- I mean about.  The point is that these don't clean well.That aside, they are VERY comfortable.  They keep my feet warm in winter even without socks (and we're having one of those &#34;where's the second digit in the temperature&#34; winters).  I was never a &#34;slipper guy&#34; before (I don't even know what it would take to be a &#34;slipper guy&#34; -- would I need a pipe?  Would I have to live in Pleasantville?) but these make me feel like the man of the house (even though nobody's fetching them for me).  I won't even cancel my paper copy of the New York Times because it goes so well with these slippers.Highly recommended.
