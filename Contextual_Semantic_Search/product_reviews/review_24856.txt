...but you get what you pay for, no?This item came quickly enough, faster than expected to be honest, but I was disappointed when I opened the package as the quality of the locket seemed cheap and a little on the flimsy side.  I was looking for a locket with a little more substance to it, a little more weight.  This locket definitely is NOT heirloom quality; it would never last long enough to be passed down to anyone.I have been wanting a locket for some time and spent much time pouring over reviews, comparing items and prices and trying to reach a conclusion as to which to buy.  I finally settled on this one because of the price...if it wasn't quite what I was looking for (size-wise and quality), then for the price no harm, no foul.  I got what I paid for.The locket is on the small side, thin and difficult to open and I'm afraid that too many repeated openings will break it because the metal seems so thin.  The etched design on the front is slightly rough to the touch as well, though not enough to be annoying while worn.  I only received it this afternoon and have been wearing it ever since, trying to make up my mind whether to keep it or return it.  While the locket is large enough to put pictures in, the pictures would end up being so small it really wouldn't be worth the fight to get them set.The only good point of this is the chain, it seems sturdy and I like the fact that it's a rolo chain.  However, at 18", it sits way to high on me (the heart sits just below the base of my throat).  I should have purchased a longer chain.Like I said, for the price, it's okay, but it definitely isn't what I was looking for.
