The waistband and cotton are a bit thin for my taste.  The best boxer briefs i've ever found are the Duluth Trading Company Men's free range cotton boxer briefs.  They are in my opinion the standard for which all boxer briefs should be judged.  They however cost 4x what these hanes 4-pack do.  These Hanes comfort soft are a good backup for me when my duluths aren't washed.  Better than most but not quite the best.
