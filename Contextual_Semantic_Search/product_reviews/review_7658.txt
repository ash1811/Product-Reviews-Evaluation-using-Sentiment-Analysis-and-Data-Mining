I bought two of these tshirts (and one grey tshirt) for a three week trip to Europe.  They were comfortable and the wicking was great.  My husband couldn't believe that (pardon me for the following description...) the armpits of this tshirt did not smell even after a full and sweaty day of walking through the streets of Rome.  Wow!  Next trip I will bring three of these tshirts...they washed and dried easily but not overnight.
