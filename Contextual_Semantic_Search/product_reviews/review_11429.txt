I bought the Bulova Men's 98C62 Marine Star Watch about nine months ago and have been completely satisfied and very happy with this timepiece.  For one, this watch is a very good looking watch.  It is masculine, has a great blue color that matches the burnished chrome of the band.  I get a LOT of compliments on this watch and many think it costs a LOT more than the $149 I paid for it!  I've removed a link on my own with a watch kit from amazon and it was very easy.  This is a very well-made, water resistant VERY ATTRACTIVE timepiece.  Exceptionally happy with this purchase and I would highly recommend it!
