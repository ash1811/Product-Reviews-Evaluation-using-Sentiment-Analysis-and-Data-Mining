I'm just getting into oxfords and I'm using Kiwi right now but I'm not really thrilled with the results. I'm going to try something else next. I find that when I finish the shoe, it looks great, but when I wear the shoe, the wax ends up drying or showing on the outside of the shoe and I need to go back and brush it again. I could just be doing it wrong but I don't think so.
