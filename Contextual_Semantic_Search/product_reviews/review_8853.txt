I feel like an angel in this.  My  husband can't take his eyes from me when I wear this.  The lace over the bodice makes me feel like a rich slice of wedding cake.  The silky, satiny skirt falls in soft folds and makes me look so graceful.  By far the prettiest, sexiest, most simple and most comfortable gown I've ever owned.  I'm going to buy some more just in case they stop making them.  It's so flattering.
