These pants are awesome. They look nice, and can be worn around the house while chilling, or worn for the zombie apocolypse. Either way I'm covered with these pants. They are extremely comfortable, and functional with lots of pockets. Very similar to what I wore while in the Army, except for the fact that they aren't a button fly, these pants use a zipper instead. They are fairly well made and have so far held up to my abuse of them. One downfall - made in China. I'd rather they were made in the U.S. Also know this, these pants have what are similar in a way to drawstrings on the sides (as do actual military issued pants - same system). So for example size medium runs from a 31-35 inch waist. I am 6 ft tall, 175 lbs. I normally wear a 32 waist. I originally ordered a large, but they were way too big for me. I now go with the medium. I pull the drawstring mechanism on the sides to tighten them up a bit, and I also wear a belt. The fit is just right. I originally bought one pair of these. I've grown to like them so much I own a half dozen pairs now.
