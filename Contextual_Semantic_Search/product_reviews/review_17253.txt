Having grown tired of constant sneakers I was looking for a pair of comfortable leather shoes.  Comfortable being the significant of the terms.These Dockers are soft enough and have a built-in gel heel-pad.  They are not for high fashion but the look good going out to dinner or theater.  I like them.
