I have changed my review from one of positive to negative.I have now received two different designs for this sock. The one I wanted was a 3/4 sock with a thick non-ribbed bottom; I got this the first time around.What I got this time, was a full length (for those without calves) sock ribbed all the way through with very little padding at the foot.I have contacted Gold Toe and the sock I was after is the Cotton Crew 513S.This is the 3/4 (Approx. 6 inch top) with full padding on the foot sock I was after to begin with.Gold Toe admitted that they have so many sock designs now that the customers are having problems (as I did) finding there old standbys from years ago.I hope this helps so that everyone does not have to go through the research process that I did to buy a simple sock!Addendum: I have finally found my favorite (5" top) Gold Toes at JC Pennys for $13.00 for three, they are called Ultra Tec Cotten Short Crew.I would highly recommend this sock.
