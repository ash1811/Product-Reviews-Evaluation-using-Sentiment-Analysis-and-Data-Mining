Ordered 3 - will return. Cups wrinkle and bag out in top half and this is ridiculous looking. ALSO: Playtex straps tend to be considerably shorter than other brands, so watch out - I could not get these to extend far enough to &#34;fit well&#34;. It just added insult to injury. Used to adore Playtex and still worship Style 4707 but it doesn't come in enough colors.
