I like them.. they are long.. but everything is long for me... They will be long for most people though I am guessing.. but that is the way with shorts.. I love the fact that they have a zipper... I still don't know why every scrub pants don't have zippers ... but for the price these are excellent... Have just worn them for 30 minutes so far as I have to get them hemmed... but they feel comfortable... they are not the softest.. but i know that will change after a few washes... I would  recommend them
