I had my order sent to my work address, as I always have. However, this time the receptionist boxed it and forgot about it. I contacted the company, thinking it had been lost in the mail. They graciously sent another...the same day my order appeared at work. The replacement was sent soon after I notified them it had not been received...so, I want all to know that they were wonderful to work with...problem was on my end!
