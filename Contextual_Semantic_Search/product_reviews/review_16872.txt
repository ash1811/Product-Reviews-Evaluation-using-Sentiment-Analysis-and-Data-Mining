Don't know about others but this is a wonderful bra.  If one is not real big, than this works find for everyday use and don't have to worry about straps slipping down or the back band itching in this hot weather.  I really am thankful for the backless strapless bras that fit with everything and stay up.  It would be nice to have some vent holes so the product breathes.
