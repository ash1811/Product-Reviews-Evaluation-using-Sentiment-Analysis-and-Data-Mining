For some reason it was not the right size so I am rating it 3 Stars because of that. The shoe itself looked well made but the aggravation of having to return the shoes and therefore not keep them makes this 3 Stars (average) rating. Please do not let this rating deter anyone from buying the right size. Thank you.
