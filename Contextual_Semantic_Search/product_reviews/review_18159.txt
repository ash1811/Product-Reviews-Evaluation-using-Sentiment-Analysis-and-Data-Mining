I actually found these quite uncomfortable.  Which is weird since I pretty much have like a million different pair of Skechers.  This company selling them is not Amazon so be careful.  I haven't been able to have any communication with them.  I really suggest buying them directly from Skechers which has them at $50 (less than I paid for them).  You'll be really sorry if you have to make any returns so just wanted to give a warning!
