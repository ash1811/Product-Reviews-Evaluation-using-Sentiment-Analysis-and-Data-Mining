These seem a little smaller for its size. I had to return it and order one size up. They are a tight fit too. So, I recommend you guys to order one size up just in case. Aside from the size issue, it is heavy duty! Great stitching work and it feels extremely durable.UPDATE: I changed the review from a 4 star to a 5 star after sizing up one size. It's a perfect fit!
