I'm trying, as often as I am able, to leave reviews one way or another - good or bad about the thousands (seemingly) of things I purchase from amazon everyday (again, seemingly)and it'll be mostly for myself, because when I'm surfing around there for whatever and finally find what I'm looking for - sometimes there are NO reviews on it to help me make a choice either way! Having said that, I found these to be a decent pair of shorts. Very well made - knowing what I know now, I'd buy them again.**UPDATE**Finally put 'em on yesterday, September 2, 2013, fit just like I like 'em! Two thumbs up!
