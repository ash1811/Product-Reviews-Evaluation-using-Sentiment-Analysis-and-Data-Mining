This bra has no underwire and in this case you really don't need it cause it still gives you uplift and support. For the money I will say it is a nice bra but feels a little snug, Started my diet and exercise regime so hopefully I will lose the pounds quickly and my clothes and this bra will fit much better. Over all it is a nice well made bra.
