This watch is nice to wear for casual occasions. The blue face is good looking and as with most Skagen watches, it is super thin. Note that only the watch, not the band, is made of Titanium - the band is stainless steel color matched to the watch face. This means the watch is not as light as it could be, but it is still pretty light considering it is so thin. Also, with all Skagen metal bands, the band lock mechanism is a bit picky - make sure you get both pieces to click into place or you may lose your watch. All in all - a pretty good watch.
