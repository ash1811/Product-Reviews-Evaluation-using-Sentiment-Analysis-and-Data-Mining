I bought the bra for my daughter according to her size.  She had went to a bra shop earlier that week and was measured there and had bought a couple of bras from the shop which fit her perfectly and were the same brand as these.  Since the bras she bought at the shop were more of a 'winter-weight' and summer is here I decided to buy these as they are more light-weight.  And, yes, they are light-weight, but somehow the fit was much too tight for my daughter and the straps chafed her shoulders after only one day of wear.  Even though I think this is a good brand generally, I would not advise you to buy these particular bras.
