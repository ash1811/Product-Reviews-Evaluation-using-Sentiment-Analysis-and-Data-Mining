This waist cincher is just what I hoped for and more. After carefully reading the reviews, I ordered the large even though my waist is 33 inches. I was worried that it wouldn't fit or make much difference, but the results were fantastic. It highlights my hourglass figure and makes me feel much more confident in clingy dresses. As others have mentioned, it won't work under very clingy and thin fabrics because the fasteners will show through.I have worn this for hours at a time, including on a long car ride, and it is more comfortable than expected. It also helps my posture, which is nice. FInally, I appreciate that it is easy to care for--I just wash it on the delicate or handwash cycle and hang to dry. I was so pleased with it that I ordered another in beige.
