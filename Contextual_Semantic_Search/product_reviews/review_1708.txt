VERY WARM, great for working outside in the cold. I order a bigger size than I would normally buy. I have plenty of room for a pair of pants and long johns underneath. The only problem I had was that while the length is only slightly long for me, the straps won't let me adjust the overalls up enough so the crotch area hangs down a little too far.
