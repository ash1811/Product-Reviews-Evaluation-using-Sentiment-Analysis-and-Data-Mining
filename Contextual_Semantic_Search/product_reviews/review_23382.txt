I would have preferred that the strap not be quite so wide but it has two pockets in it.  The bag drapes over my left shoulder and hangs on the back which takes the pressure off the shoulder.  I have the purple and it is very pretty.  I'm going to order the turquoise and the hot pink.  I don't think I'll use either of these enough to worry about the stitching coming undone and it's a very good price on a nice sling back bag.
