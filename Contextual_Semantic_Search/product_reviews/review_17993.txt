I like that you can slip these shoes on and off.  They have a good supportive foot bed.  But they are very stiff and even after owning and wearing this pair for at least two months, they remain stiff.  However, I still give these a decent rating because I have problem feet and many shoes simply aren't comfortable.  I can wear these shoes for between 4 to 5 hours before they feel too constrictive and I take them off.
