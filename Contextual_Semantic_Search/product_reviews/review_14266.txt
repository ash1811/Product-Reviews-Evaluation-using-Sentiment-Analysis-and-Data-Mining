We have found this to be our favorite brand. The others we've tried have shrunk too much after washing. This was order for a tall person, and it has remained long enough to wear, wash after wash. Others are just too short after washing. We love it. It also seems to be more stain resistant than other brands. It comes out looking great. We bought three more because of this.
