The World Tour Classic shoe looks good and fits well.  Size and width are true.  The leather is soft and construction is good.  My biggest complaint is comfort.  Rockport skimped on the sole.  Its thin and the shoe itself has very little arch support.  Fine if you sit, but not comfortable for those who are on their feet 50% or more time a day.  If you have to stand for long periods, forget it.  I returned the last pair of Rockports I purchased from Amazon without even trying them on.  Paid over $$$.  Quality was poor, spots in the leather where they weren't dyed properly, poor construction, visible glue between the sole and upper.  Leather on those shoes was clearly inferior to these.  If the World Tours had better arch support, this would be a GREAT shoe.  I always buy Ecco and have tried to change it up add some Rockports into the mix.  Rockports were the go to shoe for business casual comfort when I was growing up.  Apparently, no more.  This will be the last pair.  I've just purchased another pair of Eccos and will retire these Rockports early.  They are going to Goodwill.
