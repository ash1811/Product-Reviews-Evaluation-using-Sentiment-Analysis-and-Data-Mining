Have become a complete advocate for Playtex recently and had high hopes for this style of bra, but was disappointed. It is much tighter than others I have recently purchased in the same size. The cups don't seem to be quite the right size either and give that  unfortunate &#34;overflow' look....I will keep it but it will be in the back of the drawer for an occasional need of a deep plunge, non movement kind of day.
