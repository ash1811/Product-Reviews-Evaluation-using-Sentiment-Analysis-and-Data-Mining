Items have not been used yet.  I bought these for, my yet to be born, grandson.  I found the fabric very nice and thick and soft but the design was already cracking even before washing.  I gave it 3 stars because of the fabric quality and because I embroidered over the design anyway.  As they have not been used, I do not know how they will hold up in the wash or if the snaps will hold up (as one review said the snaps all broke - hoping this isn't so).
