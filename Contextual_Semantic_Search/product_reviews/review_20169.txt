This is my second pair of sorels in this category. The last time I bought a pair was ten years ago and that pair (in black) is still going strong. The black pair is looking a little faded but I still wear them all the time. I bought this new pair because I wanted to change up my wardrobe. The new pair is very comfortable, stylish and well made. I know this boot will last as long as my other pair! Love these boots!
