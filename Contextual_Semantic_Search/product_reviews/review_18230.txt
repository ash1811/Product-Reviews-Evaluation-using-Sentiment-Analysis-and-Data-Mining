These are the most comfortable slippers I have ever worn. I purchased them because of the 5 star reviews and over 200 ratings. They are really fuzzy, soft, warm and comfortable, but they won't make your feet sweat. They are cushioned and durable and they look like they should last a really long time. They were so comfortable that I had to order my mom a pair in women's. I highly recommend these. They are comfortable and have memory foam for support on your back and are warm for the cold winters.
