Much nicer than I was expecting for the price.  This is a modest looking ring, not gaudy or the "look at me" some rings made with CZ's portray. I think, sometimes, because Zirconia is so inexpensive that it would be easy to get a stone too big and would just look phony. This has a nice look, it is a simple design, stones are set down in the band, protecting them from snagging.  So much for my ranting about overdoing it with CZ's!  Have fun!
