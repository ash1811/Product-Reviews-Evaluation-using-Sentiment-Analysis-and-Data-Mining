The Converse Unisex Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops were a gift that I gave to my Nephew from the Netherlands. This is what he picked out from many possible choices. They were sent to him and as far as I know he liked them very much. Apparently, they were very popular in Holland. He was 16 at the time and in high school.
