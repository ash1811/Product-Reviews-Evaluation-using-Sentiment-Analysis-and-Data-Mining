Due to shedding some excess weight I've moved down from 33/32 to 32/32.  Switching from Levi's to Lee's due to heavy cost differential, there seems to be a close mapping between the two brands' sizes.  Very happy with the jeans' comfort and appearance, knocking a star due to the photo misrepresentation (two fewer loops than illustrated) and a tiny stitching imperfection (barely noticeable and certainly not worth returning over) on the lower right leg of the jeans.  Will happily be ordering another pair soon.
