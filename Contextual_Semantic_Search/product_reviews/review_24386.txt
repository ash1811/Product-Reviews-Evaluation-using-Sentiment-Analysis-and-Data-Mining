I'm a Southern girl, and as soon as the weather hits 60 degrees, the standard footwear around these parts are flip flops. So I can honestly say that I've tried out a fair share of flip flops, and Reef's Sandy Flip Flops are by far the best out there. They are comfortable, durable, and affordable.  Plus they look cute with all my summer outfits!
