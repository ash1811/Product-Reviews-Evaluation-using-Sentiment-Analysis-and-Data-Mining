I bought this several years ago and am now ordering a second one. It really works well. Just so you know at first you will think it is too small but once you hook it up it fits snug but comfy. Start from the top when hooking together. It makes my waist look tiny and smooths my little muffin top, helps make tummy look flatter. I have bought several different kinds but this one is the only one I continue to use. Well worth the $30 I spent. I have it in black, in extra small. I am 5'2, 120, I use to be 100-110, but this still fits good. I call it my winter weight lol.
