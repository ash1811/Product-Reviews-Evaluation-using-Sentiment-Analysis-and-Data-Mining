I received promptly but the center stones are not green and amber, they are clear and amber. The stones are not the same color as depicted in the photograph. Shame on Ian and Valeri Co. However, when brought to their attention the distributor immediately replaced the product, comp'd me shipping charges and offered to make it right. Nice to see such great customer service. Ring is nice quality and I like it.
