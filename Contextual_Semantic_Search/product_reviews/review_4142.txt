This bra pokes you in the armpits.  I usually buy Elomi, mostly because it's the easiest to find in my area, but I thought I'd go out on a limb because this bra gets good reviews.  It provides good support but it pokes me in the armpits every time I bend over to pick something up (which I do all day long since I have small children at home.  I would not buy this brand again.
