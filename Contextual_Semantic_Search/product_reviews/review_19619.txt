This boot is exactly what I was looking for in both style and substance. Quality made, good materials, and the waterproofing seems to be working just fine. Comfortable with good support. They are a great boot to wear indoors and out. The only reason I wouldn't give these a five star rating is because they take a while to break in....maybe a little too long. But I will say they were worth the wait....and worth the price, which I thought was pretty reasonable when compared to similar boots.
