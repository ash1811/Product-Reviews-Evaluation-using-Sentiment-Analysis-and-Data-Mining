Classic and simple watch. Looks great with anything, dress up or down. Lady like with understated elegance, especially when worn out, where everyone is in over sized "cheap looking bling" watches. Timex is always reliable. My daughter "borrowed" it for a job interview. She got the job, I think the watch helped!
