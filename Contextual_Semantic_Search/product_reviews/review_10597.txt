I wear a very consistent size 8 and these were a bit snug on the first wearing.  The leather is forgiving though and eased up after 3 or 4 days wearing them to work.  I'd say these shoes are more of a workhorse, practical leather shoe - can't really say they're &#34;cute.&#34;  If you're on your feet a lot or walk distances during your day, I'd recommend them.
