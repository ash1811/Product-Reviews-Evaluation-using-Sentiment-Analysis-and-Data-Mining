My daughter hasn't actually danced in these yet, but I was so happy to find ballet slippers in a narrow width, since narrow kids shoes are very hard to find. I ordered six different sizes from 10-12.5, since the reviews were so mixed about the size, and we ended up with the size 11 Narrow. For us, the sizing is true to size, since my daughter is a size 11 in most other brands. Depending on the width of your child's foot, the sizing may be different for you, since we always have to have a snug fit because her feet are so skinny. Amazon offered free returns on these, so it was very helpful to be able to order multiple sizes and see what fit.The quality of construction seems very good, and the ballet pink color seems true to the photos. My daughter was so excited to put on her own ballet shoes and she can't wait to start class tomorrow!
