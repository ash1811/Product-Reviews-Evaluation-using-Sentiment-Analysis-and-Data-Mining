I am very picky about my dress socks and these are not my favorite.  Tehy certainly do the trick, but I notice my feet get overly sweaty during the workday (relative to my other socks).  I also have a lot of trouble telling these &#34;navy&#34; socks from my black socks.  Although I have this problem with all navy/ black socks, I find the navy to be especially difficult with these.Pros: they seem to be well made and the gold toe is a nice distinguishing mark for purposes of matching socks.Cons: Sweaty feet.I would not recommend these.  I would say to search on here for the docker's 3 packs and that you might be more happy with those.
