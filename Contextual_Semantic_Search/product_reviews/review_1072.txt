The fit is good. The elastic around the waist is very snug, though. I am a small woman and I like high-waisted panties for a smooth line under skirts and dresses. These cut in just enough (waist size = 25 inches) that I don't get a nice smooth line, so I keep these for under pajamas or sweats or lounge-y clothes--stuff where a smooth silhouette doesn't matter.
