I like this brand quite a bit and they have joined Wolverine brand as my top socks to purchase and wear.  My other socks tend to develop holes quite quickly, but these seem thicker than average socks and I've also found that by washing these in warm water WITHOUT BLEACH it does tend to extend their lifespan.
