I have owned variations of these shoes for years.  Skechers makes the best solid black shoe for having a job that requires black shoes and standing on your feet.  I wish they had made these back when I was a waitress.  I now work as a vet tech and tend to work 7-7 which means lots of standing, lifting critters, wrestling unhappy patients and walking on occasionally slick surfaces.  I love these shoes and have been wearing them daily at work since I got them.  Nothing will save your feet 100% from a job like that, but these certainly help.  When these wear out I will buy another pair.  They run true to size so I was completely safe in order a size 8.
