When a company like Levi's, a staple of American society, starts taking the quaility of their merchandise so low that it is this noticable, we are all in trouble.  I have 550s from 2 years ago and 550s that I got today and they are sooo far below the quality of material and weight of the previous pair that I thought they were fake.  So now where are you supposed to go to get quality jeans?  Sad.
