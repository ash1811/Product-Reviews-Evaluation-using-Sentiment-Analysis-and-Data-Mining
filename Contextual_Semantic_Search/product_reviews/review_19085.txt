I have used this brand of tights for dancing for myself for years, and now have purchased some for my daughter who is about to start dance lessons. They fit perfectly, are very well made, and really super soft. They look lovely with her leotard and shoes and she is really excited about getting to wear the whole ensemble for lessons. Highly recommend and will be ordering more in future. True to size.
