I ordered these because of the quality of the Rockport shoe.  I have a wide foot with a sliding arch.  This means that in a nike I can be anywhere from a 15-16 shoe.  The Rockports provide a perfect fit for my foot which is a wide 14.  This is a very comfortable shoe and really gives the support that I have come to expect from a Rockport.
