I'm almost 8 months pregnant so finding just a basic t-shirt is a chore (so sick of wearing my hubby's stuff that does not fit right).  It's light, comfortable, and fits nicely.  When I go out I can throw on this shirt with my big preggo belly and not look like a complete slob.  I plan on putting it my hospital bag when the baby is born so I can lay around in sweats and a t-shirt!
