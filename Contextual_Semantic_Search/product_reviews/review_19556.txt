This rain jacket was bought for a camping trip. My husband found it both lightweight and durable. Would purchase it again.It fit well and packed well, too. He is a larger guy, the larger size did not have the wrist issues noted by other reviewers. It was rainproof for camping in the mountains this summer. Still going strong.
