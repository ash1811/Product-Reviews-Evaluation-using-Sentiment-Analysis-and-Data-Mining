I gave these to my dad for christmas, and he said he LOVES them! he could be saying that bc i bought them for him and he wants to seem appreciative, but he wears them ALL the time, so i think there's truth to his statement. He says they're comfortable and very warm. He was especially fond of them being so warm he didn't need socks. ?? so, fyi! they got two thumbs up from papa bear.
