Without a second thought, these are my favorite panty. They are always true to size, the waist band and color and hold up to washing over and over without much shrinkage. They do however leave a little bit of a panty line, and is more noticeable if you wear slacks or spandex (in which case a thong works best anyway), but i wear jeans for work everyday so it's not as noticeable; who really cares anyway?
