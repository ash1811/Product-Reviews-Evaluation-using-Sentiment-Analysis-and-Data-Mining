This is a watch. It tells time. Nothing much more to say. And, that is why it is so perfect for what it is. I love this little thing! It's small, I can wear it with anything..jeans...suit..cowboy hat...doesn't matter. It's a watch that no one notices. The battery lasts forever and a day so I never have to worry about that. Accurate to a fault. I set it twice a year when daylight savings time starts and when it ends. It is so comfortable that I forget its there. It fits under a shirt sleeve and doesn't bug me when I wear my motorcycle jacket and gloves. Big watches like G-Shocks look cool and seem tough but they are big and hit things. This watch never hits anything so its fine.I have over twenty watches, this one is the one I actually WEAR all the time. There's no light, but that's not a big deal. I've lived without a light for years now and I just don't seem to have a problem turning on a light to see it. Because of the style of the case, its small size, and construction the thing is practically unbreakable. The only complaint I have is that the band is kind of flimsy. I spent $9 and replaced the band with a 16mm black nylon military watch band from Maratac and that solved that. So now I have a watch that I think I could chuck out of an airplane and it would be fine. Ten years from now I bet I'm still wearing this thing. Some things they just get right.
