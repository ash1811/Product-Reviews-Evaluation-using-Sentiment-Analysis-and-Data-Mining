Beautiful earrings but I was disappointed in the weight of the earrings.  The silver is very thin, upon delivery, one of the earrings was slightly bent.  They are so thin that I just bent it back into shape.  If you are expecting heavy, silver earrings...these aren't for you.But very pretty none the less.
