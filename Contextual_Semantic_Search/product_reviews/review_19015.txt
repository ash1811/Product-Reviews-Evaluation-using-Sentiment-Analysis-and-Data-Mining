I really like the way this watch looked, and I am disappointed that I haven't been able to get one that wasn't defective. So far, I have had three defective movements. The first one would lose an hour a week. The second one stopped randomly. The third one did not have a working Indiglo light. Seems like a nice watch, but with poor quality control.
