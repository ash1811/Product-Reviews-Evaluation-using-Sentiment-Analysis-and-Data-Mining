I buy Columbia shirts for my construction man, they are comfortable, breathable, and fit true to size and I do not have to iron them.  He also is an avid fisherman and hunter.  If he is not at work he is in the woods or out on the pond or lake.  After hundreds of washings, from wearing to work or play the color has not faded it has not shrunk.  I highly recommend this brand and style!
