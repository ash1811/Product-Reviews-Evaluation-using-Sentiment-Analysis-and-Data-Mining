This hat is really small.  Too small for my melon, to be sure.  I have a fairly big head (7 1/2) but I don't usually experience too many problems with fit when it relates to stocking caps. Received this one, pulled it out of the box, tried it on and started laughing.  Great hat for a lady or a little kid, but if you're  bloke with a good sized head, spend a couple more bucks and get a carhartt, which is what I should have done.
