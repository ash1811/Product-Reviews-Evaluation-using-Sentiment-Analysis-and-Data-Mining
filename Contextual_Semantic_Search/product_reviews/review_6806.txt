The only bone I have to pick is with the way they are described on this site. I (like another reviewer) thought they would all be denim color. No matter, I can wear the white ones at home and the other colors to work on dress down day. These are the best lighter weight socks I've owned in a long long time. I won't need to purchase anymore cheap socks that fall apart after a few wearings & washings. I hope this company never lets up on it's quality control and never goes out of business. I'll be buying gold toe socks for as long as I am able to wear socks.
