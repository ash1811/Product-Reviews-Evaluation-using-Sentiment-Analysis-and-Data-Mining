Seriously, what's not to love about a toy 45? I love this little toy. It doesn't come with ammo, and I recommend you buying a lot of them because the ammo is small and easily lost. Make sure you put the ammo at the very beginning of the barrel when you load it or it wont come out. If done right, this gun can be great fun for the family.
