I owned Levis 527 Boocuts already and was very happy with the fit.  I wanted a few more pairs.  Normally I wouldn't buy jeans (or any pants) online since I prefer to try them on first but I took a chance since I figured same brand, same size, same cut, same style etc.  I looked at the size of my current 527's and ordered these with the same waist and inseam.  They arrived and I couldn't be happier.  It's a good fit.They are just a tiny bit more snug than my old 527s but still comfortable.The colors are ok.  I ordered Overhaul and Tumbled Black.  The overhaul is fine.  It's a dark blue jean that one could wear casual or with a blazer.  The black is a slightly distressed, faded black.  I would prefer and actual black jean but this seems to be all they offer now.I own an older pair of low-rise, boot cut 527 in Jet Black.  I wish they offered these still.
