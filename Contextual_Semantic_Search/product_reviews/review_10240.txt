It was cheap and had good reviews so I tried it. Bought whatever color was cheapest. Its light and holds a beach towel, a twin sheet, shirt, shorts, two sunscreen, hat, goggles, swim cap, klean kanteen water bottle, keys, iphone, earbuds, money and kindle with no trouble. Its made by Speedo so will likely stand up to years of use.
