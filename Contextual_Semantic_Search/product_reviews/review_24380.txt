I normally wear 8.5-9 in shoes. According to these reviews I needed to order a 10, so I did. I can't ever wear flip flops because it hurts my knees after a while, but I was able to walk around the beach and downtown on our vacation like a champ! Didn't even think about them! I will be ordering more when the weather warms up.
