I've always been a fan of Levi's jeans, for me they always fit great and wear well.These jeans are made in Mexico, which is better than the last pairs I bought several years back that were made in Bangladesh.This fabric is a lot thicker as well, so they are fairly stiff at first but should loosen up after a little wear.Plenty of room as well so no pinching of sensitive areas!
