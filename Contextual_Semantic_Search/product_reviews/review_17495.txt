I bought them for my son and he really likes them.  He tells me they are very comfortable.  I like the way they look too.  This version does not have the steel toe, which is good because he didn't want a steel toe in his work boot.  He normally wears a 10 or 10.5. I had to send the 10.5 back as it was too big; the 10 fits well.
