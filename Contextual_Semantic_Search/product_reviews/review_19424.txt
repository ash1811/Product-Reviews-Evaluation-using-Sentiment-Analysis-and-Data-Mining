I'd read the reviews and was prepared for the fit. I didn't give them 5 starts because the shoe laces are a problem. They will not stay tied and I've tripped a few times because of it. I'm thinking of glueing them together to solve the problem. Other than the problem with the laces, they slippers are fantastic.
