my shoe size is perfect 7. i thought 7/8 would work, considering it should fit size 8 as well, but... this is more like size 6.5, felt very snug plus it was too short in the back too. victoria's secret is doing a promo for free slippers for all pj purchase, so i'm getting those instead since i need some pjs as well. i think the sole is quite comfortable, however i think all the color options are ugly, so is the design. the clog part is the only good part. i'd think about purchasing it if they had leopard or zebra print, or tan color, something more flattering. also i dont like the fabric. but maybe i feel that way because of the odd color...
