This bra is at least 5 inches smaller around the bust than my other 38's.  It also has very little stretch to it, so it is impossible to pull together in the front.  I was very disappointed.  I have ordered from this company before and the bras have fit great, but there is something wrong with the material and sizing of this bra.
