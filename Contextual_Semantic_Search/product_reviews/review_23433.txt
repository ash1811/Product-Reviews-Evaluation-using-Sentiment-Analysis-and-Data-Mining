For men or anyone over 5'10", the strap is too short. The inside small pockets are much to small to hold anything that I can think of and what is put in them will fall out if the bag goes on its side or falls over. The cellphone pocket is too small also for anything but an old-fashioned flip or candybar phone.Otherwise, this is a nice size bag with nice hardware, but nothing about it is really special.
