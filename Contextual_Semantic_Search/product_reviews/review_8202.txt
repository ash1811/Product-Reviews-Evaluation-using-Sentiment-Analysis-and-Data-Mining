I saw the excellent reviews for this slip and thought it would do the trick. I purchased my normal size and it fit, but all day I have to keep adjusting it as it rides up. Very irritating. I'm keeping it for now, because I spent a substantial amount for it, and I need one with my short summer dresses. But I wish it would've worked better for me. I too have a small waist (like another reviewer mentioned where it rode up), but I'm curvy with hips and a butt, so maybe it's not for curvy girls?
