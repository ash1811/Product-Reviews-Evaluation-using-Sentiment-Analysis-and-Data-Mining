I absolutely live in sheepskin slippers during the winter (working from home) and finally needed a new pair. Saw these and am thrilled with them. I am very surprised at the incredible quality and sturdiness of these slippers. Very plush sheepskin lining and thick, durable sole not only for walking outside if necessary but also for added longevity.  The stitching detailing is also more flattering than my Bear Paw or Uggs IMHO. Sizing is true for me - I am standard 6 and these fit perfectly but if you are a half size, definitely order up. I ordered the Sand color (based on price) and thought they may be too light. But they are the same standard tan/taupe color as my other slippers so I'm guessing the All Spice and Root Beer colors are particularly dark. These slippers are every bit as comfortable and high-quality as the more expensive ones I have owned and highly recommend them for yourself or as a gift.
