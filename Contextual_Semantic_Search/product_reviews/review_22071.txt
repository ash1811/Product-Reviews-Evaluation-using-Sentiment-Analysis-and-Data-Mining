I really do not understand all the hype for these shoes.  I guess to scuff around in they are ok but their almost flat contour has very minimal arch support.  They also do nothing to correct common issues with arch and heel alignment which then allows the ankle to cant inward over time.  SO  not worth $70 and marginal even at the sale prices.I don't care how many colors and textures you tart them up with, they are still the same kind of thing my GrandDad AND my Dad wore around the house.

AND as to pricing, more reasonable than these.The one pair I did buy, (because many shoes can feel great at first) now only see occasional use in the yard when I pull weeds.
