I just got my watch and, while it looks similar to the one in the picture, it's not exactly the same.It does have:1) the "8928" engraved on the case back2) the same ASIN number "B000EIA0LW" on the cardboard box as shown on the product page.But, it also has a coin-edge style bezel; the one in the picture is a scalloped design. I actually like the coin-type bezel more, but I'm unsure as to whether the picture on the product page is outdated and the coin style is being used now, or vice versa.It also was missing the new plastic coverings that my other Invicta watches [I have a few others], as well as the usual polishing cloth. It had some finger-print like smudges on the crystals as well. It did have the "MSRP" tag, which had what appeared to be a coffee stain on it...so I concluded it might not have been a new watch. It is working and keeps excellent time [I wound it up manually, which you can do with the Miyota automatic movement on this watch...and I have it ticking away right next to my 2304 "bling" diver], so I decided to keep it.The blue & gold colors on this watch complement each other nicely...I really like the combo...kind of like the Cub Scout colors I had on my uniform when I was a kid ;-).The instructions might confuse some people, so here are the 3 positions you need to know for the crown once you unscrew it from its locked down position:1) unscrewed, it can be manually wound, in one direction [clockwise}...20 to 30 half-turns seems to be good to get it through the night.2) pulled out one small stop, the day can be advanced by turning the crown towards you.3) pulled out one larger stop, the time is adjusted by turning the crown.I will upload some pictures of my watch over the next few days so others can see what they *might* be getting...or might not...
