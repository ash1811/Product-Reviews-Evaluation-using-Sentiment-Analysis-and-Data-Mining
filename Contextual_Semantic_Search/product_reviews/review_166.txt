I bought this for my 2 year old cousin. She has a habit of taking her mothers purse and walking all over with it so I figured it would be perfect. When I first saw it I fell in love with the soft material and girly colors and she absolutely loves it. She always remembers to put her things in her purse so she can be "just like mommy."
