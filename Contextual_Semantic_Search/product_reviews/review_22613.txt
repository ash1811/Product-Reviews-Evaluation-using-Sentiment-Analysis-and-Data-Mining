I had a pricey diver ripped off my arm walking down the streets of Manila on a previous trip. This watch fits the bill. If you surf, windsurf or dive I recommend this watch. Accurate to the extreme. 3 months and has not lost a sec. Luminous dots are highly visible at night. You can wear this to bed and it still glows at 00:00 dark 00:30 in the morning. Simple, inexpensive, waterproof and rugged. The crown looks screwed down, it's so tiny that unconsciously it appears screwed down when it's not. I dove with it unscrewed (40'). The watch survived. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is subjective. I suppose it's the aesthetics, the face is smallish. But good things come in small packages. The price actually went up on this. It was $120. Must no longer be made.
