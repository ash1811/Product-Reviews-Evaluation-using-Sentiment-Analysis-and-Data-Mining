The shoe looks well made, it just isn't as snug as I'd like.  And I wear the Sperry socks.  I added an insole for comfort, but since the existing insole does not come out, this makes my heel sit a little high.  I used to wear shoes like these a lot when I was in my early twenties and sailing.  Thirty years later, I guess my feet have changed!
