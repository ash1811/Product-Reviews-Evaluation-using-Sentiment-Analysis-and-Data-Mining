I don't know if I generally am accustomed to a little more room than the average shoe-wearer, but these seemed to fit true to my size. Very pleased with the shoe and have already received numerous compliments. They are incredibly quiet - in these shoes, people are constantly &#34;underestimating my sneakiness&#34;. Great boot, goes with almost anything - highly recommend!
