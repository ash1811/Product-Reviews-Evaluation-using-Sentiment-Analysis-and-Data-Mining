the closure mechanism is really odd and impossible to use in a hurry.  I added metal snaps, which help. I am thinking about adding velcro instead.  It is perfect if you are traveling and want to keep a lot of stuff with you. I put a kindle, camera, phone, keys, my crocheting, and a book in it.  When  it is not THAT full, it is really floppy.  It is ok, i like it, i don't use a purse all the time so it is surely worth the price.
