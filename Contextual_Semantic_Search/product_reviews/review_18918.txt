VERY comfortable. Even the web band does not irritate as I thought this material might. Great advance over the leather band my long timeTimex Men's T44921 Expedition Classic Analog Watch(or some other design in this line, probably discontinued years ago) had, especially for a vegan like me. No animal had to die to make my watch band, and it is as comfortable as silk.VERY lightweight over all; you would not know it was on your arm, and yet it is always there VERY visibly to check the time unobtrusively at a second's notice. The face I repeat is very visible, which is great, and unobstructed, uncluttered with day and date, which are NEVER visible on a watch face and only take up space. This I just glance at the hands and good to go. I like the way the twenty four hour names are included, like military time, 15 hours being three o'clock in the afternoon etc.So a lot of that which is included in the folder which comes with the watch does not apply, as it is a generic folder in several languages covering a number of models. This is the stripped down model, no frills, just the time, ma'am, just the facts of time.What more do you really need?Great every day watch you won't even know you are wearing, until you need to.
