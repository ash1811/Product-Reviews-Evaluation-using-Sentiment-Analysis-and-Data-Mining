I really like this watch. Is is very easy to setup. I am hoping that I can keep track of the laps I swim. I tried that Oregon swim lap watch and returned it. It was hard to calibrate and use. I just want something to track my exercises. The indiglo feature is really nice. I has always been a Timex fan.
