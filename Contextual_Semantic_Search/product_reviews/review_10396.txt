We have been purchasing Wranglers for my husband for almost 40 years and have recently noticed a diminishing in the quality of the brand.  The fabric seems to be wearing out pretty quickly with hard use.  This had not been true in previous years.  I don't know if the company has decided to cut corners or what, but they are not the sturdy jeans we had previously been able to purchase.  They are good jeans, but don't stand up to hard wear as well as they used to.
