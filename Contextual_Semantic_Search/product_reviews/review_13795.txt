These shorts are soft, and I love the pleasing colors -navy blue, a light blue, and a soft lime. This is a baby gift, and I was happy to have the choice of 6-9 months size. The soon to arrive baby may weigh 12 lbs.. I chose these cute short comfort and ease. I believe they will easily combine with a cute one piece shirt with snaps. I do not know how they will wash, but I have no reason to believe they will not meet reasonable standards of excellence. You will hear more from me if there are serious problems. The shorts arrived on time a nd were well packaged.
