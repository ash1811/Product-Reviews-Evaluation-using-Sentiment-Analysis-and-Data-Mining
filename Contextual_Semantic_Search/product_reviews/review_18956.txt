This is the best $25 I've spent in a very long time!  The watch looks great, feels great, and keeps great time.  I use it as my everyday work watch and people actually comment on it thinking it's a much more expensive timepiece.  I would thoroughly recommend this to anyone who's looking to give their watch a licking but still wants it to keep on ticking!
