These are fantastic! You can stop reading and just buy a pair or two or more, and give them as gifts as I do. They are literally life-savers on the slick ice. I've bought these for family members, friends, and others have bought them after hearing me rave about them. I don't go outside without them in slick weather.My neighbor across the street was shocked when I rang his doorbell in a huge ice storm, to bring his mail to him. He said, "How did you do that? There is no way anyone could make it up that steep driveway." I showed him the Yaktrax and he said, "If that's what did it, I'm buying some" and he did. Now he brings my mail when we have ice and snow.I keep a pair of them in my car just in case I need them.Usually we have more ice than snow, and these work really well with the kinds of ice storms we have. Then we had a snow storm, and they worked equally well. Finally, we had a different kind of snow, which packed into the Yaktrax. They still worked, but the snow was so fine, I guess, and there was so much of it, that it was still treacherous walking out there.All-in-all, I think everyone should have these if you have snow and ice in winter.EDITED years after getting my first pair. I've given away half a dozen now. I don't know how I made it without them. Our weather has been crazy with icy winters. Before getting these I remember some really dangerous situations. These are literally life-savers in my opinion.Comment
