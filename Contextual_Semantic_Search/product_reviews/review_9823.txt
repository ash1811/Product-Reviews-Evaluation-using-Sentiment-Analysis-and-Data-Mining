The Citizen Nighthawk has many useful features, such as the ability to do pilot calculations (since it is a pilot's watch), slide rule calculations, division, tip calculations, dual-time capability, date, operates by a solar cell thus excluding the need for a battery, large luminous hands and markers for readability and low-light visibility, and so on. However, my main reasons for buying this watch are because it looks great on the wrist for both casual and evening wear, it is very comfortable to wear despite its large size and it is very durable and reliable. You can be sure that once you start wearing the Citizen Nighthawk you'll have people coming up to you to compliment on your eye-catching watch.
