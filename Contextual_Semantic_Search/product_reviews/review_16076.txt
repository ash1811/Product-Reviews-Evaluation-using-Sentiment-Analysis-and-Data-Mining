This is the second watch of this particular model I bought. The first one has been running great for the last two years and I had no hesitation in buying another one for my dad. Unfortunately, I realized something was wrong with this watch the moment I took it out of the box. All Automatic watches need a couple of turns of the winder to get them started. The winder on this one offered no resistance what so ever. That in itself was a clue to a bigger problem. Once the watch gets an initial wind, it supposed to be able to wind itself as you move around. This watch stopped within 5 minutes. I wore it for two days, trying to give it enough wind to keep it going, but it still stopped 30 minutes after I took it off.Since the first watch was/is running flawlessly, it's safe to assume that this is simply lack of manufacturer's quality control. Therefore, I will be ordering a replacement once my purchase has been refunded.
