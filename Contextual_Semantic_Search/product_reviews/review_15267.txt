I am a an inch over six feet tall, skinny, and long limbed. So with that being said, take my lanky-ness into consideration with this review. I found that it just wasn't quite as long as I would have liked. I usually wear a large, unless it has long sleeves, then I usually go a size up. I ordered the green in large, and it was too short in the sleeves for me. I ordered a size up in Navy, and it was fine - until I washed it. It shrank just enough. It still fit great, but I found that I was constantly tugging on my sleeves to get that little extra length that I missed. I could order one more size up, but then it would be too big everywhere else.The colors are great and they match very closely to what they have pictured here, and they do seem to be well made. I don't doubt that they will last quite a while. I love the set-in seams. The only complain I had was in the length of the sleeves. If you are looking for a longer bodied/sleeved shirt, try the &#34;sophie&#34; version of this shirt. The material is thinner, as it was meant for layering under tees or over a cami or tank, but the length is perfect for me!Overall, I still like the shirts that I bought, I just push the sleeves up some; I might even cut the sleeves and hem them. I only wish they had this rib material in the &#34;sophie&#34; cut - that would be the best of both world, IMHO. This shirt is nicer than what the price would lead you to believe.**Update** I ordered an XXL in the pink, just to give it one more shot (they are really soft!), and that one is nice and long, but it was a bit baggy every where else (as expected). If it shrinks a bit, it could end up a very good fit. I should warn you that the the pink shirt is just thin enough to need another layer. I imagine the other light colors will be the same.
