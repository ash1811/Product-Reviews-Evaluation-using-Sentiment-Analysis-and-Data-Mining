It's quite comfortable and constructed well, but my wife makes fun of the noise they make.  It has a very aggressive tread and when walking on tile or hardwood it sounds like a bmx bike with knobby tires is coming.  If you are a private eye, don't buy these shoes... you won't be sneaking up on anyone:)
