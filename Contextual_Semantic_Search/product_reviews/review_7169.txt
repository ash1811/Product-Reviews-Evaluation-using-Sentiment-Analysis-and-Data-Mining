I like these low cut socks, but most of the "one size fits all" (usually 6-12 shoe size) that I've found are far too tight on my feet and ankles, cutting off circulation - unhealthy and uncomfortable.  I wear a size 10 1/2- 11 man's shoe.  These are a perfect fit.  They are very comfortable, not too tight, and they do not cut into my skin like the smaller kind do.  I am very happy to have found these.  I have had no problems (so far, anyway) with them slipping or coming off/down, they seem fine.  I hardly notice them which is exactly what I want.The material seems fine to me as well.  Not thick, but thick enough, and I very much like that the band around the top (at your ankles) is not a super tight noose, but just tight enough to do the job.  The bottom part has enough material to be comfortable without being overly thick and seems of decent quality.If I have any problems later, I will come back and post, but I am giving these a big thumbs up at this time.20212-02-17 Update: If you like these and want something in the higher cut style, look here:Gold Toe Men's Cotton Crew Athletic Sock, 6-Pack- I tried them and they are equally good and not too tight.
