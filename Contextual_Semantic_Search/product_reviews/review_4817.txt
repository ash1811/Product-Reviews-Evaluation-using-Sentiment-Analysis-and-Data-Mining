I was looking for a light weight rain jacket and this is exactly that!  I bought it in pewter grey and it looks very nice with most everything.  I wear a medium/large in jackets and ordered a large.  It fits very well...not really roomy but I like the form fitted better than something loose.  If you are going to wear bulky clothing under it, definitely get a size bigger.  I'm very happy with this purchase.
