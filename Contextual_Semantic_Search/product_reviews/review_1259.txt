I like the style. it's water repellant and it is a no-frills bag. I don't need all of that extra foam. I may need to whop somebody with my bag full of lenses someday and I want it to count, should the opportunity dictate such a defensive action.It holds everything I need for specific assignments.It's made in the USA too!
