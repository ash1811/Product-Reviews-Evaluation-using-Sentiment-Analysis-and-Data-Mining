Keds products are reliable and affordable, unfortunately for me, I have swollen feet 90% of the time.  The &#34;tongue&#34; part of this particular shoe was too tight, I could not even get my foot in, so I think for the size, the wide is narrower than other shoe brands.  The rating I gave is completely my fault.  I rarely can find shoes with the kind of top of the foot coverage that I can fit into.  I may have to try a slip on variety with less over the toe coverage, but Keds is a great show brand.
