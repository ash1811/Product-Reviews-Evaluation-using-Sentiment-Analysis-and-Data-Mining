I'm a Wacoal girl, and I found this Lunaire bra just way too stretchy and big. Comfortable, but it looked sloppy on me because the straps couldn't be shortened enough (so I was droopy) and the sides had very little support, so I bulged out over the top of the sides. And the cups seemed to be quite far apart. I am a petite woman, a 34DD, and I think this would be a nice bra on a tall, slim woman. But not on someone like me who needs some shaping and support.
