Like the security BUT be aware that the MOST risky times for your info to be stolen is NOT while in your purse, BUT when you have it out while using it. Equally risky are the info readers that that are illegally  linked up to the machines that you swipe your card through. SOOO with this you are helping you security BUT NOTHING IS AS FOOL PROOF That being said I would like this better IF it could be thick enough to hold a larger phone AND a thin card holder AND a pear of thin reading glasses.Just a 1/2 inch more interior width front to back would be outstanding. I  can fit my cell PLUS a super THIN credit card holder w/small change purse built in, .plus a pen. Thin reading glasses do not fit.Even with less in this it can be tight to get things in and out of it. Hopefully the manufactures will make a new and improved version w/more wiggle room
