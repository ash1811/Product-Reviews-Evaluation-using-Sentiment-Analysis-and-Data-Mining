These are great panties. Wash well and are super comfortable. They do not bunch up and stay put.***I would not suggest purchasing the same panties in LACE, as they do not wear well. They had to be thrown away after a few months, as they tore in random places. I think this is due to not washing them with fabric softner a few times (I ran out) and they shrunk up, or became not as flexible/brittle. Sad day.
