I truly love a great pair of comfortable jeans. But for me, finding those pairs in a half-size, 31x32, is a very tough struggle these days, because a lot of companies stopped making those pairs of jeans. Fortunately, I can always depend from Wrangler, and their Rugged Wear Classic Fit Jeans. They are sleek and stylish in no matter what I wear from the first thing in the morning, all the way to coming home from work at the end of the day. Also, they cost a lot less than those other brands like Levi's or Calvin Klein which might make you feeling a bit more baggy in your steps, and cost a lot more from the hole in your wallet. I absolutely recommend Wrangler Jeans for not just their value, but they truly make your feel rugged no matter where you go.Price: B+Quality: BComfort: A-Overall: B 1/2+
