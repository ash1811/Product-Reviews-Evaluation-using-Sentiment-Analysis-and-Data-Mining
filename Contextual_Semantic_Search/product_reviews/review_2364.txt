we consistently buy levis from amazon. my 16 y/o is 6'1 and we can never ever find any brand of jean in a 34 L except here. he's also slim and most long pants come with a big waist.we can find 30 x34 on amazon esp the levis. he still wears them half down his rear though despite them finally being long enough!
