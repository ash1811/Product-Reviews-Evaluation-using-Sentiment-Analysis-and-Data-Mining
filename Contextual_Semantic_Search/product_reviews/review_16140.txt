This made our vacation much easier because my husband could carry this on his back and grab the other luggage with his free hands. I couldn't help much because I was limited in what I could lift with my pregnancy. This is well made, and fit over our large car seat with a nice amount of padding in the carrier. Would definitely recommend.
