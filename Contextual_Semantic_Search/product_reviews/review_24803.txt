I don't like spending lots of money on sunglasses. I usually end up losing them or sitting on them or just throwing them in my purse with a case.  These are pretty good.  Nice look - they are a little large - my husband thinks they are &#34;Hollywood.&#34; But the block the glare that I want when driving and I like how they look.  Good purchase.
