I love these slippers. I tend to have cold feet and look for slippers that have a fleece lining. I also need something with a sturdy rubber sole so I can take the occasional trip out to the mailbox, etc. these fit the bill beautifully. I wear them everyday and they're very comfortable even if I've been on my feet for long periods to cook, clean, etc. I've reviewed other Ugg products and I've always been a fan. They hold up nicely and the color doesn't fade and the construction is good. I'll always buy this option if I need to update.
