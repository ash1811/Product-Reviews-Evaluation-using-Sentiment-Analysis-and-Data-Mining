Beautiful deep navy blue with white piping and buttons. A classic pajama set. Size is precise. My only complaint is the top is cut straight from armhole to hem, no flair, no extra room. If you have a tummy :) get the next largest size. Large seems to be made for height of approx. 5'8", so consider going up a size or to a tall, if you need longer bottoms. All in all, a typically exceptional Izod product from a trustworthy Flordia retailer. Very satisfied!
