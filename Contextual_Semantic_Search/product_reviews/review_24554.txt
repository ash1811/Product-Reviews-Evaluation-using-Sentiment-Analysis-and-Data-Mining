Never bought a jewelry cloth. This one, as far as I can tell, is the Ferrari of jewel cloths. I use it in combination with my professional grade sonic jewelry cleaning machine. The result of the dual cleaning process is stunning. The two step cloth cleaning is excellent and for the price plus Prime, a no-brainer.
