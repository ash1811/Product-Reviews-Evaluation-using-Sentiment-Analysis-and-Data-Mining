I bought this watch for my boyfriend's birthday. He loves it because not only does it look sharp but it's big enough for him being 6'4", 300lbs with large hands. I love it because I saved a lot of money buying it from Amazon instead of a jewelry store. It's a great masculine watch that's versitle enough for casual days as well as nice nights out.
