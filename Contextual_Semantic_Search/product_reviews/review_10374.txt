The product promises a lot but delivers very little. When you touch is you feel unpleasant touch, rough. While it probably cleans something, as it becomes black while rubbing it against the piece of jewellery, it definitely leaves the piece in the previous, unshiny look. It also leaves stains in your fingers.
