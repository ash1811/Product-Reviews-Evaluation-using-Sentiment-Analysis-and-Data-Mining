I've worn Reebok Princess tennis shoes for many years cause I found them to be very comfortable from the first day I put them on.  However, this pair is very disappointing and I'll have to return them.  I ordered the same size as always but these are way too large.  And, what happened to the awesome arch support in these shoes?  This pair didn't have it at all.
