EDIT:  I just ordered four different pairs of shoes, two Puma, one Arcata Keens, and the SeeVees.  Gave a favorable review to the latter, but fact is the right shoe cuts inward at the heel top, just like the Arcata Keens do.  The Pumas (see my review of June 11 2013) didn't have rubber soles, so I didn't even bother trying them on when they arrived today.  So will get another pair of these Reeboks, to avoid heel chafing.  Everything else, either has those clunky soles which make no sense if you're moving, or if soled LIKE the Reeboks, still lack innersock cushioning at the heel.  Wow, I had no idea shopping for sneakers would become this time-consuming!Original review, follows below, on the Reeboks I had.  Considering the above, the 20-year problem of the soles hardening, is a minor issue.  So I'll just buy another pair of these Club classics, or the gummed red ones.  However, will inspect them in a store prior to buying, if I can.  Not sure the quality will be the same as before.============I was looking for a replacement pair of sneakers here on Amazon, and couldn't find these Reeboks until after I'd bought other shoes.  The ones here, I've owned since sometime in the 1990's.  Had to throw them out a few years back, because the soles became hard and slippery with age (i.e., when walking in Walmart).The only other wear, was on the inside cushioning.  Because it is terry cloth, depending on how your foot moves around, the terry cloth will wear out, so leaves holes from the rubbing.  Else it's a good shoe.What worries me, is that the price here, is nearly the same as what I paid 20 years prior; so I wonder if the quality has declined.  I believe my shoes were made in Korea.  Not sure about the ones here.Would appreciate someone's comment, so that any viewer can be better informed.  I wanted to review these shoes in an older version, so one might have a sense of the longevity.  I used the shoes all the time, and especially for racquetball.
