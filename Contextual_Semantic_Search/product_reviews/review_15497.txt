Love this product.  Great price, cheaper than walmart.  Great quality.  Could have easily cost twice as much.  you get 3 bodysuit per listing.  And there are so many different sizes to choose from all the way to 24 months.My baby has a big head so I was having a very hard time to find a bodysuit or any shirt for that matter that I can easily put her head through.  She always screams like she is pain every time that I would have to dress her.But NOT this product.  The neck area is great and wide.  Baby doesn't scream anymore.Great for layering underneath other clothes or just wear this by itself.I would buy again.  And with so many different sizes, this product can grow with your baby.  You get 1 size per listing.  So when my baby needs a larger size, I will have to make another purchase.  But item is great quality, and arrives very fast with Prime shipping.
