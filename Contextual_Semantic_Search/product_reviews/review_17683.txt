I purchased these shoes for a friend. These remarks are what she thinks of them: "These are comfortable shoes, once stretched. I found then a bit tight, even though I take a size 10 medium, which is the size I ordered. Once they fit comfortably they are good shoes. Walking is comfortable, & I do lot's of walking. I would not hesitate to purchase them again, but maybe at that time I might choose a bit larger in size. I highly recommend them.
