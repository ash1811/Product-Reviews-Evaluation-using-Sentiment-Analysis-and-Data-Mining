Pros:-Absorbs sweat-Dries *kinda* fastCons:-Gets ruined easily; backpack straps, anything velcro, they will tear at the material and ruin it REALLY quickly.-Though it absorbs sweat, that sweat SHOWS-Doesn't look good. Definitely not a shirt you can wear out. (IMHO)Definitely wouldn't buy a shirt with this material again.
