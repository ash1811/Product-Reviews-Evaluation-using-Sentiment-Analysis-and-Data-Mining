I have one of these bags from several years ago. I have used and used it and it is not in the least bit worn. I decided to replace it after a black marking pen leaked and left a large permanent stain - definitely not the bag's fault. Now I have my new bag. Will I keep it? Yes.I read recent reviews saying Baggallini had changed the bag eliminating many of the interior pockets. I went ahead and ordered the bag as the old one had far more pockets than I ever used anyway. The bag came and indeed the interior of the bag has been redesigned with quite a few missing extras. Outside compartments have only 1 small pocket instead of 2 and the mesh water bottle holders are gone - I loved these for glasses. The interior has only 1 zippered pocket as compared to 3 before, the cell phone pocket is open allowing the cell phone to fall out (on the positive side it is bigger and will hold a larger phone). And most upsetting NO KEY FOB! I need a key fob and will have to jerry-rig something. Finally the zippered wallet is missing the id viewer on the outside.The first customer review reporting changes to the bag is from July 2012. It is now the end of October. That is too long for an inaccurate product photo and description.
