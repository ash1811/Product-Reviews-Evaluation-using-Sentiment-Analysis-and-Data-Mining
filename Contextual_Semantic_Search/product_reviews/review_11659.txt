I love these Minnetonka Moccasins.  I have them in white, black, brown, and grey.  They are the MOST COMFORTABLE shoes I own.  They look cute with shorts, casual maxi dresses, or even casual shorter dresses.  I wear mine with just about everything.  They do run a bit big, so maybe order a half size down.
