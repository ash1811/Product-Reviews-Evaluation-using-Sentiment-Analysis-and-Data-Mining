I was looking for new walking shoes from a different brand.  They discontinued my favorite shoe and while looking, the search sent me to these shoes. Easy Spirit Romy walking shoes. They had great reviews, the price was right so I decided to try them. I will never go back to my old brand. These shoes are the lightest weight, most comfortable walking shoes I have ever worn. They fit perfect. I am beyond happy with these shoes. Highly recommend.
