I have a small frame so the classic wayfarers are a little too big for me. This is just perfect. I can wear with anything and it looks good. I bought the black frame with black lenses. It is definitely worth buying an original since the quality of the lens is infinite times better.I bought this a while back and they have not scratched or broken, I think this is a record for me. The case on the other hand... the tip of the flap below the button has snapped off. A little disappointed. I wish I could buy just the case since I prefer a hard case to a soft one since the glasses live in my overstuffed purse and protects it better.
