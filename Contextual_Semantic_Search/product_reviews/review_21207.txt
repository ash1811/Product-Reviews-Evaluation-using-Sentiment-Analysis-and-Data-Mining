Living in SoCal, flip flops are a year-round pleasure so it's only right that I get a good pair and these are them!I usually just go for the $5 cheapie flops that wear paper thin or have the little thong pop out. Silly me, huh? They destroy my feet and make my back hurt..I realize my base of comparison isn't great, but these really are the most comfortable flop I've ever owned. I saw so many amazing reviews that I knew I should just dive in and get them. Boy was everyone right! :D  I suppose my one complaint is that they are not made in the USA. Mine didn't come with the little gem on the side either, which is fine for me because I think it looks tacky!
