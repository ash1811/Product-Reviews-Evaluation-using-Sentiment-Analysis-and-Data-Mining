I love this tote bag.  Its used for my everyday commute.  Its very strong and I love the fact that it's washable.  I can fit my lunch, cosmetic bag and a pair of office shoes - it also has two smal compartments for keys, cell phone, etc.  - it doesn't fasten at the top -but that's not an issue with me.
