Strange most people say this item runs small. They may seem a little bit stiff but I think it's because they are leather but they break in relatively well if you go through a day or two of minor very discomfort. It seems to be better for the long run considering they aren't cheap. Maybe because this is my second pair I am thinking ahead about how they wear over time. What I bought the first time I ordered is a half size smaller than what I usually wear, I did the same this time around too. Because they are real leather, as they wear they get loose so I like a snug fit for when they break in so when they get older they won't look sloppy.I am a flat footed and wide footed solid 10 any other time but I always get the 9.5 and a year later after wearing them most days of the week that entire time, day fit pretty sloppy. Couldn't imagine how crappy they'd fit had I gone with a 10. My right foot is bigger in some places than my left so in all actuality the only minor discomfort I had even from buying a size down as I let these break in is actually only my right foot, not even my left even though it is still a true 10, as well. I don't have disposable income for everything, so strategic planning has worked for me thus far for sizing these. These are good for everything and anywhere.
