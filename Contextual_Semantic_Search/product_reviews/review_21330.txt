These were a Christmas present for my Hubby, he needed another pair of work shoes.  They look great, but they don't wear as great as they look at least not yet.  They are somewhat small in the width, but the length is possibly a tad too long.  Both issues are exacerbated by the stiffness of the leather, which should soften over time with wear (at least that is the hope).  He does plan on keeping them and has bought heal guards to help with the break-in process.
