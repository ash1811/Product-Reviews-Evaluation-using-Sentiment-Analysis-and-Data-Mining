Mine came with no instructions, but the expanding/contracting triangular configuration of the wrench mechanism seems intuitive enough.  The problem is, I have yet to experience any success in prying loose the back of a dead watch for replacement of the battery.  I haven't put more than 5-10 minutes into the project, so I have no doubt, especially based on other consumers' reports, that I will catch on and succeed eventually.Still, why is it so unthinkable to include an instruction sheet with a diagram or two?  And why are watches built to make battery replacement the most user-unfriendly of all projects?  3-4 tiny screws in the back would be preferable to these screw-out covers, which simply offer no surface area for the mechanism to grab on to.
