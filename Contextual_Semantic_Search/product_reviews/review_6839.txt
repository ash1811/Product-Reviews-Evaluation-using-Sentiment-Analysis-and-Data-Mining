I've used the Gold Toe product line for a number of years and usually really like it.  However, it seems that changes in manufacturers has changed the quality of this product.  Overall, the fit is fine and I hope they wear as well as in the past.  But what I don't like about them is the seam across the toes....it's too thick and rubs my toes.  In the past, this seam was woven into the 'told toe' portion of the sock and didn't cause any blisters due to rubbing.  Gold Toe socks for men don't have such a large seam, but is woven into the 'gold toe'.
