There are two basic problems with this.First, the spring loaded platform that holds your watch bracelet is too stiff. The spring loading takes a lot of pressure to hold down so fine adjustments are impossible. This makes it difficult to line up the push pin exactly with your bracelet's pin.Second, the plastic collar that guides the push pin is too fragile. Mine split after the second use.This is going in the trash. Bah.
