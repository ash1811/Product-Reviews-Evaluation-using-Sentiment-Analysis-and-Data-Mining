I purchased one of these in black to sport under my Orioles jersey when watching baseball. I thought the other brand name shirts were too costly for what they are. I am 150lbs, 5' 7" and a Medium fit perfect - even after washing the fit was very comfortable. The material is about a medium thickness and it has a nice thread count. The sleeves were a little long before washing, but have shrunk to the right size afterward.My main reason for buying this brand was the logo on the sleeve. It just looks cool. But it really is a nice, sporty shirt that costs way less then the others in it's class.
