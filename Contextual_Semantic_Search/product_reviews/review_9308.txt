The material and construction are excellent, but unfortunately, I had to take mine to the tailor since there was a gap between the pants and my backside.I'm 5'5"tall and weight 106 pounds, if that's any help in your decision. That's why I wear a size 4.I like my pants long [cover my shoes] and these were perfect. I rely on pockets and these have nice pockets all around. I've worn these a few times, didn't get them dirty and haven't had to launder them because they keep their shape.I'm giving these pants a three-star instead of five because I had to spend an additional $12 to have the mid-rise waist altered.But if you have a thicker mid-rise waist, then they should be a good fit. I do wear a size 4 in other casual khaki brands and don't have a gap in the waistband.
