I'm a tall, heavy guy ("proportionally heavy"), and as a result have big thighs. In the past I've bought relaxed fit jeans to make them more comfortable when sitting. However, I've noticed 550's for the past few years are actually more constraining and LESS comfortable for me than 501's. Plus, I miss the button fly. I don't think this was always the case, but it certainly is now.These are still great jeans, but I'm disappointed with the 'relaxed fit' part. I'm sticking with 501's moving forwardJeans: 40 W, 34 L, black colorMe: 6'2", 235 pounds
