But what is holding them ON??? There's no sticky, nothing.  Just my body heat I guess but the bra can't be loose at all... no show though and no these do not show either... wasn't "life changing" for me, but I can now wear bras I couldn't before with white t-shirts...so that's something.You only get one "leftie" and one "rightie"... I thought this was a package of many of them for some reason.  I opened it up and thought - I paid $10 for each one of THESE?Okay. Someone is really getting rich off this product / they probably cost pennies to produce, but they do work...I do wish they had some sticky on the back or option to have to hold them on...in case I bend over and my bra shifts alot.... hmmmm.  I may find some body glue of some sort and use that...I'm not RAVING about this like everyone else is here... I only got two of them, if I lose 1 I have to buy two more...okay.
