My boots arrived before the expected delivery date and I was thrilled because it was an exchange of a Christmas gift from my parents.  My first pair of boots I ordered fit too snug and I decided to exchange it for a bigger size.  I recommend going up one size as they run half size too small.  I love the color and the feel.  All UGG boots are made with an almost wide foot to fit everyone's feet.  It is roomy enough to wear with socks and without.  I recommend wearing them with socks as it absorbs odors and lasts longer.  The color is just beautiful.  All my friends order tan and brown while I wanted to fit in with style, I set my own color for a different touch.  My mom keeps reminding me of this so that I can become independent in my choices and decisions.  Thanks Mom for looking out for me, and thank you Amazon.
