I bought a pair of Isotoner Women's Terry Ballerina slippers to pack in my suitcase when we were leaving for Europe last summer. Nothing could be more convenient. I kept them on the nightstand of every motel and hotel room we stayed at when driving from Tucson to the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal. When I got out of bed I put them on. I took them off when I got back into bed. After all, you never know what's going to be on those motel room floors! They were just as convenient on the Queen Mary 2 when we were sailing back and forth across the North Atlantic. I could even use them the same way in the hotels we stayed at in Germany and Austria on our 10-day driving tour. These slippers were very durable and washable, too. They were still going strong when we arrived home 76 days later after driving back across the country to Tucson. I couldn't recommend them more.
