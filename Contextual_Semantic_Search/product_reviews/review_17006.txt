These boots are not only great looking they are the most comfortable boots I own. Wore them in this last blizzard when it was well below 0 degrees and I did feel a little cold in the toes but hey, it was exceptionally cold. I do have one fear and that is seeing the video and other ratings about the rubber splitting from the leather. If this doesn't happen the boots deserve the 5 star. If they split I'll be very disappointed to say the least..
