Bought this hat for a cheap headcover for an African safari. It definitely did the job, but it's a bit small for a size M/L. I'd say it's closer to a S/M, or even just a Small. It still provided ample cover.It's also ugly, but I guess I can't really knock that since the pictures wouldn't for a moment suggest otherwise.Also, it's really ugly.... Like... really ugly.
