I bought 4 pairs of these pants/scrubs, black, olive, tan, and grey. 3 pairs are perfect. The black pair is labeled the right size, but it is actually a full size too small, or it shrunk way too much in the wash. I can still fit them thankfully, but I can only used them for office use. Which defeats the point since I bought them to work on the floor with kids on asd spectrum. The other 3 pairs are awesome. They wash well, don't wrinkle, are slimming and look professional. I will order again but I'll double and triple check all the sizes before and after the wash, instead of just checking the label.
