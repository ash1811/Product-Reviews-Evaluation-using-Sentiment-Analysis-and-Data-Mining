As noted by another reviewer, the current model 9312 does NOT have a screw-in crown. So, I'm wary of the claim of 200m water resistance. That said, I love the Invicta model 9312 watch. It is really, really accurate. I set my 9312 two weeks ago with the atomic time website. 14 days later it was still dead on -- to the second. This is the most accurate watch I've ever owned.I also have the automatic (self-winding version), Invicta model 8930. They look almost identical but that model 8930 self-winding watch loses a couple minutes a day, and will sometimes stop in the middle of the night (on my arm) if I don't manually wind it. But, the model 8930 does have a screw-in crown and I can attest to its waterproof qualities.I liked the look and feel of the model 8930 so much that I bought the 9312 with the Swiss Quartz movement hoping it would be a better time-keeper. Good decision. For those potential buyers out there -- GO QUARTZ!! And FYI, the model 9312 is a bit lighter and thinner than the model 8930 automatic -- which is good.I thought the gold plating would be a bit blingish, but I actually like it much more than raw stainless. The gold-plated band has a softer, warmer feel than stainless -- it really is quite noticeable. The plating makes the band smoother to the touch and it seems to warm to body temperature faster.Does the model 9312 have flaws? Well the warranty isn't so great and my second hand doesn't line up perfectly with the minute markers. The band closure doesn't have the fancy push-buttons like my Seikos. Other than that it's a great watch, one that draws compliments (even from Rolex owners) all the time. When I say I wear this instead of my TAG Heuer because the Invicta is more accurate (and better looking) that says a lot. If you can grab one on sale -- go for it!I would give this watch 5 stars if it had a screw-in crown and the second hand aligned correctly.
