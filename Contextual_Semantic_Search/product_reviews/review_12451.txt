Gift for my other half's promotion.  He loves it.  Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that with these mesh bands, there is a small metal plate where it attaches to the watch on each side that doesn't bend.  It is a little awkward to wear at first and can look funny if your wrist is too small.  We own a couple of skagens and they are great watches.
