I bought these for my husband this Christmas 2013. They look really nice and look like they are made very well also. He said his feet get to hot in them but he gets hot to easy as it is. I told him to wear socks with the slipper and it would be fine. He looked at me strange I said you wear socks with your boots and shoes dont you and your feet don't sweat do they? Over all he wears them great for indoor and outdoor use.
