I wear a 34 waist in everything, so it seems like a 36 coverall ought to give me adequate room, but I have to take my wallet out to wiggle into these coveralls.  Maybe this is my mistake for not checking the size in the store before buying from Amazon.That said, Carhartt makes legendary work clothes, as durable as they come, and these are no exception.  I wear them on my Harley riding to work at 5:30 in the morning and my legs are nice and toasty.
