I've been looking to purchase this Citizen time piece from Amazon for the last few months, but never could pull the trigger. To my surprise, I rec'd it as a anniversary gift from my GF just last week :-D At first impression out of the box, overall the fit and finish is of high quality and fits the price point. On the negative sides, the directions(manual and cd-rom) makes setting up the time, calendar, date on the watch way too complicated. I found myself going over it over and over again till I happen to stumble upon the right sequences to set the watch correctly.I'm an avid watch collector and some of my very high end time pieces are easier to set up than this watch from Citizen. The alarm is perfect and does the job of waking me up from my slumber. I have yet to see the effectiveness and potental of the perpertual calendar.The uni-directional bezel is way to tight when turning counter-clockwise, I almost thought it was defective at first. The luminous hands, dial markers and center mark on the bezel shine brightly.Overall, I like this time piece from Citizen and welcome it into my ever expanding collection of wrist watches.
