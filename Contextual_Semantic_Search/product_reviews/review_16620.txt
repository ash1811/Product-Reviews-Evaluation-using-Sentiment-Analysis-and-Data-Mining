I have been buying  Wrangler's - Men's Cargo Jeans but they were wearing out in a few months.  These jeans are made from a far superior and more durable material but for only about $10 more.  I wish they had the same velcro pockets and a cell phone pocket in each cargo pocket but other than that I am sure these will last for a couple years.  Very Excellent.
