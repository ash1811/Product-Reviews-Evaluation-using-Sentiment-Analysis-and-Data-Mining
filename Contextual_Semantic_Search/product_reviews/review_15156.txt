This is supposed to be a &#34;Born to be Worn&#34; t-shirt, but instead they sent me &#34;Beefy-T&#34; shirts which are a different cut. While the Beefy-T's aren't too bad, they're much wider especially at the arms and seem to be slightly larger at the shoulders than expected. Unfortunately, they charge shipping costs to get a replacement, so it's not worth returning them due to their low price.The Beefy-T is an alright shirt: it's pretty sturdy yet soft and a decent trunk length though the width is a bit on the large size. It really only looks good on heftier people, particularly buff guys-- especially with the sleeves. Not exactly my body type, but it'll have to do. I'm quite disappointed with their false advertisement.
