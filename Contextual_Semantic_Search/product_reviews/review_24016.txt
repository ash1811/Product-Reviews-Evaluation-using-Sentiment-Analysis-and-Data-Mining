I bought these pumps in November for wear with pantsuits, slacks, and dresses.  I don't like extremely high heels because I am tall and also because I like to walk quickly (I find very high heels to be a hinderance).  I got them in black.  They weren't too exciting but functional.  Or so I thought... I didn't wear them THAT many times - maybe twice a month maximum. I have 5 pairs of black heels counting this pair. Notwithstanding this relatively infrequent wear, the plastic cap on the heel wore completely through to the metal by June (yes - within 7 months of relatively infrequent wear).  I wasn't pleased.  Normally I have a good experience with Nine West shoes, so I was surprised.  I wonder if one of my shoes was defective.
