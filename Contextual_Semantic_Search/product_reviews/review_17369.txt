This was a great kit for my clown makeup for Halloween this year.  I was a bit disappointed that things were not packaged in a way that they could be reused very easily.  I ended up cutting up the plastic cover from the packaging to try to salvage some of it for next year.  But the makeup worked great for my clown costume.
