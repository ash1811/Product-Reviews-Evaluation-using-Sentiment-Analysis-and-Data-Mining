Received these boots and fell in love. Unfortunately, I have to give these boots a low review as, after ordering a size 7 AND size 8, I had to return them both!!! They are SO cute and well made (the soles are pretty flat, not a lot of cushion, but that may not matter to many).  I believe several other reviewers have noted that they run small. That is very true.  I got a size 7 and have a slender foot, but could barely get my foot in. Once in, though, I found the foot part to be too small, however the opening did fit over my calf.I returned the 7 for an 8 and will review that when it arrives.  I LOVE that Amazon does free shipping/free return!  That's the ONLY reason I shop online.UPDATE: I received the size 8 a couple days ago. SO disappointed. The foot part fit well enough - it was a bit big, but I wanted enough room to put in an Insole, BUT I couldn't get the opening over my calf. I have very average sized calves. I decided to measure the opening and to my surprise it was over an inch smaller than the description. The description says around 13", and the opening was maybe 11.7". It was also just strange that the size 7 opening was ok, but the size 8 wasn't.  Sadly, I must return them. I then decided to go to the local Nordstrom and buy them there as I could try them on first.  I got a size 8 and the foot AND opening fit great (with an insole)!!!
