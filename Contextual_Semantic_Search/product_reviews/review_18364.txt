Ordered these for my son who lives in West Virginia. It gets cold there in the winter. He was glad to have the soles as he walks up and down stairs to get to his workshop in the basement and sometimes needs to step outside on the deck in the snow. Seems to keep his feet warm and are very comfortable.
