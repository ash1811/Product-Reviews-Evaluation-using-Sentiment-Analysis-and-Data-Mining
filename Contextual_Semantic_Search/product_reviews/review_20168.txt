Not just for looks, these boots are very well made.  They are thickly lined with remove-able fleece liner, the leather suede is thick to hold up for real hiking.  The sole of the shoe has deep treads to help you get a good grip even in slippery muddy places.The size is true, so if you are an 8 1/2, I would recommend getting the 9 not the 8.
