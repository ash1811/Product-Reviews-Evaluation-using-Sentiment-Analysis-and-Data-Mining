I have three pairs of adidas three strips pants, in various colors.  I needed to size up, and wanted the same pants I bought as many as 10, as few as 3, years ago.These are not those pants.This material is inferior, the cut is inferior, basically everything is worse in these pants than the ones I already own.That being said: If I hadn't already owned three pairs of adidas three stripes pants, I would have been happy with this purchase.  The pants are okay.We'll see in another 10 years if this (inferior) material is built to last like its predecessor. :)
