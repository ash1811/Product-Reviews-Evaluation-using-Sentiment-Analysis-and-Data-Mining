I bought this watch for my husband for Valentines Day. The watch is beautiful and perfect for a man with large wrists. My husband was really excited when I gave him the watch. It makes him look sophisticated. I would recommend this watch for any man out there whos looking for a dressy/sporty watch but without the huge price tag. Ps. Looks very expensive.
