Great lift, See thru, fits OK, straps NOT elastic so if you move much they tend to go off the shoulder, cups a bit large compared to my other bali bras while around chest/back is just a bit smaller.  Comfy and smooth everywhere except where cup wire terminates under the armpit - scratchy there after an hour or so - which means I wore it and can not return.
