I bought one of these for my son in Heather Grey, but when I received it I realized I ordered it too small and it just happened to fit me! :)  It is extremely soft on the inside and keeps me very warm. Plus having the pocket on the front keeps your hands toasty too.  A great price on Russell Athletic and worth every penny!
