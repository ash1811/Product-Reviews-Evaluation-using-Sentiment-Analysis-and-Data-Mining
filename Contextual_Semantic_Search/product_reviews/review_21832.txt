Great tie for $7.95. I may buy more. I hope K. Alexander makes ties just like this in other colors and with patterns.Pros:1. Great knot, perfect for a Half Windsor knot. It will not be too big.2. Great dimple under the knot.3. Great fabric. It has a shiny satin sheen, which is nice. The fabric is 100% polyester with a very fine weave.4. Perfect, medium thickness.Cons:5. This is definitely not a high quality $50 silk tie. I would not wear this to a wedding or job interview. This is an everyday tie where you don't start crying if you spill food on it.
