I got this wallet faster than I had anticipated and to be honest, it looks better than the picture. The picture's color looks like a sickly shade of pink, but in reality, it's more of a pinkish mauve. With marble effect. The quality is pretty good. There is a plastic card holder that holds about 5 cards. The wallet itself has 8 card slots and the metal clasp for the coin area is gold colored.
