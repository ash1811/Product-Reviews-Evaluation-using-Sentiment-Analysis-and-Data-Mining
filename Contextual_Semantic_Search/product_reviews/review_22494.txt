I could not have made my wife happier with any other present than this watch that is constantly set at the correct time, is beautiful to look at and should never need the maintenance of replacing a battery. Every quartz or battery operated watch, that she has ever owned, has always let her down at one time or another because of battery failure. Then always comes the question as to where to take the watch to the change of battery, which can be a costly affair. Again, this is a SOLAR operated watch--NO BATTERY! But there is nothing that would lead you to believe it was anything but a feminine watch for a woman to wear for any occasion.SMS
