My wife bought these for work.  We work in a law office and she was tired of uncomfortable suit pants and nylons.  She ordered these after reading so many other positive reviews.  Thank you Amazon reviewers!  You got it right again.  My wife has been wearing these to work with a suit jacket and they look nice enough for her to go to court (no one would say anything!).  She said that they are extraordinarily comfortable, and they really look good.  They do not have shape control, so if you are looking for that, you will have to try another pant.  My wife wears these pants with Clarks clogs, and they look completely professional.  One woman lawyer came up to her and work and was complimenting the pants and was stunned to see that they were actually yoga pants - she had to touch the fabric and could not believe that they were this soft cotton that looks like a work pant.  My wife is 5'6 and 135 pounds, and she ordered the large (these run a little small, since she would ordinarily order a medium).  They cost us $14.89 on Amazon - how can you beat that for your work pants?  Anyway, they look good and are machine washable (no dry cleaning) and are very comfortable - What more can you ask for.
