My husband has worn this exact kind of Ironman watch for about 10 years.  He got his first one a decade ago as a gift from my mother, and since then has had 2 replacements, the most recent being one I got him for Christmas this year.  He wears the watch primarily to work in a factory, so it gets banged up quite a bit.  If he didn't wear it to work, the watch would last much longer.This version of the Ironman watch is an improvement over the last one he got a few years ago.  There's now a way to toggle the options on the watch on or off, so you don't have to scroll through all options every time you want to set just one.  There are 3 alarms while the previous version had 2, and my husband prefers this kind of Indiglo rather than the older kind.  The only problem with the watch is the band.  It was the weak spot in the 2 previous watches my husband wore, breaking long before the watch itself broke.
