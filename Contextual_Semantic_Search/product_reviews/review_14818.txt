It's a good choice for when a tee is too casual but a regular shirt might get ruined, and collar points might be dangerous.  So far stains come out without much trouble.  Length is good for me, I'm 6-1, which is too tall for a Regular and not tall enough for some Tall sizes.  Unless you're exceptionally long-bodied, if you're between 6-0 and 6-5 this should be right.
