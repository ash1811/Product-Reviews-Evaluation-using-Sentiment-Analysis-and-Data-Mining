This is an adorable little purse. It has three zippered pocket areas and the main compartment is also divided in half. So it is easy to separate cash and credit cards from makeup and cell phone. After years of carrying larger bags to accommodate electronic devices, it is nice to get back to basics with a small, well-made little bag. I like this so much I have ordered it in several colors.
