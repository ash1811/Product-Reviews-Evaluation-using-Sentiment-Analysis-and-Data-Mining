UGG Ascot slippers are really great looking leather Venetian style driving loafers with a full, thick  shearling lining. They definitely kept my feet warm on a recent 8 degree morning. I typically wear an 11 1/2 or 12, so went with a 12. They are a little cramped at the toe end, due to the wool lining, but I think 13 would be too big.
