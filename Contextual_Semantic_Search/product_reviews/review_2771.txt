I bought this for my daughter for xmas.  She was delighted!!!!  She has yet to actually *wear* it, but I think it's adorable, and it the time it displays is in keeping with my perception of the time-space continuum, so, thumbs up!  I might take to wearing this myself, if it will fit around my adult wrist!
