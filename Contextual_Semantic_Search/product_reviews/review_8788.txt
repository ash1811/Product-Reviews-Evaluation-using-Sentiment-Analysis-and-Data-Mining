I have been searching for a front close bra that actually fits, comfortable, and does not flatten the breasts and I have it!!!  Ordering some more in different colors.  I was looking for seamless cups, but this fabric is soft so the seams do not irritate. It also falls beautifully against the back and helps posture.  I would definitely recommend.
