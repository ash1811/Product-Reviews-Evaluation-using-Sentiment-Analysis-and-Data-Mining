These are FITTED JEANS!  That said I'm size 36 x 30 and over the past couple months I ordered some wranglers Jeans of my original size and they were really humungous and I started to think that I'm no longer that size...I almost ordered these 34 x 30...but low and behold when they arrived these jeans fit me perfectly in my 36 x 30 size unlike the oversized wrangler jeans.  Levis has done it again...I swear the pair I got was tailor made for me...I love them, I'm a runner plus I do squatts so these Jeans show off my power legs and sexy behind the ladies love me in these.....these are deffintely a good buy...I bought a black and I'm seriously considering getting another pair in a different colour.
