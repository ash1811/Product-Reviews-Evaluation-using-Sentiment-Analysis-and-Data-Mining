I really like canvas bags like this one. When you buy this, keep in mind that it is really small. You will have a difficult time using it for work or as a every day carry bag. That being said, it was priced well and is well made. I wish they made the same thing only bigger - I love the buckle on it and wishes the other Rothco bags had them instead of Velcro.
