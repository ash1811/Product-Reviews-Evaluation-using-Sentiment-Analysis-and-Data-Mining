When I ordered them I thought they looked beautiful in the picture but when I got them they were even more beautiful.  The candy jade swirls were swirls of pink and green.  Above the jade were crystals of pink and green These earrings are unique.  I think they are my favorite from gem avenue.  but I love them all.  Never seen earrings anywhere like this.  Thank you for bringing them to us.
