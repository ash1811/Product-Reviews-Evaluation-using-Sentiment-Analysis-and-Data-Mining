Although I personally prefer the (now-discontinued) Jefferson and Washington models from Dockers (which were very similar to these Rockports in design and style but more comfortable) I'll admit that these are excellent. They have a simultaneously casual and dress-casual styling and aura and go well with both khaki pants and jeans.  As with most Rockport shoes the overall quality of both craftsmanship and built is excellent.
