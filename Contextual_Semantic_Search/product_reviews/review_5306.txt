I now have 3 pair of these in different colors. I normally wear a woman's size 7-8 and I order size Medium in these. I like how they fit me. Baggy and very comfortable. Love the length. I'm 5'6&#34; and they are quite long enough. These are very well made pants. I have had my first pair for a couple of years now and they show no signs of wear at all. And now that these are fulfilled by Amazon I can get them in 2 days. Old shipping method took forever. Might just have to get one more pair.....
