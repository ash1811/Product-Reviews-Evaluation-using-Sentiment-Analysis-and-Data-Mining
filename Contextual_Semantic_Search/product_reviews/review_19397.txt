I ordered these from Nordstrom, after reading all the reviews, for a few reasons. 1. free shipping, 2. insure no counterfeit 3. easy return in case they did not fit.....  I ordered the 8 (I am a 8.5 US), after reading reviews that this style only - runs smaller than UGG standard....  they fit perfect.  Color is true to the photo (Dried Lavender)They fit perfect, and are gorgeous.UGG now has a reflective tag inside all left shoes to insure they are really UGG..  incase you order from Amazon...
