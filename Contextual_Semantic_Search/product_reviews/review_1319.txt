I've tired imitation Merrell mocs in the past.  They fit just fine and lasted forever, but the comfort wasn't even close.While an imitation isn't uncomfortable it doesn't have the arch support or contoured sole that the Jungle Mocs have.I normally wear a D-E width shoe and these.  I did buy the D as I though the EE would be too wide.  The D does run narrow. If you are on the wider side I'd suggest going to the EE.  Other than the slightly narrow fit, great shoe.
