I don't wear flip flops because they hurt btwn my toes. My friend ordered a size 7 that was too small for her. I wear a size 6 so she brought them to me to try. I was skeptical. Wow! I just ordered myself a pair in a neutral color so I can wear them with everything. They are now my every day footwear for summer.
