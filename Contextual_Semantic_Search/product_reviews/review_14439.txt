To this day, the most comfortable pair of shoes I've ever had. No break-in period. The leather is buttery soft and the feel, even on day one, is like wearing slippers.I'm a big fan of shoes with a large toe box like these. I think that's part of the reason there's no break-in period.I've taken these on dozens of trips and I love them. When I'm bringing only one pair of shoes - this is it. I can easily walk all day on these and quite comfortably. They're light and look very nice with jeans or trousers - sportscoat etc. The most multi-functional pair of shoes I have - I have the dark brown ones.Really I could go on and on - these are the most comfortable shoes I've owned. I've worn them with every type of sock I own (and without socks on quite a few occasions - they're that soft) - and they're just perfect. Leave the laces loose and you can even slip in and out of them like slippers. Very nice.
