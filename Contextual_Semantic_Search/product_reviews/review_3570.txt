If you have to wear TED hose, these are a great option. I normally wear jeans or khakis, and thought regular TED hose looked kind of funny with casual clothes. These feel great, look like thin athletic socks. They keep you warm when it's cool out and absorb sweat when it's hot. I love mine enough I bought a total of three pair.
