I recently came across these very same hats at a local mall this past Christmas.  As an avid walker and hiker, even in the dead of winter I am always looking for something a little warmer and more comfortable with the least amount of effort to put on, or carry along.  For years there was the traditional knit hat, or toque that was on my list as standard equipment both for walking and hiking.  That is until I tried one of these on at the mall this past holiday season and decided that they have easily incorporated into the design of these the 3 essentials necessary for keeping warm and comfy while braving the winters savage elements.  A knit toque for the head, an extended ear flap to take care of the ears, and a visor for the very obvious reasons as to why we very often need one.  Quite simply put, I found these hats to be far more warm and comfy than the traditional toque for surviving the long winter here in New England.  Most of all, I wish that I had located the hats here before buying a couple at the local mall.  They are not only cheaper here than what I paid, but as of the time of this writing, ship for free through Amazon.  If you spend a lot of time outside in winter and desire the ultimate in head gear as far as warmth and convenience in my opinion, invest in two or more of these and be done for life.  They are warm, comfy, and at the price they are asking for them with free shipping, its like you are buying them tax free and at cost from your local store, and having them delivered to your house for free...
