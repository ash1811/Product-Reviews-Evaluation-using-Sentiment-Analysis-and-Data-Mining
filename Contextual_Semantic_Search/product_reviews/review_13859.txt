I'm 70 years old. I've liked Lees since Hi-school. They fit me better then Levis do. My brother likes Levis better, so I guess it's a good balance. I have to wear a steel back brace, so the big size is great for me. I wear'em every day, so I need a comfortable fit. Wear one wash one and they last for about 2 years before the creases get too thin. I teach Japanese kids, and I set them on my leg to help teach them English Phonetics, so my lap gets quite a work out. These are the only pants I've found that I can use for work and &#34;dress up&#34;.
