I purchased these Reef flip flops to replace my favorite pair of Evolv flip flops (Evolv no longer makes the style I have loved for years).  Overall, these fit well and are very comfortable.  The bottle opener in the bottom of the shoe is a novelty but I don't actually use it (who wants to walk all over and then put your drink on the bottom of your shoe?!)  I suppose if I were stranded on a beach with a six pack and no way to open it, I might reconsider the usefulness of this feature though.I would recommend these shoes, however I don't recommend using the bottle opener unless you just wear these around your house!
