Love this windbreaker. I ordered size Medium Maroon color, very nice, the length fits perfectly, sleeves are normal length (not too long), and nice looking jacket. Where I live it's not too cold or raining yet, but I wear it in the chilly morning and I've even had compliments! When it does get colder, I know a warm top underneath will fit fine. Even though the jacket is one layer, stitching is very good so I know it will hold up to a lot of wear and washings. Note: cannot be put in dryer, ironed or anything but delicate wash. The label is more specific, be sure to read it.This jacket does not have the tight gathered wrists that windbreakers normally have. Instead they are like (large) rubber bands (too wide) made to stretch for someone with very thick wrists or something, but I like it so much I'll keep it anyway. Also, there is no lining inside but I guess that's what 'lightweight' is all about.
