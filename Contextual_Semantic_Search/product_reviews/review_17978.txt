I bought the correct size and I have several other Skechers shoes that I love.  However, I couldn't put the shoes on.  I found them too tight around the top.  THe idea of "slip on" is really not correct.  I think making these shoes with a regular tongue and velcro straps would be a better idea.  They would be easy to put on.  I returned them the day after they arrived.
