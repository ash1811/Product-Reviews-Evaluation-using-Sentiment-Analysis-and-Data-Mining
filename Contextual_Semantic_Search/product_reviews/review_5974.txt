First of all, you MUST be sure that you're wanting a push-up bra when you order this guy.  It's SUPER nice, but the straps are a bit thin on it and I'm thinking that unlike other Playtex products, it won't last as long as the rest of them do.  That said, you might want to go up a little in size.  The cups were a bit small, like Victoria's Secret's items.  Quality is much higher than Victoria's, but well, the sizing is almost the same.  I'm having to send mine back to get another size, which is larger than what I normally wear in Playtex's items.  SO love these bras!  They wash and wear nicely too, just keeping my sewing machine close by just in case on this one. Highly recommend!
