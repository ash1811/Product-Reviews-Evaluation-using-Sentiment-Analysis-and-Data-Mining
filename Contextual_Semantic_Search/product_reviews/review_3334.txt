I love this bra, love.  I'm a 34DD and I've tried on hundreds of bras, and over the years settled for ones that just work.  Maybe they stab me in the ribcage, create serious backfat, top spillage, whatever...  NO MORE.  I found this bra on Amazon and took a risk, and haven't worn one of my twenty other styles in over two years.  I ended up buying 5 of this style and wear them every single day.  They create a nice shape, perky but natural.  Some have said that they make them a little bit pointy, and I would suggest to make sure you are "adjusting" the ladies to make them look right to you; you can't expect the bra to do everything for you.  I might just be used to that move having larger breasts, but it takes me 5 seconds to adjust and go.  This is the only bra in my size, apart from spending 100 dollars at a specialty store, that doesn't make me feel like I raided grandma's bras.ProsPrettyComfortableGreat ShapeCHEAPNo dorky super wide strapsConsThin lace doesn't protect from nipping outNot recommended for jumping jacks and/or pogo-sticking
