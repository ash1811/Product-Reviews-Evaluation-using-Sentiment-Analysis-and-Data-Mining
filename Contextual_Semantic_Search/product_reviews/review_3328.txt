Having gained some weight, my Bali Woman's Lace bra got put into storage.  Weight gone now and brought out older bras.  Rhere it was. Oh happy day, I had forgotten about this comfortable and beautiful bra. I instantly went to Amazon and there it was, waiting. I bought two and will be back next payday to get two more. Being a DD size, it's difficult to find a comfortable bra. Love, love, love this my Bali Bra
