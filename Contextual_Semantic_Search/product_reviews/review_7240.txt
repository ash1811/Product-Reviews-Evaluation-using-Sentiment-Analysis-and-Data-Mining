First of all, to explain the title, I get really itchy with some metal jewelry.  This one advertises hypoallergenic, and it is hypoallergenic.  So it is also extremely comfortable.  The dial is easy to read.  Even better, I get many compliments on this watch.  My mother accused me of spending too much on a watch, which translates to a compliment in mom speech.  The mother of pearl dial has just the hint of shine.  it is easy to read and the hands are long enough that the time is clear.  ( you know how sometimes there are tiny little hands that only suggest the direction of the dial? ).  So a perfect marriage, beauty and function, and no itch.
