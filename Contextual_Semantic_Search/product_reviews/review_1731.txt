I ordered maroon and was surprised at how brown it actually was. I held it up to a pair of brown pants and it basically matched. It was not a wrong product because they do not offer brown. Other than my complaint about the color, it feels like a pretty nice belt. Seems strong so far and quite durable. Good belt good price, expect a darker color.
