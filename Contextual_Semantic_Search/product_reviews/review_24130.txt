These CK briefs are of very high quality, and the material of which they're made is very silky and soft.  Hopefully, they will perform as claimed for a while, but only time will tell.  I bought a 3-pack of VERY similar CK briefs (just not as silky and soft) at Costco for around $22.00.  The difference in price makes me wonder if I paid way too much for these.
