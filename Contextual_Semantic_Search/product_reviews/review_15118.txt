As I noted when I reviewed the Jerzee's sweatshirt, these sweats are really great but they need to be offered in a variety of more sizes. I am a petite woman, who likes a drawstring and pockets, and these are perfect - except being a tad too big even after washing. Please, offer more (smaller) sizes!
