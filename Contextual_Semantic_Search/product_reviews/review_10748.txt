Like my previous Reef sandals, I expected these to be comfortable from the very first step. I was a bit nervous since I'm pretty picky when it comes to flip flops. I have had bad experience with the thong digging in, and cutting between my toes.  But not with these.  I already walked over 6 miles in them over the last two days.  Nothing but comfort!  Highly recommended.
