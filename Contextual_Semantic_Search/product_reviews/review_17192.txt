I bought a pair of these several years ago and they have been the most comfortable slippers I've ever owned. I wear them all the time and only just now are they starting to fall apart, still as comfy as ever but the material has split open. I ordered a pair to replace them, same style, same size, and they are made differently now! The toe separator has moved further down on the slipper making it less comfortable. The strap laying over the foot is much tighter and the top edge of the strap is digging into the tops of my feet which is painful. They also have a funny smell to them and look and feel as if they are made more cheaply. For example, the seams do not look or feel as well put together. Even the foot padding, which was my favorite thing about my old pair, isn't as comfy and fluffy as before. I am quite disappointed and wish I would've tried these on in a store before buying online.
