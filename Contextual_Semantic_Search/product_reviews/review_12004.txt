Love the way the shoe feels although I think they run a tiny bit big. I normally wear an 8 so I order the same here. It fits perfectly everywhere and I have just enough toe room, but it still slipped a little bit. There was even enough room for the special insolesSuperfeet Unisex Green Premium Insole For Maximum Supportthat I wear which is great. I have Plantar Fascitis, and these shoes make it comfortable to be on my feet the whole day without causing it to flare up.
