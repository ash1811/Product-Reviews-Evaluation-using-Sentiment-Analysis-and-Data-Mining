Based on the reviews, I ordered a 44 DD instead of my usual 40DD. The fit was snug except for the cup.  I did re-order to get a 44D which fits fine but there would have been no way I could wear a 40, which is my size. I even measured again according to the chart, so it's NOT true to size. BUT it is a fabulous well made beautiful bra, so with the caveat to go up 4 inches, I highly recommend it. Incredible value!!
