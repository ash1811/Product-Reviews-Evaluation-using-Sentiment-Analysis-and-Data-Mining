I read the reviews and saw tons about the seam inside being uncomfortable in the back.  I had bought a pair of these about 3 years back and there was no such problem then and they were sooo soft, so decided to try anyway.  Unfortunately it's true.  The way they've stitched the ending of the seam together center inside back on the top, it's too thick and sticks out about 1/8" inch, and it's NOT soft.  If they wouldn't have pulled the waist band so tight to stitch, it wouldn't be a problem, but alas it is.  However, because these tights are soooo soft and durable, my daughter wanted to keep them anyway, and I found a simple fix... a bandaid.  Just stick it over that seam that sticks out and voila, no more issues so she can wear the tights for all the perks, without the problem....  I'm sure it could be fixed further maybe by cutting that extra area off and having it stitched together, with less excess, but sewing is unfortunately not my forte.  In comparison though, the regular Bloch tights we used to buy, seem to have gotten cheaper in quality though because they used to last years, and now they've ripped within 3 uses....  so just one of those things that makes it hard to decide which way to go.  Best of luck!
