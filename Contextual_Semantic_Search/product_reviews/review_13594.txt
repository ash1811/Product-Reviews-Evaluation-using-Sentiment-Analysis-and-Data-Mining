I bought these because of the positive reviews I read. The slippers are nice, comfortable and they seem to run true to size. My left foot is 1/2 size larger than my right foot, which often causes fit problems in footwear. No problems  with these. Shipping was fast.Amended review---The inside cushion for these slipper wore out amazingly quickly. I had to toss them several weeks ago because they were very uncomfortable. The outside still looked great.I would NOT buy these slippers again, and I would not recommend them to a friend.
