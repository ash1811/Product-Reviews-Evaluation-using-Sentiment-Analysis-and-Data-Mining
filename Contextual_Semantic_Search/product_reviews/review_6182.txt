I bought these after a fall on a "freezing rain" day (broke my pelvis).  I have used them for 3 years, and can attest that they DRAMATICALLY improve safety on ice.  These are not for hikers-- are designed to use going in and out of buildings or working outdoors on icey days.I sincerely think everyone should have these.  And everyone in my family does!  I have told all of my friends about them, and sometimes strangers, haha!
