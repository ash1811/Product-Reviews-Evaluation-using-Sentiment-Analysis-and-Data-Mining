Bought these as a gift for a friend's 16 yr old daughter. She just loves them, says they are a perfect fit and her mother says she practically sleeps in them. So refreshing to see a teen wearing Keds instead of some $100+ celebrity name tennis shoe ! Her mother has a matching pair and loves hers graphite Keds as well. Highly recommend !
