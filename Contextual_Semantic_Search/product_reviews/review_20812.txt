I now have three of these in different colors because I LOVE the support and slimming effect.  Everybody else may know the trick to getting these tight fitting &#34;sausage skin&#34; things on; but, I didn't. Yesterday I decided to step IN to the cami and pull it up instead of struggling to get it over my shoulders.  WHEW! What a difference!  Now I don't have to start getting ready an hour early just to get the thing on! AND, I did get TWO sizes larger than I normally do because it runs VERY small.
