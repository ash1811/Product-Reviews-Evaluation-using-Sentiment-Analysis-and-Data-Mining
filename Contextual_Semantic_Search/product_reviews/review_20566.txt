I am female, have a long (91/2) narrow (AA) foot.  After  reading a few reviews I decided to try a 9.  They are plenty long and they are very comfortable.  I have a pebble tec pool and after a few laps it gets a little rough.  These shoes are cushioned enough for good protection.  And if they do stretch in width, I will wear socks with them.  Right now, however, I am very pleased.
