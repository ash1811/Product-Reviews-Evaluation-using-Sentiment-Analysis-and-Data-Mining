We bought a medium for 9 year old. It is tiny!Made with a very cheap material, with weak stitches.Back is wide open (from waist up - only Velcro on top(and on the wrong side too)) so plan to buy larger so child can wear shirts underneath.Cape is not usable - one velcro and slides offDoesn't include breather box or booties or gloves.
