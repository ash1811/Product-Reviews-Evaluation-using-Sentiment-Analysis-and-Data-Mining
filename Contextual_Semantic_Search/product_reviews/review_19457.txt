The only sock I will wear.  On me feet at the farm all day.Keeps me fromg getting corns, rubs and blisters.  Nice and cushy.I do find the sizes run big.  There are a lot of small people in this country.I would think the marketing people should have picked up on this by now.The socks are just a little to large for me, wish they made a small.Have the same issue with warm and sturdy gloves I need small, with out extra long fingers to leave room for long nails.
