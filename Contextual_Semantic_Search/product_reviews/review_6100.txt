I bought these for my husband who is a woodworker. We live Hawaii and it is hot year round. However, being a woodworker you need some protection. These are great. He wears these without a shirt and they offer the protection he needs, but still keep him cool. These are comfortable. He wore these for one day and asked me to order him some more. They hold up and do the job.
