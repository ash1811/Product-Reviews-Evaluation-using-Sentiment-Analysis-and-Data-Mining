They are nice shoes, well made & highly rated, but they were a gift that I bought for my husband... a bit too early.  I got them a month in advance, so my the time he opened them and tried them out to find they were too big, they store selling them through Amazon said they would not do a refund or exchange.  My fault... I was just trying to be on top of things.  Will know better next time.
