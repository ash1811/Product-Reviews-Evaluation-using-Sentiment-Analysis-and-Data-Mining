Normally, using "comfortable" and "bra" in the same sentence, would be an oxymoron most of the time, because let's face it - there's nothing comfortable about bras! After all, what's the first (maybe second) thing we women rip off our bodies as soon as we come home from work (or oftentimes, ENROUTE!) - it's the bra!But, that said, 'for a bra', this one is pretty comfortable. Today is my first day wearing it and I must say that I agree with the other reviewers in that it is made very well; it covers the back nicely; love the front closure and the support. I don't know yet how it does for the back and would like to be able to have a few back support bras to try on altogether and compare and see if they are noticeably different, but I certainly like the coverage in the back. You sure have to comment on the price! And now that I have it, I do wish I had ordered two. That's ok..later.Can't comment yet about how it washed up or dried; or whether my 'computer' back will ache less now that I'm wearing it, but we'll see.All I can say is, it is a great bra so far; agree with the others and definitely recommend!
