This is one terrific watch from Timex! Just as they say, this is one watch you'd have to TRY to kill. It really keeps time very well even if you're a bit careless and bump it into a wall once in a while (and I do); and it fits well on my wrist without making me feel uncomfortable. The band is well made and it's great that you get such a flexible band!The day and date are easy to adjust using the dial on the side of the watch; and the face of the watch is actually pretty easy to read despite the fact that the watch lets you count seconds and even in twenty-four hour intervals. The ten year battery life guarantee impresses me all the more.With the proper care this watch should last for years; the only thing I haven't tested is its underwater capability but I would assume that it works well just as Timex and another reviewer say it does.I highly recommend this watch for casual wear and for anyone who wants a sturdy, resilient watch. It's officially a men's watch but I don't see why a woman couldn't wear it; and you won't regret this purchase.
