I used this duffle bag (21&#34; x 36&#34;) as a sandbag for training.  The bag has 45 lbs. of sand in it and the bag seems like it could handle plenty more.  Very durable and has withstood thousands of slams.Very roomy and the straps hold very well.  Sturdy construction.  I would not hesitate to purchase again.
