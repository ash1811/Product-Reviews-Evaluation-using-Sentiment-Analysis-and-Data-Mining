The boot quality seems to be ok, although my husband never got to wear the boot to see how they wear. He is normally 9 1/2 D (med), sometimes a 10 D and these boots were way too wide. I am also upset by the fact that I have to pay return shipping plus a pickup fee to return to Amazon. I was under the impression that during this holiday season, I would not have to pay return shipping on clothes and shoes. Anyway, the good deal that I thought I was getting is now negated by the return shipping fees all because of poorly fitting shoes. In the 40 years we have been together, he has NEVER worn a narrow in shoes or boots.
