I have been wearing these pewter slides for years, and they wear for years and I'm talking everyday of the week... I was so disappointed when Wissota Trader went out of business because that is where I always bought them - they had them in 4E which is perfect for me... I'm hoping these will be wide enough... I order 3 pair because I don't want to be left out if they should stop making them - the material is great, simply does not show wear - the black soles do not wear off in the pewter but they did on the all black ones and the other white soles wore off and just looked dirty... the pewter ones are the only ones I buy...
