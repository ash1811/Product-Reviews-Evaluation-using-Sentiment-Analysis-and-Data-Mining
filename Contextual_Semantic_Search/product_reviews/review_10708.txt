Fits well, the toast color is great as it doesn't show up under more transparent shirts like the other colors do. The lace isn't as great in quality as it used to be [ I've owned the halo strapless for years now and the one I bought in 2001 is still in perfect condition while the one I bought recently - the lace is already ripping] I expect this lace will rip too - I can already see the signs but I have been wearing it a lot. Till I find another bra like this I might have to buy this one repeatedly.
