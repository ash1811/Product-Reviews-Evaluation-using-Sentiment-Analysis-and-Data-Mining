This is NOT the former princess aerobic shoe.  Firstly, it is not even made of leather like it used to be.  Secondly, it in no way resembles the comfort that the princess shoe used to have.  Thirdly, the fit is nothing like it used to be.  I still have an old pair that I checked and they ARE made of leather and they are a half size smaller than this shoe.  This shoe was about 3/4 inch shorter.  These are made in Viet Nam.  I am very disappointed in Reebok.
