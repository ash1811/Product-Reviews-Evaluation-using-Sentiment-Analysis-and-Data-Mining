I walk our large collie dog everyday in the winter and these were very handy for that light duty job.  Also I was also able to use these for the snow and ice removal when I walked behind my new Power Smart 208 CC two stage snow blower that I purchased from Amazon.  I also ordered the extra replacement tungsten carbide studs.
