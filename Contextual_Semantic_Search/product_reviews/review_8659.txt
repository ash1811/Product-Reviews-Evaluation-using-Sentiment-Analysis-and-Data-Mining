This slip fits well, and the length is just above the knee, so it's a good length for business wear.  More importantly, the fabric is perfect.  Many of the slips now are a super-flimsy fabric that sticks to and rides up on hose and tights, leaving you with a slip that is rolled up around your hips.  On this slip, the fabric is sturdy but not clingy, so it stays where it should and serves its purpose.  It also launders well - it's a no-drama, serves-its-function slip.
