My teenage son wanted skinny jeans. I never really liked the super big hanging-down look, but was unsure how he would look in skinny jeans. I got him both the Levi's 510 and these 511, both in his "normal" size. (29W)When they arrived, he tried on the 510s first, and they looked great! Definitely form fitting, but not too skin tight. He is more or less average build, with maybe slightly thicker thighs, not an overly thin or heavy kid. When he tried on these 511s however, he couldn't button them. Close...but just too small. (I was going to return them but of course he ripped all the tags off and threw them on the floor for 3 days...so I didn't.) I took away one star just for the inconsistency of the sizes between very similar items (both Levi's, both "skinny"). It just makes it harder for customers when they are not trying them on in a store.I am here ordering the next size up, hopefully they will fit him. (I am watching this time so he doesn't rip all the tags off!) If you are unsure, please keep your tags and packaging so you can return easily. If you buy from amazon.com as the seller, they are currently listed eligible for free returns.I am not sure why there are two different pages listing these. There is this page:Levi's Men's 511 Skinny Jeanand there is also this page:Levi's Men's 511 Skinny Jean. They appear to have the same items, prices and reviews. Maybe it is just a mistake and amazon will merge the pages. However one page may list different sellers than the other, so if you are looking for a size/color combination on one page and it isn't available, it couldn't hurt to check the other one, just in case another seller might have it. :)
