I am going to make this brief . Those are the most comfortable running socks I've ever tried (even slightly more comfy than the thorlo's with thick cushioning somehow)And I've tried a lot, went through dozens of socks&running; shoes in the last 10 years, i.e. tried most alternatives around.They don't look as hi-tech as many alternatives (they are not even L/R specific), but they do their job great.
