I have had a bad case of plantar fasciitis for well over a year now and nothing was helping.  Then someone recommended getting these for it and at first I thought they were right, but after a week the shoe wasn't comfortable at all and actually caused my feet to hurt more when I wore them. Sizing was accurate for me; I wear women's size 10 or 10.5 and got size 41 M according to the chart and they fit perfectly.
