The bra was the right size according to the help I rec'd from sizing chart. As perviously mentioned in a comment, I did not find the seams to show through t-shirts. It has a good fit I think because of the three sections to the cup. The back strap is wider than usual so that is nice. Overall I think this is a great black bra and fits very well. Quality is good.
