I have worn Levi's 505s since high school until now and probably will into retirement. The quality is better than jeans costing more and superior and heavier than those costing less. You can frequently find them discounted. I cannot recall ever wearing a pair out. I have retired or given them away when I gained or lost weight. I dropped 2 inches recently in my waist and had to buy several pairs. I am keeping the old bigger ones just in case, but I hope I keep my narrower waist. I have tried other Levi's but 505s fit me best. The others are way too tight or way too big. I am 6 ft 3 and weigh about 200 pounds. The 36 34s fit me perfectly.
