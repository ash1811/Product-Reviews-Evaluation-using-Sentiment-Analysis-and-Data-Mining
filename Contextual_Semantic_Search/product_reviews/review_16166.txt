Excellent product at a great price -- qualty and utility are outstanding. My husband has a bad back, and it is difficult for him to bend down to put on his shoes.  What a life (back) saver these are.  We have several, at doorways where he changes his shoes upon entering the house, and in the bedrooms at both our homes.
