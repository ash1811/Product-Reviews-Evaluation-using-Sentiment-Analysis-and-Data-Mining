Just purchased one of these in black and I plan to buy a couple more.  I wanted a nice, simple nightgown for a vacation I'm taking in a couple of weeks and this one fits the bill, entirely!  It was super easy to wash and hang dry and it dried really quickly.  It was so comfortable to sleep in and I didn't have any "embarrassing slippage" in the front, like a few of my other nightgowns tend to do since I'm a bit full in the front and my others are a bit lower cut than this one.  I bought a 36 and I'm a size 6-8 petite in dresses and I had plenty of room.  I think my next purchase will be a 34 to compare as the 36 has a bit of spare room in the hips, not ridiculously so but I thought I'd try a 34 as I'm smaller through the hips and would like something a tad more fitted and since it's stretchy material, I'm sure it will still accommodate my top as well.
