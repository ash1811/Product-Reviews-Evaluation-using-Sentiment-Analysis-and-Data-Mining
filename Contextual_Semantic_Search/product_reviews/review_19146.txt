I read the majority of the reviews. I was apprehensive when I read that they were "arrowhead shaped". They are, but they are not "totaly" flat (front to back) They are not a full tear drop either. See the pendant that matches and you will get a better picture of what the earring shape is. I would describe it as a "pillowed out" arrowhead shape.If you like blue and you are picking these out because of the picture, don't. Find some that say they are blue. These do reflect a sparkle of all colors with the majority colors of amber and yellow at the center of the earring, because of the reflection off of your skin and the indoor lighting. Outside they reflect all colors. They are great daily ware earrings. They go with everything and aren't too fancy for jeans. They are very eye catching but not "too fancy" and they are not tiny or too big. The size in the ladies photo is acurrate to where the earring will fall from the ear.For the shape see this productSterling Silver Multi Faceted Swarovski Crystal Pendant
