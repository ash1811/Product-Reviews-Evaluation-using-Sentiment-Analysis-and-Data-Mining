Real nice undershirts.  Soft and they are longer which helps them stay tucked in. I like these better than fruit of the loom or hanes. Also, I started tucking my undershirts into my underwear to keep them tucked in. I just hate when the undershirt gets un-tucked and your dress shit does not. Then I get this weird bulge around my waste. These are the best undershirts I've tried tho.
