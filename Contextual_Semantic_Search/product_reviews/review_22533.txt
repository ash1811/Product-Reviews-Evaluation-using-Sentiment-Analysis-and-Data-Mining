I'm glad this watch has a perpetual calendar, because it is dang hard to set the first time.  I finally got it set.  As long as it never stops I think I'll be okay.  Otherwise it looks very nice and keeps good time.  But seriously, if I ever buy another watch with this many complications, I'll get one of those watches that sets itself from radio signals.
