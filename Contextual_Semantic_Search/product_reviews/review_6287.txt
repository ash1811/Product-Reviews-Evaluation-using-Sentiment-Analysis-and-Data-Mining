I must thank all the other reviewers for warning that this shirt fits large. I bought a size down from my usual and it fit well.The Bahama shirt looks and fit very similar to the Bonehead and the Tamiami. However, the material for all 3 shirts are rather different. The Bonehead is cotton, the Bahama and the Tamiami are both synthetic type material which have different UV protection abilities. I must say that I like the Tamiami as it offers the best UV protection and has the nicest fabric of the 3. But this is subjective and many would prefer cotton. The Bahama has a different pocket deign from the Tamiami and again I personally prefer the Tamiami.It is a good shirt however and Amazon offers a pretty competitive price for it. Happy overall with it.
