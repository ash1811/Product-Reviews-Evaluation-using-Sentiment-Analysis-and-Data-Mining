This is a great watch for the price, allowing that you won't be replacing batteries. It keeps very accurate time - I've had mine 3 week now and I'm not sure its more that a second off.  The band is short like everyone says. I have a 7 1/2&#34; wrist & wear it closed at  the 3rd hole. It is NOT uncomfortable - but I bought a black leather with red pipe stitching anyway. The watch looks so much better to me.  A good deal all around
