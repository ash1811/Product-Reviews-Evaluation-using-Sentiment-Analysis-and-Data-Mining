This is my first Seiko watch. I've read and heard that every watch collector should have this or it's orange brother in their watch box, So I thought I should try it out. I was so excited to get this I even paid the $3.99 for overnight shipping. When it finally arrived I opened the box and it didn't quite give me that wow factor.  This one is no "Monster" I don't know why it got that nickname. Perhaps the nickname was given back in the day when a watch at 42mm is a monster, I don't know.The case is bit too shiny for my liking. I would have preferred a brushed case. But other than those two things this watch is quite nice looking and very comfortable. For the price you cannot go wrong. The lume on the indices and hands are excellent and the unidirection bezel turns very smoothly and quietly. It's too early for me to tell the accuracy but since it's a Seiko so it should be fine. You really can't go wrong with a watch like this. If you are looking for a weekend warrior or daily wearer type watch give this one a try. Also if you are looking at those Invicta Pro Divers I would highly recommend that you pay the extra $$$ and get this one instead. It looks very nice and it should last for a very long time...
