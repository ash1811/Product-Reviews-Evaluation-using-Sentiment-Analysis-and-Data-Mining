After using this toiletry bag for a year, I can only express my satisfaction from this product.  I find it sturdy, and its large capacity allowed me to pack everything I need for a 2-week trip to Europe.  My favorite feature is the detachable section which holds what I need for the shower, while keeping the rest of my make up and other items in the main sections.  Yes, it is bulky when rolled up, but as I did with previous bags, I usually throw it in my suitcase at the last minute anyway and lay it flat.  No problem....  Wonderful that you can hang it anywhere and keep your toiletries handy.  I really like the bright periwinkle color I chose.
