I've been a fan of the Wayfarer for a long time. But the original side profile had too deep a lean for my face.Enter: the New WayfarerIt's the exact same facing profile but the lean is dramatically reduced. No more rims digging into my cheeks.What I like best about these is that they come in 55mm lens widths. For wide faces like mine, that's important. They fit in all dimensions this way.While these standard sunglasses lenses are better than the average, I would HIGHLY recommend paying the extra $10 and getting the polarized lens version. I did.So why do I have these, too?I like the profile so much, I bought these just to take out the lenses and get my optometrist to put in my prescription lenses. But here's why I had to do it this convoluted way. Ray-Ban just started offering this model in their prescription lens line. But they only have it in the 52mm size. And they cost twice as much. These also have the Ray-Ban logo embossed on the arms. Not all the prescription frames do, even if there is plenty of room to.Yes, I lose out on getting a prescription frame hard case but that's a small trade-off for having a set of frames that are attractive, official, and fit right.
