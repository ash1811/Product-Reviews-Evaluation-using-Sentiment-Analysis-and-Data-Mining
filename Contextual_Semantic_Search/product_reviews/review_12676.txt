This bra do lift your breast up and tuck your breast in tight. The cups is roomy, so u have no spillage. The bra fits true to size. The strap is wide enough so it will not dig in your shoulder blade. You have full back coverage, which is a plus. The one thing I don't like about the bra is the underneath part of the bra don't lay falt and roll up under the breast. I do have to keep pulling it down every so often. This bra will surely make you stnad up straight. So all in all please give it a try , you might like it.
