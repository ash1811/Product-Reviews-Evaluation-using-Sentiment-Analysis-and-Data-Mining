Bought this sweatshirt for my husband who is a carpenter.  He is very hard on clothing and needs warm quality sweatshirts to work outside in the winter.  This sweatshirt definitely fit the bill.  It is both durable and warm.  Sizing was appropriate and I allowed room for shrinkage as is expected based on some of the other reviews.
