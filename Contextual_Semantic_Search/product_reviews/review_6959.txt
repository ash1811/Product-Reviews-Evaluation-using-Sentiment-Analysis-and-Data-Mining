I like my socks to be as close to 100% cotton as possible and these filled the bill. I have trouble with some materials like polyester and such as it tends to cause me to itch if I have to wear it for a long period of time. These socks are great for me. I've always liked over the calf socks as they don't tend to slide down quite as bad as the ankle types do. They fit great and feel great. These were a good buy.
