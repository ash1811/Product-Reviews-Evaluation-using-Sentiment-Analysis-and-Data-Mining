Not my first Carhartt Work shirt, but first Henley with 3 button front. You can find work shirts for less, but this is a much better shirt, strong fabric double stitched - spend a few more $ and get the real deal with a Carhartt.Size; I'm just under 6' tall, 170 lbs 34&#34; waist and sleeve length - athletic build; usually wear a large but a Medium Regular fits me best. I wear a basic cotton T-shirt  under these.If you have a beer belly or chest measures larger than a 42&#34; regular suit a Large will probably be a better fit, also if you are going to wear over thermal shirt or sweater underneath go with the Large.I'm Carhartt brand loyal, I try to buy on sale, Henley was just over $20 so not much discount but Carhartt sells out - here on Amazon and in western wear stores - even if you pay full price you won't regret it.  If the shirt fits buy it in every color!
