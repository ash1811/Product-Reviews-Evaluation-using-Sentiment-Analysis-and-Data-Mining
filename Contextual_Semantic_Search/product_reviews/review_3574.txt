The Good:  I love these socks.  They are very well built and I feel like I have a sock that will last for years.  They are great for walking around the house with no shoes.  Their elastic around the calf is well made and I have yet to have a pair start to get loose on me.  The warmth is fantastic and they feel comfortable with all types of shoes.The Bad:  They are thick, but this is probably why you bought them anyway.  Just be aware that you may have tight shoes start to fit strangely because of that thickness.
