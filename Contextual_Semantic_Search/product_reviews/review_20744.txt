Do not accept any imitation of Carhartt, this is the only brand that actually lives up to its tradition of tough workwear that will hold up to what abuse you can give them and always be ready for more.I bought a pair of Gramicci brand and the crotch ripped out on the 3rd time wearing them. Dickies are pretty tough but made cheaper. Carhartt is the king of the hill. You will be able to hand these down to your kids.
