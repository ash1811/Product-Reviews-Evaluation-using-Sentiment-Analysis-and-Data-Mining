Good boot, hard rigid sole that will not compress and deform.  will need a few break in wear events, leather a bit stiff.  A sewn edge on the bottom of the tongue where it joins the boot has a tendency to roll under and create a pressure point on the top of the foot.  I hope it will stay &#34;up&#34; after a few wears, if not a drop of glue might be required.  Good looking black boot overall.
