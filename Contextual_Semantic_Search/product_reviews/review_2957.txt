The pantyhose is not super high quality, I would expect them to pil or rip IF you are not careful with them.  So far, the g/f has worn them 2x, and been washed in a lingerie bag and they are fine so we got our moneys worth.  They look great on her, not a super dense material, nor are they shiny, rather a nice matte sheen.
