People always tell me black is bad for sunny countries but this shirt fits great and is relatively cool compared to cotton shirts, only downside is it sticks to velcro which I work with a bit more often than average. But avoid that and it's great! For someone with broad shoulders, standing at 187cm or I believe the conversion is 6ft 1 or 2&#34;?
