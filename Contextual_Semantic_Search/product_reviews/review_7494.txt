Perhaps it is a different model I was looking for.  The hat I recieved was very soft and flexible wool, in black.  The fit and sizing was fine. It seems to be well made.But I was looking for a replacement for a Kangol hat that looked just like the picture, but was without seams and held a shape.  This one is soft and floppy. Is there another model that is shaped?  Fifty years ago, what I was seeking was called a Shetland cap, while this one was called a flat cap or a soft cap.  Now I will try to never leave my hat or cap in a resturant.  The soft hat does have the advantage that it can go in a pocket rather than on a rack or shelf.
