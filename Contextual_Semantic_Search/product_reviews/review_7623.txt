These thermals fit great, but are a little thin. I bought a different pair at a CVS once and love them. I have never been able to find a pair that is as nice as those. The waist band is sturdy and really hugs  my without constriction my waist. They keep me warm, but are not as thick as my other pair. Great for hiking, or on the slopes because i generate sufficient body heat. For just chilling and sitting around i would like a slightly thicker pair.
