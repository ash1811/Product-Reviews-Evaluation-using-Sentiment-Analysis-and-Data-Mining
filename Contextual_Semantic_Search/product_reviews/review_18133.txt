Buying shoes online is never easy because so many things can go wrong. I am happy to say that nothing went wrong with buying these shoes!They fit well and are very comfortable! I teach and am on my feet all day, so I was looking for a versatile, stylish shoe that didn't look like an orthopedic shoe. This shoe totally fit the bill!There was a very short &#34;breaking in&#34; period, but that was just me walking the dog around the block a few times. I wear them all the time, and I get compliments regularly. I am considering buying another pair in a different color.
