I have a similarly looking Clarks bought several years ago which is VERY comfortable.  Being under the impression that this is the same model I've purchased these. The outsole is identical to mine and they look almost the same, there's a slight decorative difference but these are way too rigid, especially at the ball (where toes join w/ the rest of foot). The impression is that your foot is in a cast w/ a pressure point at the ball.  Because of the good outsole walking in them though is comfortable as Clarks usually are.So, if  you don't mind the pressure I described it's not a bad shoe. I've returned nevertheless.
