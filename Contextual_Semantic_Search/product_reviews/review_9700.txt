Love these socks -- they're the first ones my boy didn't kick off with ease. I also like getting a color assortment. The fabric is sturdy and thick, the elastic is firm but not binding, and the quality is much higher than other kids' socks I've tried. And the price is right.However, be careful with the sizes. I got size 0-9 mo. for my 6-month-old, and they were too small. He's a big boy, but not that big. So I would order one size up from what you think you need. As long as you get the size that fits, you can't go wrong with these.
