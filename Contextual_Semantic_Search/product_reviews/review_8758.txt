I bought this bra for my 82 years old mother. There was a risk that it would not fit her, so I took measurements 10 times before I decided to order and I am very happy that it fits so well.  We are very pleased with the quality of the bra, it is very comfortable and material is cotton. Amazon is amazing, you can get really good things online. This is a first time I decided to buy a bra online, so I think I will buy some more. Online shopping is amazing!
