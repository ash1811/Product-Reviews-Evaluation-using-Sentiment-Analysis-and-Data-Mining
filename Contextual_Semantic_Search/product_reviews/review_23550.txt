These shoes really are great.  My aunt does not wear sneakers since it is hard to find wide shoes that fit comfortably...and then I found Easy Spirit's Romy sneakers.  She tried them on and she said they are so comfortable.  Her feet were swollen and they still fit inside the wide shoes.  She told me it feels like she is not wearing shoes and she was very happy with them.  I greatly recommend this purchase.
