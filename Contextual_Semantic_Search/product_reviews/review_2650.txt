I have this watch and the timex with the black band. I like this one better because the band is nicer and because it has the day and date function. The time is very easy to read, and the night light is outstanding. The gold face is nice but everything else is silver in color, which I found odd. But it keeps time well, looks professional, and yet is durable and practical. The watch is a good value.
