Not a fashion statement for sure.  The whole sole seems higher than normal.  But I did not buy them for looks.  The first few five mile treks left feet and legs a bit sore but once I got used to them they are now working fine for me.  I feel as if they are &#34;good for me shoes&#34; rather than my being thrilled with them.  Oh, and they seem a bit wide also.  I bought the CD size which normally is perfect for me but I have to tie the laces on these really tight.  If I wore bigger socks maybe???
