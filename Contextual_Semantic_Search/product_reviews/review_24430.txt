The sizing is perfect and they are very comfortable.  Enough other people have noted on here how amazing these are, the only reason I feel compelled to write a review is that I was looking at old order and realized that I am still wearing these flip flops two years later!  That's two hard summer's worth of use (wearing for quite a bit of walking every day) and two fall/winter/spring's worth of use (wearing pretty constantly when it is warm enough for flip flops in SLC).
