Every underwear from Exofficio is great. This is no exception. These run a little big. My waist is a 33 and I got a medium and they feel big. Other than that these feel great. They wick moisture very well and they allow for good movement of the male parts. They also dont bunch up like other boxers unless you are wearing tight jeans. Overall a great product.
