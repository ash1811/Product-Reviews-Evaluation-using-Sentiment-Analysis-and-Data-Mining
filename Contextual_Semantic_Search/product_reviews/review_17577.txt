Unfortunately, I'm big.  I have fat thighs and I know it.  But when something says "one size fits most," I expect it not to cut off my circulation.  I understand, because of my size, that I would normally need garters for stockings, since stockings tend to bunch and roll down on me.  However, I have to wear these stockings just above my knees so they won't cut off my circulation.  I'm only a size 12, which is still in the "average" range, so why a "one size fits most" item won't fit an average-sized person is beyond me.  From now on, I'm buying stockings that have size categories that INCLUDE Queen sizes.
