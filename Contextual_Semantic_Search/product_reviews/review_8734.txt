Ordered the stainless steel bracelet version but received the rubber diving band version.  I decided to keep it and so far it has performed correctly on my watch winder and on the wrist.It is running about 15 seconds per day fast so far which seems to be typical of Seiko automatic wind mechanical watches.  For some reason mechanical watch manufacturers seem to favor running fast to running slow.
