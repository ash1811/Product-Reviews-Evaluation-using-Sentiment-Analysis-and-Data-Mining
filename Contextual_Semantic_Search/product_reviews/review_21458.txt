I bought a pair of the pink camo fatigues about three years ago and love them, so I decide to get another pair. I bought the olive drab and love them as well. They do run a bit large. I bought a medium, but I think I could have bought the small. The pink camo pair fit me a little big and so do these. That's ok...I love this pair as well. Would recommend these paints. Well made. Mid weight. Comfortable!
