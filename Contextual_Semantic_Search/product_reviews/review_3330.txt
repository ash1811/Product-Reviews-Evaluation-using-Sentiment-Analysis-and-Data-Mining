I'd been putting off purchasing bras because it's a hassle to find a good fit. Finally, I ordered one each of three different styles just to check them out. This manufacturer/style worked very well for me! Subsequently, I ordered several more in shades of beige and black. Three washings later, I not only still like the fit, but also found them to be durable (they just look delicate).  They are retaining their shape and "newness" very nicely.
