Good quality, handy and functional, no bells and whistles just a leather product that works.  I like the coin compartment being on the outside and available without having to open up the whole thing.  I don't like the zipper coin compartments because they don't open wide enough so this is just right.  And the style and color is nice/classy.  It also has a check book holder inside and about 5 credit card slots.  The place designated for your driver's license has a cut-out in the center of the plastic to help get hold of it to take it out when needed which is handy.  It also has a zipper compartment inside to store stuff you want to keep but don't use as much.  Very nice.
