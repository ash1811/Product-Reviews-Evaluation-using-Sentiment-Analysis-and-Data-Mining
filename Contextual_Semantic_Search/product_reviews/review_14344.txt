These thigh highs come with a cute bow, and are a nice mid-heavy weight good for, say, wintertime. They aren't *quite* opaque like it says in the title though, which is why it gets an ok. I'd say it's mostly opaque (if you can even have that as a concept), and pretty good for most hosiery. But you can see my calf-mole through the fabric, which is by no means opaque!
