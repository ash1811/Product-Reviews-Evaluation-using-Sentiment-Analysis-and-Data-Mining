I purchased this chain because I was looking for a simple silver box chain in a longer length.  This product, offered by Gem Avenue, looked to be of good quality based on the other reviews, came in a variety of lengths, and was priced affordably.  When I received the chain, I was pleased with the appearance, and so far, it has met my expectations.  The only thing that I would mention is that this chain has a spring-type clasp--this is accurately noted in the description, but the photograph here appears to be of a chain with a lobster-type clasp.  The latter would have actually been a nice small added feature, and for this reason, I would give this chain 4 1/2 rather than a full 5 stars.  Other than that, however, I am pleased with this purchase and would recommend it.
