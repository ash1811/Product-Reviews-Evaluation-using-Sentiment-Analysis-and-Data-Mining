I usually have an extra wide width with shoes. I bought this same shoe in a different color way back when in a MEDIUM width. To my surprise, it fit perfect. I ordered this shoe on amazon in medium width and it still fit perfect. They are very comfortable, easy on and off, nice shoe to wear with shorts
