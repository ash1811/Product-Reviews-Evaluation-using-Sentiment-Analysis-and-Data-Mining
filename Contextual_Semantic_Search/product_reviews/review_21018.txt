These slippers are barely okay.  Definitely not great.  I wear slippers around the house whenever I'm home, so I need something that provides arch support and stability on my hard wood floors.  Also, I wanted something to replace my worn out memory foam slippers, these do not even compare in comfort.  The soles are not very cushioned, and my feet stay tired.  I feel my feet ache with every step.  No arch support at all.  I've got them now so I'll keep them, but I'll mostly use them for running outside quickly and I'll get something else for wearing inside.  I gave these 2 stars instead of 1 because the material is soft, but the comfort stops there.  Some reviewers complained about the tag, I found that the tag on the footbed is easy to remove with a seam ripper.
