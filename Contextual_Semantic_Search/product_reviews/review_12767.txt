I bought the blue one and the beige one and they both fit heavenly. This is what I have been searching for for a long time but it's hard to find bras of this quality ESPECIALLY at this price. I plan on buying several more because they are extremely comfortable and the straps are amazing because they don't dig into your skin which I've always hated. I would also say that they are true to size. Great bra! Finally a bra that exceeds expectations and you can't beat a price like that.
