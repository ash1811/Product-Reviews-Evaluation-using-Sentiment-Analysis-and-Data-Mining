Just bought another pair. These fit so well... I'm 5'7, 145 pounds, a 30 waist, and got the mediums. It's very warm... I feel like I can use them in temperate weather, as well as very cold weather. I'm in my 65 degree office right now with them under my work pants and they feel wonderful! I used them in 35 degree weather outside for 5 hours and I was still pretty toasty. A great base layer. I'll be looking to Minus33 for more of my winter products from now on.
