Im a heavy sweater and walk a lot at work.  Ive been fighting chafing for a few years now by trying different underwear, ointments, powders, etc.  I purchased one pair and have not had a single problem chafing since.  They wick sweat nicely and don't leave you with swamp butt.  2 more pairs on order. Im 5'11" and 38" waist and the large size fits perfect.
