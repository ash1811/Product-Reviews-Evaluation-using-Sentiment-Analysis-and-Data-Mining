When I was a kid, these boots were all the rage--but my parents wouldn't buy me a pair.  Finally, for my 50th birthday, I treated myself!  They make me happy.  They also make my feet look TINY, and that's always nice.  I'm a size 7; these are a perfect fit.  They're going to require some breaking in, but generally are pretty comfy right out of the box.  I wish they were a little taller in the shaft, but then they wouldn't be the classic Frye Campus boot!  Love the saddle color.  I can't imagine how these boots will EVER wear out!
