I was hoping the fabric would be even more substantial. There is no hanging hook, you must have your own hangersinside to suspend the bag. There are no pockets for shoes or other items. It's just a BAG. At this price it's an OKAY buy.If it lasts for decades as most of my luggage does, then itwill be a good buy. No big recommendation at this time
