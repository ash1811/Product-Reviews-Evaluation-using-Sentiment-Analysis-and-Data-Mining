This is the second Invicta watch I purchased that was defective.  In this case, the automatic movement began working (after some initial winding) but I was surprised to see that it had stopped in the middle of the day (while wearing it).  I cranked it up and again, it stopped after a couple of hours.  This pattern continued to repeat before I finally decided to return it for a refund.  Yes, its a nice looking watch (if a common and tired design) and is sold for a great price, but I'm now quite skeptical of Invicta's quality.  I had previously purchased the very similar (but smaller) style #8932 from another store and it had the same issues of running for a while, then stopping.  Which was even more surprising in that case since it was a battery-powered quartz movement (battery replacement was no help).  So I guess if you are one of the lucky ones to get a good unit you have a real bargain - if not, you may be out of luck and late for your appointment!
