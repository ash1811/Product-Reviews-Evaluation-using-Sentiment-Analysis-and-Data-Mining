I just received this pair of boots (delivered to the door as promised), only one word comes to mind...WOW.  I bought two pair of these (before the price increased) and at $98.00, the boots were an incredible price.  The black ones are extermely stylish and I was a bit skeptical of how the brown ones would look...in a word...WOW...I am extremely pleased with the style, the workmanship and the sizing of the boot.  Having read on this site they tend to run bit narrow, I ordered a size 14 and I'm glad I did, not so much for the narrowness but for a bit more room in the toe box.  These boots are a must for any collection and for those having a shoe size above a size 12, these shoes some how tend to make the foot look smaller, whether it is the cap toe with the antique styling or the narrowness, I'm not sure, but the boot is definitely a keeper...just love em...I can already tell the brown ones will be my favorite of the two.
