These house shoes are warm and comfortable, at least for awhile.  They lose their cushioning effect a little to quick for me.  I have put inserts inside them to see me through the winter.  As much as I liked these at first, it looks like I am going to have to buy a new pair every winter to get the optimum cushioning effect.
