Levi's jeans still seem to be made with quality materials, and continue to be durable.  That's why I ordered this pair.  But after washing and wearing them for the first time, I realized that they're too short.  I already had two pair of the 31 x 32 550 Relaxed Fit Levi's which I had purchased from a local department store which fit well, so I thought I could purchase, sight unseen, another pair online.  I was wrong.  These Levi's are about 1/2 inch too short, even though the label says 31 x 32.  Why are there no size standards anymore?
