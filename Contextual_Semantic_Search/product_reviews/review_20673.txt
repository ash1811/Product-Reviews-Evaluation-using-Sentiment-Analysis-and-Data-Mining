soo comfortable.  cute, too.  these shoes have that comfy, cushioning sole that Softwalk is famous for.  They are a beautiful leather and a true navy color.  I can wear them without socks. When on, and wearing pants, they kind of  resemble clogs.  They are cute, super comfortable and the price was fantastic!
