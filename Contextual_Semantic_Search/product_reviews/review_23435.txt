I purchased this bag for traveling and it didn't disappoint.  There are many pockets to accommodate your kindle/ipad, ipod, water bottle and all the other things you would like to carry with you when traveling.  The bag is small enough that you don't feel like you are carrying a small suitcase on your shoulder, and is lightweight so you can carry a lot of "stuff" without being weighed down.
