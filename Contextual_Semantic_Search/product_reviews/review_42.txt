If you really need to learn a new language, and learn it fast, Rosetta Stone is the way. I've taken college/high school and even junior high classes and learned. I took a Berlitz course and learned. But by far, the fastest way to a new language - and outside of taking one as a kid in public school - the cheapest way, too, is Rosetta Stone.No, I don't work for them or even get to date that spokeswoman in the tight blue dress. But I do love learning languages and I really like RS. Lots of options to learn so you won't get bored. Very little of the repeat-after-me stuff from normal classes. And actual fun lessons. Plus iphone apps and internet based learning. They have the bases covered.Ok, what I don't like - the complexity of the install with all the verifications and such. I understand the need to prevent software theft. It seems like, as usual, the legitimate purchasers end up paying the price ($ and install-wise) for the people that don't. Arg! I'm not sure how easy/hard it would be to install it on two machines or even how hard a reinstall would be should you need to move to a new computer, but I dread finding out!That little caveat aside - and it only pertains to installing the one time - this is a TERRIFIC product. It ain't cheap, but real learning seldom is. And the benefits to you are huge.
