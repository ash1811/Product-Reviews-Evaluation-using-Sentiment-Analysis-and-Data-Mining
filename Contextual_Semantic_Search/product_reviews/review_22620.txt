I have owned this watch for five years, and it is still running and very accurate. Solar powered watches are great.  It charges up easily by sunlight or even putting it under a lamp overnight.  I have done several dives with the watch and it performed as expected.  It is not my main dive watch, I use a Casio G Shock most of the time, but if you prefer an analog with a one way ratcheted bezel this the way to go. My only criticisms, and they are minor, are that the date is way to small to read, they should have just not had a date and it would be better with a more anti reflection in the crystal, also it is on the small side, around 40mm without the crown, as larger faces are the style now. This is a tough watch and I highly recommend it!For more information and discussion of Citizen divers go to watch freaks forum:[...]There is special board dedicated to Citizen Watches.
