I've had to use these running shorts along with my previous pair of too-short shorts. The Champion brand are great for wicking away sweat and keeping a tender body area dry however they are extremely see-through immediately upon putting them on! If I wear my black running shorts over these I get the best of both worlds, but for the price of these shorts I would prefer to only need one bottom that has thick enough fabric to not show off my underwear/skin.
