Was having trouble changing the battery on my first one, broke the watch and just decided to buy a new one.  This one has tons of features, but, I like the stop watch and the multiple time zones.  ALso, the backlight display is awesome.Great little watch for your workouts.  will not dissapoint and is at a reasonable price point.
