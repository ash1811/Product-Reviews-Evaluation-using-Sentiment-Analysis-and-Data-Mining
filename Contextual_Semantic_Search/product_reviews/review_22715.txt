I had purchased the 24&#34;, and really liked it, but because of the length, I was catching it, and breaking it.  After the 3rd time, I decided to try the 22&#34; and it is just right.  It is very high quality and the design is so different from other chains I have looked at. even though I like a longer chain, this is just right, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a chain that will get compliments.
