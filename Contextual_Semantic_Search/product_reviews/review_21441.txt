They arrived yesterday and I'm very happy with them. I've been looking all over for pants like these. I'm curvy and I wear anything between a 12 or a 14 and the large fits perfect. I would suggest maybe a size down if you want them more form fitted. I really like the "great outdoors" aesthetic they have and I personally think they look really cute with spaghetti string tops or babydoll t-shirts.
