I needed this shirt for a project, and the deadline is fast approaching.  Was supposed to be 50/50 cotton/poly blend, pre-shrunk, so I ordered the size appropriately.  Turned out to be 100% cotton, which, of course, shrunk in the wash.  It's too inexpensive to be worth mailing back for a refund, so I'm out a few dollars. Believe the other bad reviews... this is a total bait and switch.Retailer was NY Lingerie, fulfilled by Amazon.Edit:  Amazon has offered a refund, given me a free return shipping to print, and help in waiving shipping fees for an alternative shirt.  As always, Amazon is awesome when they get a complaint.  It seems a lot of comparable shirts on Amazon have complaints of bad QC, sizing, or other issues, so I'm just going to try and get something locally instead.
