I've worn Timex Ironman watches for the past 13 years. This was the first time I switched to the Sleek version, and so far (4.5 months later), I'm still pretty happy with this watch.The sleek styling is more attractive for everyday wear than the original Ironman, but still maintains the functionality. The face is a bit small for reading numbers while running, and I don't use it for serious training (I use a Garmin Forerunner 305), but for a casual run concerned with elapsed time, this is more than adequate. I wear it with most outfits, except for business attire or evening wear.The styling is feminine but subdued, and I've received several compliments on it.I like that just the numbers light up when using the Indiglo, meaning that it is much more discreet if you are in a darkened auditorium or theater and need to check the time. It does not glow like a small flashlight.The paint is starting to chip off the face, but not very much. The paint on the buttons is about halfway gone.
