I first saw these on Footlocker.com and they were $67+. Out of curiosity I checked amazon and they were only $50. The ones I looked at on Footlocker were all white, no blue but the blue adds a really cute touch. They are comfortable and true to size I would say. I'm a 7 and they fit perfectly. I will definitely be considering buying the other colors in stock soon.
