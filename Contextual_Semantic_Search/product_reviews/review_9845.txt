The sleeveless t-shirts were purchased for someone who ALWAYS wears an extra large. But this shirt had arm holes that hung down so low it was truly unbecoming-- We like the sleeveless t's because they're cool but offer coverage and this gaping, unbecoming armhole revealed way too much of an area that isn't the most attractive. Could be its a 'style' thats new and we're unfamiliar and so it wasn't for us, per se, but seriously its very impractical to have so little coverage under the arm where a man wants the comfort of the cotton to wick away moisture and help keep one feeling cool vs clammy. We bought five colors of this same shirt because the price was right but had to return them all.
