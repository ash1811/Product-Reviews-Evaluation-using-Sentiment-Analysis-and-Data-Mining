Next time I will pay slightly more for the Nunn Bush Elden oxfords which are much more comfortable.  The main area of discomfort seems to be the upper.  The sides and the sole are good enough.  I've been wearing them for a few days and they are pretty broken in.Fit is accurate.Quality is good.Value is good.Comfort level is just below expectation.Again, look at the Nunn Bush Elden Oxfords.
