I have heard about these shoes for years and wore "desert boots" as a teen. Because I travel and walk a lot, I was am always looking for a comfortable shoe. The reviews were impressive so I jumped. I am very impressed. I read a travel book where the author said that these were the ONLY shoes that he wore on long trips, so I jumped. The shoes are very comfortable. The leather is heavy but soft ( I did NOT buy the suede because it shows spots when wet). There were conflicting statements regarding fit. I found the length perfect as was the width. Normally, I would order a 12 D or 13 Wide. These came only in a 12 D or 13 D, depending on the shoe.  I bought the 13 D and they fit just fine. I am looking forward to my next long walk.
