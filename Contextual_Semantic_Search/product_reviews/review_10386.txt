Dear sir,  I like the wangler jeans you sent me.  However one the pair of jeans has a defect in the stiching on the inner thigh near the knee.  It must be some type of manifacturing error.  I know they make many pairs of these type of jeans so quality control is offer missed.  The hole is about the size of your finger.  I would like your comment as to how we can correct this problem.  I will return them with your return policy, for a replacement.  I am sorry this happened, and I don,t blame you for excellent service.  Thank you very much for your  corrective action on this problem.  Respectively  Alan
