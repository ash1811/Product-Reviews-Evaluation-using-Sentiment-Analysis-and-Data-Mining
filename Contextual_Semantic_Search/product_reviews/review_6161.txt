A pair by the backdoor and a pair in the car for unexpectedly icy parking lots.  I've tried several other brands and was amazed at how much more effective these are.  Some people seem to walk on ice with no problem, but I'm not one of them and since I have to feed animals in the barn daily regardless of the conditions, I have always sought something that would give me secure footing.In Virginia, we don't have much snow, not even all that much ice, but when we get it, it can be a serious problem.  We don't have snow blowers and such--not enough need.  We just had a huge snowfall, the irregular top of which melts a little each day and refreezes at night making walking treacherous.  I'm so glad I have these.  The metal really bites into the ice giving very secure footing for your entire step, not just heel or toe.  They are easy to put on and take off and fold up to carry in pocket or purse in a store or someone's home.  The metal coils will mark a wood floor so it's best to remove them inside.  I keep a pair on barn boots by the door that I can slip on and off when at home, so I don't have to remove the YakTrax each time.No other product I'd tried before getting these allowed me to walk normally.  When wearing YakTrax I could run on the ice if I wanted to and still feel safe.  I've given many pairs as gifts and all recipients are awed by how well they work.  Some years I don't need them at all, but this winter so far, they are getting a workout.  Highly recommended.
