For my first automatic watch, this is one beautiful watch. It's actually not too big, i expected it to be bigger. It fits very comfortably on the wrist, and you don't really feel the weight, probably because the link is well designed.Resizing the band isn't trivial, the band uses some kind of clasp pins, which you need to be careful when pushing out. I pushed them out with a medium sized sewing needle.The orange monster is truly a gorgeous watch!
