I'm a pretty big guy, and need an extra-wide shoe in 13, so there aren't a lot of options for that size.  I've tried various New Balance and Nike, and settled on these.  As others have said, this is a somewhat big bulky shoe.  It's not for marathon running or the like, but with a wide base and really good cushioning, I think it's great for aerobics, racquetball, urban hiking, and similar activities.  I'm going to order 2 more pairs :)
