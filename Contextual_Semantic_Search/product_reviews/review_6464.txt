The shoes fit well but did not have the arch support I need...I wore them to work and lasted about 4 hours before my feet began to burn and ache...I contacted the seller and had no problem returning the shoes, even though I had worn them...would recommended buying from the seller as the customer service is superb...I bought a pair of shoes from them a couple of years ago and they were wonderful...These did not meet my needs as I work on concrete and require better arch support...Would recommend them for people who do not have flat feet..
