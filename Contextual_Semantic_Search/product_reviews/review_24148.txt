After years of hunting for the perfect underwear for my husband, I've finally hit the jackpot!  He absolutely loves these - "the most comfortable ever" to quote him.  They are holding up really well so far.UPDATE:  after several washings these have become very loose in the legs and as a result things that you want to stay in start hanging out.  Too bad, started off great.
