I would easily give a five star rating if only it didn't fit so overly tight. It is my normal size, yet takes all my strength to pull together in front so that I can close it. If only I could be sure the next size up wouldn't be too large in the cups, I would not hesitate to place the order. At present, I am still considering the idea because other than being too tight, this is a very pretty, as well as a very good quality bra.
