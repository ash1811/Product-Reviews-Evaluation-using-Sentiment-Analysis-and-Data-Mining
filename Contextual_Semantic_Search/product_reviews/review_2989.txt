I bought this for my nephew he is a mover, let me tell you the material is heavy but not to weigh you down, the wind will not penetrate the material because is like the material was deep in glue. It has a pocket inside the jacket, and three pockets in front. This jacket is very expensive, My brother bought the same jacket at the store for almost $200.00. I think the jacket look better up-close, great deal too.
