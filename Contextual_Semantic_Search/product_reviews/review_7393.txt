I needed undershirts for my medical uniform. I didn't like the prices on the various scrubs websites. I order these. They do not wick away moisture and can be bulky compared to shirts designed for medical uniforms, but they serve the purpose enough. The sleeves were a little long. Easy to care for wash and toss in the dryer!
