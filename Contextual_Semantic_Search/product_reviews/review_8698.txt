It's a good watch don't get me wrong. The problem is I got it for my wife, she wanted a watch with 24hr time for her work . It has this feature the problem is it dose not toggle back and forth, you have to go to the settings and change it each time. What's the problem you say, well she wants AM/PM time when she is not at work and doesn't want to change it each time. However she likes it enough to keep it and only wear it at work. Also it has buttons on the face which is kind of an odd place you have to be careful if you bump something. Otherwise like I said it defiantly good enough to keep!
