Beware - Fake Fur - As many reviewers wrote they run small.  i order a size up and they were still tight for a day or two.  They are good quality and look better than most and definitely more comfortable than most but they should be for the price.  I almost returned them because the fur is fake.  I was really looking forward to the sheepskin so i was disappointed but i gave them a try and like them and kept them.  I didn't know UGG made fake fur so if that's the only reason you are getting them look elsewhere.
