Took advice of previous reviewers and ordered 1/2 size smaller.  They are a snug fit - will not be able to wear the heavier boot socks with them, which I like with boots.  Shipping and delivery were lightening fast.  Boots are great but will darken them with Bear Grease leather dressing, which will also soften them so hopefully they stretch out a little faster.
