I ordered this for my husband cause he needed a new BLACK polo. His was getting faded (how black does after a while) He wears a large in every shirt size. Ordered a large, which said it would fit his measurements and it was baggy. Not toooo bad, but i returned it because it was less black than the one we already had that was FADED. What the heck? I wanted a black polo, not a faded black polo.Overall the quailty seemed nice, maybe in a different color would be ok. Would still be baggy though!
