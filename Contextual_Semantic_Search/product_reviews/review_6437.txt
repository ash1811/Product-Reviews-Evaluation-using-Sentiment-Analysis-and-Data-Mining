These are my favorite t-shirts, great for lounging or for work (construction).  The material is the perfect weight...not too heavy, not too thin so no matter what the weather is, I'm comfortable in them. If it's a hot day, it doesn't cling to my skin and if it's a chilly day it layers well under a sweatshirt without bulking. I like how the material feels and that the collar area fits nice around the neck without any sagging.  They also wash and hold up well.
