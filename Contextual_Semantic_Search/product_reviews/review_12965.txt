Love Levi's jeans and the 550 fits me the best. The pants I bought are black with a black leather label with silver letters. The small Levi's tag is red. Not faded, not washed, the jeans have a new look but are not stiff. The thing that pleases me the most is buying them from Amazon. I take a popular size and when I go to the department store my size is more often than not &#34;sold out&#34;. How nice it is to not only have my size but also a choice of colors!
