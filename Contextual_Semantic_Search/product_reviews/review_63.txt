My 2.5 year old got the 3-4 year suit. It's a little tight to begin with, so he fit in it just fine. The pants were a little longer, but with shoes, he fit it, no problem. (He is "average" height and weight, for a 2.5 year old, according to docs.)  If your child is "meaty" at all like mine is on top, I would suggest getting the larger size.After reading the other reviews about how flimsy this costume was, I didn't let my kiddo wear it until the actual day of Halloween. He ran around a lot but it didn't tear at all. I think it has a couple more good uses in it.If you are hoping to buy a costume that will last and will allow your child to play in it at home, I don't think this is the one. They have the $50 one that looks a lot more sturdier. But if it's just for this Halloween and maybe next year for the kiddo next door, then by all means, get this one!!!  For the price we paid ($35), I am very happy with the purchase and the pictures of him enjoying being the Heroic "Buzz" will last forever, even if the suit doesn't!
