I love these booties for my casual environment work. They are so very comfortable, look fine. Regular length trousers hid the fringe.  Nice with gray pants. These really help both comfort any balance. Well made.  They really do run long.  I have narrow feet and they fit me perfectly - I do not recommend these for wide feet.
