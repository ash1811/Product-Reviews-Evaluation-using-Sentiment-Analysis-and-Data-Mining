I just got these in brown and black. The size 5.5 is perfect for me, so these are true to size and have a little give in the toes. They look great with skirts (wearing the brown ones with tights now) and with jeans. They slip on so easily I'll wear them everywhere. I would give 5 stars, but the sides wrinkle as I walk. No biggie, just not as sleek-looking on the sides as I walk. But I'm probably the only one who notices that.Oh, the leather is soft; these were comfortable right out of the box. Not sure they'll last more than 2 years, but they're reasonably priced, look good, feel good, so I'm okay with that.
