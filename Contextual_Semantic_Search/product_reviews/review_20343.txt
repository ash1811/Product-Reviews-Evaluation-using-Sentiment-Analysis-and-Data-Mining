These are super comfy and very fluffy, and like someone said, the seams are nice and they stay up too.  My big problem is that after wearing about 5 times, the fuzzy part is completely flat/matted down on the bottom (sole) now, and no amount of washing, brushing or fabric softener will return them to their former glory.
