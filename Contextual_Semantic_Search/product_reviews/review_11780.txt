My wife is on her feet working with customers for many hours each day.  We purchased these for her to help her alleviate some of the aches that she was feeling each day.  The shoes fit as expected.  More importantly, her feet get some of the extra padding needed to lower the aches and pains at the end of the day.  On the downside, the shoes are a little bit &#34;clunky&#34; looking.If you're looking for a comfortable shoe that can help you be on your feet a lot, and looks are not critical, then this is the shoe for you.
