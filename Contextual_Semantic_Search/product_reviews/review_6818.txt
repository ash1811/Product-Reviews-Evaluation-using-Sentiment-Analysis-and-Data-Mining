I cannot understand why these socks , not too long ago available in the mens department at nearly every department or mens clothing store , have disappeared from their shelves , except maybe we have become a flip-flop and sneaker society . Most comfortable available for long days wear , cool and lightweight , and from my experience , the longest wearing .
