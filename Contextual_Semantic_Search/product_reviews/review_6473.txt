I bought my first pair of Quarky's (in bubblegum pink, which I picked from a selection including only lime green, banana yellow, and the pink) 5 years ago.  I was told they were gardening shoes; no difference to me, I have no ability to stand on cement for more than 5 minutes without spending the balance of the day walking crookedly.  These shoes were and remain REALLY COMFORTABLE...no kidding, they are so comfortable, weigh little, are waterproof, and don't look like rubber (which I think that they are).  I just bought a second pair in black (having finally wearied of strangers eyeballing my feet in the pink ones.)Others have commented on the squeak; yep, these new ones are a little squeaky, and I don't recall that the others ever were.  Maybe they were, and I've just to wear them in.  At any rate, these are super shoes, and very comfortable; I am an educator and spend hours and hours on my feet in lecture halls. They're great!! If I had a need to enter a room without being noticed, I suppose that I'd slip them off. :)
