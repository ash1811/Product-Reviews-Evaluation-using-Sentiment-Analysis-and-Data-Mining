I bought this for my niece as a gift for finishing the Harry Potter series in one summer and she loved it. She was ecstatic about getting the Elder wand, the most powerful wand in the Wizarding world. Definitely realistic looking and well worth the price since it comes in an original looking Ollivander's box.
