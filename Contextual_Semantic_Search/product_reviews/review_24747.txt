Unlike a lot of other brands and products, Reef seems to have kept its eye on quality over the years.  They are bombproof and comfortable.  This is my third pair.  The first literally lasted 8 years before one of the toe thingamaboppers disintegrated. The second pair I decided to replace after four years because they were getting a little gamey.  This pair of Phantoms continues the tradition.  They are well-made and comfortable.  I can wear them around the house or wear them on a campsite.  If they get dirty, you can always scrub them with a still brush or toss them in the washer.  I use a laundry bag. (Obviously, you can't do this with leather flip-flops, but you probably wouldn't want to take them camping, either).  I've tried a couple of other brands, Havianas and Crocs, and the quality is incomparable.  It may not be an issue if you just use your flip flops for an occasional trip to the beach or the shower, but if you abuse your gear as much as I do, I highly recommend the Reef Phantoms.  And they're only $25. Cheap!
