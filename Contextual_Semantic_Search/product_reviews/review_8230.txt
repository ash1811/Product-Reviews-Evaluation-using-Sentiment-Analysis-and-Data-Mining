This is the best watch I have ever bought. I own a Swiss Army Officer's watch and a wonderful blue faced Citizens Chronograph. The Invicta easily tops them all. Heavy, solid, high quality time piece. The word "Invicta" is inscribed on the side of the watch as well as on each and every link of the band. The sweep hand runs very smoothly.The "ecodrive" works flawlessly and it has kept perfect time. The date window is easily visualized, and the crystal is super clear!This is one of the best looking wacthes I have ever seen. It screams high end quality, but thanks to Amazon, we can get it at a super price.If you like high quality, heavy, "manly" :-) watch this one is for you!
