I agree that these are super comfortable and I wish they did fit, but unfortunately they were just way too narrow for my feet and I had to send them back.  I felt like my feet kept sliding over the inside of the flip flop every time I walked.  I wear a size 10 and measured that my foot is 4" at the widest part (across from below big toe to below small toe). Hope that helps someone else!
