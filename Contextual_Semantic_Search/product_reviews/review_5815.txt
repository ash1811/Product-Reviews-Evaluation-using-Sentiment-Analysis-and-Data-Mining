Only time will tell how long they last. But I've had shirts from expensive mail order houses that wore through the elbow in less than a year, and from cheap no-names that lasted ten years. These look nice both with jeans and with a sport jacket.* * *Follow-up less than two months later: After only a few wearings and washings, two of these have started to come apart at the seams. This shirt is way too light and flimsy. I would not buy these again. Dropped my rating from four stars to two. Hopefully my two remaining shirts will last longer.I will stick to the Hanes, which seem to be better quality.
