This is a great scarf for the price. It's soft and made of decent material. It is a little itchy when you first open it, but I'm sure that goes away after a wash. Highly recommended for all your Harry Potter-esque activities. I bought this in conjunction with theHarry Potter Ravenclaw Scarf - Midnight Blue and Greyand I would say that this one is better.
