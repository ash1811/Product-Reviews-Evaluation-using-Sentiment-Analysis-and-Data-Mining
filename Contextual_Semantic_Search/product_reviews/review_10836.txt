I got these for work as something a little more formal than work boat.  I work in a lab and stand on my feet most of the day.  The size seemed a little big, but it could just be the roomy toe-box.  The initial feel was very plush, but the insole has firmed up a bit and feels supportive.  The black leather is more of a satin finish and not glossy.  Overall I feel it was a good buy.  Now only if they came in brown leather.
