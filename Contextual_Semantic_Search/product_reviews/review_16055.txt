I was very concerned I would get a size that was too big based on my regular shoe size and some of the reviews. I would recommend at most that it may be a little on the larger size and probably less than a half size larger. I would just order your usual size because as is or with thicker socks this boot size is perfect. Very light too, will fit with jeans or cargo style for sure. The side zipper a nice touch not easily seen to help put on/remove boot.
