First of all, be warned that only the upper "cap" is padded, not the walls of the main body of the bag. That was a disappointment based on the product name ("Padded" Umbrella Stroller Travel Bag), even though it means folding the bag when not in use will be easier.The zipper is the smaller and weaker size (cheap luggage always has a small zipper while more substantial luggage has a larger and stronger zipper). Childress could have spent an extra 35 cents with their Chinese supplier to have a larger and stronger zipper installed (after all, the price of zippers on the China market is low). When this zipper fails, I will replace it with the larger, more robust size zipper that Childress was too cheap to spec.I bought the bag for my new First Years Ignite stroller (I highly recommend this umbrella stroller for those traveling). The Ignite stroller just barely fits, if you rotate the front wheels inward, position the handles on the inward side of the padded cover (next to the upper cap "fold"), and keep repeating "I think I can, I think I can". I wish the bag was 1/2" to 1" longer. If you also have an Ignite Stroller, you can safely go ahead and buy this bag. But be careful to pack it as I said, to avoid putting excessive stress on the cheap zipper.Given the cheap Childress stroller bags (the red ones) say "Gate Check" on the side, you would correctly assume that their premium bag here would also be labeled, especially since they decided to go with the same black color as common luggage. On the side of the bag, it should say, "Gate Check....Handle With Care-Stroller". I can't understand Childress with this bag. While you are paying more, they skip important features like the labeling that wouldn't cost them much at all.
