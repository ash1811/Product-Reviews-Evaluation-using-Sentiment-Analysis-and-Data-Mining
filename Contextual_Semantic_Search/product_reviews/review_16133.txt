We bought this for our first plane trip with car seat (infant carrier, Chicco Keyfit 30). It worked great, survived the plane trip well. For the infant seat, it was quite roomy. We stuffed other items in as well, since you can check a car seat for free. We didn't really try out the backpack straps on this trip, but I can imagine they would be helpful.
