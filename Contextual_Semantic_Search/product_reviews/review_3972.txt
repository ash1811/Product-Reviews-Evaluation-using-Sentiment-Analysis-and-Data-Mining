MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS. I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL,SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL. IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE,BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME!
