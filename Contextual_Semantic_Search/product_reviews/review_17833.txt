My son likes the look of the watch.  Its a bulky watch though, if that's what you're looking for.  One thing I don't like about it is setting the analog hands on the watch (all the G-Shocks) is a hassle.  It's not like a regular analog watch, you have to set it by pushing a button and the hands move electrically, you don't just turn the crown of the watch like an analog watch.
