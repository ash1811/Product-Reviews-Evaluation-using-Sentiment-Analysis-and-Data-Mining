I'm a long-time Reef Sandals owner and these sandals are well constructed, super comfortable and look great.  A bonus is that they have a bottle opener built in.  Someone really figured out the lifestyle and designed a neat feature.They are a little pricey at over $40, but in my opinion, you get what you pay for and they'll last much longer and are far more comfortable than the cheapo sandals, so it evens out in my mind.
