My new panties are so soft and comfortable.  I have tried at least 3 different no line panties all of which have lines somewhere.  What is that about.  But my Jockey's are great.  Lots of give so no binding when you twist or stretch, look sleek beneath pants, you have to check you remembered to put them on.  Thanks,
