I had a pair of leather Sanuk sandals and after about a year my feet hurt every time I wore them.  Not sure if it was the sandal, but I bought a pair of these bad boys and my feet don't hurt at all.  They are like walking on a cloud.  For the price you can't beat it either.  Once these wear out I'm definitely getting another pair.
