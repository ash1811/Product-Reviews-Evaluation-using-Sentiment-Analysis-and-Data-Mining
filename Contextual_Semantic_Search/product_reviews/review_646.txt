I am wearing a wire bra in a parade and don't want any wardrobe malfunctions. After buying two other more expensive pairs, one too light (who would have thought that Jennifer Lopez was considered &#34;dark&#34;) and one whose reviewers swore it was adhesive and it wasn't , I finally found these again and they arrived quickly .  I'm SO pleased!!!!!
