I have never bought the same pair of shoes twice, but after three years with a pair of these, I just bought an identical replacement pair. They are so comfortable. They have good arch support. They are warm, waterproof and light weight. If I'm not wearing sneakers or dress shoes, these are all my feet want to have on.
