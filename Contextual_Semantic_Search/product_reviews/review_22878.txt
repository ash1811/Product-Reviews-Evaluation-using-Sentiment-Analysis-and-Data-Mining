I read several reviews and knowing that they are leather and will stretch I ordered a full size down. However, they seem to run a size and a half larger, as even though I ordered a size down they are too large. It isn't horribly large though and I will hand onto these, but wish I had ordered a size and a half or two full sizes smaller. I think, the thing is, that these are men's sizes, not womens.
