I bought these earrings as a lightning deal special last November. I've been very satisfied with them. Size-wise, the external diameter of the earring is pretty much identical to that of a US nickel ($.05) coin.  I laid one of the earrings on top of a nickel coin, and when I lined up the bottom of the earring with the edge of the coin, the fastener wire at the top extended just a bit beyond the edge of the coin - at the open end, not the hinge end.I like the feel of these earrings; they aren't too heavy to be comfortable to wear, but they are substantial. They present a nice profile from the front.I've worn them a few times a week for three or four months now, with no problems at all. The fasteners seem to be a little hard to snap shut, but I like that because it means they are not likely to come unfastened accidentally. And they haven't come undone by accident, unlike other hoops with similar closures, which have sometimes been slipped open by contact with a scarf or coat collar.UPDATED on June 30, 2012: These earrings are still one of my go-to wardrobe mainstays. I wear them at least three days a week, and they are usually the only earrings I take when traveling. I have no idea if the quality of the earrings being sold now, is different from this pair that I bought two and a half years ago. However, my earrings (the 14k yellow and white gold version) are still going strong. The wire fasteners are still working well and the finish is clear and bright. I haven't abused these earrings but I haven't babied them, either. The price of precious metals has gone up since late 2009 when I bought these, and my budget's rather tight right now. If not for those two facts I'd be buying the all-yellow-gold version of these earrings in a heartbeat. For now, they are on my wish list.
