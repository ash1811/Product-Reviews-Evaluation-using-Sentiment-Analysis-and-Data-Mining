I have always struggled with finding a good bra since I have a larger chest size.  This bra is great.  It is very supportive throughout the day, no sagging.  The straps don't slip.  Two caveats:  It can make your breasts look a little pointy and smaller.  I'm in my early thirties with a baby, so I'm past caring that my breasts look a little smaller and less round.  I want support and comfort!  It's still a pretty bra, though.  Also, it is a little tight and leaves marks, but again, with looser bras, I didn't get the support, so I'll accept the trade off.
