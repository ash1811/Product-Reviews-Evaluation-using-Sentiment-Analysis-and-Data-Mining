This was my 2nd pair of Keen sandals.  My other 7 year old sandals are still totally functional but I just wanted another color.  They are very comfortable and do best when you are traversing between land and water.  They are also great for hiking or just doing daily stuff.  I always get 1 size larger for comfort.  I don't like a long wear in process.
