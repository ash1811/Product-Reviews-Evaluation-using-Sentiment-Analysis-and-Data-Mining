I wish this came in different sizes, because as a petite lady they are way too long and a bit baggy. Worked just fine for the occasion, but I would rather have the top of the stockings be visible since they're quite pretty. Instead they go to the very top of my thighs and then there is still some slack. For reference, I'm 5'1&#34;.
