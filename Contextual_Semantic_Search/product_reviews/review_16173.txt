I've had these thermal pants for a few weeks now, and I like them quite a bit. I wear them almost every day to battle the moderate cold of a California winter--yes, it can get pretty cold here! I wouldn't recommend them for temperatures near or below freezing, but they're nice for everyday wear. Medium bulk, so they wear fine under all but the most snug-fitting pants. One gripe is that the area at the top, above the pant legs (the butt and groin area), is out of proportion with the legs, so it's kind of loose. Maybe they're designed to be worn with adult diapers? That might explain why the brand name on the tag is "Faded Glory" ;^)
