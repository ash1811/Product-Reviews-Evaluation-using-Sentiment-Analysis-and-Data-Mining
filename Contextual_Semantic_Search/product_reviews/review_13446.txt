I really dislike fat wallets but from time to time I try to put too many cards in mine and stretch it out. This usually happens in vegas when I pack it full of casino rewards cards, a room key or two and more cash than the usual six bucks I have on me. After the wallet is packed and stretched out its pretty much over for that wallet becasue you have to keep enough stuff in there to make sure it stays tight and doesn't fall out.This wallet won't do that. Its designed better than any wallet I have used before. The materials are adequate but the design is really what earns this wallet 5 stars. This wallet expands nicely for cash and whatever else you want to put in there. There is nothing I would change about this it.
