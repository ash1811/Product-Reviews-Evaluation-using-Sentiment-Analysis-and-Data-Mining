Pros:* Good stitching* Quality leather* Comfortable fit* No nonsense style* Removable insole* Easily broken in* The leather creases gracefully* Takes good shine* Brushed polish looks greatCons:* Extremely cheap quality of lace; if you get it throw the original laces and get a new pair.* Cordovan colour looks bad after the leather starts creasing.Summary:Great buy for $50. Recommend these pair of shoes in black. Will certainly buy another pair.Update 7/27/13:* Use them everyday at work. Takes wax polish very well. Aging gracefully. Doesn't look cheap.
