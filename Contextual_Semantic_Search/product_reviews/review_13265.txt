I ordered this because it was the cheapest 34DD I could find on here. I was trying to figure out which size I should be wearing. I'm glad I only bought this as a practice because it's the ugliest bra I've ever owned. The picture is misleading. The straps are ridiculously big with NO room for adjustment - well, maybe about 3" of strap which is nothing if you're tall - I'm on the short side so no big deal but for anyone that needs more room - don't get this bra.And it abslolutely gave me cone boobs. I think I just missed the worst of it but anyone bigger than my size is going to have a problem. It wasn't just cone-age - it separated my boobs so badly that it looked like they were trying to run away from each other. I wore this bra for a total of 24 hours (and wore heavy sweatshirts all day so no one could see my weird boobs) then got my butt pronto to my local mall and purchased much better bras in my new correct size.Yuck. Ugly bra, ugly fit - just stop now - put it away!!
