I just bought 8 of these, 4 of the charcoal and 4 of the dark blue one. There's a spot for my nice pen in the left pocket without actually opening the pocket, and the pockets are good for holding my notebook or random receipts and papers or whatever else. I smoke cigars and these dickies do burn holes. I heard a rumor that you couldn't burn dickies, but just disproved that myth hahaha. Really awesome work shirts though, truck drivers don't think twice!!!
