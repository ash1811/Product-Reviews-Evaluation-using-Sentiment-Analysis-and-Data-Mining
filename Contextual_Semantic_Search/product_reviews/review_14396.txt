This was the perfect gift for a man, for a woman on a budget!  The price simply does not reflect the quality and feel of this watch.  The leather band is both durable and flexible for comfort. Colors and other details are true to the picture shown. The watch has a nice weight to it, without being burdensome to your wrist. My boyfriend loved the classic style and how easily the watch transitions from everyday to a nicer occasion.
