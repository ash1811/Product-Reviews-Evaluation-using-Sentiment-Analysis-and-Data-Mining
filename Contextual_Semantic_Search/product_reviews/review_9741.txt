I have a size 32 waist and ordered the size 32, despite what others said.  My legs are kind of skinny, and the initial fit at the leg opening was a bit snug, but after one swim and wash, the tightness deisappeared.  These things fit like the proverbial glove.I'm not a competetive swimmer, but I do swim longer distances (1/4 mile to 1 mile).  There's a very noticeable difference between swimming in regular old swim trunks and these.I don't bother to review a lot of my purchases, and I'm not a fanboy who gives five stars to everything I review.  I am completely satisfied with this purchase, and would absoluetly recommend this suit to anyone interested in swimming.
