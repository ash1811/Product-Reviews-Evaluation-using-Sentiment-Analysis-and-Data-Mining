since I read this was cheap, I ordered 2. However, I still have yet to break the first one. I have used this to change the strap several times on my breitling super avenger, tag heuer aquaracer, oris dive, and omega planet ocean.So far so good - and at this price, if it does break, I won't cry about it.
