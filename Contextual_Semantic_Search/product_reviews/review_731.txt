Nipples Upward and fashion backwards, this bra is a blast from the past that takes getting used to for those of us with larger endowments (40D and up). Usually I am trying to slightly minimize the overwhelming appearance of my chest (I wear anywhere from a 38G-44C, depending on the brassiere manufacturer), but this rather comfortable buttressed wonder is "an all signs point to two Kilmanjaros" kind of affair!The sort of high-construct, seamed directly-over-the-nipples cups, heavy-duty, thick-banded bra that macho litterati Ernest Hemmingway and Mickey Spillane would have waxed over, and the Godfather of bras, Howard Hughes would have machinated. And while it does fit great (though runs large), and makeS you feel sexy as all get out, it does NOT work with about 75% of my wardrobe, or most modern wardrobes I would venture, as clingy knits, spandexes and thin t-shirt cottons are the order of day. The back band of the bra sticks WAY out under any rayon-thin, drapey fabric, and that's with the correct size; it is just a clunky kind of bra.But since Amazon sells these Bali Flower Underwire Bras so inexpensively, I decided to keep it anyway. Under thicker shirts the back band is less noticeable (but not the upwards-pointing nipples!). Hell, I might even buy another one in the suggestively named navy, "Midnight." You could run without bouncing with the bulls in this! Spain is waiting.
