I had been wearing Z-coil shoes for the last 2 yrs and my feet must have changed, not really sure why but the Z-coils weren't as comfortable at all. Saw these here on Amazon, read the reviews and decided to take a chance and I AM GLAD I DID!I work 8 hrs a day on my feet, had a TKR  about 17 mths ago, and I need good comfortable shoes. The first day I wore these to work I took my old shoes just in case I couldn't take a whole day of breaking them in. Never needed to. I've been wearing these for a little over a week now, and my feet are happy happy happy!  Just what I needed- I will purchase again
