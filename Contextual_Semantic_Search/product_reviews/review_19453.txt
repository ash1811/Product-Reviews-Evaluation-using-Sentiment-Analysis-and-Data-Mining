I like the look and feel of these.  They do seem to be a bit larger than I wanted.  The size 4's I ordered are the same length as the size 5 shoes I have.  My son has worn them a few times, but since his foot is still so skinny (size 3.5-4 and not a chubby baby foot) they do come off more than the Zutano fleece booties he has.
