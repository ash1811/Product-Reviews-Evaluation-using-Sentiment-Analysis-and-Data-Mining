They are the softest I've found and fit pretty well. Carefull if you have some muscle in your butt or thighs though since the leg length is a little on the shorter side and increased butt or thigh size exacerbates the issue. I've had issues with some competing brands having little to no space in the crotch despite thier advertisements (they aren't even stitched to have space) but these provide a reasonable amount of space if you like it nice and snug.
