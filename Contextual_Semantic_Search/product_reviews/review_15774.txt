I bought these socks thinking they may be like some fantastic socks that I bought in a factory outlet in Salisbury, NC when I was visiting friends there.  NOT SO.  These socks are totally unfinished on the inside and consequently I feel little bunches of thread bothering my toes/feet.  I am sorry I donated to the troops via this outfit, because I am afraid they just aren't what they're cracked up to be (regardless of the glowing reports).
