i was told by a woman who works for amazon that these reefs r the ones to get , she said she had to order them 1 size bigger than her normal shoe size and suggested i do the same , she said she had a wider foot and so do i , turns out she was rite , the 1 size bigger than my normal show size is a great fit ! these r very comfy , i just got them today and i'm already waring them . these r awesome , after having them for a month or so now the bed of the sandle is forming to my foot some what AWESOME ! i am so glad i got 1 size bigger as suggested to me by a Amazon employee. i will ware these till they fall apart , so comfy , and i pray that u continue to have these !so i can buy more !!
