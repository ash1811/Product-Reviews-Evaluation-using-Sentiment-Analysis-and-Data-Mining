This is a great sturdy, light, well-organized bag to carry in emergencies. It saved the day on a recent trip as I took back much more than I brought over, & this worked well as my carry-on because my purse and all gifts fit into it. It folds up small, but holds a lot of contents once opened. Baggallini makes great products.
