I have a high arch, and I love that Rainbow makes this double layer option, which provides better arch support than most sandals.I had my first pair for 7 years.  They were well worn and comfy until they got flooded out in hurricane sandy and I found them sodden and covered in mold.The replacement pair I got on amazon is every bit as good as the originals!If you are new to rainbows, they take some breaking in.  They are quite firm, and at first try they may not seem that comfortable.That firmness is helpful for long hours on your feet as they provide excellent support compared to squishier foam sandals.Give them a chance, after a week or two they start to mold to the shape of your foot, and become more and more comfortable over time.  They are my favorite footwear, highly recommended!
