Pros:* Appearance (Beeswax) - I wasn't sure about them at first from the pictures but once you put them on they do look very good. They are a little darker than in the photos, and color isn't completely uniform. They also scuff easily but it just adds to the great "worn in" look. Great way to grow up your shoe collection from sneakers without going to full on dress shoes.Cons:* Uncomfortable - The sole is not padded and my feet hurt after the first office work day. After a few days you do get used to it but I really recommend insoles.* Sole color - gets blackened very quickly and easily and are the reason I'm stuck with my slightly-too-small size.Other:* Sizing - As people have said, they run big. I recommend 0.5 size down at the most and NOT 1 full size smaller. A half size down may be a bit long but when I went a full size down (to 8 from my normal 9) they were too narrow and tight across the top of my feet. They are so tight that I unfortunately cannot use insoles. For most comfort you might just stick with your normal size and use insoles to full up the extra space.
