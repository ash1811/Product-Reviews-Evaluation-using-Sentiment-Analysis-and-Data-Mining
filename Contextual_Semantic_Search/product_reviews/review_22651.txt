I will say that it took me several months to work up the courage to purchase this watch.  I hesitated because it looked too bulky.  In reality it is bulky but that is what I was looking for in this particular watch.  Surprisingly, it wasn't as bulky as I thought it would be.  I purshased the watch to wear during the warm months with short sleeve shirts.  It is an eye catcher but I don't care about that really.  I own 4 Citizen Eco-Drives and love the brand.  This watch is built like a tank and I love the simplicity.  Time and date is all you're getting from this monster and that is just fine with me.  I wear my more expensive and overly complicated Eco-Drive watches when I need more than just time and date.  If you like quality along with size, this is the watch for you.  If you plan on wearing it with dress shirts, you may want to go in another direction because most cuffs will not fit over this monster.  All in all another great product and value from Citizen.
