Sadly, had to return item as it was too small.  Husband usually buys this size but this product did not fit and was too tight.  Looked like a great shoe and was comfortable for the 10 seconds he had his foot in it. Too bad.... Also, did not have wider size when we returned so we had to purchase another brand.
