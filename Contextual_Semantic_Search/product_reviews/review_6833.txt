I love these socks. I have to wear dress socks all day and every sock that goes half way up the calf ends up slouching for me and I end up pulling them up all the time. These do not. I may have to pull them up once or twice during the day but that is all. Also, I have large calves and they fit over my large calves. Beyond that, I have been buying these socks for years and they are durable.
