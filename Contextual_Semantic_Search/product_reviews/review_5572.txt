This Ultra Force "Vintage Camo Boonie Hat" looks great and is good physical quality, but it is sized a little small. We ordered this from a company that does custom embroidery and was generally impressed with the vintage look of the hat.If it wasn't a little smaller than expected it would be just about perfect, but as is I am pleased since it fits another family member just fine.Recommended, but I will order a size larger next time.CFH
