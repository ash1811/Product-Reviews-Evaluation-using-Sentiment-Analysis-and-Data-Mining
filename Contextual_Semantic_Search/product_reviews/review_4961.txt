The main reason why I got this underwear is because I experience much chafing with other underwear that will get wet, have rigid sewing lines, and have little bits of cotton ball up inside of them, all of which attribute to chafing.  I bodybuild, so at 6'2&#34; 250 lbs, no chafing is important to me.  Also, these are great for exercising, which is also a plus.  They will never rip from squatting, and they dry quickly, making sweating more comfortable.  Oh yeah, back to chafing.  These eliminated any and all chafing I had.  Also, I like that they have extra space around the balls for more airiness.  They can ride up, but the fabric is so comfortable that it doesn't bother me if it does happen although these do seem to ride up less often than Hanes and the like.
