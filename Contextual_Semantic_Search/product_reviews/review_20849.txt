This is a very pretty pendant.  It is well made, the size is as described, and I think the price is very reasonable.  The angel is high polish, and it is a good weight. It is about 2mm in thickness. The chain slides through the wings of the angel and stays put if properly centered before wearing.  Because of the kind of chain and the way it slides through the pendant, the angel does not lie perfectly flat (it is slightly tilted); however, it looks and feels nice.  The chain itself measures 16 inches (including the lobster claw clasp), and it has a 4 inch extension chain that makes the chain adjustable from 16 inches to 20 inches.  The chain is about 1  mm in diameter and is a good weight for the angel.  The snake type chain is not one of my favorites, and I am pleased that I can easily replace the chain if I so choose.  This little piece of jewelry can have any number of symbolic meanings for the wearer.  What is there not to like?I initially bought one of these pendants as a Christmas gift for a 100 year old aunt.  She seemed very pleased.  Because she knew I had ordered the pendant and had it sent to her, sight unseen, she sent me an email describing it.  I knew that I had made a good choice in choosing this gift for her.  I later bought one for myself and two more for gifts for my daughters.  All of the recipients are very special people and are many many miles away.  The idea is "everyone needs a guardian angel,"  and hopefully, the wearers will have warm fuzzies (and maybe, just maybe, they will think of me) when they wear their angel. It's sorta' a family thing...doncha' know! ;)
