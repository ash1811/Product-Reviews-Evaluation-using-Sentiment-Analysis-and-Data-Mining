This belt is a favorite of mine and it goes with most colors except dark clothing. For example, when I dress in black I use a black belt. When I dress in lighter colors I wear this belt. It will replace any brown belt. It has the Columbian design and several colors are inlaid into the leather belt. It also has a padded leather inside. I like this belt and have worn it for a couple years.
