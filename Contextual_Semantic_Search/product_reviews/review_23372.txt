It's big, a bit heavy and bold with lots of sparkle.  Great watch for me to wear everyday.  I tried to take out the pins for link adjustment and it turned into a nightmare.  Save yourself apologies for using bad language and damaging the links and just take it to a jeweler.  For a small fee they will adjust it to your wrist.  The pins are all but glued in there and are not an easy fix unless you have all the right equipment.  Even my jeweler had a few colorful words to say but did get the job done.  This is my second watch purchase from Amazon and my second Guess Watch.  Very pleased.
