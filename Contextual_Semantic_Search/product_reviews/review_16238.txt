One has expectations when buying 44&#34;x32&#34; work pants to actually work in.  These do not meet those needs.  The legs are too narrow, the crotch is too short and the crotch is too narrow.  Ouch!  So if you are a natural 34x32 plus a big beer gut then these are for you.  Otherwise not even close.
