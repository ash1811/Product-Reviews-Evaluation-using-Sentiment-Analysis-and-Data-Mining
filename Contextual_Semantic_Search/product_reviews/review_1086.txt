I've worn this underwear for years and gave up finding more (should have thought of Amazon earlier) The fit is perfect for me, high enough they don't slide off my hips, low enough they don't slide up the cheeks of my fanny, leg cut large enough to not cut off the circulation in my legs, more? oh yeah, they're all cotton
