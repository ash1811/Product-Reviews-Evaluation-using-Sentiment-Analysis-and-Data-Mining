If you are a busty woman (anywhere from C cup or above), then this bra is for you.  I have tried numerous other (very expensive) sports bras, but none has provided the level of support AND comfort that the Enell does.  Now, I have no problem with the fact that there are no strap adjustments, but apparently some women find the straps are too short/long for them.  It fits me perfectly and I have changed sizes over the years.  Be sure to take the time to measure your rib cage (below the breast) and across your breasts to determine the correct size to order.  The basic calculation is breast size (let's say a 40) minus rib cage size (say 34) equals your cup size (40-34 = 6).  Count the alphabet to 6 letters (in our example, F) and that's your cup size.  Many products use double and triple D, so an F = DDD as well.  As anyone with large breasts knows, it can be difficult to get excited about exercise when every bounce hurts, but exercise is SO important for our physical and mental health.  So take a little time to figure out your size, and spend a little extra money, and get a good bra!
