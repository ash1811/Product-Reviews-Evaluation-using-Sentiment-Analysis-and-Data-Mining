The size on these pants was not the normal 4X. I would guess them to be more like 6X. They are way too long and on the pocket that is on the right leg just above the knee is a bright red Dickies tag. I really don't want to wear pants with a tag on the middle of my leg. They wrinkled when they were washed. (Hot water did not shrink them.) Maybe if they actually fit, I might be happier.
