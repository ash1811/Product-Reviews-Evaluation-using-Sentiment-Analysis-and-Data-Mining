Initially this shirt was a good fit and pattern for a large tall. The sleeves are actually tall sized as well.....but the fabric was too soft and too stretchy, i could tell that it would not wear well in the long run. But after only one wash the collar is completely deformed and wrinkled, as if there is no elastic in the collar.The body of the shirt is twisted after washing and the front hem is now 2 inches shorter than the back due to uneven shrinkage. The fabric is way too pliable and has no structure and stretches out too easily. The weave is very lightweight, this feels like a disposable t shirt.Overall the pattern, fit and sizing of this shirt are better than the Carhartt work t shirt, BUT the materials are junk. Considering that this shirt looks so ratty after one wash, this is a very disappointing purchase. just wasted my money.
