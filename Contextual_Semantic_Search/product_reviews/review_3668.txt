I've been loyal to Levi's for about 20 years now.  I used to be able to walk into a store, grab some 32x32s, cash out and go home.  They would always fit.  This is no longer true.  The quality of this brand has been slipping for years, and now it's to the point to where I think I need to find a new brand to buy.  It is hard enough to find 32x32 jeans, and about 1 in 4 that I try on won't fit right at all.  Nearly every pair suffers from the "leg-twist," which is caused when the manufacturer cuts the bolt off-grain (this condition frequently gets worse after you wash.)  Other less frequent issues (but noticeably more common these days) would be crooked seams, crooked/misplaced tags, missing rivets, and uneven leg-lengths.  It seems that Levi's has been moving to thinner textiles, which means the jeans will wear out faster.Hopefully the quality returns.  If not, I'll be moving on.
