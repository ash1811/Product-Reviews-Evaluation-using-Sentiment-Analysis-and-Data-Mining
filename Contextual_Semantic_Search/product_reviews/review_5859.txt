Not only is this shirt super comfy and cozy, they shipped super fast.  I can't thank you enough and I will order from you again! Kudos!!!  Oh, I washed it with bleach in hot water and put it in the dryer.  No problem.  I'm a 3x but I love big shirts to bum around town in.  My friends want them so I'll be ordering more, decorating them, girling them up, and giving them as Christmas gifts.  Thanks again!
