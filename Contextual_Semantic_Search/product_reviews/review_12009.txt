I have purchased many Skechers in the past, but I must say this is the first pair I have been disappointed with.  They really hurt my feet. I am trying to break them in although I have never had to do this with Skechers before. I CANNOT wear them to work so I guess I will just wear them around the house. I suggest another kind of Skechers for people on their feet throughout the day. I do NOT like them!
