UPDATE: It's been 4 months since I wrote my review and the slippers are now almost completely de-fuzzed on the bottom of the foot bed.  The leather is starting to peel/tear away from the covered portion.  I'll be buying a new pair of slippers today and putting these in the trash.  These definitely did NOT hold up for 6 months of wear.  Granted, I wear slippers from the minute I get home from work until I go to bed, but I never walk outside with them or otherwise abuse them.  This pair isn't worth the money.I put these on my Wish List after reading all the good reviews and received them as a gift for Christmas.  When I first put them on they were fuzzy and warm and inviting.  I was thrilled.  However, less than a month later I have multiple bare spots where the fluff has completely worn away and the slippers are no longer fuzzy, warm, or inviting.  If I don't wear socks with them my bare feet stick to the soles at every step where the fluff has worn away.  They'll do for normal house wear, but I've gotten better quality slippers for far less money.
