I believe Wrangler has a better fit than Levis nowadays and an affordable price.  These pants just fit fantastically.  I owned a pair prior to these but waist expansion has made the previous pair fit funny, ;).  These seem like a well made pair of jeans and I do enjoy wearing them for their comfort.  They arrived ahead of the estimated delivery date and were well packaged.  If this waist problem persist I do hope it is a reduction vice an expansion either way I am keeping the old pair just in case they might one day fit again.  I recommend this product.
