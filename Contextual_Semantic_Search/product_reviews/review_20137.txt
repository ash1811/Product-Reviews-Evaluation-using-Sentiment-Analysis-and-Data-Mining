This is a good product if you have shoes that are worn at the heel but are otherwise still in pretty good condition. Instead of throwing them away and buying a new pair, this will save you money by rebuilding the worn heels and other areas. You can get some more mileage out of the shoe. Be sure to apply in a well ventilated area because the goo stinks, but it's okay once it dries.
