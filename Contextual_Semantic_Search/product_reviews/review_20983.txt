I have Mocha, Aubergine, & Beige. I received the new & revised version of the Dream Tisha bra, fits well and looks good. This purchase is replacing 3 of older version that I've been holding on to for dear life! I have a special round lingerie holder specifically so they aren't smushed, and warped in my underwear drawer. I recommend this bra.
