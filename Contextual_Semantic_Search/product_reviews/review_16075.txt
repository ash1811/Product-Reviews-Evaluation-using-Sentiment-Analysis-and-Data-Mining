I purchased this for my husband as an anniversary gift.  He is so pleased and can't stop looking at it.  When Iasked him for a comment to include here he said,"OOO La La!".This watch is authentic and accurately described/pictured by Amazon.  Packaging of the watch itself was meticulously done. The band, clasp, front, & back were all encased in a clear protective film.  It was easy to check the quality and try on the watch prior to removing any of the protective wrap.  I highly recommend this piece for purchase.
