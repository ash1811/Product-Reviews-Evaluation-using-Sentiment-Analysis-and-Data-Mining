I own a couple pairs if Minnetonka boots and these are by far they most comfortable. I think the zipper placement has a lot to do with it. The pair I have that zips on the side hurts my ankle. I think with the zipper in the back they have more give when you're walking. I was worried that I wouldn't like the hard sole as opposed to the nub sole, but it's really made from quite flexible material. I love these boots. I wish they made the double fringe with a back zipper!!They do start out rather narrow, but they break in really nicely. I don't usually wear shoes around the house but these are so comfy I forget to stop and take them off!!
