I've owned a bunch of Merrells, mostly of the &#34;moc&#34; variety.  Nothing negative on this particular model, though I can't yet comment on durability.  However, past Merrells have held up nicely; the outsoles always wear down smooth long before the uppers are ready to pack it in.  The one thing I notice with this model is that the sizing seems to run a tad larger than my other Merrell mocs -- I ordered the same size I always have, but this pair fit a smidge looser than I expected.  Without a comparison, I can't say if a 1/2 size smaller would fit better.
