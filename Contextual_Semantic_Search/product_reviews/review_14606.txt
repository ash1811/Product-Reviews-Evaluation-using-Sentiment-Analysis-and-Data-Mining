I've hear so much about Smartwool socks and I was excited to get these. These socks look great - exactly as pictured. Unfortunately, they are tight around my leg (leave marks) if I pull them up all of the way and I do not have especially large legs (slim but muscular). I also didn't feel that they kept my feet any warmer than some high quality cotton socks that I usually wear. I won't be purchasing anymore given their price point.
