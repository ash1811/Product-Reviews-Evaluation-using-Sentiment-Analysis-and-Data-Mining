I've totally embraced the cross body bag style and I was looking for a brown bag for Fall after enjoying my Keen Brooklyn II Hemp bag all summer and loving all the organization that that one offered. This is almost identical in style so it was easy to transition all of my items into this secure bag and still have them relatively in the same spots. As a bonus - this bag is lighter! It even appears to be water resistant, although I don't plan to test that theory. It holds my wallet, make up bag, small umbrella, two pairs of glasses, ear buds, cell phone, Kindle, and various little items in the interior small zip sections like keys, gum, kleenex, etc.  I even squeezed a lunch bag on top and was still able to zip it shut thanks to the adjustable flap snap.  This will be a great bag for travel as well but for day to day commuting into the city with slots for everything and everything secured with zippers, it's great. And although it lists for $78 on numerous websites, I found it on Amazon for $55. Sweet! Thanks, Amazon! Oh and the monkey is cute too.
