Really Nice looking Slacks. I normally wear 40-42" waist. XL's Did it for me. comfortable wear. the only thing that i'm afraid of is that they could rip appart, i hope not. Biiig Pockets, awesome. Not too long but they do have the little strings on the boot so you can strap 'em up and hold them up i guess.
