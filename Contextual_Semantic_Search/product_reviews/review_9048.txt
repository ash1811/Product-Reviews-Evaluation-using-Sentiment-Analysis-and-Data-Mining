I have worn 40x30 Dockers for years. When these arrived, I found them to be too big with no expansion of the waist elastic. I ordered the next size down (38x30). When these arrived, they fit fine, requiring some expansion of the waist band  -- I returned the larger pair. I can't say this will be the same scenario for everyone, but you might want to order one size smaller if is a 'comfort waist&#34;.
