These are not worth a dollar...they are horrible quality and do not stay up on your thighs.  I am a normal size 10 and they fell down to my ankles.  Normally I would complain they were to tight as most stockings are but these were just blah.  In my opinion go for something with a little bit higher quality.  wasted my money
