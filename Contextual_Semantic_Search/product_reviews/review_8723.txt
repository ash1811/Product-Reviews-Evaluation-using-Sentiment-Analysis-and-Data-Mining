I bought the Seiko Black Monster several months ago at a great price, delivery was slow even though I paid extra.The watch arrived well packaged, in new condition and works as it should.It is a beauty, well made, and now one of my favorite watches.  It goes good for going out dressed up or casual wear.BTW, Mine came on the reknowned SS metal bracelet, well made and comfortable.I would buy it again.
