These are a pretty rugged pair of pants. I've worn them 5-6 times and washed them multiple times to loosen them up but the stay somewhat stiff. Now, that could be good or bad depending on what you use them for. I feel these will last a long time in construction, outdoor work or sports but maybe they aren't the best (comfortable) pants for long periods at a desk or being stationary. I could see myself loosing it off a bike or board on some cement and they would take the damage.
