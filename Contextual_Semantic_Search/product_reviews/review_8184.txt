$185! (after Christmas price) I paid $210 JUST BEFORE Christmas. As they say..."That's Just Wrong"However...this review is supposed to be about the watch, so here goes.First off, I have had several SKX007 models (as well as an 779 & 781) & finally went for the SKX173. So far the 173 has been the most accurate right out of the box. I've had 007's gain as much as 45 seconds overnight, (older A movement) this 173 (B movement) so far has gained only about 4-5 seconds overnight. During the day it stays spot on!So...I'm VERY happy with the watch. Amazon's packaging sucks, but the watch did arrived undamaged.The price drop after purchase well... I'll get over it.BTW:Production date on this watch is JULY of 2010. First two digits of the S/N being "07" which is the year and month of production.O.K., I've had the watch about a month now & it's "broken in" Don't let people tell you Seiko watches don't need a break in period, they do. I've seen it with all the Seikos I've owned.The the point...For the last 2 weeks in the morning, I've checked my watch against an Atomic G-Shock that I have & it is typically 3 seconds fast. At night when I go to sleep, it's 3 seconds slow. I place it on my night stand crown up & in the Morning 3 seconds fast.Whooo Hooo! That's outstanding for a Seiko, so I've up my rating to 5 Stars!(even tho Amazons packing sucks)If it gets a little too slow, I'll take the watch off earlier in the evening thus letting it sit longer & then it gets faster. If it gets a little too fast, I'll take the watch off later in the evening.Needless to say I'm VERY happy with my SKX173!Remember YMMVUPDATE:It's 2 years later now and my Seiko is constantly running slow no matter what. I guess I should find a watchmaker that can adjust it, but for now it sits collecting dust.
