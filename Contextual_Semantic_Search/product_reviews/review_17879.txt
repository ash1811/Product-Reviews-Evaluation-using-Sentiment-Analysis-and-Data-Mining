Whether worn with work/hiking boots or running/walking shoes these Wigwam 60% wool 40% nylon socks are quite soft and very comfortable. They are not nearly as heavy as some other woolen socks I have owned in the past, but I do like them a lot. There is no &#8220;binding&#8221; up top, a few inches above the ankle, as is the case with many socks these days, which can irritate your legs. The cushioning that is provided, especially if you are on your feet all day, is well worth the modest investment as, after all, it is your health (and comfort). If you have never worn any type of wool socks before, it may take wearing them once or twice to get used to them as there is a difference between these and all-cotton, cotton-blend and synthetic socks.
