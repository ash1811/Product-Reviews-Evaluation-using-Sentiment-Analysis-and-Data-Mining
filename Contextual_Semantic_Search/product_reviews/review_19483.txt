I have really mad feet - a bit wide, a bit old and with issues (bursitis [or neuroma]) and corns in strange places.  These have a roomy toebox and reasonably comfortable footbed.  You don't feel as though you are on 2-inch heels owing to the 1-inch platform sole, so the lift is gentle.  I chose these for the natural colour - I wanted the nearest thing to nude leather, ie vegetable-dyed leather, but no zip and wth a slouch shaft.  I am happy with these, although were i to voice a complaint it's that they are heavy, and I feel as though i am walking in a dream, ie somewhat ploddingly, but they look really great!*NB: for those who watched TV in the seventies, this is the style that Hutch wore in Starsky & Hutch.
