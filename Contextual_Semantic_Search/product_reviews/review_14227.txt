The shoe has great eye appeal.  The colors are great and stitching looks very uniform.  I rated this a four star because the tongue on left shoe is about a quarter inch shorter than the right shoe.  It still protects the foot but can be seen upon close examination.  It is a sign that these shoes might have some manufacturing quality issues.
