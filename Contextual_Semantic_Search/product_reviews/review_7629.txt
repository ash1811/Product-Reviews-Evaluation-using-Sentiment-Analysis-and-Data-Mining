i bought these hanes thermal pants as well as the matching thermal shirt. I must say they are nice easy to put on and take off. they are kinda thin but they do keep you warm. My husband wears his outside under his clothes all the time and it gets cold down here in the south (arkansas). it has been down to 12 degrees and my husband will put on his thermal pants and shirt and his long sleeve shirt and jeans with a jacket and he is warm when we go outside to walk around. i am always freezing. these pants are so comfy and fit under any jeans you can't even tell that you are wearing them. these are a must if you live any were it gets cold. i would also remend that you buy the matching shirt.
