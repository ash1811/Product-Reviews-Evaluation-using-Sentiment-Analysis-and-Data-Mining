I just got these today for my birthday and wow are they cozy! I was super shocked to get them for a gift!! I have always wanted some uggs but I didn't have the money. After reading about them, I plan on purchasing some waterproofing spray to protect them. They look so cute tucked into jeans or over them :) I can tell that these are going to be my favorite boots for a very very long time!
