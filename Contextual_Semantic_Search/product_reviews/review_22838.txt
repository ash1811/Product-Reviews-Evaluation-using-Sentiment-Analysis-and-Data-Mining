I had hoped these would be good for walking around campus during summer semester but the narrow cross strap keeps slipping under my short pinky toes. This makes it really uncomfortable and I have to keep stopping and repositioning the strap. Nice colors, not very cushy sole because it's so thin and overall very sorry I bought them without trying first.
