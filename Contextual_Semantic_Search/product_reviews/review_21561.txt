On the first day, after wearing her tights for an hour, my grand daughter dropped a pen on her lap and snagged her brand new tights.  While it seems impossible, she got a hole in it the first day.  I would have hoped that it would have lasted a little bit longer before ripping.  Anyway, for little active girls, it must be much better made than these were.
