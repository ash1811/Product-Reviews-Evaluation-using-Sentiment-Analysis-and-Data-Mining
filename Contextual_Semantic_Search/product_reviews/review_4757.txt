Hey, it's Carhartt, so it's quality. Duh.  My moan is just that the color, it didn't quite reflect what I saw online. It appears much more orange online, which i liked, however it was more like it's description says.... BURNT SIENNA.  Guess it deserves a 5th star cuz it's my bad, but, 4 it stays. I would get another because it is a great shirt in general.
