These are sized wrong. I remember trying a size medium and ended up giving them away as they were way too big (That was an exchange for size large). So I decided to try again with a size small. I couldn't even get them on. Plus the waist in these are very high (almost up to your chest, definitely completely over the stomach). I'm on the thin side and can't wear that style.
