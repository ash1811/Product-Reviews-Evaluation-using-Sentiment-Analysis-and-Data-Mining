My husband wears a size 14, and local stores only seem to have UGLY showes in his size.  If they are not ugly, the price tag is way too high for shoes that he is going to wear out in a matter of 6 weeks.  So we decided to try these.  There is not as much cushon under his feet as he is used to, but he is not complaining.
