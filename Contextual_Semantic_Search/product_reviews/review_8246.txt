I have owned/still own several Invicta timepieces. I really had no complaints until I bought this one. It was dead right out of the box. I made several attempts at reviving it by rotating it, stuck it in my watch winder for a few minutes, nothing, it would never start. Well anyway, I returned it and bought the Invicta 9937OB Pro Diver Swiss Automatic and believe me, that was one of the best watch purchase I have ever made from Invicta to date. It almost compares to the model 9226 Swiss Sapphire Elite Chronograph (unavailable today) I purchased 5 years ago. The 9226 was one of their Swiss made pieces, with quarts movement and Sapphire crystal, still looks and runs as good as the day I bought it. I own several Movado and two Tissot's as well, but seem to always wear one of the Invictas the majority of the time. I was very disappointed when I opened the box and saw it wasn't working. I have always liked the quality you get for your dollar from Invicta, and I will most likely buy another of their great timepieces in the future. You cannot beat the quality for the money you spend. I wont knock them too much for this one off experience, but it rates a three star rating. Good looking piece and very well made but, dead is dead. If you dont mind paying a few dollars more buy the 9937OB, you wont regret it. Its well worth the extra cash.
