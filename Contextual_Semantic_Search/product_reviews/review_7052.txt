I've been buying Gold Toe socks for my husband for at least seven or eight years.  Although we've tried picking up other brands, the Gold Toe are his favorite.  The cotton is pretty soft, they stay up around the ankles, they last at least eighteen months, and they don't develop holes too quickly.  This most recent pack feels a bit thinner than packs we've bought in the past, but I imagine that they'll still hold up fairly well and won't need replacing for quite some time.
