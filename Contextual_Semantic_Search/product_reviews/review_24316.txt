My son loves this costume, and still wears it all these months later. It is very realistic looking and they have taken great play out of it! I was not impressed with this seller, though, but other than that, were happy with the purchase. Do NOT get the boots that are advertised as going with this (sold separately) as they are TERRIBLE! They don't fit properly, are nearly impossible to get over shoes, and look ridiculously big on...
