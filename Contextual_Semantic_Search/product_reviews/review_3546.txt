I'm pale skinned with pink undertones. I ordered "barely there", (the title next to a light shade of hosiery) and if by "barely there" they mean "VERY OBVIOUSLY there", then they've really nailed it with their subtley sarcastic description.These hose were brown, like a dark taupe. The photo clearly shows a lighter shade. So, anyway, the point of this review is, if your skin tone is like mine, don't make the same mistake I did by assuming the shades shown represented how these hose *actually* look in real life.
