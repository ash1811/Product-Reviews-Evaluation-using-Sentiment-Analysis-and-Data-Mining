After 21 years in the military, I missed all of those pockets that my uniform pants (BDU's) had. I wanted to find something that looked presentable for casual wear, but still had the durability and storage of the BDU's. These fit the bill perfectly. I now have both the pants and shorts versions in &#34;Loden&#34;(Forest Green) and in &#34;Black&#34;. I'm seriously considering buying both versions in the &#34;Bark&#34; (Khaki) color as well.
