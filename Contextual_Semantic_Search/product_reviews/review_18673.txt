This is a great fully functional casual watch.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about is the band which is fabric.  Not that it's not cute but rather it will probably get dirty looking although it hasn't so far.  This watch is durable & has been in the kiddy pool a few time and works like a champ.  It is a perfect watch for a younger girl.  It is on the petite side.  I actually gave the watch to Grandma (75) who lost hers and she has been wearing everyday to work in a construction environment. Does everything you need a watch to do!!
