OK, I'll admit that I thought I was ordering the 937 stretch jeans, but I mistakenly got 936s. They are stiff as a board! We laughed when he tried them on because he could just stand them upright and step down into them. Also, my husband's other jeans are all a 34 waist, but when he tried these on he could barely get them fastened. (And no, he hasn't gained weight!). I thought perhaps they were sized wrong so got out the yard stick to check. Yes, they are a 34 waist, but they fit really tight. I am returning them today and will be more careful about getting the 937str instead.
