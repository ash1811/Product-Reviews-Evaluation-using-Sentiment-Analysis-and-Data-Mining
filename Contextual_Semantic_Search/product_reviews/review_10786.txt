I purchased both this flip-flop and the Reef Men's Slap II Thong Sandal in black for my husband before heading to the beach.  He immediately fell in love with the Slap II flip-flops as they were comfortable from the minute he put them on.  I had read the reviews on this shoe and was able to tell him that many of the reviewers said it would be tight at first.  This was true.  After a few weeks, the Fanning is comfortable to him, just not as comfortable as the Slap II.  He's also not a big fan of the bottle opener in the bottom the shoe (wondering about metal detectors), but I'm sure that's a draw for others.
