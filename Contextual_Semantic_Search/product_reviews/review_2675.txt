My husband absolutely loves this watch.  It has just what he wanted - time that can easily be read at a glance; day of the week and date of the month; and a comfortable fit.  Less than a year ago I had bought him a more expensive watch which was very attractive, but difficult to read and he constantly complained about it.  We both are very happy with this purchase and worth triple the price.
