These are some very kool jeans. I usally buy Wrangler regular fit or Levi's 505 jeans. But while searching Amazon I came across these Lees Carpenter Jeans and thought what the hell, try something different. So along with a pair of Dickies Overalls I ordered these because I am tired of wearing the same jeans day in and day out. I was hoping they would not be too loose because I am on the thin side. When they arrived and I tried them on I sure was glad to see they were not really loose at all and they actually fit me. It's nice wearing something different for a change and I like all of the pocket locations. Especially the shallow watch pocket where you can put something into and get to it easily rather than be fishing down deep for it. I like the back pockets too that aren't down too low, and your wallet is next to your butt and not halfway down your leg. I have washed and dried these twice with no shrinkage so just order your normal size and you should be fine as far as the fit. What I really like about shopping for jeans on Amazon is the incredible selection of not only brands and styles, but of all the various versions, like stonewashed, light stonewashed, stressed, black, white, different colors and so on. There is no store I have ever been to with that kind of selection. I am all for supporting my local retail stores but this you can't beat. That's it!
