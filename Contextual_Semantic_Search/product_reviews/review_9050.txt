Go check out my other Dockers Pants reviews -> They all pretty much say the same thing: "Leave the pleats far behind and definitely stick with the flat front".  The D1's are much nicer too being more narrow for slim builds and a younger look.  They are much more flattering and fit way nicer - you'll get by far MORE COMPLIMENTS!!  We bought a TON of these and any exchanges were taken care of immediately at no charge to us!!Beware of the color matching & sometimes they are sized correctly...I've had to make exchanges because of this.  Overall, we are very happy!! :) :)
