I have purchased other Minnetonka moccasin's in the past.  I like them very much and they usually fit well.  This particular moccasin is OK in length...lengthwise it is just as to be expected however I ordered a Narrow width (as always) and it feels more like Medium.  I like the shoe very much and I'm going to try using a gel insert before I give up on them completely!
