These are gorgeous shoes. I have never worn or even tried Minnetonka shoes but I must say I would get some more if the other styles fit like these. They feel like slippers on and no breaking in! I'm a size 6M and these fitted me perfectly. Can't comment on the longevity since I only got them recently but they look nice on and I plan to wear them with jeans and cargos.
