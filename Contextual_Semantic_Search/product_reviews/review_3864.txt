I wear a Rago 6207 high waist long leg panty girdle - every day all day - it is wonderful! It does notshow - I do not have that "girdled" look and most of all it gives me a flat tummy. I do not wear pantiesunder, stockings, and only my girdle. The 6207 has no zipper and once it is on forget it. The open crotchmakes life easy in the bathroom. At first my girdle is tight, then it is comfortable and then I just forgetthat I have it on. I am not at all self conscious and I look great - have had many compliments and no qustionsat all - women's girdles are not just for women. I have three 6207's - one on, one in wash and one in the drawer.I would not leave home without my girdle - no ride up, roll over and a flat tummy.
