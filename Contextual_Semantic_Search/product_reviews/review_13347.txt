Love Ray Bans!! the most comfortable pair of sunglasses I've ever owned! Im a female, average shaped face and I bought the 58mm size, I like the fit, they do feel just a little big, so the next pair I buy, im trying 55mm to see if they fit a little more snug. the pair I got look and feel authentic, they are made in Italy. I read one review stating they got their glasses and they were made in China?? No such thing, Ray Ban are made in Italy period!!!!  It seems that Sunglass Express states that sometimes Ray Bans come from China, I wouldnt buy from them, so beware. I purchased my pair thru Amazon directly, so they were shipped out fast and I got them within the week.
