purchased two in &#34;mocha&#34; and one in &#34;yam&#34;, all double XL, and the yam colored garment is at least two sizes smaller than the mocha colored garments (which fit perfectly) - the yam garment is also lighter weight. i noticed that the tags in the mocha garments show that they were made in thailand while the tag in the yam garment shows that it was made in china. i really dig the mocha garments, they are perfect in every way, but i would i would like to order other colors. unfortunately ordering other colors is problematic given there is clearly a difference between the garments depending on where they were made. can the seller indicate which colors were made where? this would be extremely helpful.
