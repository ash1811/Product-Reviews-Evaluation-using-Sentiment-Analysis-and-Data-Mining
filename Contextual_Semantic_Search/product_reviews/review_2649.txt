I'm a 50 something woman who loves this watch. Just bought my second. I bought a nice silver and gold 16mm band and had my watch guy change the bands and fit it to my wrist. It looks stunning and quite dressy. I can actually read my watch now. The best part is the illuminated dial. Just push the little button you set the time with and the watch lights up in the dark. They last forever. Love it.
