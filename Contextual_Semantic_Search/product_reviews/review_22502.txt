I haven't worn a watch in my adult life.  Bought this, love the look of it, and it's holding up really well; has one scraped on the metal part from where I banged it hard against something, but yeah, fits well, works perfectly, never needs to be charged or batteries replaced, and looks really good.  Would definitely recommend to friends, and do!
