I pretty much wear one brand of jeans and style of jeans 527s, but I keep thinking they don't last as long as they use to; looking at 3 generations of 527s I have found that they are much lighter denim now than they were a couple years ago for the same price.  They are still comfortable and a great fit but they really aren't as heavy, so they wear out much more quickly.
