First off I'd like to say that I LOVE Ray-Ban Wayfarers.  I bought my first pair in the early 80's and was hooked.  But that was back when Ray-Ban was owned by Bausch and Lomb and therefore the lenses were produced by Bausch and Lomb, a company who is synonymous with eye health.  Hence, the quality of the lenses was top notch and crystal clear.  In 1999 Bausch and Lomb sold Ray-Ban to an Italian company and since then the lens quality is just not the same by a long stretch.  I now own both Ray-Bans and Serengetis and the lens quality of the Serengetis are far superior.  Trust me when I say it pains me to say this about my beloved Ray-Bans, but I find myself grabbing my Serengetis more and more often for the clarity of the lenses.
