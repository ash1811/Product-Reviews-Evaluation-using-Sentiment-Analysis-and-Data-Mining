These shoes are cool. They look cool, feel cool , and any one who wheres them is cool just by association . I normally where an 11.5 athletic shoes , and for that matter in all shoes, so I ordered an 11.5 and guess what ? They fit. They have a little bit of heft to them , but that is in part due to the gum rubber soles which hold tight in anything I have walked on. It took a couple days to where them in but it was worth the wait for one of the most comfortable shoes in the universe . So, in summation , they are cool.
