Otherwise I love &#34;my Princesses&#34; which with bad knees I wear as much as I can everywhere and any where as IN BLACK they look like &#34;regular shoes.&#34; I have worn them day in and day out for over 10 years if not more. I would, however, next time buy them from a store. The 9 size I got is OK, they do stretch but I do need a 9M.
