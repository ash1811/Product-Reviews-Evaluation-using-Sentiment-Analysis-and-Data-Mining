He loves this belt.  We actually bought a second one for back-up because he wears it daily except for non-casual business meetings.Arrival was prompt and the belts themselves are very attractive and comfy, plus they are thin enough in height that they fit the belt loops of every one of his pairs of jeans and slacks which is something that can not be claimed for all belts.
