I bought several of these in white for an art project. They are thick t-shirts and a bit on the stiff side. They look exactly as pictured. They didn't seem to shrink too much after washing in warm water and drying in the dryer. My daughter wears 5T, and the 5/6T is still a little big on her. They take fabric paint well and seem to be well made.  If you're looking for a thick t-shirt, then these are a good option.
