At first I was very displeased with these Reef Sandals....they seemed too tight and wraps wore painfully on the top of my feet. I thought to myself how is this possible, all the flip-flops I have ever had were too lose, now this!!! But I gave them a few days and things changed. As my feet began to mold to the sole of the Sandal they became more and more comfortable. Now I can wear them all day with comfort. Not only that but they hold snug and don't feel like they are always about to fall off. I highly recommend them...after you break them in:)
