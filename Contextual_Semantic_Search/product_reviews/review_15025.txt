They are good shorts but if over 5'5&#34; they aren't for you. personally I like my shorts longer but if your around 5'-5'5&#34; they are mid thigh. I have trouble finding shorts that fit and these fit I'm 36 inch waist. uneven legs but mostly legs less torso so I have good length inseam. these size medium fit me other then length but that's more of personal preferences thing.
