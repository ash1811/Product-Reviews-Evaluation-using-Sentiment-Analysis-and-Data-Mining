The fly is a bit difficult to access, but overall I like these. I think I like the given-n -go boxer brief a bit better as it has a nicer fit, better look. My wife likes both boxer / boxer brief as well, slightly preferring the cut of the boxer brief.I gave these a 5 over the regular boxers which I gave a 4.
