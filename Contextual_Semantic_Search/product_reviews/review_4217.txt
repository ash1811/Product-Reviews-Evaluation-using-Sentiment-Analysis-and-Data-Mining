Very supportive.  Sports bra like in the ++ version but does have a piece of material inside to keep the ladies separated.  Clips are easy to operate but straps tend to migrate off my shoulders while nursing or pumping.  not a big deal though.  Not my fave nursing bra but a good one, would buy again.
