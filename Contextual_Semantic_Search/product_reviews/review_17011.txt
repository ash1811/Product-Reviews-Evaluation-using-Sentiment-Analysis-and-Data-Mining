For a long time I had to adjust watch bands by either bringing them into the store, or using the old hammer and punch kit.  Sometimes my punch would have to be a very small hobby screwdriver.  That method is difficult and leaves scratches on the watch.  I actually used that method on an $1800 watch.  Purchased this when I ordered my new Bulova Watch.  This thing works like a champ.  I actually went back and made some adjustments on some of my other watches, because it is so simple to use.  Excellent design, without the need for instructions.  Comes with a few extra pins, in case you are not careful and bend it.  So easy, my girlfriend could probably operate it.  Ok......that might be a bit optimistic.
