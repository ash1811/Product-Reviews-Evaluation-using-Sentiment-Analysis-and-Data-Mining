These are very nice, substantial, yet light-weight earrings. It's great "notice me" size, but not over-done. I wear them frequently.However, the current price is appalling. I purchased them in 2007 for under 50 clams! Insanely low-priced then, but insanely high-priced now. No way would I pay the asking price for these, much less the list. URGH! These earring previously listed for just over one hundred, and I got them on a one day deal for just over 40.These are nice earrings, but don't over-pay for these! They should be going in the 100-150 range. Wait for a deal when there is additional money off. Increased gold prices or not. These are not worth 250. Trust me.
