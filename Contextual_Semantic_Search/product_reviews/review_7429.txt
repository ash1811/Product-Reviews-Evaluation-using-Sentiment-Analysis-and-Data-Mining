This is the one jacket that is always with me. Doesn't readily show dirt. After five years of constant fall, winter and spring use I am replacing it with another, identical, jacket as the zipper-pull fell off. Not too bad of a run, the jacket is still in great shape . . . except for the zipper-pull. I wonder if Carhartt warranties the zipper-pull?(January 19, 2012 update) Went to Carhartt's customer service site, told them that my years old jacket zipper-pull broke and they are sending me a repair kit free of charge. Impressed . . . yes, I am. Quality.
