My husband, for Christmas, asked for a &#34;Dressier Sweatshirt&#34;.  He wears plain old sweatshirts around the house in the winter.  They're comfy and warm.  But if we're going to visit the grandkids and he's going to be outside, a &#34;dressier&#34; sweatshirt looks better.  So, of course, I didn't hesitate to order this navy Carhartt Crew Neck Sweatshirt.He liked it and has already worn it.  After washing, it looks good as new.
