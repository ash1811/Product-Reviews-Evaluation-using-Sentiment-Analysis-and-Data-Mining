I understand most minimizer bras give you somewhat of a classic missile t*t look, but this was just weird. Very snug around the waist, the cup towards the torso was Ok, but there was a very weird &#34;reservoir tip&#34; at the nipple.So sad because I love the color and micro leopard print! It has to go back.
