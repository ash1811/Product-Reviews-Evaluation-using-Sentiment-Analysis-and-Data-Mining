A good pant, good fit and excellent color. I am 34 and waist fit well. I only can say than pants look something different to the pic they show here. Maybe if you use boots all time you feel good but if you use sport shoes pants will look a llitle width than pic.. But nothing bad at all. Finally, I recommend this product.
