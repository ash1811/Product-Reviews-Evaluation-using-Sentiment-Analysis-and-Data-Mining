This little piece of metal will allow you to change watch bands. Some people have complained that there aren't any instructions with it. I'd have to say that means you probably shouldn't be messing about with your watch band and go to a jewler. If you want to see how one is used either take your watch into a jewler and they'll generally be glad to let you watch or hang about leaning on the counter and watch them do it. Of course, they may think you are planning to knock the place off.Anyway, if you have a number of watches and want to change bands, or just want to help your friends and family out by "working" on their wristwatches then this is a must have tool.
