I purchased these slippers for my husband who has had problems in the past with ordering wider sized slippers only to find they were a bit narrow. These moccasin slippers are very nice.  They seem true to size.  The slippers have a good semi-soft sole and though it probably wouldn't be a good idea to wear them out as shoes, they could definitely be worn outside the house.  They are well lined and they seem sturdy.  I am very satisfied with this product.
