Love these, bought them in this color and black. Only problem is that I'm fair-skinned and this light toast color is like Malibu tan, which might work in the summer. They hide any spider veins or light/small discolorations well. The shimmer is nice, kind of understated. See my review about the ultra shimmery footed tight in black for issues regarding feet slipping in shoes after these are put on, because it's important to know.I will order these in the lighter skin tone, as they might be a better match for me to wear year round.
