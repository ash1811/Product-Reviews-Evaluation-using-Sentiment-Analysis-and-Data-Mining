Much, much better than any jean I bought at CK (either too tight ot too loose) online and outlet stores or Costco (tried many brands, all are baggy).My size is 35x32, but many brands differ not just in style but in length too (do they use Metric to measure and then convert? It's a joke: sometimes the length differs by almost 2 inches!). These 36x32 fit very nicely. You feel that they have a stretching component in the fabric, especially when fastening the button. The leg and knee have become a bit looser after a long day of sitting on a plane, but I assume they fill shrink once I wash them.The color &#34;Cash&#34; is nice and quite washed on the front. I like darker-colored jeans, but not too dark. This one is just a bit on the lighter side, but it is still very nice toned down &#34;blue&#34;.It is very hard to read a very small font on the tags. 98% Cotton, 2% Elastane. Looks like they were made in Indonesia.
