The girlfriend here. I was excited to try this bra but it just wasn't for me. I did end up returning it. It was accurately sized and felt very comfortable but it seemed to push down and not lift and I prefer a little lift! Otherwise it would be a very comfortable bra. I don't care for the extra thin cups either, I like a very slight thickness, not padded but not nylon thin either. These cups are nylon thin.
