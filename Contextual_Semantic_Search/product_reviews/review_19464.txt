I first purchased the World's Softest Socks from a catalog. That was many, many years ago. After the first pairs, we had to order more! Every few years we replenish our stash. They seem to last forever! Now that we can find them in an array or colors, our collections have grown. We even use them as gifts, tossing in a pair or two to match a sweater or shirt. We've now got all our friends buying them! Once you try these ultra comfortable and soft socks, everything else is second best. On a cold night, I'll even wear them to bed -- they don't bind at the ankle at all.Sometimes these will turn up at the outlet malls, and it's worth a little hunting around to find them and appreciate the softness and quality before you buy.
