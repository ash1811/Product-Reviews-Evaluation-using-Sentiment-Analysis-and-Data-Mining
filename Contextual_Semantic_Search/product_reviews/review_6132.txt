A light weight but tough utility pair of pants.  Alpine Tundra is more or less a light olive color.  The 38W fits loose, but if it shrinks, who knows.  Length is true.  Fit is overall loose.  Not dressy at all. No structure.  No lining.  No crease.  Handy zippered pocket for your wallet or passport.  I suggest remove the pull and hide the zipper.
