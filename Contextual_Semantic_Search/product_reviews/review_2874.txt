This polishing cloth is better than the one I purchased before it.  The chemically-treated interior cloth takes all the tarnish off quickly, and the outer layer polishes to a shine.  It was shipped on time.  The only negative I have is that it is over-priced.  After I purchased it, I found it for several dollars less in a big-box store.  Next time, I'll buy it there.
