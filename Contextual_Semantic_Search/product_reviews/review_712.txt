I have been on the prowl for thigh highs that do not have the very uncomfortable synthetic material to hold them into place. I thought these were it, but I was wrong - I failed to read the "Elastic leg bands for stay-put support" part, but I did not give them 4 stars due to my human error. They received 4 stars because the "fantasy black" was hella black, barely sheer. Maybe the "off black" would have provided the sheerness I was looking for.I thought about keeping them any way, but I finally found what I believe to be a pair of Berkshire thigh highs with lace and without thigh choking rubber involved so I'm sending these Sheer Thigh Highs back. If these are the kind of thigh highs you are in the market for, I suggest ordering a size up because my thighs are small - I'm 5'4", 120 lbs - and the C-D still dug in enough to create that unsightly bulge at the top. I believe if they were one size larger, they would still stay in place and be flattering and somewhat comfortable at the same time.
