I have two of these watches and wear them everyday. The first I bought about twelve years ago just before I went to basic training. The second I got about five years after the first when I lost it (though it was later found, recovered and still in service). The first watch was abused in a manner than no watch should be, it had been worn every day for years, been diving, jumped from planes with me, been to every bar in South America and then some. It was exposed to chemicals and hydraulic fluid on a daily basis and never had an issue. The tritium in bright and the watch keeps amazingly accurate time. As another reviewer mentioned the numbers and the bezel itself can wear down to the point the numbers can't be seen. That said it only happened on my first watch, the second still has good readable numbers on the bezel. I don't know if that is because the first one was exposed to so many chemicals. I've abused both pretty well when it comes to outdoor activity. Even now over ten years on the tritium is still bright and the watches still keep on ticking. I am more than happy with my purchases and would be just as happy to buy another Luminox tomorrow if these both died on me.
