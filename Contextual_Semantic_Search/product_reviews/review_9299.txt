I like these slippers because they fit well and wash well and the bows never shred or stop being cute little bows.  There is a rubber bottom so they don't wear on the bottom. I wear mine all day cause I am ill so I need to have a good slipper like someone else would need a good pair of everyday shoes.  I prefer the terry because they aren't as tight as the nylon ones and my foot can breathe through the terry.
