I love Baggallini.  It stays looking good forever.  I have a small tan bag that I use for shopping and it still looks good after about four years.  I love the light blue interior of this bag as it makes it easier to find items.  The only thing is that I wish it had more inside pockets with zippers or velcro closures.  I have only used the bag once but plan to use it for arts and crafts shows and travel.  It is as advertised so I wasn't disappointed.
