I love the wide straps and they stay up! I bought this because I was fed up with having the wires in my bra poke me in the arm pit. I'm heavy and no longer young so comfort is important to me. I think this is one of the most comfortable bras I've ever worn. It does nothing about improving my looks or the fit of my clothes as a Bali Flower Bra with underwire does, but it doesn't poke me. To me that was very important.
