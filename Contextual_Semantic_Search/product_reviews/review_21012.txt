I was very disappointed as I absolutely adored my old dearfoams-wore them literally until they fell apart (about 4yrs), these are ok but dont match up at all, they got cheaper over the yrs-not BETTER. They're no where near as comfy as my 1st pair. Not sure I'll buy dearfoams again unless they go back to whatever they were doing before.
