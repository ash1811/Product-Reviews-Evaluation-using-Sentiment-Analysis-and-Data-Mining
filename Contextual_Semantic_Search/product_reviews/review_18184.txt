Warm and comfortable to wear around the house with a flexable rubber sole for outdoor wear. Bought my Daughter a pair as an early Christmas present.. She put them on as soon as she got them and loves them too!!ADDING TO REVIEW-1/20/12 the fur inside on heel and instep is coming off and just the skin is showing --SURPRISED they are wearing out so fast-should ask for a NEW pair to be sent to me
