I was a little stressed buying online with all the complaints about being small . Remember we are all older and our  feet spread out from weight on them over time . I used to wear a 12 b when young then a 12 d and now find I require a 12.5 d or feel squeezed in all brands it isn't just one shoe . I bought some new balances and got 12's and they really need a shoe stretcher and I suffer breaking them in  . It is just natural as we age our feet grow a tad from compression over time just like we remember the past and want things to be the same as they were when we were young .Sadly we get surprised as they are not .  Quality of this shoe was the same as always these are great shoes . Very classic style . White was the best price in my size so I purchased a pair not sure how I would like them  but I love the colors ...something I do not remember in the past . I used to love to drive in these  when I  drove for a living .I am pleased and will be watching for a price break on the grey for winter when white is out of season .
