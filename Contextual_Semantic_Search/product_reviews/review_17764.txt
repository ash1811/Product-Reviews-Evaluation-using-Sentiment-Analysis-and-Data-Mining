This dressy style men's watch is perfect in every way except for fit. My boyfriend needs a wrist watch that is 8.5&#34; length in the band, and this one didn't meet the requirement. He loved the look and all the features though. Returning it was a breeze. I'll look for another Casio product to replace this one, and would recommend this watch to anyone who doesn't have such a wide wrist.
