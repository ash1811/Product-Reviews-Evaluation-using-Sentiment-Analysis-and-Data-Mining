This shawl is very pretty and soft. Although it doesn't have care instruction, I would assume since it has silk in it that you should be very careful cleaning it. The design I received matched the picture on Amazon. It looks elegant and is perfect for warm weather. It is not a heavy thick shawl but would be great for summer or nighttime wear. I will definitely buy more of these!
