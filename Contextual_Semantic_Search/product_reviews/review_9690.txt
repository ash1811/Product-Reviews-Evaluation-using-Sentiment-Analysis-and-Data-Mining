look, you know you're not getting some fancy shmancy, super expensive lingerie here, let's be honest.  but you also aren't getting badly constructed junk, either!  i love this .....thing.  Not even sure what to call it, but for things and giggles, I refer to it (in my head) as my gothic / victorian &#34;house coat&#34;.  Because house coat sounds sooooooo...icky, but this is anything but!  it's very light, it's I dunno, rayon or something?  I haven't tested it's propensity to burst into flames, so I can't speak to that, but I've worn it, and I didn't break out into hives or rash or anything.  I love the fitted bodice, and the sweeping skirt.  Mama likey.
