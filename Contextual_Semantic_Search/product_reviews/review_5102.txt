I got this jacket in Lavender, size 3X.  I very much appreciate that the price for the X sizes was the same as for the smaller sizes, that is often not the case.I carry this tightly rolled up in my backpack, just for those times that it is unexpectedly chilly or windy.  It's a great extra layer for warmth, does a great job of cutting the wind and has handy pockets both inside and outside.  I highly recommend this jacket.
