Indeed, this is one of the best Seiko Divers out there for the money, and is a must have if you are a diver and/or collector. This watch means busines and it's available in Black and Orange. The watch is heavy, 180-grams, and has a Seiko's in-house movement, the reliable and robust 7S26, a 21-jewel. The luminous on this watch is best among watches, except battery ones. The bracelet has an extension for those who wear scuba diving suits, and a clasp for security. This watch is easy to put and take off thanx The push button clasp. Is the nicest I've seen on any watch in this price class. Overall, I'm absolutely delighted to have the Seiko SKX781K as part of my collection. It's a really fun watch to own. For the money, I think this is probably one of the best watches you can buy if you actually intend to dive with it. Even if the watch never sees anything deeper than kitchen sink, it is an excellent watch, but probably won't appeal to everyone, and certainly isn't an every day watch. The quality on detail is superb. Heck, when I first saw it, I thought it was ugly as a heavy rock. But the watch really grows on you - once the Black and/or Orange Monster has you in its clutches, it doesn't let go. MTNG
