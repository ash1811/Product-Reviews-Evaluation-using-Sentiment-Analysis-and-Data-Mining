There are times that I have extra stuff: Kindle, camera, notebook, phone, keys, that I want to carry, but it is not really enough for a bookbag.On the other hand, I really don't want to be carrying what could in any world conceivably, possibly be a purse.This works great. It is clearly not a purse, it has a fair amount of room, and is well made. The price, of course, is also great. It could use a wider, better strap and the &#34;ears&#34; that are supposed to go under the main flap don't always fold down automatically.The ad said &#34;many compartments,&#34; which I really didn't want, so that works out: It has a main compartment divided into 2 parts, a front pocket (still under the flap) that is the right size for a wallet, with a couple of pockets for something the size of a pen knife and slots for some pencils. It is a lot less complex than some I have seen.Things are also easier to find than in a black backpack--everything seems to be black these days. The material is heavy and seems well sewn, so it should last for a long time.
