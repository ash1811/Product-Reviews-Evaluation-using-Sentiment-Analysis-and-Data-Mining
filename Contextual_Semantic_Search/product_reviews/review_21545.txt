I'm giving it 4 stars b/c it isn't exactly what was promised. The description should be edited to say it no longer has a pocket for a water bottle. Other reviewers mentioned this but I bought it anyway, so I wasn't expecting the pocket. However, it is a feature that would have made this bag even better than it already is so I hope the manufacturers go back to the old specs. The Only Bag is lightweight, has lots of pockets w/zippers & plenty of space for everything I took on a recent trip EXCEPT the side pocket for my water bottle. I would have liked & used it.I have several Baggallinis in tomato and I love the color; it's bright but not unattractively so & it serves a purpose: occasionally, I'm asked to gate-check my Baggalini carry-on; my tomato Bagg stands out from all the other bags so I can quickly locate it and be on my way. On my recent trip, I used the Only as my purse and b/c it has a sleeve on the back, I could tote it attached to my carry-on Bagg.  It made going through Customs very easy.If the water bottle isn't a big issue for you, I'd highly recommend buying it. If it is, make sure it's not an empty promise before you sit the Buy button.
