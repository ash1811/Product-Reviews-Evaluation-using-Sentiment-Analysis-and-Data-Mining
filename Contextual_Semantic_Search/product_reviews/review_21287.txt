were not as cushy as i thought they would be, and the strap across the top just rubbed me the wrong way.  i'll stick to my Reefs i guess.  i wish they would make these yoga mat flops with nylon straps instead of the leathery synthetic kind.i guess the main reason i didn't like them was they aren't water friendly.  what's the point of owning flip flops that you can't wear to the pool or beach?
