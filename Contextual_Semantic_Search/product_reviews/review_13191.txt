I have been uncomfortable in my Bali bras mainly because of weight gain and because of the elastic around the bottom.  I stepped up the size once I followed the &#34;how to measure guide&#34; that provided on the site.  You should really go through this step to help decide the exact size.  It's very comfortable!  I love the wider straps and smooth cups and the lift it provides.
