I have 3 pairs of these and they are unbelievable savers of time, space, and weight.  Wash out in the sink at night, wring dry with a towel, and totally dry the next morning.  I have taken several multi-week trips, and could have easily gotten by with 2.  I just like having the third pair for peace of mind.
