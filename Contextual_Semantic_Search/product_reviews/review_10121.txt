By tall, I mean over 6'5&#34;.  I have searched long and hard to a hoodie that fit my 6'9&#34; son.  Turns out most manufactures consider 6'2&#34; to be tall, which meant that most tall hoodies were still too short in the sleeves and body to fit my son correctly.  However, this hoodie fit perfectly.  Nice color, construction and weight.
