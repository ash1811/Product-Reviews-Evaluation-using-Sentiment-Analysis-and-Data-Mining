They are exactly what they say & they do survive machine washing & drying well.The padding on the bottom is what I marked them down on  - it's there but barely.  I was expecting super thick padding from the description.The black part under the fuzzy part is suede so it has worn really well ( been about year & half).I just wanted super thick padding & maybe an arch support like some Acorn slippers have.
