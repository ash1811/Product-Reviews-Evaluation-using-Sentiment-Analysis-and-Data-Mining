First, let me say that I am typically warm even in cooler environments, so most blankets make me feel uncomfortably warm. I bought this for camping and general use, and seeing as it has been close to single digits since I purchased it I have only put it through pretty mild use. Even so I really like the feel, softness, and insulation of this blanket. It felt a little stiff right out of the bag but loosened up quickly. Using it keeps me at an acceptable temp, but the whole family seems to like it every bit as much as their fluffy and heavier blankets that make me feel like I'm being slow roasted to death.
