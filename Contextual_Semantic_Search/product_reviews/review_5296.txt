I purchased four of these pants, in various colors, back in 2009.  I am currently still wearing these pants on a day to day basis.  They are soft and light.  I wouldn't recommend wearing them in a snow storm, but they are great pants for working, hiking, and general outdoors activities.  Three years and still kicking, these pants are great.
