The watch has been great. Good looking. Not oversized. Anti-Shock.Water-proof is not very good. Sometimes I find there is water inside the glass.The battery died after 3 years. It doesn't justify the use of solar power if it lasts this short, since ordinary watch would have lasted almost about the same time.Need to get a new one. Probably still G-Shock but not solar-powered.
