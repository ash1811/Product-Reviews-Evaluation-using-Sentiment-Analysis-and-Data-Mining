Perhaps they run a little large in sizing but these are a quality jean. The material is very durable and they are well made. I can't imagine the stitching coming undone in any circumstances. I have worn these quite a lot now and it looks like they have quite a few good years ahead of them even if they are a little heavy for summer.
