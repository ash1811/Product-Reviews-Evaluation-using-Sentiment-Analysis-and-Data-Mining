I needed a new pair of shoes to replace the sneakers I always wear. I love these shoes, very comfortable, nice sole, good fit to my foot. I'm wearing these all the time, since I received them a week ago. After I purchased them, I read some of the reviews, all I can say, for the moment, I'm happy with them. I'll see how they wear in the future.
