Classic slipper and I've had them for eons!  However, the elastic around the back heal portion was cutting into my ankle just beneath my Achilles tendon.  After wearing them for about a week, the pain became progressive and problematic.  I repeatedly tested this throughout the year and consistently the same problem would occur.  When I would quit wearing them, this would go away.I did love the leather sole, it was very durable and the sateen fabric is also quite durable.  Just didn't work for me.BY THE WAY, my foot is a medium width, ladies size US 9.
