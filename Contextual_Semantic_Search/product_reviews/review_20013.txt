These boots are sort of retro but also back woodsy cool. They remind me of the boots I wore in school. I had four pairs in different colors and thought I was fashionable. The only drawback was my old boots weren't as warm, didn't keep my feet dry, and did not have a removeable insole.These boots are warm and cozy. They fit perfectly and are so warm that I do not need to wear extra heavy wool socks. Because they are rubberized around the soles and the shaft they keep my feet really dry. The insoles are removeable but I have never had to remove them. Under most circumstances these will work in snow unless you are caught in a blizzard and have to deal with high snow drifts. The soles are made of Vibram and offer a lot of traction and wearability.As for negatives, have yet to find anything I don't like about them.I started out with a black pair and later bought a brown pair since I am no longer a slave to fashion. These are great boots and while they are not cheap they live up to the adage that you get what you pay for. I've already used them a lot this season and am glad I had them. They are perfect for my casual lifestyle.
