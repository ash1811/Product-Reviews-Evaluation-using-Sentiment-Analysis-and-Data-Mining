I have had these shoes for a couple months now and I am VERY pleased!  I am overweight and walk a lot all day with my job.  I go through shoes usually twice a year, sometimes three times.  I always bought my shoes at Walmart.  By now these shoes would be showing signs of heavy usage and I would know that the end would be near.  However, these still look and feel like the day they came out of the box!  I am a 10.5 and these were right on the money.  It took me a couple days to break them in, but now they fit wonderfully and at the end of the day my feet don't hurt!!If there were anything to complain about is the shoe laces.  They are always coming undone for some reason.  Not sure why.  Not a huge thing for me at all.  I would buy these again  no questions asked!
