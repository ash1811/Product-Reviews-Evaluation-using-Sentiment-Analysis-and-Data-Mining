I was hoping to be able wear this more for the back support than the waist clinching, but it's digs into the area underneath my breasts and is uncomfortable for longer periods of time.  I purchased the "blush" color and it's a nice neutral beige color - I was a bit worried it would have a pinkish tint to it.
