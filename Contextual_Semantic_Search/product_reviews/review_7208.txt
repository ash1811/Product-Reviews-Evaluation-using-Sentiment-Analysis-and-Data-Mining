I am a guy and I love Ugg boots! these are the most comfortable boots you will ever own! They were made for guys long before women started wearing them &#34;FYI&#34;. I am a size 11 in every pair of shoes except these! Guys, you will definetly want to go up a size! Buy waterproofing as they are like a sponge in winter!
