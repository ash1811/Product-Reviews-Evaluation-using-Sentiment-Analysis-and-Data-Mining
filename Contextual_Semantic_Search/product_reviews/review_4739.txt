I ordered the "Brown" color (not the "Carhartt Brown" or "Dark Brown") and I wasn't sure what I'd receive because the color swatch for Brown on the product page looks more like a moss green.  The Brown I received can be described as a rust color, a shade of orange-brown.  It's nice, just wanted to share the info on what the color actually looks like.  The pants are the sturdiest I've ever owned, my wife was laughing because it kept its body shape when I took it off and placed it on the ground.
