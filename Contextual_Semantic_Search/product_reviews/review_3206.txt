I am returning this item because I like my bras to have a little more material over the breast.  I don't like push up or padded bras, but this material is so thin, that if you're the slightest bit chilly, your nipples will be showing through your blouse.  However, I did find that this bra was true to size (34D) although it is a snug bra.
