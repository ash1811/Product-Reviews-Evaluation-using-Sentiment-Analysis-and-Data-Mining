My four year old had just gotten a watch and then my three year old decided he needed to wear a watch also.  He loves animals! This was the best one I saw. It is a fabric wrist band so it was easy to size to his very small wrist. Band is too long for him but I tuck it under and it stays fine that way. Doesn't poke or itch him and now he wears it to school like his brother and shows his friends. Of course he can't tell time but oh well he feels like a big boy.  It lights up when you push in the button, which is the second thing he shows people after he announcing it has lizards on it.  Arrived quickly from seller :)
