I'm 31 now.  These are awesome!  They fit my feet great and they're made just like the pair I had when I was in 7th grade--albeit with different materials but they feel great!  I love Saucony Jazz!!!  I haven't been able to find a pair of these shoes anywhere.  So glad it occurred to me to check here.  If you've ever worn this style shoe in the past and LOVED them, buy this shoe!!
