I bought this as a gift for my Mother, to replace a watch she lost.  She wanted one that was both gold and silver - and this one has a good balance between the two metals, with a gold face, so that the gold predominates, as it did with the watch she lost.  (The other relatively inexpensive two-metal watches I found were more silver than gold.)  My mother was very pleased with it, and so was I.  It was large for her wrist, but most watches are - just required removing a link.
