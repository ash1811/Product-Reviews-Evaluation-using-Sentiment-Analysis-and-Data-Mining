I can't stress on the quality you get for ten bucks for this gun. Plus, it is made in Italy. When you see the gun you can see visually that it is well made and not cheap. Once you hold it you will be amazed by how well it feels in your hand and how well it shoots. I bought this for my son and he likes it but I am sure he doesn't appreciate it as much as I do. The revolver that holds the ammo doesn't pop off which is a bummer but helps in having less moving parts thus making this toy last longer with kids. It has a little door on the right that you slide and insert ammo. You then turn the cylinder and do the same thing 7 more times. When you shoot it you don't just shoot 8 straight times. You have to cock the hammer back each time you wanna shoot. This gun is super fun.
