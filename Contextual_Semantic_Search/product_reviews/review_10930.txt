I bought this sandal around one month ago, its very nice model and quality but unfortunately its size is somewhat small. I returned all its cost and I hope if Amazon give another chance to buy this sandal with more suitable size by waiving the shipping fees or by give me a special discount such as 70% because I like this sandal but I cannot buy it with shipping fees.At the end, I have to say &#34;Many thanks to Amazon&#34;
