These cotton cup underwire bras are a dying breed!  The support is perfect and there is no irritation from the seamless cotton cups.  Several companies used to make these, but are now opting for other than good old-fashion cotton, which is terrible for my skin.  Would highly recommend these to any who want good basic support and a smooth outline.  Thanks, Playtex!
