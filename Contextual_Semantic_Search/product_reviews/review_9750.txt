These are great briefs but beware that I received the incorrect item [when ordering from Amazon.com] -- style 70800-641, instead of 70800-041 as advertised/ordered.  These two cuts are very similar, however, there is enough of a difference that the suit doesn't fit as well as the style I'm accustomed to.  When it comes to briefs, swimmers seem to find a cut/style that works best for them, and stick to it.Other than that, it's a great 'Speedo.'  The sides are wider than some Nike/TYR/etc suits.  Expect the suit to be tight if you order the same waist size as jeans.  I usually wear at 34&#34; in TYR (comfortable); these I ordered in 32&#34; and are tiny and snug.
