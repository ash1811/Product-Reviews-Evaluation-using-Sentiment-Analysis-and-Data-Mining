I really love these bras.  They give me great support, they are cut low enough that I can wear lower cut tops with them without the bra straps showing.  They also don't push my boobs too far apart.  The straps may be just the tiniest bit wider set than some of my other bras but they are generally hidden under all of my clothes.  No seams or lines so they look great under t-shirts.  I have 3 of these and wear them all the time!
