When it comes to this tote, I like it and I don't like it. The material is shiny and nice looking, but almost too shiny for a guy. I decided to keep it because it will hold a lot of items when I do too much shopping at CVS or Rite Aid. I would like it better if the handles were shorter and a little stronger. Also, I kind of wish they were stitched closer to the top of bag. The inside is a nice tan color with a large zippered pocket and a small pocket for a smaller iPod or small cell phone. On the front, it has 3 open slightly deep pockets and 1 zippered pocket in middle. There is a wide deep pocket on back for something light like paperwork, etc. It is held closed by the back handle. The only other negative is the fixed bottom, which makes it hard to fold up smaller. Otherwise, I guess it makes the bag stronger. Folded, it is about 8.5&#34; deep and 18&#34; long, so you would have to have a long plastic bag to carry it in until you get out the store. That is what I do, unless I do it near the exit door. If you are driving, just carry it under your arm or in hand, or transfer items to bag when you get to car.
