These bras area great!  Good quality and fit well.  They are  not the typical minimizer - this bra does not just squish you and move things to other places.  I have a problem with straps digging into my shoulders.  This bra takes all the pressure off my shoulders - no more digging in!  They wear forever and the support lasts.  The price is great too.  I don't wear any other style.
