So your thinking about buying this watch. First off, it's a good solid watch. Not too big for a 6-7 inch wrist. Comfortable to wear. It has all your your basic functions. If your into extra bells and whistles go for the Casio Riseman(which I own and highly recommend) but that will add another $100 or more to your budget. Basically I like the look of the watch, I'm not too much into the other various colors or negative displays which they have in this model. Try one on at your local watch shop, test the buttons as they can be hard to press for some people. If it looks good on your wrist,and you love it, buy it on Amazon for the best price on the market. Remember no review can replace an actual test run on your wrist. You will know if it is too big or if it is not for you.One more thing I would like to add is that a bigger watch does not mean a bigger display. If you are like me and your Irish eyes ain't smiling as much as you get older, the display may be a little difficult to see. Another reason to do a dry run at the watch shop. I have a Casio SGW 100 which I think has the best display for reading glass folks like us. It has a digital compass, thermometer, mineral glass(instead of cheap resin glass) display and the numbers themselves light up when you press the light button. A good looking functional watch at a budget price available right here on Amazon. I have had it over a year with no worries. Hope this helps, good luck with your Mudman
