I read some of the reviews and in most of them they say to buy a size smaller than you usually get in this type of product. Now since I did order mine, this was not the case.  I had lost 32 lbs in the past year, but did want something to hide my spare tire.  Also, to give support to my back. [Which is in bad shape].  I tried it and never got past my knees.  I always had small hips and legs, so you'd think it would fit.  It definitely  was too small.  I loved the product, though.  Would seem to be cool and comfortable.  I get my larger size tomorrow.  I hope it does fit this time. --- I wanted to add to this since I did receive the one size larger. I did get it on, with a little bit hard time getting it on. Once I had it in place, the lower row at the bottom is bigger than the top section. I have a short torso and I put the garment under my breasts and the bottom lines up with the bottom of my panties. If it were only a half of an inch shorter, then I can give  this item 5 stars.  I can sit down and the staffs bend with you. Seems comfortable and really holds my posture without any help from me. I could look 5 lbs. smaller, cause it does cover the extra fat. When sitting down, it kinda pushes the top up. I am a short person, since I lost 3 inches in my height. I wish I could stretch myself back up to the 5'4". That would solve my extra fat I have developed by getting even shorter. I will keep this because I do like the con-structure of the whole item. I still don't see why I had to go larger in the size, when other viewers went the opposite way. I usually buy my clothes at Blair.com, and I where a size Medium and a small in the pants. Maybe I just don't want this to suck me in so tight you can not breathe. In all, I do like this and yes, I would recommend this product. I got fast service and it did arrive on the day promised.
