I bought three pair of these Wranglers and I love them. They fit exactly how I need them to fit. Plenty of room in the legs, and overall. I'm a large guy, and the extra comfort makes me feel &#34;together&#34;. They look good too, as my wife says, so if it passes her inspection then they do look good. Great value, couldn't beat it in a retail store. Way below what I expected to pay for this quality of jean pant.
