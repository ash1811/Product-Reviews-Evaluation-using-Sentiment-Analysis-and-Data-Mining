These Skimp Skamp Briefs are the most comfortable undies I've ever worn, and I've been buying them for a long, long time. They're perfect for anyone who doesn't like bikini or high-rise panties. After three babies, I can't wear those things anymore. The fabric moves with you, and they're practically invisible under clothing. I add Oxi-Clean to the detergent when I wash them, as chlorine bleach does a number on them. Plus I use a hanger with clips to air-dry them on the shower rod, as they last longer that way.
