nice ladies watch, slimmer band than the mens, although the band is very long even my husband could wear it lol! I got it for the 5 alarms, wake up, drop kids for school, wrap up work, pickup kids type stuff, it's perfect for that, its waterproof, 10 year battery, looks feminine, is comfortable, has other cool features. If your like me you've shopped around looked at cheap and expensive, bottom line this was best bang for the buck. Only wish is for the alarms to choose daily/weekly etc, but it just alarms same time each day. The alarm goes of for maybe 10 seconds and stops itself, just loud enough for you to take note but not annoyingly loud that would bother others etc.
