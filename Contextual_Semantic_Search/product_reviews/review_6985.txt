I love the GOLD TOE CREW SOCKS. They fit your feet perfectly due to the blend of cotton, nylon, and spandex. They stay up and provide adequate cushion so they're comfortable to wear.The blend helps the socks keep their shape and they hug your feet like a glove. No more saggy socks or uncomfortable bunches when loose socks become crimped inside your sneakers.I own both the white and the black, and it's true: the black ones leave little black fuzzy lint on your toes and toe nails. Hopefully washing them inside out will cure that, but it's not that big of a deal. So far I haven't found any black socks (that weren't dress socks) that didn't leave some black lint behind.Otherwise they're great! Love the GOLD TOE SOCKS!
