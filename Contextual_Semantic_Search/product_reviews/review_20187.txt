These are comfortable mid-weight sweatpants.  I bought them because they have elastic at the ankles; I'm very short so non-elasticized-ankle pants are always too long.  The sizing is for men so women might want to order one size smaller.  They are warm and I've enjoyed them so far.  Wish they had pockets, but I knew they didn't when I ordered.
