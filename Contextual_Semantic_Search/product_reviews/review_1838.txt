The brown tumbled have been my standard wear-to-work shoe for over 20 years. The chocolate nubuck version is my weekend shoe. These are the most naturally comfortable shoes I have ever found, and they look great.They're produced in Vietnam and China. Though not scientific, my feet say the Vietnam production feels better. The only problem I ever had was with one pair produced in China. I couldn't put my finger on it but something about the fit wasn't right.I can't describe with words how much I have enjoyed wearing Rockport's World Tour Classics all these years. They're perfect in every way and the price is reasonable.I greatly appreciate Rockport for staying on course with these shoes. No changes, same great fit and appearance, with solid durability for a reasonable price.A key reason for the World Tour's high comfort level is the insole design. Hopefully Rockport will hold the quality level and not go cheap like so many show makers have with low-end insoles that only perform for 6 months.For as long as Rockport continues to sell these shoes, I will be buying them. Hopefully, that will be for a long time to come.
