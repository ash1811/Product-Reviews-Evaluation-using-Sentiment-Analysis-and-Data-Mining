This bra is perfect for those whose breasts are not so close together. I got tired of buying old fashioned bras, in which the cups are too close together. I always have to push my breasts into the cups, which was uncomfortable overall. This bra fits my breasts perfectly, and lifts them up a little bit. Most importantly, it's very COMFORTABLE! One tiny problem is that the top part of the bra tends to show in some of the shirts I wear. Not recommended for low neck shirts.
