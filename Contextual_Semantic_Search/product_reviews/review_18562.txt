I bought this watch to wear for international travel so I could leave more expensive jewelry home.  It is easy to read and comfortable to wear.  It keeps great accurate time.  The date is a little difficult to see because it is so small.  The watchband is large (I have a fairly small wrist), but I don't like my band super-tight, and am able to wear this comfortably without putting it in the last whole.  I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because of the small date and long wristband.  Overall, I am very happy with this watch and would definitely recommend it.
