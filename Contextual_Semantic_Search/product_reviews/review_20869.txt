I bought a pair of these jeans for my husband about 5 or 6 years ago and was a bit anxious to re-order some more after reading some of the poor reviews here.  I almost did not re-order but I am glad I stuck to my gut feeling. The product is well-made and true to size (you can't beat a pair of jeans that fits perfectly especially when you are relying on pure description).
