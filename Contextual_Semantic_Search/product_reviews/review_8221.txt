*******IMPORTANT INFORMATION....SEE LAST UPDATE BELOW...******I HAVE NEVER PURCHASED A CHEAP WATCH AND GOT THIS ONE ON A WHIM. THIS IS A GOOD WATCH FOR THE MONEY, INVICTA #8926. I HAVE READ ALL THE REVIEWS ABOUT IT VARYING IN SECONDS AND STOP WORKING IF NOT WORN. IF YOU WANT A WATCH THAT DOES NOT VARY IN SECONDS DON'T GET AN AUTOMATIC.... GET A QUARTZ. BUT IF YOU WANT A NICE LOOKING AUTOMATIC MOVEMENT WATCH THIS ONE IS AN EXCELLENT BUY. I OWN 2 TAGS, 1 MOVADO AND THE 8926 SEEMS TO BE OF NEAR EQUAL QUALITY. ALSO IF YOU WANT TO REMOVE SOME LINKS IN THE BRACELET GET THE WATCH PIN REMOVER SOLD ON AMAZON FOR ABOUT $8.00 OR TAKE IT TO A WATCH SHOP FOR ABOUT THE SAME PRICE.I HAVE ONLY HAD THIS WATCH FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND WEAR IT 24/7 TO TEST IT OUT. SO FOR I AM VERY PLEASED WITH IT AND WOULD/HAVE RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS.....FOR $89 WHY NOT GIVE IT A TRY?...UPDATE...OVER A MONTH NOW AND NO PROBLEMS AT ALL!!!!!!!!!...UPDATE...MAY, 2008...STILL NO PROBLEMS AT ALL, CONTINUES TO LOOK BRAND NEW AND I WEAR IT OUTSIDE W/ CONSTRUCTION/LANDSCAPE WORK.......UPDATE...JULY 2008...THIS WATCH IS GREAT!
