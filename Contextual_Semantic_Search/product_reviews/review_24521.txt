I have always been a big fan of Bulova Watches and this one is my favorite every day watch. It is just the right size and the face is classic. I took it to a local jeweler for sizing, I needed two links added for my wrist, plus I like it a little loose. Anyway, he was surprised that I paid $200.00 less than his retail for the same watch.Love it, Love it!
