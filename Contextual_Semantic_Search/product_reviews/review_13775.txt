The Jerzees Sweatpant is comfortable and warm.  There's is nothing spectacular about it amongst such garments, but for the price paid it suits is function of lounging around the house, quick trips out, or a work out.  The addition of pockets would have been a nice bonus.  The waist string is the type that comes in a loop you must cut, which is something that has always annoyed me about some sweatpants.
