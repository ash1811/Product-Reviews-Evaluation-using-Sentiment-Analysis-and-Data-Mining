I must say this is the best shoe tree I've had. At a very good price point, this shoe tree does it job to maintain the shape of my leather shoe. The cedar fragrance leaves a pleasant hint of freshness in my shoe.Be sure to check the given shoe chart to make sure it fits your shoes well. I chose mine based on the chart and it does its job wonderfully. It fits snuggly; easy-on easy-off with the string loop to pull it out.I highly recommend this to keep your leather shoes up in shape.
