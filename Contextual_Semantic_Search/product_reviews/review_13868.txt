I have been wearing Wrangler jeans for years and figured I would try a pair of Lee's for a change. These are definitely not the Lee's of old. They are made of a much lighter denim than I remember, but living in Florida this will be a nice change. The overall construction of the jeans are ok. The stitching around the pockets could be better and I am not sure how they will hold up in the long run but I am ok withe the purchase. If you want heavier denim, get Wrangler's.
