ProsGood designGood quality.ConsSizing is missleading, it runs LARGE. I usually wear 10 but this 10 is too large even with heavy winter socks.It says, it is ok for -40 F. It is cold even for -10. So if u plan to wear it somewhere close to north or south pole, try something else.Overall - it's good for mild Russian (Moscow) Winter.
