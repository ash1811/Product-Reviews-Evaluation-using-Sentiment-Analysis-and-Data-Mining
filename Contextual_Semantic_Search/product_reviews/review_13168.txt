I love this bra- perfect coverage, wide straps, soft fabric, smooth appearance, great support (42DDD).I wash mine in warm water and hang it to dry and have worn them at least 3 days a week for ever 2 years with very little signs of wear, except that the elastic under the cups has started to be less springy.Try this bra, it's Great.
