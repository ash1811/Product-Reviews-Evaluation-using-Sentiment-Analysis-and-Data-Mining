I bought a Citizen Eco watch while on a cruise many years ago and the band recently broke to the point of no repair. I had been looking for a nice looking band and even ran to my local jewelry store, the bands I found were in the $30 range so when I saw this one for less then $5 with good reviews I figured I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did! This band is a perfect replacement for my Citizen watch. It's not even close to the original band but it looks good and it fits perfectly. It did come with 2 pins to attach it to your watch, in my case the pins were too long and I fortunately still had the original pins so I was able to recycle those with this new band.If you have a watch and need a 20mm band and want one that looks good, this is the one you want.
