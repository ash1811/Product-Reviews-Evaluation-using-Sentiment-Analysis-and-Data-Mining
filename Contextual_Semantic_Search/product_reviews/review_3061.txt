My son wanted a Dickies work pants for work, something comfortable, of good quality and could handle the wear and tear required of his daily tasks.  He wanted a bright color to match with the theme required at work, so Royal Blue would be the closest and acceptable to the theme.

The package arrived quickly, quality excellent, and the pants is comfortable, allows you to move freely in the pants and are true to size.
