This Overall is a nice jewelry box. Some of the issues are though, if examined closely, a couple of the handles are not totally in line with the shelves. (This may vary by item). The little travel box although cute and useful has a hard to open clasp. It is a leather strap with a hole in it that you pull down to a metal stud - I can see why the leather cannot be stretched out because than the box won't stay but it is difficult to open and close; my opinion it's a design flaw... a turn key or just snap button would have been better.I also wish the boxes were lined with anti tarnish for sterling silver; but at this cost you can't expect that... but good price for what you get. Actual Box is heavy and takes up a lot of room as with most large jewelry boxes but has a lot of space for everything. Single your jewelry, double it, or triple it. Compartments are versatile so you don't HAVE to put certain things in each compartment. You can pick and choose. *thumbs up*
