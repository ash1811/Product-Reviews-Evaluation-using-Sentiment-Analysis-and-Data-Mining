I have been wearing Gold toes since the only place you could buy them was in MayCo. (you remember those days?)While there quality has dwindled over the years, they are still one of the best buys out there and the onlyproblem I have with the Gold toe line these days is figuring out exactly which sock to order amongst the myriad of socks that are now under the Gold Toe line up.It used to be three or four designs and that was it; not anymore. Whewww!
