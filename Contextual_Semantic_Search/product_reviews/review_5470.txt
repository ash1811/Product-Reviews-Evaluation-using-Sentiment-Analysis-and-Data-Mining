This is a good watchband.  It fits many Timex watches including the Expedition.  The band itself is a canvas strap which I like alot because it "breathes" with me.  The clasp is the end of the band which goes through a plastic loop and fastens to itself with velcro.  Actually my only complaint is that I'm a big guy and the strap, even at its most loose, is a bit tight for me.  I know - lose weight!  So, my overall rating is good, but for me, not great.
