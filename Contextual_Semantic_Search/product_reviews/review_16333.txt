Purchased the Mignon Black Boot in a size 10.5 for my boyfriend's birthday and he was blown away.  He loves the detail, the fit, and,  actually, he loves everything about them.  From the moment he tried them on he had a huge smile on his face.  They look great--better than the online picture.  He said these boots were very comfortable and even wore them to a wedding with his grey suit. He received a lot of compliments. This is a very good looking pair of boots.  I tried to purchase a much more expensive Italian boot for him last year, and the experience was a dismal disappointment. I am thrilled with the Dan Post Company and Amazon.  They shipped the boots right away, the price is terrific, they are true to size, and the craftsmanship is excellent. I will be back for a brown pair for him for Father's Day.  Thank you.
