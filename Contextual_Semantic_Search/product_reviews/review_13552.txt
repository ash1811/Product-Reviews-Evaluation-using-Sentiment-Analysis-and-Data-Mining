I but these every year but it seems like they changed them a little bit and they are not as comfortable immediately like before. I have had surgery on the top of my feet and usually these fit great right off and then even better once worn in, but they seem to hurt one foot. I am sure once I wear them and wear down the foam they will fit. By the way the comfort foam does wear down rather quickly to the form of your foot and doesn't bounce back and stay fluffy just in case anyone believes that they will stay pillow like forever, they won't.
