Got these for a friend whose entire boot collection had been stolen. He had a pair like these and the rest were cowboy boots. I chose to get him these because they are stylish and much better for your feet than the other.  He is very happy to have them since they also took his van and he is walking a lot but refuses to wear walking shoes, etc..Some forty something guys are as tough to get practical as teenage girls.
