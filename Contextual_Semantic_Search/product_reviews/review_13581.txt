The design, support, materials, trim and of these houseshoes are great.  Be warned, however, that they run small lengthwise.  There is a small ridge of material on the very back under the heel so you will feel this as you walk, even if you order the shoes in your size.UPDATE:  Over time, your feet will flatten the padding, creating more room and ending the 'stepping on the ridge' bit I mentioned previously.2nd UPDATE:  I have never worn these outside my carpeted house and now, just a year after purchase, there is a huge hole worn into one of the soles.
