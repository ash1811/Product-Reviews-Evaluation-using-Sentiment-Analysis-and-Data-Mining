I am a small woman with large breast, this thing makes me look like a football player all over padded I order a 36 DD they send it but there is so much padding I look like there even bigger~ now really at my size do I need padding? NOif it was not such a big thing I would send it back, just as it is I will never order this or anything from these peoplethese people will not take it back since I washed it, I washed it since I am allergic to chemicals and would break out if this thing touched my bodyso FYI TRY IT ON OR BETTER YET DO NOT BUY IT ALL TOGETHER
