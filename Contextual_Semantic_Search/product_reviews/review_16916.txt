These are the absolute best garden shoes I've ever had - truly comfortable to wear and your feet stay dry all day long. Absolutely love the elasticized trim. In addition to keeping out dirt, stones, mulch and the usual detritus that used to work its way into my shoes, it greatly adds to the overall comfort.You can tell that a lot of thought went into these shoes. Even the tread pattern works well - it provides good grip in mud or on wet grass, but does not allow the mud and dirt to cake up like "waffle" tread shoes do. Yes, some mud will stick to the bottom after you slog through the muck but just let it dry, then bang the shoes together the next day and they are clean and ready to go.Very easy to slip on. With some practice, you can slip it on without using your hands - gives you the benefits of a shoe but the easy slip-on nature of a clog.Runs a bit large. I wear a mens size 11 that fits fine in a sneaker or regular shoe. The Muck Boot size 11 was a wee bit large - 10  would have probably been perfect, but they don't sell half sizes. It does not distract from comfort, but if you normally wear a half size, you probably would want to order the next size down. On the other hand, the greater roominess allows me to wear heavy socks without any problem.If you garden, you gotta get these. I'd give up my Felco pruner or my Hori Hori knife before I would give up these! (Well, maybe not, but it would be a thinker as to which is more valuable.)
