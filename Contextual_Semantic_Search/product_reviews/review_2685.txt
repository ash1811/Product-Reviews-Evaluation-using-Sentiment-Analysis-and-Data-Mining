Wow!  I'm very happy with my new watch!  Although I'm a woman, and my wrist is fairly small, I LOVE Big watches.  and this one is Super big.  I also love that it has roman numerals, and the face lights up at the touch of the button.  The leather band is great too...I was afraid it might be too big, but it has plenty of holes.All in all, a great watch.
