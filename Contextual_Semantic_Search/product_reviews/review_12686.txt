Great fit. Doesn't ride up.  Comfortable even in my very active job, while offering much needed support. Control in the back for the rolls n lift in the front for the girls :)After my initial joy came distress. This bra was held together by glue, very cheap glue. Glue that comes apart when I sweat and material that dyes my skin. The bra quickly lost shape with each wash.
