They used to make Carter's Spanky pants for women. But that ended in the 70s. These are the closest things I have found to those since that time. I love the lack of elastic on the let openings. The elastic always hurts for folks with desk jobs. I would order them a size smaller than you usually would. Generous in the material . . .
