I'm not into brand names for the name. I purchased a pair of these about 6 years ago and I'm still wearing them. They come in wide, which I need. I purchased the new pair for a great price. I wanted a back-up for when the old ones finally give out ( so far, they don't seem to be wearing out any time soon ). Very comfortable boots.
