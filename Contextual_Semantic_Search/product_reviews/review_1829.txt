These shoes have the most inferior insole of any walking shoe. If you want to add a decent insole, you won't have much breathing room for your foot. The shoes overall aren't as comfortable as everybody is saying, but I have a slightly wide foot. I am fine when I wear my New Balance shoes with a width of D. I do believe that this shoe isn't what it used to be. They are a decent pair of shoes for someone on a budget. I bought theRockport Men's Ct Sport Oxfordwhen I bought these, and highly suggest those. Those shoes have a much better insole, and the shoe breathes well.
