I was mostly a Levis fan until I ran across my 1st pair of 13MWZ (PW suffix) jeans, since the 1950's; in a rustic country store 8 or 9 years ago. Those Wrangler Prewashed Indigo Cowboy Cut Original Fit fit perfectly, not too tight, not too loose, didn't slip on the waist, bag in the butt, grab in the crotch & fit at the natural waist. They felt supportive, snuggy, cocooning without emphasizing my skinny legs. Lately I've lost weight & waist size & wanted a better fit so I got an inch smaller waist. These Shadow Black 13MWZWK Denims are even better, the material is softer & feels heavier, stay up even without a belt without being at all tight. Don't be put off by cowboy cut if you're not a fan of cowboys or country music etc. (I am a fan). These have almost straight legs & in my opinion look better on a man then skinny tapered legs or too baggy relaxed fit. I can move easily in them, they are comfortable on a motorcycle or doing strenuous work that requires stretching, bending & stooping. These Shadow Black Denims fit true to size with standard shrinkage, don't wrinkle much, are softer & look dressier than standard blue jeans. In past the 13MWZ line has worn like iron & IMHO are the best jeans in the world. These are nothing like the Wranglers you find in most retail stores, at least here in New England.
