I have worn these for years, but was concerned about recent reviews reporting an odor.  They do have a smell, like you might have from your detergent.  It is not strong enough to concern me, but I would just as soon it not be there. I have washed them once  before wearing and will see what happens as I do more washings.  The fit is as usual and I like the colors and pattern.
