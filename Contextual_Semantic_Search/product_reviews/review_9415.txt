If I was only lounging by the pool these would be great.  As soon as I step out of the water the shorts cling to every nook and cranny.  I could pull the outer layer down and release the fabric from showing the complete outline of my package, but it seems annoying.  I am not modest by any means.  It is about the reaction of people at a family public pool that needs to be addressed.  I don't feel that anybody can see through them.  I held the outer layer away and my wife couldn't see anything in daylight two feet away.  I like them and I like wearing them swimming.  I'd rather wear as little as possible.  I'm not a fan of too much clothing whiles swimming.I think that I will find myself wearing these to the beach, but have a pair of nylon shorts with pockets to put on over them when I need to wonder closer to the crowds.  I would also wear these when company is over to enjoy the hot tub and they are too shy for nudity.  They're great for lounging around the house in the summer.  Very breathable.  Some people would feel comfortable wearing this as running shorts.This product is a one step closer to modesty: Speedo Men's Solid Surfrunner Volley Short.  I bought this at the same time.  I've worn this swimming once.  I didn't feel like I had to monitor the fabric because of modesty.
