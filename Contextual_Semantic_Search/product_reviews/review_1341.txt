These are very comfortable and I wear them on occasions that are not casual enough for myMerrell Men's Moab Ventilator Multisport Shoe. They're great for weekend days when I have to go to work or even a semi-casual night out.The uppers are suede and I've been a bit worried about damaging them, but so far, they've held up quite well.I bought size 10.5 and they fit well.
