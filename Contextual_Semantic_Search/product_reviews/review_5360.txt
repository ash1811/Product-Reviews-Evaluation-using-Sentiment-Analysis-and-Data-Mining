I bought these earrings for my son's girlfriend for Christmas because she has the loveliest long brown hair and while she loves girly things, she is quite low maintenance. I knew as soon as I saw these that she would love them and they would look stunning on her. Several people here have commented that these aren't what they looked like on the site. I have bought many earrings like these over the years, and these were the same as those I bought (for gifts). I knew they would be smaller and more dainty than the picture showed. And they were exactly as expected. The reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is that they were not boxed. They were simply put in a pouch and sent to me. These are sold by Silver Insanity and these earrings should have been in a nice little box. This was NOT a classy move on their part. Otherwise, they are exactly as expected, including the light blue topaz stone. If you like flashy, big earrings with thicker silver, then these won't make you happy. If you like understated elegance, then these are the earrings for you!
