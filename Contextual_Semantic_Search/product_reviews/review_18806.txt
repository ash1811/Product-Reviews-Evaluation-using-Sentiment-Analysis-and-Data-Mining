Timeless design, comfortable, convenient, cheap, and fairly durable. I have owned 3 other pairs of these, each last about 3-4 years. I wear them daily at some point or another - Shorts trips to the store, walking the dog, getting the mail, etc.When they are new it takes your feet a few days to adjust to the stiff needles but after that they are super comfortable.
