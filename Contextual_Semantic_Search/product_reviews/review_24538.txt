I ordered these shoes not because they looked all that great, but because (1) they were cheap, (2) the beautiful shoes I'd ordered for my daughter for starting school were too big, (3) I remember from my own childhood that Stride Rite shoes are supposed to be high quality, (4) I could get them shipped overnight for $3.99 with my Amazon Prime, and (5) I figured if nothing else, since they were so cheap, I could let my daughter draw on them to achieve that stamp of coolness kids so covet.As it turned out, these are quite a sharp-looking pair of shoes, and they are indeed well made.  My daughter reports that they are very comfortable, and, shock of all shocks, her friends think they're cool.  She's thrilled.  What started out as an emergency backup pair is now her favorite pair to wear.I'm not sure I'd pay full price for these (I'm cheap), but the clearance price is a fantastic bargain.  I plan to buy more.
