I bought these for my husband for Father's Day. I noticed he was in need of new sandals for the summer. He's never had a pair of Keen sandals but after reading the rave reviews, I decided to take a chance and buy them for him. He put them on and immediately commented on how nice they felt on his feet. He wears a size 9M and the size 9M fit him just right. He's been wearing them daily ever since.
