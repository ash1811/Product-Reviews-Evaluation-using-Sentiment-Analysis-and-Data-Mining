I buy Levi 501s all the time and was surprised at how differently these particular jeans fit from the ones I usually buy.  I had to return them which was VERY SIMPLE AND PAINLESS!  Thanks for the easy return policy.  I will have to pay more attention to the &#34;type&#34; of 501 I buy in the future.  This was my fault, not the pants!
