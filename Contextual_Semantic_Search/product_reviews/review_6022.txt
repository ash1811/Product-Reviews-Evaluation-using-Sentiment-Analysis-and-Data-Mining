I love not dealing with panty hose or garters.  Over the last ten years I have had increasing numbness in my fingers due to MS which makes getting dressed a real chore.  I wear pants most of the time but needed to put on a dress for a recent wedding that I attended.  Panty hose are very difficult for me to deal with but the thigh highs did the trick.  I was very worried that they would fall down on my 110 lb body but the A/B sizing worked well for me and restroom breaks were a breeze.
