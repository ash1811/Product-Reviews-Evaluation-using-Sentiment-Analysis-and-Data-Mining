The fabric is the softest, and the thick lacy detailing is so sweet. This is my go-to black tank top. I wear it under nearly everything. The front does not sit as low on me as on the model, so it covers nicely. My last one was a hand-me-down which lasted several years, the new one I ordered to replace it is the same quality. I usually wear a medium/6 bottoms and large/8 on top, but in this I order/wear a MEDIUM.
