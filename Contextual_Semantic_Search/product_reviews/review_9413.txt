So nice I almost forget that it's on. Silky smooth feeling and freedom of movement allows me to perform my physical therapy in the pool with ease. My only hope is that the chlorine will not fade the color too soon as I am avid at going to the pool. At this price, that would not be a problem compared to other more pricey brand names. I will be buying more in the future. Fit true to size. Looks good in and out of the pool.
