This is the fifth Lee Dungaree Jean I bye from this site. I bought one in a store in Florida several years ago and realized they came a bit larger, so I've got a 33x30 although I was 34x30. The 33x30 fitted perfectly. Then I began ordering through amazon because I already knew the size. The first three I ordered were perfect. The last two were not. This one and the second last one came somewhat small on waist size. I wonder if they've made sizes adjustments. My advice: Becarefull because these pants are not somewhat larger anymore. Order your actual size.
