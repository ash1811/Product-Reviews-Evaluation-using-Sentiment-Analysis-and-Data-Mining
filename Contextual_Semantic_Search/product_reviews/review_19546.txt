Was suggested that I take a rain jacket with me to New Zealand so I found this one and it worked out well.  Wore it several times throughout New Zealand, not because it was raining but because it was a little chilly.  Worked out well, cause I could roll it up into practically nothing and it disappeared into my bag.
