I've bought 2 other socks made by Thorlo and loved them so thought I would give these a try. They are not the same. This pair is sloppy on. When I walk around the house without shoes, just socks, the bottoms slip up to the side of my foot. I have to keep reaching down and adjusting. The material is very different, feels cheaper, like something I could buy at the big discount stores. This sock has 85% acrylic and the previous pairs had 70% coolmax. I will check the material more carefully next time and stick with the coolmax.
