My husband it a tall, long-legged guy with broad shoulders -- in order to find a t-shirt that fits his shoulders I have to by extra-extra large.  That size, however is usually too short for him and that is what was wrong with this T-shirt.  Great for a big &#34;wide&#34; guy -- not so great for a big &#34;not-too-wide&#34; guy who is over 6' tall.  I liked everything about it but the fit.  Washing it of course, made it even shorter.
