I've tried many panties lately to fit my curvy figure that stayed in place without any panty lines that weren't too loose or too tight in the leg and for size 10-12 5'7" hippy gal, these fit perfect!  Ordering more, other colors would be nice.Update, after washing they have sm hole from coming apart at seam on the leg opening in the front of panties, bummed but like enough to try another pair and contacting seller/mfr.
