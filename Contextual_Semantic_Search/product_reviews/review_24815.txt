They are what they are.  Nothing expensive, no UV protection, no scratch resistance, but very stylish.  So for the price, I won't complain.  If you are going for "looks" these are cheap and cheerful!Ps...I've had these for over a year now and they are still in decent shape.  HOWEVER, I want to note that they were priced at less than $10 at the time.  That is what they are worth:)
