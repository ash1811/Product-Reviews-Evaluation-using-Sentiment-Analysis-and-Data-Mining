I can't find 31 waist Levi's locally.  I'm so glad they have them here!  The usual Levi's warnings apply...no consistency in lengths, and sometimes the leg seams wander around to the side.  Thank you NAFTA, the prices would have gone up more if they were still made in the US, but at least the jeans would have had more quality control.
