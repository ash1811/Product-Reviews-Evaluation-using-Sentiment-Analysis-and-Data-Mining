Love Love Love these shoes, they are the most comfortable shoes in the world and I mean that. I am so happy with these shoes I will most certainly buy more pairs, just as some others have voiced. You can wear these shoes all day and your feet will be comfortable all day and night, they are fully padded inside and the vamps are higher also which gives you a lift especially if you are short like I am. They feature a good quality canvas upper and quality stitching all around. I am currently wearing them just around my home as house shoes, sometimes I even forget I am wearing them because they are so comfortable that I accidently wear them outside, that's how comfortable Grasshoppers are. In my opinion these shoes should be renouned for comfort. Believe I will continue to purchase these shoes as long as they make them. I recommend these shoes to everyone who is seeking a quality made most comfortable shoe. And a big plus they even supply you with a shipping label with your order, that's the sign of a confident manufacturer. Added to my review this is a update to my last review, these Grasshopper Jensens slip on shoes is that they did not last as long as I thought or expected to last it is now a year later and their are signs of wear these shoes were only worn inside my home and never worn outside my home, this latest update will not deter me from purchasing these most comfortable shoes however it will be a disappointment as far as how long they last, this is the only disappointment I have with this brand.
