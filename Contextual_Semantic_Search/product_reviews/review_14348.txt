I find these really cute for whatever event you might have that warrants this kind of &#34;look&#34;.  They are well made.  The only complaint I have is about the listing - as you scroll through to select color, the picture of the color doesn't always match what the words say.  I did, however, get the color I ordered, so all is good.
