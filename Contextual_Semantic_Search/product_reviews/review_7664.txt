I have ordered the ExOfficio underwear for my husband before, so I decided to order a t-shirt as well.  The shirt fit well and seemed to help with the sweat from wearing his bullet-proof vest which he is currently wearing in July in August.  Of course, he still sweat, but he said that the shirt made him more comfortable than normal.  This seemed to be a good buy and I will certainly order more t-shirts of this brand.
