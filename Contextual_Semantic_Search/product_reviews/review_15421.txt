I think this is the best bra I ever bought!I have large breast and am pregnant at the moment. So I was looking for something that would give me the support I need but with comfort (no under wires). This bra is perfect! I feel I can even sleep with it on but at the same time it is so efficient! It lifts, it separates, it holds in place, it gives support...The quality is superb! Soft and wide cushioned straps, breathable material at the back (perfect for gym or hot summers), and the lining is very soft against the skin.I'm ordering more of it.I think every woman with large breast should have this bra! Love it!
