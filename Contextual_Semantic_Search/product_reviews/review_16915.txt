I had to send these boots back because they were too tight. Replaced with one size larger which was a bit too large. I will keep the larger ones since I will only need these boots for yard work and &#34;mucking&#34; around with my ducks and dogs. They stay on okay.There seems to be a big jump between sizes. My husband's MuckBoots are a Men's 9/woman's 10. They have always been too big for me so I ordered the next size down for myself thinking that they might be too big also but I don't really mind a little too big because I always wear thick socks on the wet, winter days. They turned out much too tight. I noticed when holding my husband's older boots next to these new boots that the width across the ball of the boot is equal but the instep is MUCH narrower with the new boots. That is probably why the larger sized replacement boots stay on well even though the toe is longer than I need. Oh well.BTW, I normally wear an 8 woman's shoe but the replacement boots are a woman's 10! They are comfortable. Hope they last a very long time. I got these for free using my saved up Amazon visa points.Hope this helps.
