Virtually all of my shoes are Keen shoes: dress and casual. My feet aren't the same size, the left foot has had multiple surgeries.Needless to say, it's hard to find comfortable shoes for both feet.  My orthopedic surgeon not only Keen's Newport H2 Water Shoe said it was the best choice for me, he has a pair as well!
