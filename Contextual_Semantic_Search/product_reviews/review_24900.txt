I was looking for a wallet to replace my trifold (they are really hard to find in women's styles), and this popped up as an Amazon suggestion.My requirements for a new wallet were that it have:1) Plenty of slots for cards2) A coin holder of some kind (parking necessitates lots of quarters)3) Two slots for money (I use one for receipts and one for cash)4) A plastic ID window5) Be leather so that it will hold up longerSince I loved the green color of this wallet, I thought I'd give it a shot, along with theBuxton Parkview Zip Double Cardex.  They are very different wallets, and I really didn't think I'd like the relatively longer and bigger style of the Suburban wallet.  However, once I got them side by side, it was no contest to decide which one to keep.  The Cardex had tons of slots for cards, but it was really chintzy looking on the inside (cheap polyester fabric).Not so with this Suburban wallet, which has leather slots for all of your cards (not just a leather facing on the top of the slot, either, but leather throughout).  Once I got all of my stuff in it, I realized how much smaller and nicer this wallet is that my old trifold.  It snaps closed with a satisfying click and the "kiss" coin holder is perfectly cute.  The check book cover doesn't fit inside the little pocket like I thought it would once my big checkbook was inside (I use the kind with carbons - maybe without that it would fit), but I just thew the checkbook cover separately in my purse and it looks so nice as a matching accessory.  I've already gotten complements from friends with much bigger budgets for these things than I.It's a very ladylike and nice alternative to my old wallet and I am quite happy I bought it.  In all, it's shocking how high-quality this wallet is for the money, and I could see myself buying another easily.
