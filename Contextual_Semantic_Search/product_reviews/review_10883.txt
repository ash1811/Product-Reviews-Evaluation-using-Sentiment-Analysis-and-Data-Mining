Went w/ 9.5 instead of usual 10 based on numerous reviews. The 1/2 size down is accurate for foot width and length - but the shoe does not allow for the height of the arch (normal arch) and it takes ~ 5-10 hours of wear before it begins feeling OK. As it arrives, it is not a soft foot cushion and you'll probably want a good insole insert. I'd stick with the 2/3 length inserts since you really don't want to add more height under the ball/initial arch of your foot (see beginning comment on break in). Once through the initial period, I'm quite happy with the shoes. They got 4 vs. 5 stars because of the initial experience and because they are not really the originally designed shoe you might remember. They're close, but somewhere between the original factory and the overseas location they use now ... someone at Clark's spent way too much time playing with material costs and lost some of the original magic.
