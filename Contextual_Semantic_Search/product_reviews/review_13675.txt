My boy saw the movie Gladiator and was enthralled. Naturally, he wanted a Halloween costume that looks the same as the Spaniard.My experience with Halloween costumes in the past few years has left me highly skeptical. America's weak (nonexistent, really) anti-false-advertisement laws have led to an entire industry selling flimsy plastic pieces while putting totally unrelated fantasy photos on the packages. So, it was with quite a bit of trepidation that I ordered this costume for him.Well, it turns out that this costume is indeed flimsy but still much better than the industry average. The pictured costume was probably the prototype. The factory had to substitute with much cheaper materials, of course. The armor is a thin layer of vinyl. The cape is polyester. The shin guards and the helmet are made of soft rubber. Amazingly, the overall effect looks decent. The only thing that looks obviously cheap is the helmet. It comes floppy and shining silver, more like a rubber mask than helmet. I staple some cardboard inside to prop up the shape. The application of some black and silver acrylic paints adds the final touch for improved realism. Now my son wears it every night, in happy anticipation of the big day.
