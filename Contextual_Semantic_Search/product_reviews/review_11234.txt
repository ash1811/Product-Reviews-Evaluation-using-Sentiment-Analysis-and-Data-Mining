Well I am really peeved that the price went down over 20 bucks so soon after I purchased it.  The law states that if a store sells you something and it goes on sale within 7 days after your purchase they are under obligation to refund you the difference, but I didn't come back to check on the price until 10 days later.  Booo.Other than that I'm happy with the bag.  It's my grocery shopping bag and it's great for anyone who doesn't do their shopping with a car.  I wheel it around the store and use it as my shopping basket, then when it's time to hop on public transportation I use it as a back pack to go up and down the stairs easily.  Then it's back to wheeling when I'm walking those few blocks home.  The only thing is that the zippers are kind of tough and they aren't always easy to zip up and down, but I'm hoping that with use over time they will get softer.Update:  I was right about the zippers.  After using this bag for a while the zippers become easier to pull.  Now the zippers give me no problems at all and glide easily.
