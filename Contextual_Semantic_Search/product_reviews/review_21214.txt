I don't think I have wide feet- I usually fit into regular shoes happily, and have never noticed anything amiss.  With these, I felt suspiciously wide.  The sides of my feet weren't spilling off, but they are exactly on the edge!  I ordered the brown on brown if that makes a difference.I really like the feel of them and I am pretty sure I'm going to keep them, they're just a bit narrow.
