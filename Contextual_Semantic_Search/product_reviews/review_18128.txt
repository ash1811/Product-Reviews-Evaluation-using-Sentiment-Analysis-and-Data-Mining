I'm a fan of these type of Skechers shoes.  These particular ones had a bit of a rub spot on the outside of one of my feet (a problem I've never experienced before with any other shoe), but that went away as I broke them in.  They run a little big so I'm glad I ordered a half size smaller than usual.  Otherwise very comfortable!
