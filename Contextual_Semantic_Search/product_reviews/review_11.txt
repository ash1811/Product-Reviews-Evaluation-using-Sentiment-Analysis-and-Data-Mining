My daughter has worn this skirt almost every day since she received it and it's even been through the washer along with the other clothes.  It's amazing quality!  She fits a 4T and it's just above her knee, and has a little bit of growing room, although I'm not so sure as much as others are saying.  But considering how often she wears it, I'm not worried! ;)
