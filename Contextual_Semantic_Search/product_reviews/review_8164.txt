I ordered the large robe (in Taupe) to get the added length. I had been looking for an all-cotton Turkish robe because what I could find locally were only synthetic textiles - high static. This robe is exactly what I hoped for. It is long (to my ankles - I'm 6') but not overly loose. It does feel heavy (5lbs) but that's fine. I also like that the sleeves, although large, don't drag on the ground like a kimono (i.e. are not awkward).
