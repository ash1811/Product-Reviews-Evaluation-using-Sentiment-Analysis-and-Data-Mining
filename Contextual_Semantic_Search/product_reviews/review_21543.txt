My 3rd Baggallini in 10 mos - going for lightweight larger travel bags that'll double as purses and carry my lunch bag to school/work. This one performed beautifully giving me easy access to travel dox, Kindle, iPhone, water bottle, glasses/sunglasses, lipstick, pen, keys, business cards (in snug inner pocket) and more in the two outer snap-close pockets. The center zip compartment's roomy enough for my large wallet, snacks, mini 1st aid kit, camera, makeup bag, and plenty more. It's a matter of how heavy you want it. And getting this one in black was with the idea of taking it out to dining later. Perfectly fine & quite classy with its all black (no white stitching), tapered lines. I have to stop buying these now. But all the great styles & colors makes that tough to do!
