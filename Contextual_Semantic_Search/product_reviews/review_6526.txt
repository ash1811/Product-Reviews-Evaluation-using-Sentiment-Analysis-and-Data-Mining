What can I say about these gloves. They fit well, look great ( I have the tan set ) I got the idea watching Tony Curtis wear driving gloves in his series &#34; The Persuaders&#34;.  I would never buy anything else. Normally I have a large size but ordered the medium and they ,can I say it, fit like a glove. Only blemish was  a slight stain on the right glove,but was so happy with them,I kept the set and plan on ordering another pair.
