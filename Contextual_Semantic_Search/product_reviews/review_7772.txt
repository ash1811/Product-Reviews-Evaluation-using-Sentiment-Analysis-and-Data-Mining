I had to buy some more underwear because I realized that I only had bikinis, boxers, boxer briefs, and jockstraps. Sometimes a guy just needs a plain and simple brief and that's when I thought about CALVIN KLEIN MEN'S BASIC BRIEF in white.After reading some of the reviews, I was a little apprehensive because it's been a while since I've worn Calvin's iconic tighty-whities (and that was way back when I was a teen and now I'm full grown). I'm 5' 9", about 184lbs, with a muscular build. I got the briefs in 34 and they fit just fine.I could've gotten a 32 but I like a little room for my junk. Not sure why some people are complaining that the CALVIN'S are too big and loose, maybe they got a bad batch, but I've always known that these briefs are the only ones that cover my seat completely.Having a muscular butt, most briefs end-up cutting across my cheeks or being stretched too far in back, that there's not enough room in the front, LOL, but with CALVIN'S, the cut is fuller, so it forms and covers the way a brief should.And did I mention that they're super comfortable and super sexy! Sometimes simplicity is sexier than a lot of bells and whistles, which is certainly the case for these CALVIN KLEIN'S BRIEFS.Now that there are numerous companies in the business of making "sexy" underwear for guys, these briefs still have sex appeal.
