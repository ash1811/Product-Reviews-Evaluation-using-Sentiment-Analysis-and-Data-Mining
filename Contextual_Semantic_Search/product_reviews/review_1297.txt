Good traction, fits well and seems to have extra cushion or sole in the heal area. Stepping in them you will notice they are taller than a tennis shoe and more like a boot as far as adding a little height in the sole. First couple of times I wore them I wasn't sure what all the hype was about but by the fourth or fifth time I was quite pleased. Will be interested to see how well they hold up over time and use.
