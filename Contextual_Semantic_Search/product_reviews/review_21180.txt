These are not your ordinary flip flop!!I have 3 pairs of Sanuk sandal/flip flop type shoes.  These are my favorite.  The yoga mat sole actually forms an arch support that no other flip flop I've owned has done.  They're so comfortable that I can wear them all day without complaint.The bands across the top do start out somewhat tight, but they loosen up so that they're perfect after a couple days of use.  The material between the toe was a little annoying the first day or so but again, that loosened up after a bit and is very comfortable now.These shoes have never let me down.  Next I want to try some of their slip ons and loafers with shearling inside for fall/winter.Sanuk shoes for every season!!
