I love, love, love these earrings.  I was looking for something small and round but more unique than just a ball. These are adorable. Size is great, 4.5mm, and works well on the lobe even if you have multiple piercings. My ears can be sensitive but did not have a problem with these. Sterling silver and white gold are usually a safe bet for me. The backs stay on well, I sleep in them all the time. Have never had them fall out. I have received a few compliments on them also. I would recommend these to anyone looking for something small and unique.
