My husband and I have an old bungalow style house and it's very cold inside during the winter months, so a robe is essential. I wanted the robes to feel almost like we had blankets wrapped around us. I did some browsing here on Amazon and read the reviews for these robes and decided to order them. I am 5ft short and my husband is 6ft tall, and I ordered two in the size of L/XL because we wanted them to wrap around us really well. Like other reviewers have said, they do run pretty big/long, so, you will need to think about what size to order. We both feel very comfy and cozy in our robes.
