The pin remover works well once you get the drive pin aligned with the link pin you're removing.  I used this on a Citizen watch with a titanium case and band and it did work well.  The watch band is 20 mm wide and just fit in the tool. It would be useful if they noted that this tool will not work with metal bands wider than 22mm. The supplied 0.85mm drive pin fits this watch, but may not fit all others. A good tool for the price and for limited, non-professional use.
