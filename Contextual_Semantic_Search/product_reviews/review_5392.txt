OK, guys have nipples too.  The front part (everything past the leather) is a very stiff weave - I had to move them well away from my nipples to avoid having them cut in (hard).  That said, they are also very durable, the clasps are functional and hold well.  The elastic is on the back straps below the leather only, and seems to work well.  I bet these would hold up a reasonably apportioned tool belt as well as they do my carpenter jeans with square, leatherman, large tape and razor knife in them.Added plus:  Suspenders with no belt = much more comfort for those of us with no hindquarters to support the weight in our pants without cinching up our belts like a python killing it's prey!If plumbers wore these they wouldn't need longer shirts!
