For those who like me want a genuine leather jacket, this is a great choice. I must admit to being befuddled by other reviews that complained of the odor. The odor is the odor of leather, and I would be concerned if it were absent! The five pockets are a big plus. Although a little thinner than some other leather jackets, it's a huge bargain at the price I paid ($34.80 with free shipping as my total order was over $35).
