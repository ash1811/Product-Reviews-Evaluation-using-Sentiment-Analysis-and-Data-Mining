The boot was somewhat large - though another boot of the same brand, size, and similar style was too small and had to be returned. I am going to try a sole insert and thick socks. For the price the quality was lower than expected, the leather upper almost like plastic,. Plus the pictures were better than the reality. I am buying from zappos (owned by Amazon) from now on.
