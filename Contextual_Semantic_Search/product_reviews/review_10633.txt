This watch is dignified looking, not quite elegant, and yet casual for every day wear.  The oval face looks lady-like and dressier than what I would expect from the traditional Timex.  I like the expansion band for easy on and off, and is so much "faster".  Overall a very attractive, clean-casual yet dignified watch that I'm glad I found after careful searching.
