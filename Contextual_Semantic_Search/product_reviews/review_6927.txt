It was my mistake to buy these. I prefer the &#34;crew&#34; fit of socks which don't go over the calf. I have broad calves, so these are hard to put on, and they squeeze pretty hard. If that's the type of sock you like, you will like these. Gold Toe are very high quality socks. They are comfortable, and they last a very long time.
