I never thought I would need one of these modern day girdles but mother nature had other plans. I recently purchased a white linen dress and wore the Spanx under it and was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable it was. It certainly did the trick. Just a note:It's a bit tricky to get on so prepare to do a silly little dance!
