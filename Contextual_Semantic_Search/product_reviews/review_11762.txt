That is what my 91 year old Dad told me this morning.  He loves everything about them. The fit is perfect, he loves the supple and flexible fit and feel of the leather .  He says the cushioning in the foot and arch are perfect and he is  also very pleased with the firm sole and the grip of the sole. Dad lives with us  and we have all wood floors, so of course we always have the thoughts of slipping. These moccasins definitely are no slip on our floors.I am thrilled because this morning was his second time to put them on and he told me how much he liked them , wore them all day , and mentioned again at lunch how very comfortable they are and how perfect they fit. At 91 he has worn out a few slippers in his life, so thank you Minnetonka for helping me make my dad happy and thank you Amazon for carrying  such a great product.
