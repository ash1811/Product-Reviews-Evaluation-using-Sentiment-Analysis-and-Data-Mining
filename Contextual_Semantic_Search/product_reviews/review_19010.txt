Very low cost watch that is easy to read in both daylight and darkness.  I disagree respectfully with the several reviews claiming that it was difficult to set the day and date.  It was trivial.  Also, a few people commented that leather strap was too red and looked cheap.  Mine strap was brown and looked quite good based on the modest price I paid
