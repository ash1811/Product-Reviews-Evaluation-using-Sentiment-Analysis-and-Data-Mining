They fit perfectly...would be ashamed to mess up something so simple. I am not at all pleased with their customer service. The shipment was super delayed and they were not kind about resolving the problem at all. I thought they had just decided to drop the order altogether then randomly a month later I received a mysterious package and there they were. The case if the long lost gloves.
