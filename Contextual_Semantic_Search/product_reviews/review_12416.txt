I was hoping for a longer than 'above the knee' cargo short that was adequate quality and didnt break the bank. These shorts size run on the large size so if youre on the edge of a size, err on the smaller side.Also, these are manufactured by Rothco if that matters to you. I find that I return 90% of Rothco stuff for lack of quality so I stopped ordering anything by that brand. If it said ANYWHERE in the description that these are Rothco I wouldnt have ordered.
