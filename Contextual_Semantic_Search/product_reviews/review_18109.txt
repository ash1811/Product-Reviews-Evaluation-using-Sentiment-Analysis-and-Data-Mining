They got to me really fast. Fit perfect. I used the sizing guide, and measured my foot. They are very comfortable. I need a wide toe box, and these were fine. I wore them to work the first day I got them and no rubbing, no blisters. The heel is more narrow than I am use to, because I usually where a walking shoe. But I absolutely would order them again.
