My daughter is a petite and dainty tot of 20 months; about 25th percentile for weight, 40th for height, with slender legs.  In Children's Place clothes, and many brands she takes 12-18 months; Baby gap she wears dresses sized 6-12 months and ditto their onesies.  I bought her the 12-18 months onesies shown here, and they are somewhat too short - they strain to go over her diaper.  The sleeves are also short, but that didn't bother me so much because I generally put these under things.  But I don't think she'll be comfortable in them being this length.  I'm going to have to give them away now I've pre-washed them...first try on, they seemed to fit but they are just too snug.  Ordering the next size up.  Be warned.Otherwise, they're nice.  I liked the smaller ones I bought her a year ago, and I thought the price on these was pretty reasonable.
