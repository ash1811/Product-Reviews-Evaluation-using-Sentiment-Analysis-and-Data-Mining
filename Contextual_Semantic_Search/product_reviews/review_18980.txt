by Marjorie's husband. I need a smallish tough, reliable waterproof digital watch with month day year and day of week. I live in the bush and can totally lose track of the days otherwise. I can't stand having anything on my wrist so this lives in my pocket.  I LOVE the idiglo at night. I think this the 3rd of this type Timex I've had. One lasted about 8-9 years, most recent one lasted about  6 I think, so  hope this one does as well. I am very hard on these even in my pocket.  I dont want any other fancy stuff and I can't figure out why a men's watch needs to be as big as a coffee saucer - this is great at a good price and a soft band that works fine as a pocket fob. I like it.
