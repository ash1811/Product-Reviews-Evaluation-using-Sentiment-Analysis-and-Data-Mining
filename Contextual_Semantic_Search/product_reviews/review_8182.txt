There is no question that Seiko has really made some of the most innovative watches of all time. That has shown with their Solar-powered watches, as well as their automatic watches as well. Their Seiko Men's Automatic is definitely a clever designed watch that is easy to strap on, has very bright illumination that glows in the dark briskly, that can even compete with brands like Invicta and Citizen, easy to setup calendar settings for the day and date, with a rotating bezel, to tell time underwater, and with 660 feet water resistant protection, it definitely is a watch that truly is worth their money. While Seiko does make a lot of automatic watches, they definitely don't get the recognition they do deserve, and this one os definitely worth recognizing.Price: BComfort: B+Setup: B 1/2+Overall: B 1/2+
