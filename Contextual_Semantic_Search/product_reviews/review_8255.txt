Ok, now a Rolex is a Rolex. So if you want one you gonna have'ta come up with the cash. If you want to have people think that you own one, then this is the one you want. As for the watch I have to agree with most of the reviews that it looks much better than the picture, and it is heavy. The Chronograph though does not work. I tried it so many times but I never got it to adjust like the manual says. I do have to agree with the reviews before me too about if looks matters with you, then this is it, because the Cronos are worthless. I can't give it a 5 star because it is not fully functional like it claimed, but I just can't get my self to drop it to a 3 star cause it sure feels like a Dytona ;)
