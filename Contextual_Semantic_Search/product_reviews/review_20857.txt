I only had problems with two pair of these jeans where in the stitching came out around the fly button hole. I was able to sew them up again on one pair; but not on the other pair. The other pairs of jeans worked fine. These are thin light weight jeans not soft like the "Seven" (7 of Mankind ) jeans (Cairo) and they are not form fitting like the AG or "Seven" jeans; but for their low cost they are a good buy. They worked fine for me. I liked wearing the lands end and eddie bauer more for their thicker fabric; but the AG and "Seven" jeans fit better and look better; but they cost much more too.
