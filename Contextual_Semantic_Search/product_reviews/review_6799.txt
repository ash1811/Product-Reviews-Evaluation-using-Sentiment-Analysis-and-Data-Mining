I like the colors and the feel of the material.  But I'm disappointed in the gold toe....the toe seam is too thick and rubs my toes.  I've had to turn the socks inside-out to reduce blisters.  My 'older' socks don't have such a fat seam, the seam is more woven into the 'gold' toe.  I've use Gold Toe for years and they usually wear well.  No sure how these will do.
