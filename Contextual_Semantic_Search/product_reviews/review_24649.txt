My first pair of these were bought by my lovely wife for me as a gift.  After two years (being the only foot covering I've worn around the house) of constant wear, they are getting too ratty to go to the store in :)So I had to get a second pair.  Am still using the first pair when out in the garage, etc.  They fit a touch snug for the first week or so, but then conform to your feet, so don't buy them loose!  I wear a 12EEEE (New Balance), and the 12EEE in this slipper works great!BTW - thank God for Amazon, and the 'order history' - it makes repeat buys much easier when you can't read the tag any longer!
