Works as intended changed two links out of my watch very easy and fast.Pros:Since it is plastic where the band lays it leaves no marks and does no damage to the band as some metal tools could do if the person is heavy handed, it also comes with four pins (.85mm)-three extra and one already in tool.  Better throat design- the useful bandwidth is 7/8" whereas cheaper tools have a useful bandwidth of 1/2".Cons :The pin is not the screw in type, but has a flat side notched into it where the set screw goes, the pins are small as is the setscrew so you will need a 1/8" flathead screwdriver to remove set screw, which should have been included for this price.I thought the purpose of this review was to actually "rate" the tool-pros/cons, not to talk about alternative means of removing the pins. Besides if you lack the mechanical ability to use this simple tool it is likely you need to be seeing a qualified jeweler before attempting to use alternative means.
