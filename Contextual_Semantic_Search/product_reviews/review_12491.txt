In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W.  I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered.  This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds.  There seems to be no consistency of sizing, however, between colors or styles, and I have had to try different colors and styles due to "not available" items.  Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug.  So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long, but wide enough.  I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W (no Chambray available in 7 W) and it was waaay too short and very tight.  I don't think a size 8 W would even fit.  This idea of shoes "running small" or "running large" makes no sense to me.  Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it.
