Three reasons why you want a pair of these:1) Comfort!2) Comfort!3) Comfort!These sweats are just perfect for weekend wear.  I put mine on this morning around 10am and...TWELVE HOURS LATER...they are still as comfortable as ever.Pants come with two deep front pockets, drawstring for the waist, elastic leg cuffs to keep the sweats off your shoes/feet, and are made of 100% cotton.The pants are easy to move around in too.  The drawstring keeps the pants on your waist and not sliding down it.Was so happy with this one, I bought a few more -- in different colors.  Highly recommend.
