Theses slippers are warm and comfy. Surprisingly, it took a while to break into them. At first they felt a bit awkward. The base is a bit narrow, which caused my feet to roll. I was tempted to send them back, but after a while I stopped noticing the rolling. Now they feel a big fluffy wool sock, which is great.My only qualm is the sizing. I where a size 11 but I found the 10.5M - 11.5M to be very big. My feet have about an inch and half to spare. It's not a big deal though. It's not like I go for long walks in them.
