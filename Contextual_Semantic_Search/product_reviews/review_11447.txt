I recently developed an umbilical hernia and needed something to hold it in until surgery can be done. First I bought a surgical abdominal binder, which is extremely uncomfortable because it pulls on my stomach hairs. Sorry if that sounds gross.I had seen the waist nipper while shopping lingerie previously, but this time I bought it, and I love it! It holds my hernia even if I have a sudden sneeze or cough without pulling those pesky hairs, and it's easy on, easy off and feels just a bit naughty wearing it all day.
