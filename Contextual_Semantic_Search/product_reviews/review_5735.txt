First, I took the advice of other reviewers on here and ordered a size larger, but that was a bad idea.  They are not super loose, but they are not like my other compression tights.  A size larger than I normally wear and they are like regular sports tights.Second, I would definitely recommend layering them under sweatpants or warm ups if your temps hover at around 0F.  They are warm, but not super warm for that weather.  I'm sure once Spring comes, they'll be fine for running and staying warm in temps around freezing.I appreciate the extra elastic around the ankle.  They don't hike up and they keep the cold air from coming in at my ankles.The only addition I would make is to add a small pocket.  My other compression tights, from another company, have a zippered pocket at the back which is perfect for a house key.
