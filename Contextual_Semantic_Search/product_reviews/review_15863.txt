I have been wearing these hiking socks for years. I first discovered them in a hiking supply store, and they were heartily recommended by the associate as having the proper padding for good hiking. It's true. The structure of these socks is such that there are elastic areas where you need support, and padding where you need shock absorbing properties. They last a long time and they rarely run into holes (unless a mouse gets in your hiking backpack and eats one, which just happened to me on vacation to a remote area! Hey, that sock was my BEST pair!) Seriously, I've never found any socks I like better. And they are rugged.For really difficult hikes, you may want to put a pair of polypro liner socks underneath to wick away sweat and moisture. For regular hiking, I don't bother. I even had these in a pair of waterproof boots and my feet were comfortable all day.
