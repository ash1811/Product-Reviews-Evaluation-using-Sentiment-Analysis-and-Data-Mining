I haven't bought a pair of Levi's since I was in High School, you know, back when the earth was cooling; I shopped carefully at Amazon, went only to Levi's, read all the product descriptions regarding fit and rise, ordered and held my breath. They arrived, I put them on, and they fit like a glove! I'm was so sick of those baggy leg jeans that made me look like an oil drum. These are so comfortable, soft, and so well made, I ordered another pair immediately!
