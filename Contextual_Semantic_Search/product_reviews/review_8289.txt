My uncle had lost his gold watch and had mentioned once of needing a new one that can fit his new daily activities -board room to gym.  I wanted something dressy yet resilient and after reading the reviews on various watches, I thought this was the best style for the dollar. Very elegant looking, holds up great to his little hits and sweat and I just love the two-tone appearance. Its even got him quite a few compliments and people asking him where he got it from.  My boyfriend is now looking to get his hands on one.  Warranty is good and packaged great. Immediate shipping as well.
