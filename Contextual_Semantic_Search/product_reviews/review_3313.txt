I have tried every bra out there from cheap to very expensive.. If you need support and a decent looking bra, this is the bra for you. I am a 50 year old large busted woman who needs support in a bra. I have been professionally fitted and spent $100's of dollars on bras and always kick myself and go back to Bali..After almost 40 years I will not bother with any other bra again. Now I just order a new set of all colors about every 6 months....it can't be beat..
