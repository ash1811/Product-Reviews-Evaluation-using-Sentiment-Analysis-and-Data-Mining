So the arches are really hard and pronounced, and they are not the same on each foot, another reviewer said he had a defective left shoe, well I think I got the matching right side.  I've been trying to stick it out for a week, even directly putting my heel and all my weight on the arch to try and "break it in" but it's not budging and I'm going to end up limping if I try to keep it up. The first day I wore them, it took me a couple of days for my arch to recover, I thought I had just hit it wrong or something.The styling and design of the shoe is great, so it is disappointing that it is not comfortable, I really wanted to like these shoes, I guess I'll see if I can send them back because they are defective.
