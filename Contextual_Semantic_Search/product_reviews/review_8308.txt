I purchased an identical Invicta watch about a year ago and was so satisfied with the look, fit, feel, and appearance I purchased another one as a gift for my son.  The watch keeps excellent time, very quite operation and holds up well in all weather conditions.  If you are looking for a watch that looks great, wears well, keeps good time, and holds up well in all weather conditions this watch fits the the bill.  &#34; Great watch at a great price&#34;  This is my third purchase of an Invicta watch.
