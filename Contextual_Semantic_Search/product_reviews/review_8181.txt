Wow! This a great buy! Super cheap, great quality, great timekeeping and very rugged! I own lots of expesive divers including Breitling and Rolex. I purchased this one for my job as a daily beater, I'm a commercial diver and I have had this watch to 255ft with no problems! I only use automatics and i love this one! people complain about accuracy and that is pure crap! unless you have a timer you will never notice a plus or minus 10 seconds a day! And in my job accuracy is youre life! I hate desk divers!!!! There is only one real negative with this watch, the rubber strap is pure s***! I have seen better straps on wal mart specials! the buckle is pure garbage it broke the first time i cranked it down over a wet suit! it was a easy fix to a better strap though so no sweat! The lume is great, even though i dont care about lume, I always have a light on my helmet anyway so every one talking about how important lume is , is just retarded, you always have lights! This watch does not have hacking seconds or hand winding but again,, you dont need them! Its plenty accurate very legible, the dive bezel is perfect with minute markers all the way around so I can see when its time to decompress and hit the tv lounge!! buy this watch, its great and cheap!!
