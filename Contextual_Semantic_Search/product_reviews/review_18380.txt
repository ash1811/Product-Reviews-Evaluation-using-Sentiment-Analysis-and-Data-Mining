I don't care what it's made of - I wanted something to keep my feet comfortable and warm.  And these do the trick.Great sole for when I run into my garage to get something out of the car, and my favorite part about them is that, unlike my slippers these replaced that had the definite edge to the material around the ankle, these are soft, nothing pressing.  So even when moving my foot around, i don't get anything pushing against the edge of my ankles.
