My husband had his last pair of Tamarac slippers for over 4 years and the exterior is still in good shape, unfortunately the interior is pretty much shot.  I ordered these as a replacement, purchasing the same size as his last pair (which were more a moccassin style).  The new pair look to be of the same great quality but were too uncomfortable.  My husband stated that where the elastic gusset was sewen (check out the photos-you can see an elastic gusset between the side and the tongue of the slipper) rubbed on his foot.Thanks to free return shipping, I'm going to send this pair back.  I just can't decide if I want to try these in the next bigger size (my husband liked the way they hugged his foot which would add warmth and prevent the dreaded slipper slap) or purchase another pair of the moccassin style.  So many slippers, so little time.
