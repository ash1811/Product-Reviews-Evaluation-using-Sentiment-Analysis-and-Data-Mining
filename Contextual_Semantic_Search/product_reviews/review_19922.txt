These are very nice slippers. My last Acorns lasted forever, I hope these will too.  My only complaint is that they've stretched out in the width so I have to wear them with heavy socks to keep them from slipping off. That's ok though, since it's winter and these aren't summer slippers  :-)So far, I'd recommend them since Acorn is the best slipper I've found.
