I've had one of these for a couple of weeks. I wear my watch on the inside of my wrist, and when I used to have a similar watch in a thick metal case the noise of it hitting my desk was distracting. While still thick, the plastic case on this watch eliminates that for the most part. It has the same mechanism as the old watch, and so far has kept perfect time. One other big advantage over the old design is that the hands are so short they don't block the digital display nearly as much as before. But unlike the old watch, only the hands are luminous, and it isn't as readable in poor light without using the illuminator - which is still on the left side of the case, making it a bit awkward to use if it's on the left arm. I have no idea what purpose the bezel serves, but the crystal is recessed inside it, so maybe it's there for protection. It ticks quietly, and has a LOUD alarm. Only big strike against it so far is the factory strap. It looks and feels like canvas, and would probably last forever; but it's ugly and it itched, so I replaced it with a leather strap. Those plastic things that hold the strap to the watch are very tightly fitted, and it was a royal pain to get them off.
