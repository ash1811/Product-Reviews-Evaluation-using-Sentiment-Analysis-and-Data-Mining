As usual my experience with Amazon has been great.  I ordered this belt, to go along with a harness system that I am putting together.  Many operator belts are very expensive.  This belt is very reasonably priced, the buckle is solid, the length is great.  The belt is a little on the light weight side, so it may not work for a duty belt, but it works great as an oeprators belt.  And as usual the buying experience was fantastic.
