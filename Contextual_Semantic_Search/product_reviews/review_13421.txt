With most shoes I fit size 11 just fine but with these the shoe was so small and tight I had to return them. I don't like the fact you have to go up a size and get a wider length, these shoe companies should be smart enough to know an eleven inch foot (heel to toe) should be comfortable in a size 11 shoe.
