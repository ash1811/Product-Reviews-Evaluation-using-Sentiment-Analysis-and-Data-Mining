I've looked for awhile now for everyday long-sleeve tees and most seem either too thin or like the UA charged cotton overly expensive. I finally ordered two of the Russell Athletic in navy and gray and they have everything I want in a long-sleeve t-shirt to wear with jeans. They seem solidly constructed with just the right thickness and most importantly to me wash without needing to iron. I also really like the richness of the navy blue.This t-shirt does run a little on the large side. I had to shrink mine down and then both of my shirts fit just right- ordered large and normally run between medium and large. These shirts have a nice look and seem a cut above anything else you will find in this price range. I gladly recommend this shirt to others and have already ordered a couple more.
