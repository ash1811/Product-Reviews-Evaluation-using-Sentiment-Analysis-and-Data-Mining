I was looking for a good sports bra with a lot of coverage and support.  Being a DD I know it was asking a lot.  The Lily of France bra looked like it was just what I was looking for.  It is a nice heavy cotton (don't like the thin poly covering), padded straps and didn't even mind the underwire.  But when I tried it on it fit more like a push up bra and didn't cover me.  So may be ok if you are an A or B cup, but not a larger endowed cup.
