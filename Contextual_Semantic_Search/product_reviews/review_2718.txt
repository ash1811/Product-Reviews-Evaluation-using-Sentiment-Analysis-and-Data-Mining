I just received this watch a few moments ago, I ordered it as a Christmas gift for my husband. When I opened the box, WOW!.. Of course  I fell in love with it online that's why I ordered it but setting my eyes on it...it is much nicer looking in reality than the picture. The picture doesn't do justice to this watch, why..The outside beveled edge is so much prominent that once you set your eyes to it, that's what gets your attention! Then the watch face (with the numbers) is like sitting in the well  of the beveled ring. The face color is very nice beige, the band is great; not the smooth leather but the kind of calfskin that gives it its unique character.  I love it, I love it and I'm very sure the recipient will love it too! Where the band is connected to the watch, it is kind of raised/curved some; in other words those who like the watch to lay flat on a surface this may not be the case. It is also a little heavy if you are looking for light weight! It was delivered just in time! For those who share the same taste... You will love it!P.S. The recipient loved his gift. He took time to tinker around trying to set the date right, and finally got it. Next step is to set the alarm. He said he hasn't got around to that but will. Nice watch, great buy! Its for keeps!
