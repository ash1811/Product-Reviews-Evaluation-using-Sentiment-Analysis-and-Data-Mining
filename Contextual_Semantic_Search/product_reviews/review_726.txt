Very nice bra, but the material is a bit stiff, which keeps the girls where they're supposed to be, though. It'll give a pointy shape, which is not very flattering with regular t-shirts, but will add some lift with "flowy" tops.BE AWARE: even though it says that this item qualifies for free returns, you will have to pay for the shipping costs if you want to return this bra!!! Amazon customer rep told me it's because the product is not sold/fulfilled by Amazon itself, but by a 3rd party. It puzzles me why Amazon mentions free returns on the product page when it doesn't apply  to that specific product. On a product that doesn't cost much, having to pay for return shipping is quite a waste.
