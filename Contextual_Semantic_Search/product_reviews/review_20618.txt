I needed a basic, inexpensive aqua shoe that was reliable.  I need this for the pool, beach and snorkeling excurions in the Caribbean.  While I haven't &#34;tested&#34; them out in these locations, I have tried them on and they are comfortable and fit great.  Please note that my foot is a 9.5 and the 10 fits me JUST right so if you are a half size, go a size UP.
