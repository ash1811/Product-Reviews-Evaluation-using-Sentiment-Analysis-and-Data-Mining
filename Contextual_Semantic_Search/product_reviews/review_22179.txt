Bought this bra previously and have liked it because it is made of cotton which is great in the summer, as well because I live in a warm climate.  I really dislike bras made out of poly type fabrics because they don't breathe and I sweat to death in them.  This bra is smooth, and great under any garments like T-shirts or dress wear.  Comfortable and cool.  The sizing is right.
