These are quite a bit larger than expected, even after consulting sizing charts. They do still work, as I'm just looking for shorts to wear around the house, but I feel that the crotch is really low on these, and they feel really loose all around (except at the waist). In general, though, it isn't a bad thing, at least not in my case. But good to be aware of. (and might be good to knock it down a size)
