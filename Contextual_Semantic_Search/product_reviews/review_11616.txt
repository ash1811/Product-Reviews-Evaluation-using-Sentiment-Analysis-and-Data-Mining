Great at first but after washing the elastic in the waist shrinks so bad! I wish they would fix this as the underwear itself is nice and soft and has a little extra padding up front for accidents, what a shame that the waist shrinks up so bad like that after being washed and only on a warm setting too, has these a few months now and disappointing.
