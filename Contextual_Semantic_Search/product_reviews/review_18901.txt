I always purchase this watch, which last me about 3 years before the band break off from constant daily use. I even used this when I deployed to Afghanistan it worked amazingly. It never failed me. The only thing that breaks this watch it the wear and tear of everyday use. This watch has my full recommendation. By the way, this watch is not a fancy watch. This watch is just for an everyday active use. It also a great training watch even though it doesn't have all the bells and whistles like the other watches out there in the market.
