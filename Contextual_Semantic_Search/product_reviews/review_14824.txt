Bought a plain tee in XXL and it fit great. This one with the Henley buttons seems to run a bit larger all round. Tempted to try an XL but it will probably be too small. Washed it, in this case hoping it would shrink but it didn't, which is usually a good thing. Could try super-hot water as it's going to goodwill anyway if I can't make it work.
