These studs are very tiny.  I bought them to go in my second set of holes and on one side I was able to pull the earring too far and it disappeared. I couldn't get it to come out the back so I'm not afraid of losing them.  I immediately replaced the back that came on them with clear rubber plastic ones because the original backs were so hard to get off.  Within minutes they made my ears start itching, but I used some rubbing alcohol and they are fine now.  They say sterling silver, but I think they are just plated not solid sterling silver, so don't expect them to last.  For now they look cut though.
