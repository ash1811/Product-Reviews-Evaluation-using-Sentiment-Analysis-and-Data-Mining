This is the watch I just recently replaced.  I purchased it elsewhere, but I figured I should write a review.When I first received the watch, I absolutely loved it.  Appearance was excellent, craftsmanship appeared solid, nothing was out of place-- I was feeling pretty good about my purchase!  I wore it all the time.  Well, it appears I got a bad one.  The water resistance on mine was nonexistent.  I was washing lettuce of all things, dunked my hands in the water, and that was pretty much the end.  A little water got inside, I figured I could just lay it in a bag of rice and let it dry out--nope.  It dried, and it died.  The watch was under warranty, but they required $28 for return shipping, after I pay to ship the watch to them in the first place.  That's approaching 42 dollars from where I'm located.  For a watch that's under 50 dollars in the first place, I'd rather not go weeks without a watch to save a few dollars resurrecting a watch that I'd be afraid to ever get wet again.  After reading some of these reviews of the horror stories of sending it in, I do believe I dodged a bullet.Anyway, I went with a different brand this time.  I don't know much about the Invicta brand, but after that little fiasco, I'll try someone else.
