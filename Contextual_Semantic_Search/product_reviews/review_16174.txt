These were my go-to thermals last winter for the really, really cold days when I worked outside at a ski resort in Colorado. These fit snugly and didn't restrict movement. Solid construction-- no holes from wear in the typical spots so far. Stitching looks really solid so I'm not surprised they've held up so well. For the price, I don't know where you could find a warmer pair of thermals. Very satisfied!
