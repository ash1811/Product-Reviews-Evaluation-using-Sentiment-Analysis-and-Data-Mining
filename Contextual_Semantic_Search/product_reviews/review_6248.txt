I purchased three different belt for work when purchasing this one, thinking I would send back any non contenders, however I decided to keep this one for when I dress up . The belt is smaller in width then what I am use to which is nice because it gives it a more stylish look. I wear a size 38 and this belt leaves just enough to tuck the buckle to the belt with little excess once fastened. The buckle and metal end are finished nicely with no rough ends. The slid clasp works well with no catching when I release it. It is a bit stiff which is common for these style of belts until broke in.
