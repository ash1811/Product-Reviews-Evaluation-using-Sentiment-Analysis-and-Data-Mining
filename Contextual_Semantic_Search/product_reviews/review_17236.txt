Bought a pair for my hubby. His comment as follow: very comfortable and looks good. Doesn't really shine but it already look good. Been wearing for almost 2yr now and still good. Insole gel initially feel funny but is actually very good. Gel hasn't split as mentioned by other reviewer. Doesn't leave mark. All in all, good everyday shoes. Recommended.
