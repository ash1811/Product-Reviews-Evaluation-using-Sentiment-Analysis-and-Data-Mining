Great pair of sandals. The arch supports work great as I have fallen arches. They fit to size. They do require some breaking in though. The first time I put them on I went for a long walk and ended up rubbing a soar into the bottom of my foot. They also tend to squeek when I walk from my foot rubbing against the flip flop. I'd buy another pair.
