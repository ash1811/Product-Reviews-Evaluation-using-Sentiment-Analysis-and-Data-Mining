A first class watch which, as one would expect from Invicta, keeps impeccable time. The watch arrived in the UK. promptly and without any fuss.- well wrapped and in pristine condition. This is a heavy watch which I personally find reassuring. To this buyer it feels &#34;right&#34;.Highly recommended - especially at this price !!!!!!
