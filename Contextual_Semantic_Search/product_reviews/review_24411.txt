I have been an avid fan of REEF flip flops for YEARS because of their excellent construction, great arch support and phenominal comfort. What other flip flop can you wear all day and not have tired/hurting feet, legs and back? I will always buy any REEF flip flop over any other brand ~ no matter the cost since they last forever!
