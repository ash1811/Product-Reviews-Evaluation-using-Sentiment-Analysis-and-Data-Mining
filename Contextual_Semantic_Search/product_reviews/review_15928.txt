Socks are a great material, comfortable, and do help when you are doing a considerable amount of walking.  But the few pairs I ordered don't have very tight elastic at the top, essentially starting them down the path of &#34;quitters&#34; way too early.  Will wear them for the time being, but probably won't replace with the same ones if the fall down on the job.
