They are very pretty. I have another pair in black that I've had for awhile. They hold up very well and are very comfortable. One of the reasons I'm such a fan of this style is because of the straps. So unique. I'd recommend these to any one. The sizing is true as well. It gives you a little room to surround your foot so it's not slipping off the sides.
