I ordered this bra in a medium since I am somewhere in between a 34/36 C and it fits perfectly. It doesn't fall down for me throughout the day. The only thing I found a bit bothersome about the bra were the little cups. They seem to sometimes slide around inside the bra and it can be annoying. It comes with straps, which seemed to me at first to be a bit too short but they were actually perfect.
