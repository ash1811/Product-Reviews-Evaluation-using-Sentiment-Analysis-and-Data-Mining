I bought these shirts when I could not find the colors I wanted from the Russell Pro Cotton line.They are nearly identical to Russell, but seem to be a bit coarser in texture and cut a little tighter than the Russell.I think washing them a few times will speed up the softening. Otherwise, a decent product. I will probably be ordering more, soon.
