The silver on these is not a woven Celtic silver knot. The silver is die cut, thin, almost foil thin. The silver is poorly worked to make it look as though it is a knot, but there are many rough spots. the welding of the know to the stone setting is uneven.  And caution, because it doesn't jump out at you from the product description, the stones are synthetic.The metal is stamped 925 (for sterling, but the workmanship is so bad I question whether this stamp is accurate). The ear wires are also stamped 925.Product is labeled "Made in Thailand."
