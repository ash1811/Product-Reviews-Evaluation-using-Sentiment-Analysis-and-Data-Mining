love the Minnetonka classic fringe bootie accidentally picked the wrong size but just changed to my right size and everything's okay they're so cute you can wear them with dresses shorts skirts skinny jeans basically whatever you want they will look good so grab you a pair  you won't be disappointed very comfortable true to size. I bought the black.
