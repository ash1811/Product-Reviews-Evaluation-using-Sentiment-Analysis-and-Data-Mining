I purchased this watch about 3 weeks ago at a major chain membership store (for about forty bucks under retail).  I LOVE it.  The watch is very thin and does not get caught on sleeves or other clothing.  I have received about ten compliments on it in the short time I have owned it.  The face of the watch is a "brushed stainless" look and the band is both brushed and polished steel.  The dial markers are tiny tiny crystals (but do not look tacky in the slightest).  This is a very simple design for people who like the basics.  The watch has a very nice quality and I think will hold up for a long time.  The only thing I wish it had was a date indicator-but overall, this watch is a beautiful piece.
