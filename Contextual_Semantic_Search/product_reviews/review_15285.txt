I'm completely satisfied with this purchase. A tip o' the hat and a sincere thank you for the helpful advice from others on selecting the proper size boot. I wear a size 9 1/2 medium dress shoe at work and bought these boots to protect my shoes from the elements between home and office. I bought the Tingley size "XL" and my shoes slip easily into and out of the boots. Not looking forward to monsoon season, but now at least my feet will be dry and I won't have to struggle putting my boots on or taking them off.
