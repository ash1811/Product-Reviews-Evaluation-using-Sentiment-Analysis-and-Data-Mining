Don't buy these. Unless you can pick them up for $5, they are just likely to be one of those gotcha buys that will haunt your nightmares for years to come.I bought several pairs of these two years ago. They appeared to be part of a product line that had some excellent hoodies which I had purchased initially. I've regretted these sweatpants ever since and have just ended up hiding them under one of the various and sundry heaps in my closet.The worst thing about these pants is the fabric. It is thin, it is SO thin that I can feel even slight breezes coming through the legs. The fleece on the inside of each leg does nothing to help with this or to give the pants a more luxurious feel. When I put these on, the fabric alone screams, "Cheap!" at me.But that's not all. The legs are cut too long in proportion to the waistline. This wouldn't be a problem if the result was just a fashionably baggy appearance. However, in both of my pairs of pants, the elastic in the bottoms is weaker than a 10 yo rubber band. As a result, the bottoms are constantly dragging on the floor and getting in the way of my feet. I finally got the clips that cyclists use for their cuffs. This helps a little but is also unnecessarily inconvenient.Last, I have not found the drawstring to be terribly useful. Rather than ending in two strings that I can securely knot, the drawstring is just one continuous loop that is much more difficult to secure. This is perhaps the most minor of the problems, since I can always just cut the drawstring in half. I've been reluctant to do that, though, because this is often just a recipe for losing the string altogether.Companies often modify their styles in the course of different production runs. Possibly the problems I've noted have been corrected. However, this purchase has left me feeling sufficiently burned that I am not likely to make a return to the scene of the crime to try my luck yet again.
