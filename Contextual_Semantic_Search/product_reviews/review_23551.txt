These are nice-looking shoes.  I got the 8 C/D.  I couldn't quite say that it fit a bit large, but it is a little roomy in the heel area.  The rest is all perfect.  I was nervous about buying shoes online, so I'm pretty relieved.  As another reviewer said, these are not made for hard-core walkers, just everyday here and there walking.  They're very light-weight, and the heel isn't real high.
