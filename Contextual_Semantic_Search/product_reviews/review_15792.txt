These socks aren't TOO thick but they do have moderate padding/cushion.  When you wear them, you notice a difference not only with regard to the padding all day but it'll put you in a better mood.  I went back to regular socks after wearing these and the bottoms of my feet were burning (new pair of shoes) so i am totally spoiled now.  I'm trying a few other brands to find the very best, but TRUST me, get yourself some high-quality, cushioned socks and you will kick yourself in the butt for not doing it earlier--it makes a true difference in your life!  Some lady once said something like, "You better have a comfy bed and comfy shoes, cuz when you aren't in one, you're in the other," but she should have said socks.  You'll never go back to six-packs of cotton bleh socks.EDIT: 4 years later and the socks are still holding strong except I've had to sew the toe area twice (guess my toenails were cutting through)--upgraded to 5 stars.  The way they lightly hug your foot and leg is just nice.  I recently ordered some Carhart thick socks and some Wigwams and neither one was as comfortable as these, and time will tell if they are as tough.  They feel coarse compared to these.  I'm also able to wear them in summer because although they are thicker, they are breathable.
