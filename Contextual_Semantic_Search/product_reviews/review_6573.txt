I like that the boot feels supportive and firm.  I didn't find it to run small as some reviews posted.  I take an 8 in UGGs and the 8 in Bearpaw feels perfect.  I chose the Pom Berry color which is the pinkish-purple color.  It looked a little more purple-y in the pic than in person, but it's a beautiful color and a beautiful boot.  I'm going to wear these as proudly as any of my UGGs for less than half the price but still has the same quality of the UGG. I'm super happy with these! &#60;3
