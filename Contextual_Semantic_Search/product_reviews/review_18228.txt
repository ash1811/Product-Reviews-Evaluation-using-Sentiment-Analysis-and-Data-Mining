My husband loves these slippers. The first pair that I bought home he likes as well but they were whole slipper shoes as oppose to these being slippers. He likes that he can just stick his feet in them and go outside. He wears them with and without socks. He says they fit good either way. They are true to size and the fur lining is very warm and soft.
