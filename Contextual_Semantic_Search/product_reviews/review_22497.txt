This is really a beautiful watch. It doesn't look like a piece of jewelry, it looks like a nice watch. I like that. It was a bit tricky figuring out the proper way to set the day and I am a bit nervous for the month change because I'll have to break out the instructions. I think that the numerals and the hands glow in the dark, that was a nice surprise.
