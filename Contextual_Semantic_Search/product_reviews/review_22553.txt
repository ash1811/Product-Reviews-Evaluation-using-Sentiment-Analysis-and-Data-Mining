I bought this for my husband for his birthday, and he loves it. He has a slimmer wrist, and all the watches I looked at were so BIG that I didn't even try them. Then I found this one and it is a great size, both in diameter and thickness. It's very good looking - can be worn for both dress-up and casual.  I highly recommend, especially if you want a watch that is smaller in size.
