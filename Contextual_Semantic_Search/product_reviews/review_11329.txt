This bag has extra room for more books.  I tell the kids to manage their papers and books, but they don't really listen.  Their locker is also in bad position for them to navigate from locker to classrooms.  This bag has multiple, probably half of them useless, pockets.  Strap is cushioned.  Stitching is standard, no reinforcement.  I just wish the bag bottoms were reinforced.  These bags last about a year, but they all start getting holes.
