I got this cincher for my holiday party dress, but it was awful. My boyfriend didn't like it at all. It cinched me in, but it was too long for my torso and added an extra &#34;curve&#34; where it ended. I didn't look like a better version of myself at all. I ended up not wearing it under the dress and just returned it.I also ordered the Fleece cincher based on reviews some people liked this one better and others that one. Similar issue there. I returned them both.
