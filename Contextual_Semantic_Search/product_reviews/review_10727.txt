I ordered a black shaper tank from self expressions in a med (from amazon) and it was less expensive than THIS one.  It fits perfects..no see through, flawless, no need to wear a bra.  They didn't have white available in self expressions,  so I tried this, expecting better quality than the cheaper black one? nope. A med was to large..the material that is supposed to smooth your tummy at the bottom is actually quite see through.  If this does not bother you, atleast order a size down for extra smoothing.  Also the top is completely see through so a bra must be worn.  Defeats the purpose for a shaper. I returned and hope for white to come along from other seller
