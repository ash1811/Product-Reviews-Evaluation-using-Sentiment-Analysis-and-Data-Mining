I already know that I love this product!  This is the third pair of these sandals that I have purchased through Amazon.com.  The shoes fit perfectly (I have a narrow heel and wide instep), comes in several great colors and is washable!!! What's not to love, except the price?!  Fortunately, by going through Amazon.com, I've been able to save about $20 off of retail.  Still expensive, but worth it.
