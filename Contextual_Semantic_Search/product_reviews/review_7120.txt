These are without doubt the worse socks I ever purchased.  I've worn these for years but the ones i received the last 2 or 3 times are terrible. They don't even make it through one washing and the material washes out of the sock and you can see flesh.  Might as well wear them new without washing so you get at least one wearing before you have to throw them away.  I heard the same from other reviews so had to reinforce the other low reviews.Gold Toe Boys 8-20 6 Pack Sport Quarter Sock
