I'd send it back but that is too much bother.  The stitching is awful.  It is just a single very thin thread stitched around the border.  It is loose in several spots even before I have used it.It also still looks like a man purse even though it is canvas with black metal fittings.  probably because it flares at the bottom.So if you want a canvas man purse that is badly stitched...look no further.
