While the jeans I got fit well and were comfortable, I was disappointed that the material was so thin.  i have some older 501's that are still hanging in there because the material was thicker and more substantial.  I think Levi's marking just thinks of copying the competition and not the traditional Levi buyer will keep their market share.... Sorry to say I will now look at other jeans makers and just think of Levi's as another lower option.
