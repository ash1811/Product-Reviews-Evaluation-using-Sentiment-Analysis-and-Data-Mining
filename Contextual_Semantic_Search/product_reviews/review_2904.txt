Wow! My new Keen Venice H2s JUST arrived.  I had to go write a review right away, because I was stunned at the amazing comfort...right out of the box!! I'm normally a flip-flop girl but will be doing a bit of hiking on vacation and needed something that could support my bad feet better.  If I can't wear a flip-flop, these are the way to go!
