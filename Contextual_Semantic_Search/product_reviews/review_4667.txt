Jeans that fit well and actually sit AT the natural waist, these are them. So many of the recognizable brands of jeans makers out there are producing product that sit below the natural waist. And I think we all know what that translates to when one sits, bends or crouches. Frankly, I don't want to see that, and I don't think others do either. Thank you Carhartt for recognizing this.The B18 Trad-fit jean fits comfortably. They have the right amount of room in all the places one needs the right amount of room without the baggy-ness. These are REAL jeans, not those single stitch, thin denim things sold by the people with sail boats on their catalog covers.  Made of nice, sturdy denim with solid construction, these will hold up well on the work-site. And, if you're a casual social event type, their quality construction and good looks pair well with a shirt and sports coat.Nice jeans that can both work and play.
