I JUST ORDERED 5 OF THESE FOR WORK AND THEYRE REALLY NICE...ONE NOTE..GET THE NEXT SIZE SMALLER!!!!  IM A BIG GUY AND NORMALLY WEAR A 2X FOR COMFORT AND FREEDOM,BUT A XL IS THE PERFECT SIZE FOR ME.I BOUGHT 1 XL AND 1 2XL BEFORE DECIDING WHAT SIZE TO GET AND THE 2XL WAS WAYYYY BIG.THE XL IS PERFECT AND ITS LONG SO YOU WONT GET THAT "PLUMBERS CRACK" WHEN WORKING.ACCORDING TO A TON OF REVIEWS THESE WONT SHRINK EITHER SO IT LOOKS LIKE I HAVE WORK SHIRTS FOR A LONG TIME...ALTHOUGH I WISH THESE WERE MADE IN U.S.A,THEYRE MADE IN HONDURAS WHICH IS BETTER THAN CHINA ANYDAY****UPDATE 3/23/13**** AFTER OWNING THESE SHIRTS FOR 2 WEEKS I DEFINATELY LOVE THEM,BUT MY ADVICE TO GET A SMALLER SIZE WAS A BIT TOO EARLY..I WASHED THESE AND DRIED THEM IN THE DRYER AND THEY DEFINATELY SHRUNK.OTHER REVIEWS CLAIMED THEY "WOULD NOT SHRINK",BUT MINE ALL HAVE..THE 2 XL THAT WAS WAYYY TOO BIG BEFORE IS NOW THE PERFECT SIZE AND THE XL STILL FIT,BUT ARENT AS ROOMY...I APPOLOGISE TO ANYONE WHO BOUGHT THESE BASED ON MY REVIEW,BUT THEYRE STILL GREAT SHIRTS
