This belt has performed without fail.  It's plenty long for even the largest wait sizes (I am a 38 waist and had to cut off over a foot of extra material and use a lighter to melt the edges to keep from unraveling) but I'd rather have extra material than not enough.  The buckle holds strong and is fast to adjust.  So far it fits all of my outdoor wear such as BDUs and my Craghoppers so I am pleased.  Can't beat the price, either.This belt was a little stiff coming out of the packaging, but after just one wear it softened up and now rolls up nicely with no bends.  The more I use it, the more it breaks in but still stays rigid enough to not curl up in the belt loops.  Great belt!
