I pick these up any time I see them on sale.  I'm slowly getting rid of my old cotton boxer briefs and replacing them with these.  The comfort is great, they dry quickly, and the &#34;smells&#34; are lowered.  The only boxer briefs I have that are better is a pair of merino wool one's, but their cost is quite a bit higher.
