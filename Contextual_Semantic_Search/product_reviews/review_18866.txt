I wouldn't normally buy anything with a bright yellow logo on it -- I prefer plain black.  But once I saw these, and how well-made they were, I bought instantly.  As others say, they seem a half-size too large, so if you wear, say, a 12.5, buy the 12 and not the 13.  Pretty much the finest boots I've ever worn -- and they look to last for years.
