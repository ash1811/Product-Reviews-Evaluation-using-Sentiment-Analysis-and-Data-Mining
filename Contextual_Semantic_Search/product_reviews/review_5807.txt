I have a very friendly hummingbird that frequents my feeders, hovers above my head and even eats out of my hand from a small test tube feeder. He is attracted to this color (as opposed to a basic red or pink) and always buzzes by me when I wear this shirt.The shirt is made well, but the material is thin compared to older shirts I've owned from FOTL and Hanes. Not really a big deal to me because I only wear this when I am &#34;playing&#34; with the hummingbird.I purchased in XL and it fit snug. With most tees I am too big for a large and too small for an XL.1/2 star taken away for the snug fit and 1/2 star taken away for the thin material.I wish it had a pocket. I would purchase again.
