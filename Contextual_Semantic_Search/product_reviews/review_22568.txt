This watch has a solid feel without being clunky. It is large without being oversize, and doesn't have those ridiculous knobs and bells and whistles that &#34;prestige&#34; men's watches often feature. The band is sturdy. In the 48 hours I have had it, it has kept time accurate to the second. So far, so good!
