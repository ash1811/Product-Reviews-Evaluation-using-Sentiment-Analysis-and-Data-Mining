No kidding on the title. These Kangol hats are the type of hat that if you get used to wearing, you will feel naked without. I also bought a 507 model and have a review of it on here too. The main thing to know is I bought this 504 in a XXL because I wear a 7 3/4 baseball cap, but it's a bit big on me. I bought the XL in the 507 and it fit much better.I liked the 507 a little better overall, but I'm still going to get a couple of these 504s too, in XL size. The quality is nice, the material feels durable and they really do go with nearly any outfit. Recommended the most for balding men or bald men, especially head shavers like myself. It feels like a nice, stylish, yet subtle way to keep our heads from sunburn. It also takes away the frustration of trying to buy a baseball cap these days, not knowing whether to order a flat brim and trying to bend it or going with a low crown, pre-bent. I also think I've found the perfect gifts for my bald uncles and grandpa.
