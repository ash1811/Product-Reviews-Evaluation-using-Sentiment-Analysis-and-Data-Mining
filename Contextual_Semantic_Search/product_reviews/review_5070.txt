I was hesitant to purchase these because of the price until I saw all of the reviews.  What made me look for these in the first place was when I noticed my husband's underwear had several holes and when I asked why he wasn't throwing them out he said he liked to wear them while working on the yard b/c he sweats so much and it helps to have the ventilation!  So I found these and decided to give them a try.  He loves them, and asked for more.  He sweats a lot and they keep him from getting chafed and chapped.  They wash well and are dry in just a few minutes so I don't have to put the in the dryer.  Great product!
