I originally bought these tights to wear with a Halloween costume since I figured I could get away with shimmery legs then.  These aren't glittery or obnoxious with shimmer, they just give you gleaming, sexy legs!  Seriously, they looked better than I could have ever imagined!  I ordered the toast, which is a pretty deep tan color.  I was a little worried they would be too dark because I'm fairly pale but I go tanning.  They ended up being the perfect color, but I may need the light toast for winter.  I think you could get away with these during the day as well, so I'm ordering more colors!
