Hm... I just wrote a review, but I'm being prompted to write another.  Oh well, my headline says it all.  My only disappointment is that these jeans jumped $10 since I ordered them previously (a few months ago).  I don't know who to blame for that, but I'm still very happy with my jeans.  I recommend them highly.
