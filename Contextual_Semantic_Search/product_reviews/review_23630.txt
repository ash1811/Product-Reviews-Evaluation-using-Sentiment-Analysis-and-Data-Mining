I just got one of these, and I'll tell you, it is absolutely the coolest bag ever! I prefer the "backpack" style so that I can be hands free without some bag swinging around. The regular backpacks, unless you put both arms in the arm slings, constantly fall forward. But this bag stays back on your back like it should. Also, ever had problems digging down to the bottom of your bag for items under "heaps" of other junk in the way? This resolves that issue, because, not only does the double zipper go down the length of the bag, but there are handy pockets all up and down on both sides to hold things in place. It also has two clips for holding your keys or other items. And I still have room for a book or two. This is too cool for words, I love it!
