I ordered the navy backpack and can say that it looks nothing like the picture, to me the pictured navy backpack is simply blue. I can confirm that the backpack is actually a navy color if anyone was curious. Now onto the backpack, it is simply great for what I bought it for, carry my binder and books and still have room for other stuff. Straps could be beefed up a bit but its still a great backpack for school.
