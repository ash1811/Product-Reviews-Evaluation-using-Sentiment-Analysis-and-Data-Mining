Could easily become one of my favorite fall lounge-around shirts.  Comfortable neck line and sleeve length . . . . and it's cotton.  I have gotten to where I will not wear the blends as they are just not as comfortable.  They may wear longer, but I prefer the softness and sweat absorption qualities over the durability of the blends.
