It's a fine watch, but don't rely too much on the "water resistant" label.  I've had similar Timex watches that had no trouble with leakage from being worn while swimming or kayaking.  But as chance would have it, I got one that leaked (badly) from being worn in the water.  (No button pushes under water or any other action that would have increased chance of leakage; it just leaked.)Too late to return to Amazon, and Timex warranty coverage for this sort of thing isn't clear.  (Besides, shipping both ways would probably come up to half the cost of replacing with a new watch.)Too bad, it's otherwise a watch with a great feature set, maintains accuracy reasonably well, etc.
