As others have said, there is nothing &#34;heavyweight&#34; about this tee. Very light weight and that will work for me.I'm usually a true XL(sometimes even a L) but order t-shirts a size larger because I hate a tight t-shirt. This fits as a full XXL. It will be a great knock around the house shirt. It may make it to the gym but not out in public. Too much like an undershirt to wear out for a coffee run.
