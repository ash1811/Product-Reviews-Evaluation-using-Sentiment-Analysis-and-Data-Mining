The GOOD about this watch is that it looks great and works perfectly. The BAD about this watch is that you must be VERY careful when buying a Skagen watch in the sense that SOME Skagen watch batteries can be replaced by the user and some can NOT. I tried replacing the battery on my old Skagen watch and broke the watch trying to open the back of the watch. I then found out that you have to send the watch back to Skagen to have the battery changed. YOU pay all the shipping both ways AND a hefty price for the battery and replacement. The back of this model appears to have a small tab where you can fit a tool to pop it off and replace the battery. Other models do not. The UGLY about this watch is that you had better pray that it is working when you get it, or doesn't go bad on you too quickly. The warranty is useless because the shipping both ways is too costly compared to the price of the watch.Almost all watches today keep perfect time. Buy this watch only if you like how it looks. For the price, I'll take my chances.
