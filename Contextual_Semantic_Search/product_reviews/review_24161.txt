Boots are Very High Quality...they deserve 5 stars.....this based on my own examination...I did not use them because the Post Office  basically sliced the package in handling, so they arrived unusable, but to be fair ..these boots look extremely well made. The seller took care of me but I thought these boots still deserved a review.
