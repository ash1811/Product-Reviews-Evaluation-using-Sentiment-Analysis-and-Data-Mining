I purchased this at a local store.  I am 67" and approx 165 lbs.  My waist is approx 33-35 in.  Well, I wanted something to slim my tummy whenever I feel "puffy".  I have tried soo many other products, and this too will end up at the top of my closet.So, here's the thing:  I cannot wear it under a form fitting shirt, all the hooks, rods, etc, show thru. It holds tight to the top and bottom, but that mid (most important) section, bulges right thru.  And to add a reason that makes most shapewear suck, is the fact that I am STUCK with it.  You cannot (and should not) return under garments.  So, for anyone who is undecided, I realize the 5-Star ratings seem promising, but I strongly suggest you try something else.  If nothing else, go to a local store because it would REALLY suck if you pay S&H; to have this disappointment DELIVERED!
