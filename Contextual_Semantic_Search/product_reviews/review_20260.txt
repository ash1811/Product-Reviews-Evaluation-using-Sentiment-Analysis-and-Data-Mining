I wear white shirts to work as part of my uniform.  I like many people like easy care so I use alot of the golf shirts.  I like sleeves that are a little longer and this one is just right.  It's a good fit, washes well and a great price, but does need a bit of ironing.  Other wise I would give it 5 stars.
