I have at least 6-7 Lunaire bras in my lingerie drawer. I love how they fit me. I'm a "C" cup and I prefer underwire but I hate it when the wire pokes me in the under arm area. I never have that problem with this bra brand. It always fits me perfectly and it's comfortable to me as well.I love the looks of this bra. It's GORGEOUS and it looks great on. I must admit, it's not the sort of bra you'd wear under t-shirts and it's not for exercising in. For me, for every day activities, there's plenty of support in the bra however if you're bigger than a DD then this might not be the bra for you in terms of support. I have a friend who is a DDD (I think) and she bought one of these after seeing mine but thought there wasn't quite as much support as she preferred so just something to think about.I find I get best results when I wash this bra by hand and hang it to dry but I've put them in a bra washing pocket thing and thrown them in the washer on a gentle load and it came through fine but I think that probably wears on them a bit more than hand washing.I think the price is mostly fair for these bras and I'll probably be buying more in the future.
