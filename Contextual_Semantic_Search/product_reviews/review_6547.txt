I love these boots!  They look just like Uggs Bailey Button boots but are literally 1/4 of the price!  They feel like slippers.  I recommend them for anyone of any age, particularly if they love the look of Uggs.  The one drawback is the tread.  There's not a lot of tread on the bottom for slippery conditions so I can only wear these boots when it's not slippery.
