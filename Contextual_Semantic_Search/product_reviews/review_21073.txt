For your reference, I am 5'2&#34; 128lbs and I normally wear a 34e cup bra.I purchased this swim suit for swim training and it fits perfectly. It does give me a uniboob look but it doesn't matter since I am not concerned about fashion during training. The cut on the leg was exactly where it should be and the straps are the correct length. Very happy with the purchase.
