I've been doing ballet-style workout DVDs at home lately, and wanted a pair of ballet shoes to use for those workouts so that I'd have better grip and support.  I can't speak to how well these work for ballet classes, but I thought that my review might help others like me who are buying these for the same reason.Based on some reviews, I ended up ordering these at first one size larger than what I usually wear in my street shoes.  The 8.5 that I bought (instead of my usual 7.5) were huge, but (thanks, Amazon, for your great return policy), I returned these and ordered a 7.5, which fit perfectly.The ribbon at the front of the shoe can be pulled tight to adjust the width of them, and they are very comfortable.  They don't have a split sole on the bottom; instead, the sole is one long piece that stretches down the length of the shoe.If you're looking for some at-home ballet-style workouts, I also recommend Mary Helen Bowers'Ballet Beautiful: Total Body WorkoutandBallet Beautiful: Body Blastand Leah Sarago's four workouts, especially her newest oneBallet Body Signature Series: Total Body.  All of these are a lot of fun to do, and make me feel like a ballerina!
