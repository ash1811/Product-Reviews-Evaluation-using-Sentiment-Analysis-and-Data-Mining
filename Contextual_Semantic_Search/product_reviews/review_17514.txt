We just got back from an Alaskan cruise and I used these shoes a lot on board. I took them because they did not take up a lot of room and thought they would be good to use just to walk around ship.  Boy, was I ever right about them. And they looked good with my dressy pants or my jeans.  I highly recommend them and suggest you buy them through Amazon because I paid about a 1/3 of their retail price here.
