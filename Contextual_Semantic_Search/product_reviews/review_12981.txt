It has all the required rivets and seems to be of LEVI quality so I hope LEVI makes a whole lot of money shipping American jobs south of the "border".  These jeans were made in EGYPT.  The wealth of this country is evaporating and we are defending the free world by borrowing money from OPEC.  Something has got to give and I say, screw the world, bring home our Navy and all our Marines, Army, Air Force and Coast Guard personnel back to the states.  I have no doubt the world will then go to hell.  A lot of NATO and American blood has been shed in Afghanistan and now the Chinese are going in to buy up all the mineral rights.  Something really stinks about this turn of events.
