I had a pair of these many moons ago when they were made in the USA.  They are made in the Dominican Republic now but I can't tell the difference.  The quality of leather and workmanship are the same.  I ordered a 1/2 size larger than I normally take as I will wear them mostly with cotton socks outside of the house.  They fit perfect.  A little loose when I wear them sock-less which is just fine.  The best double soled unlined hand sewn moccasins for the money anywhere.
