I wanted a small, but reasonable size wallet to fit in my tiny purse, and came across this in Amazon and knew I had to give it a try. The price and quality makes sense. The pink one looks very classy, although a ltitle bulky, but can't complain...There's many credit card/card compartments and 2 sections where you can put your bills in (I'd say one is more than enough, but it's there).Overall, great purchase.
