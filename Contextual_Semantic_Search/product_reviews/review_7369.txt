I'm an old lady with an odd quirk:  I don't like to wear labels from the manufacturers of my clothing.  This has a little &#34;Russell&#34; logo on the sleeve.  But it's otherwise a very nice shirt, which I can use the way I use all my long-sleeve tees:  in the winter, they go under my short-sleeve tees.  The short sleeve ones are the ones with messages, like &#34;I love my shelter cat&#34; and &#34;I'm dreaming of a blue Missouri.&#34;
