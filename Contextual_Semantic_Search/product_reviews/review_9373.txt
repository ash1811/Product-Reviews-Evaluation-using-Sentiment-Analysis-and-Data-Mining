I bought a pair of these a year ago to wear to the gym and liked them so much that I purchased another pair last week for casual wear. The material is great - it's stretchy and soft, without being thin like a lot of other pairs I've tried. Even after a lot of washing, the color is still dark and the fabric still looks new. I do think they shrunk a *little* but it was nothing to worry about. For $20, you can't go wrong.
