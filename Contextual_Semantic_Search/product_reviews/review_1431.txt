I love how cushiony they are.  I also purchased the Thorlo Unisex Combat Boot Overcalf Socks and wear them slouchy.  I have washed them a lot and they have held their shape and look great.  But I also don't wash my clothes in hot water.  I have been wearing Thorlo socks for years and have never been disappointed.
