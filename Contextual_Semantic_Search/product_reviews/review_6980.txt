I'd be careful to read more recent product reviews, as my guess is the quality control on the product has changed dramatically.  the fabric is much thinner and more elastic than I expected - I guess to get a really thick crew sock, you'll have to buy one of their "fluffies".  at around $2 per pair I'm not returning these - just disappointed they are not as thick as they were years ago.
