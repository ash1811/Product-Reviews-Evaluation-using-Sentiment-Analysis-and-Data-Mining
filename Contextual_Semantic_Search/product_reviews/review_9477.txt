These flip-flops feel good when I stand still. As soon as I begin walking the right sandal turns slightly so that when my heel comes down on the shoe, the heel of my right foot lands over the inside edge of the sandal. This causes my heel to hang-over off the edge of the sandal, it's very annoying. My left foot has a shoe to walk on, and my right foot has a shoe that my foot walks next to. It seems to be caused because the shoes are VERY NARROW and the outside strap pulls the sandal out of alignment when walking. I would return it, but I believe all the flip-flops out there are about the same. I guess it doesn't pay to offer choices in 'width' when it comes to flip-flops. After all, who needs comfort when you have convenience? They are convenient...but not very comfortable!
