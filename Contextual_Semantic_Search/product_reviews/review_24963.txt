They look like something made by a 7 year old Taiwanese kid...who just stared making boots.  The material looks cheap and feels cheap (the black is not as glossy as in the pictures of them online). I sent mine back and paid a few dollars more for a super sweet Burberry boot. I cannot tell you how cheap they look and feel to the touch!
