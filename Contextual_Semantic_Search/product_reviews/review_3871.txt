Pros:  Major lift and support, No bounce possible, No back bulges, size was easy to pick.Cons:  Unnatural look and feel, Extremely minimizes breast.I'm a 1X 42DDD/E.  I tried the size 5 and it seems to be the right size for me.  I found it a little difficult to put on.  Once on though it really lifts and supports the breast.  That said, it also made me look like a B/C cup and just didn't look right.  I left it on for about and hour thinking I just had to get use to such an extremely different kind of bra.  I thought the material was comfortable.  I decided it is just too much support (and I can't believe I'm saying this).  I am going to return and try the Enell medium support.  It is a little more expensive but I notice the cup seems are at an angle and I think I'll feel more natural.  BTW, I was able to wear under and wide strap tank top with out it showing.
