so, I admit, I always buy 10 pairs of the same socks :-) in case I loose a single, I have 19 left :-) ....see me not all that useless :-)Now, I bought the first pair of these about 3 years ago (the first 10) and they are still great, ok, I may have lost some...ehhhh the sock monster may have stolen one or two pairs....but they still keep up nicely.This time when I unpacked them I looked twice. I only buy cotton socks, max 5% non natural fibers. Even this sock claim to be cotton they feel different, like...not being cotton. I also sweat more in them...not happy. So if you are like me and like your cotton socks and your feet dry and cosy...move on. I will do so too.If I can answer any questions, please ask.
