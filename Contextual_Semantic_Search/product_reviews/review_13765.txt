These are cheap, and effective.  I bought several pair for the purpose of cutting off one pant leg, as I have a broken leg and wanted some cheap pants to get my cast through easily.  These have been perfect, and comfy too.  They definitely are not as breathable as 100% cotton, but for 6 weeks they'll do the trick.
