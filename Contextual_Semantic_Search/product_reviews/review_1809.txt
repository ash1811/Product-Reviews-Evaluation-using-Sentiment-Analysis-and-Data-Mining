I purchased these shoes to replace a very well used similar pair of walking shoes. I loved the old ones. Unfortunately, the quality is not as good as in the past. The sizing leaves a lot to be desired. As suggested by some other reviewers, I ordered the shoes  size larger than I had in the past. The length was OK, but the "medium" width is more wide. I also ordered a pair of Rockport sport shoes. They were size 11, but barely. The width was just OK. I will order shoes again, but will not be surprised if they need to be returned for poor size quality control.6month follow up:  I have been wearing these a lot. The more I wear them, the more pain I get. Went to a real shoe store and was shown that the front lateral side of the shoe tapers more narrowly starting near the base of my little toe. The more I walk, especially with orthotics, the more the side of my foot is compressed. Not good. This was not present on previous shoes. I bought a pair of SAS shoes that do not taper. Much, much better. I have worn Rockports for over 20 years. This latest pair don't make it. Lift the sole cover on the inside. Could it be cardboard? This may be the last pair of Rockports that I buy.
