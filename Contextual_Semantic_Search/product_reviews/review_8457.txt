I was in need of a new scarf and I'm a huge HP geek, so I was happy to find a non-obvious version of Harry's winter accessory on amazon. Without the garish colors used in some of the films, this soft and warm scarf in maroon and mustard is wearable even by adults going to work in a professional environment. The patch is very high quality and can be flipped if the wearer doesn't, ahem, wish to be so flagrant with his/her HP enthusiasm.
