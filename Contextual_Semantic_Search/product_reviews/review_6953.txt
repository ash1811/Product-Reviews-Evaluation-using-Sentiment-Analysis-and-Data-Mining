I have Psoriatic Arthritis in my fingers and toes, this arthritis attacks the small joints. I have to be very careful about the socks I wear because any type of toe seam can cause extreme pain after a few hours. The Gold Toe socks are the only brand I can buy with confidence that they will never cause me any foot pain. I don't know the secret to their toe seams but whatever it is, it works!
