This is my first pair of Lee's jeans.  I usually buy one of the other two major brands..  That has been a mistake.. The others are good but I really like these better..and the fact that they were a couple of bucks cheaper helped even more.  A bonus was that my cell phone fits nicely in the oversized &#34;watch pocket&#34;..  Great fit, great price &#34;phone pocket&#34; and they look really nice too..
