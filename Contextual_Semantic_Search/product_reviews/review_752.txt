Wow...I should have listened to the other reviews. While it looks comfortable-- it isn't. The edges alone are scratchy and the torpedo look I could move past as I've had one other bra do that to me in the past, but after some time it worked itself out. I'd have ignored it completely if not for the scratchy feeling at the hem lines. There for it's being immediately returned.
