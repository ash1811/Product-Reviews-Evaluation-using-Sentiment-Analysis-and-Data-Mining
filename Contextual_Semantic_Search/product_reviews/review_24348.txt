I have one of those extra large heads (to house my gynormous brain) and this hat does fit, but it looks a bit strange on me as if there's not really enough material on the hat for extra large heads, like 80 percent of my head is covered then the adjustable band gets the other 20 percent. It would be better if they increased the size.
