This is my second pair of Sperry Top-Siders. I love the shoes: they are comfortable, the sole doesn't wear down as much as my other shoes (so I can wear them for a year), they don't stink (unlike my other shoes...), and they are a perfect balance of dressy and casual: you can wear them out/to work with jeans, or just walking around in shorts. Great shoes, good value.
