Compared to the price for any other auto-winder, if it works at all it is a bargain.  The description notes size adjustment.  Actually there are two different sized blocks the watchband wraps around. These just pull straight up and off to get at the smaller version.  No instructions to tell you this.  The watch itself is intended to fit into a recess which is about 33mm long.  My watch is 38mm diameter and thus will not fit into the device as it is designed.  It is working with a bit of fiddling and with the cover left open.The operational problems others have noted I would guess are related to individual variance and typical Chineese quality control.  Those problems would probably be there for the similar but much more expensive auto-winders, unless they come from Europe or are backed by an expensive Swiss watch brand.April 25, 2011.  Now it is years later and it still works just fine.  I leave it plugged in and running about two days a weeks.
