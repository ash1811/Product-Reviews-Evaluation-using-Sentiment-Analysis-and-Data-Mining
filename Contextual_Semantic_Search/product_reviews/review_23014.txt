I've worn Rockport Men's Margin Oxford shoes in various colors for many years. I'm delighted Amazon now carries them. This shoe is as comfortable and foot-supporting as your favorite running shoe, but they're stylish enough I can wear them to work at the office. When I know appearance is especially critical, I may switch to a more formal-looking shoe, but these are my everyday go-to shoes. Fit was perfect. They're so comfortable, I wore them to work the next day, right out of the box, no break-in necessary. Highly recommended!
