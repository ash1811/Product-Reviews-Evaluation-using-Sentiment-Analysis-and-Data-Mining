I know this shirt says it is a work shirt but the photo looks like it could be a nice casual collared shirt, something to wear instead of a t-shirt. It was too small but even if it was not, I didn't like the way it looked on my husband. It looks like a uniform, very boxy, very much like a uniform you'd see someone wearing in a car repair shop. If that's what you're looking for, this will probably be perfect.
