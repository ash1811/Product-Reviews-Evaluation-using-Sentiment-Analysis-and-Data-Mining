This is a great shirt and we wear them for our EMS uniforms.  They take embroidery well and take heat transfers pretty well too (but you can expect some peeling if not washed and dried with care - best inside out).The polos are soft and feel pretty hefty when you get them.  I have washed mine 5 times though and as a uniform shirt it is not bad but the material seems a little more prone to snags and wear than I expected.  With the 5.11 name and the great stitching on this shirt it's really not bad.  In fact the stitching is so reinforced and good that I expect the stitching to hold up longer than the material for the shirt itself.How could 5.11 improve this shirt?  I think if they were to create a blend or weave of material that wears a little better and is less prone to snags.  Considering I bought one of these for non-uniform wear in black to wear with jeans, I will better be able to assess how it will stand up to a non-work environment.  I also found the price of $25 for a black version of this polo outstanding since they sell for $35 on the 5.11 site.  The price was great with Amazon Prime shipping thrown in, so I couldn't resist.This is definitely a great polo with great stitching, a nice fit and potential ... there is something about the softness though that makes me wonder about long-term durability.  One good thing is that the shirt seems less resistant to wrinkles than some of my other polos (like some Land's End polo shirts I own).4 stars - it would be 5 if I knew that these were a little more durable.
