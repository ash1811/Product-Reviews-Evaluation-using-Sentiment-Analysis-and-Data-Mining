Got these for my wife who wears nothing but flip flops unless it's snowing outside...  She wears them almost daily.  In fact, the only  pair she owns she likes better are a contoured pair she bought this past summer.  These have held up very well and were well worth the price.  In fact, she's getting a new pair for Christmas this year!
