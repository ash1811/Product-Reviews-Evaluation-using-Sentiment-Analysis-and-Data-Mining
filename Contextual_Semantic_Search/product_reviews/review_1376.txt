have always liked kswiss for myself. however, not the best for small kids. they are quite stiff and scuff so easily. and i'm not saying &#34;gets dirty&#34;, I'm saying the leather on the front toes have totally been rubbed off after only a handful of wears. I think I'm going to have to stick to white Vans for now.
