I ordered a med, I usually where a women's med top, and this fit fine-expect because it's stretchy it didn't really support well. I have a bigger bust and I think a small will fit better and support more. I gave this to my mom who said she likes it. We were both excited that it is so close to the old Olga one she used to have hen I was growing up. My husband liked it on me too, and is looking forward to the small coming!
