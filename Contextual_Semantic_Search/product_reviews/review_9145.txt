Finding stretch jeans anywhere is extremely rare.  I did find one or two other brands but no one does men's stretch jeans best like Levi's.  Tried the Levi's 510, but since I weight train the 511's are a more comfy fit.  And I was lucky to find a Grey pair size: 32/30 a perfect fit!  This is my fourth pair and will buy no other brand.
