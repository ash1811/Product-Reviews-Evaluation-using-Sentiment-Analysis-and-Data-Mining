It arived and does not work, at all.  Maybe yours will but my order came new and doesn't work.  Also, now that I see it I have a collapsible umbrella already that is nicer and has an extending handle.  This one has a VERY short handle.  You would have to hold it on top of your head!  Kind of weird actually.
