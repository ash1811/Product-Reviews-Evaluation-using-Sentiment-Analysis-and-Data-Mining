This is a standard-sized (40mm; it will not overwhelm your wrist like larger designs, although I did think the watch would be a bit bigger), visually awesome watch that you can wear daily, and the 'Eco Drive' technology means you never have to wind it, move or shake it (like an automatic), or change batteries.  What a concept!  The typical wearer will wear it enough (several times a week) such that it keeps a good charge by being exposed to everyday indoor light and outdoor sunlight.  It looks and feels expensive as well, with a good amount of weight to it.  The only drawback (if you want to call this one) is that you will hear the phrase 'nice watch!' on a frequent basis! Incidentally, this exact model watch was featured in an excellent article on Citizen Watches in the April 2006 issue of 'Watch Time' Magazine!
