These are a second pair ordered.  I also got the Cheetah print pair.  Both fit great, are comfortable and look beautiful.  Shipping was as I expected.  The only issue I have that has nothing to do with the slippers themselves is how Isotoner packages them.  They are on a small hangar to which they are secured with the common nylon T- ended tabs which would not be a problem except for the fact they are poked through the bottom of the slipper in the center of the ball of the foot area.  These terry slippers have a fairly durable rubber sole.  Poking a hole in them not only does not make sense in any case, but this does seem it would ruin any moisture protection if one should step into some spilled liquid.  The Cheetah print do not have the hard sole, so it is not as important since they would probably absorb liquid anyway, but on a harder sole it is an odd thing to do.
