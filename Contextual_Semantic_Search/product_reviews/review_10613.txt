At first blush, you might be tempted to dismiss this as cheap and forgettable. Note, however, the really low price, and it represents good value. I do like this watch, but you might want to buy a couple of extra. It has one small, discrete day digit. The band is kinda stiff and uncomfortable. I have only had it a couple of weeks, but it seems to keep perfect time.LOOKS NICEThe dial face, numbers, and hands are a rich, golden affair. So much so, that the contrast is pretty low and hard to see in normal light, and impossible to see in low light. The contrast from the golden dial to the black bezel and bands is rather odd, but I do like its looks, though it cannot really be called "dress".C'MON, IT IS PLASTICYes, yes: plastic, and it looks it. Also, if you wear it daily, even under light wear, I think it unlikely that it will last more than a year. That is why I suggest you buy a couple more if you really like it. At the price, you can afford to have a couple of spares. Since the battery is advertised to last 10 years, it will be ready when pull out the spares in a year or two.GLOW IN THE DARK?Well, no. The hands are luminous, so if you take it out of bright light to dark, they will glow for a few minutes before fading.
