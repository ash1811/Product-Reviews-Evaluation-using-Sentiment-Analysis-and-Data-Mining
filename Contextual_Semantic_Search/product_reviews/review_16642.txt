OK I ordered a 56&#34;x30&#34; to accommodate my Santa girth. The waist did fit as advertized but from there down these pants fit is ridiculous.  The hip and leg room was sized for a much larger person, someone who didn't taper down from a 56 waist. I still fit comfortably in my old 48 waist jeans, except for the too-small waist. I was hoping the designers at Wrangler were cognizant of percentages and designed accordingly. I mean, out of 100 Santa-waisted guys you've ever seen how many have huge hips and thighs? Maybe 5? That's who these are designed for, not the other 95, at least the pair they shipped to me. The other design problem is the huge &#34;rise&#34;.  For me to get the crotch up to the right place, the waist was 2&#34; above my belly button. Maybe they were designed for a huge _______ like the rest?
