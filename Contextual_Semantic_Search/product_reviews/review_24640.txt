These run small for the size.I ordered "EEE" because I wanted them on the roomy side.They are on the tight side.Also I will need to cut off a piece of material (leather or suede whatever) that is extending  through the inside cushioning material.I will cut the hard material off and glue a couple of cotton balls in its place.I would buy again but a larger size,I purchased 11 EEE.
