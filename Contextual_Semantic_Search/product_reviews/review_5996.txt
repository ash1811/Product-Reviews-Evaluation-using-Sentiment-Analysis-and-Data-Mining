I have lots and lots of problems wearing shoes. I find many women's shoes too constraining and tight, and have had various problems with my feet over the years that seem to just boggle the podiatrist. Putting me in orthotics seemed to make things much worse, as did just about any arch insert or other things inserted into the shoe. Most sneakers become almost unbearable to wear after several hours, and over time I've found that a light shoe with basic support worked best for me. I'd had good luck with some other easy spirit shoes so gave this one a try. And it is really amazing how comfortable this shoe is for me. It's so rare that a shoe fits and is comfortable without a serious break-in period, but this particular style just works that way for me, and I just hope they never discontinue it! I've tried a few other Easy Spirit shoes, even some walking shoes that look very similar but they just never seem to be as comfortable as this one. It definitely would not be the choice for someone who needs a lot of arch support and a really solid sidewall, but if you like very light shoes, this is an excellent one to try.
