I tried this boot on in the shoe department of a major store.  Yes they had the MAJOR price too.  So after confirming my size, I came home and fired up the computer, cracked my knuckles to loosen my fingers and ordered a pair at practically 2/3rd's less in price.  I am just a little old lady with fond memories of the 60's when these boots first made their debut I think.  My mother HATED them, so naturally I loved them.  But seriously, they are still well made, maybe even better than they were in the 60's.  They still have that &#34;groovy&#34; look, kind of slouchy and comfortable looking and go real good with my old bell bottoms.  Good times, good memories, great Wallabee's. Rock on Amazon.
