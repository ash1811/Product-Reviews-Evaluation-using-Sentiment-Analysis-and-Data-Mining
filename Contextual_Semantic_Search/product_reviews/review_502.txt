I purchased this due to the good reviews it has on Amazon. I plan to use it for long day trips, weekend trips, and vacations. It has plenty of room, separate sections, and extras that will work out great for holding all kinds of stuff! I can't wait to use it! I have smaller bags like this where the strap goes across the body, and I prefer that when traveling or walking around all day long, but I definitely needed a bigger one (but not too big - haha). I feel safer knowing it can't be stolen from me and it is also more comfortable to wear. It is made well and I like that the material will repel water. Great bag!
