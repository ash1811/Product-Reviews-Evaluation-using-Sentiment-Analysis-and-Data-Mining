I've been wearing Chuckie's since I was a kid(over 40 years!!). Original Chuck Taylor's are the biggest icon ever to hit sneakers, with the same bulletproof looks and simple construction throughout the years. They might offer zero arch support(easily fixed with a set of insoles), and can wear down a bit faster than newer brands, but there is no denying that, for the price paid, there's no finer example of what a sneaker is.With all of the new colors available, it has and will always be the king....buy a pair and find out for yourself why.
