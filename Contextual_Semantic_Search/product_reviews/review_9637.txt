Great fit and finish, fast ship. Comfortable for me, great value, good color, and no defects. I highly recommend the black and prewashed indigo jean and will buy again. I do not recommend the rigid indigo as they were sized small, very stiff, and I looked like Fred Mertz from the Lucy and Dezi show.
