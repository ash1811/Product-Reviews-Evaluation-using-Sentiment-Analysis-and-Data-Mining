These water shoes run a little large, Our grandson wears a size 8, so these 8-9's are a bit big on him. They go on easily and the drawstring top tightens them up fine.  I do wish the botton was just a bit more grippy, but they serve the purspose and protect his feet around the pool. The colors are bright and they are well made enough for the price.
