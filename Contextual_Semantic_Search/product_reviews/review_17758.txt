My feet is of average width and I would normally wear a size 11 sports shoes (with socks). I my first pair of Dockside of size 10 (to be worn w/o socks) and it was too big. Despite wearing them for a long time, I did not successfully break into the shoes in that I suffered from frequent abrasions resulting in blisters. Thereafter, I purchased another pair of size 9.5 and it was a perfect fit. So watch out for the sizing!
