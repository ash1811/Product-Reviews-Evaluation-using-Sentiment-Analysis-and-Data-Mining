Purchased these for myself after reading all of the reviews and I have to say that they are very comfortable and have held up great. I enjoy wearing them and they don't cause much fatigue on my feet. The material that fits between the toes is soft and does not irritate. They are a nice simple/subtle style as well. I recommend these for anyone.
