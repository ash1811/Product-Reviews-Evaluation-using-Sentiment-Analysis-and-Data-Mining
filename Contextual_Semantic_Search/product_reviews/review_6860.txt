These socks appear to be very strong. They have reinforced toes and heels. A little disappointed though because they are not very soft, and they do not stretch much at all. If your feet tend to swell, they will get tight. I feel like I had to choose between socks that would wear a long time, vs socks that are soft and comfortable.
