Hubs is in love with them! They have a nice rubber sole so that they can be worn outside. Hubs didn't want to take them off, ever. I had to make him choose, either he can wear them outside OR he can wear them in bed, but not both!! He sleeps in them. He has diabetes and they keep his feet nice and toasty and he says they are sooo comfortable. As soon as he comes in from work he puts them in! Great great slippers!!
