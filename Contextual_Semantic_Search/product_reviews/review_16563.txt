Even though teaching is my profession and I work indoors, I need a pair of tough pants.  I am a physically larger person and I need pants that fit me well.  These pants fit perfectly.  They are just right.  Further, the rear pockets are large enough to fit my larger wallet with room to spare.  You can fill the front pockets with change, a big bunch of keys, a pocker knife, and small flash light, and so much more.  There is also a watch pocket on the right side and side pockets for small tools.We have zero degree weather now and I was snowblowing before I went to work.  I had to get snow tires on my car and had to carry the tires from the shed.  The pants looked fine as I went into school.  Also, I am involved in many projects at home and work.  I can tell that these pants will be up to the task and won't split and tear in the crotch area or on the side where pants always come apart.  The seamstress in town isn't going to see me as much anymore.I wonder why I didn't choose these pants sooner.  Really, they're perfect for the person who works hard and needs clothes to perform well.  The fabric is &#34;stout&#34; but it's not inflexible.  They are of the right weight for durability, but they don't chafe you or feel too heavy. I am going to order a few more pairs since I like them so much.  The right pant for the person who needs more from a pair of pants.
