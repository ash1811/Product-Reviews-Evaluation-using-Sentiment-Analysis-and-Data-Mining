I bought this bra based on reviews and it did not disappoint. It is true to size, has nice wide bands, and is very pretty and soft. It was instantly comfortable and did not bother me as the day went on. Both cups and band fit well and were comfortable. Everything stayed put! I am very happy and ordering many more as we speak!
