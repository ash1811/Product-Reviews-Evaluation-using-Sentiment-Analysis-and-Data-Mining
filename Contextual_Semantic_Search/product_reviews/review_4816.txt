I bought this jacket for travel, but have not tried the waterproof feature yet--I anticipate that it will be great since it is so well constructed.  It fits perfectly--fitted for a more feminine look.  I bought it so that it but can be worn over lightweight and heavier weight clothing, yet folds compactly.
