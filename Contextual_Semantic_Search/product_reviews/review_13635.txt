I wanted slippers with a bit of a heel and cushioning so I could work standing up, which I understand is healthier. These slippers give me that. They make it easier for me to stand and move around for many hours while I work.However, it is true that you end up standing on the part that's supposed to fit behind your heel, flattening it; and these slippers started to fray almost from the start. I wish the back and sides were higher up, and the material was less prone to fraying, but I still like these slippers very much for my purposes and would buy them again.
