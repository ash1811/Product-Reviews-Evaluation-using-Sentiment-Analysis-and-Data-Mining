Updates: It has been a blistery 2 years since I bought this shoe. I swear to god I love it, but good god the blisters sometimes make me question my love. It is so hard and strict, HOW DO YOU ALL BREAK IT IN? HOW DO YOU NOT SCREAM WHEN YOU WALK IN THEM?. Every once in a while I get the nerve to put it on and walk in it, and most of the times Its the worst day of my week. I walk like I crapped in my pants and refuse to go to the bathroom because pride. I am sure its a good quality shoe, and it requires time, and blood, literally. But unless you are ready to face the blood and pain and the scarred feet, I'd recommend you shell out few more for a broken in pair, otherwise this shoe will just stay in your closet collecting dust.I love it. The shoes is FAB! I am still on my breaking in process, the blisters hurt, but I am close. The shoes get comfortable the more and more you wear it, I know the first time I tried it I couldnt even walk to the front door. I had to drag my feet. I got size 4 and it's perfect with the thick socks. I really hope I get to break it soon. I want to wear it more and more but the blisters make me want to scream.
