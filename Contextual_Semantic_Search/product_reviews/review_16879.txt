I am a large busted woman ... am trying to lose weight but found regular "sport bras" are like being squished into an Ace bandage, and not especially supportive.  This bra is so well constructed, yet lightweight, it doesn't even feel like I'm wearing a bra.  At the same time, there's no bounce or jiggle when I am exercising.  I highly recommend this bra!
