I asked for this as a Christmas gift and will already be replacing it, because the clasp on the coin purse does not stay closed.  I just have to look at it the wrong way and it pops open, spilling coins into my purse.  The slots for credit cards open to the left, so if you are right handed you have to turn the wallet upside down to slide them out...another huge problem.  It is cute, nice leather, but totally useless!
