I bought these sandals for my boyfriend for his birthday and at first he complained that it hurt and was too small, but it just took a couple of days for it to mold into shape... now he wears it every single day and he says they're amazing and comfortable! He's a size 8 in shoes and I'm pretty sure i bought him the medium size
