I bought this for my son who's in high school, he doesn't like backpacks and was fed up carrying a big messenger bag which banged his hip with every step. We are quite pleased with the purchase, the bag is sturdy and roomy, and sits nicely on the shoulder/back. It's also a good value for the money, at the moment these are priced between $14 and $21 depending on the color you choose. Only two small adjustments could be made: one, I agree with the reviewers who say it could benefit from the addition of a water-bottle pocket on the outside, and two, if you are very tall/long in the torso, this might not fall in the right place, and you can't lengthen the strap, they ought to make it adjustable.
