I've bought cheap paisley bandanas in various local stores for half my life, over 20 years. I wear them and wash them, and wash them and wear them, for years, until they're threadbare and finally get holes in them (unless I lose them first.) I had to get a solid black one to wear at my new job and couldn't find one in any local stores, where they have paisley and other patterns and colors, selling for a dollar a piece. My husband found this solid black one here on Amazon, and even though it was three times the price, he got it for me. For one thing, it is DEFINITELY NOT square. And for another, I wore it one week, just washed it today, and it's already fraying. You've got a lot of nerve selling this crap for three dollars; it's not even worth three cents!
