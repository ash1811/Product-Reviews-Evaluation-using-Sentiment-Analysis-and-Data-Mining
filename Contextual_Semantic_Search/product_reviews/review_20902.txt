My boyfriend goes through work shorts quickly (he's an electrician).  These are built to last.  They seemed very thick and heavy at first, but a few times through the wash and they are very comfortable.  He usually snags his shorts and rips little holes in them, but these seem to resist that.  They do seem to run a little small -- he wears 32 in other brands, but 34 in Carhartts.
