It's just me, but I seem to like the regular Venice better than the H2.  I think the H2 is hotter, live in Florida, and the fit is just a little off.I do really like this shoe.  It's very comfortable and has that Keen style.  Can walk long with them.  Very good arch support, and you can wash them in the machine.Pretty darn good.
