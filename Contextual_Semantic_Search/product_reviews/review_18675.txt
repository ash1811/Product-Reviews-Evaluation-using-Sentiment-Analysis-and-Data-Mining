I got this to wear while running. It's certainly not the nicest watch I could find, but this display is very clear, it keeps time well, and the functions (timer, alarm) work. It's nice to find one without a plastic strap, as I find those chafe. The battery has lasted more than a year. I would recommend this, especially for exercise.
