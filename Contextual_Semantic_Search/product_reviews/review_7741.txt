I ordered a medium in A-TACS FG and found out that was waaay too big after already ordering this in medium as well. Turns out A-TACS just sizes really large. I do have to cinch the waistband pretty tight, and will probably get the waist taken in, but the legs of the pants are perfect, not too tight, not too fat. Works well and after blousing, cinching, and putting on kneepads, I'm comfortable. Add to the comfortability that even though this is poly-cotton it feels like all cotton, it's soft and wears well without being too lightweight or feeling like it will rip in duty. I like them, and would buy again.
