I am a wheelchair user who is going to school for anesthesiology so getting ahead of the game and grabbing up scrubs early. But these pants run HUGE, a Small is more like a mens Medium, there is no way the waist size on the Small is a 32 and the inseam is way too long!They are very stiff and have no stretch, which is a bit of a problem when your a wheelchair user, you want a little bit of stretch. Heck even an able bodied person will want a little bit of stretch to accommodate movement. These are as baggy as rapper pants on me too. I'll go look into other brands for pants.As far as tops Dickies has me sold but the pants either I need to buy from a different collection (not EDS) or go to another manufacturer.UPDATE: Wednesday Aug 15th I received my new pair X-Small they fit my legs lovely and they DO have a little tiny bit of srtretch, again Dickies has me sold. Just ordered 3 more tops and 3 more pants!
