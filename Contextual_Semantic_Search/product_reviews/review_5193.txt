After 10 months, the watch still works fine after daily use.  Only complaint functionally is that the large, exposed buttons are easy to press accidentally, but no biggie.  But cosmetically, the watch doesn't last.  The silver finish around the face has rubbed off & the plastic face is scratched up (see my posted photos).  I've also owned a light purple version of this watch, which looked even worse after a year - the band discolored and wouldn't come clean.  So, though the watch works fine, I'll be replacing it because it now looks ugly.  I find that Timex watches have a lifespan of a year or less - sure, they keep ticking, but they really look awful after a few months.  So, I've been replacing my watches every year.  Maybe this time I'll learn my lesson and try another brand.
