I put a kickboard, buoy, zoomers and a rolled up towel in here to carry to the pool.  Plenty of space, and allows for gear to dry in the house without having to take it all out of the bag (I do hang up my towel on a hook to dry instead of leaving it rolled up).  Wish I had this 20 years ago when I was lugging gear in my gym bag back then!
