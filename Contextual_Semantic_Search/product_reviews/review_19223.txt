I thought for the extra money I'd get 'WOW !!' and I got bupkis !!  As far as the sizing, it might fit a teen or little kid, but after that BEWARE !!!...and - of course - too cheap to bother returning at the P.O.  Grrrr....I would have been better off buying one off the street in Times Square !!! Boooo !!
