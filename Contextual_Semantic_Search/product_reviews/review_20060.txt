My regular size was too small in the toe area so I ordered half a size bigger which fit perfectly with a bit room. The inside of these shoes feels soft and they feel very comfortable however they have no arch support. They look very stylish with dresses and jeans and can be worn year round. The tread has some pattern so they are not slippery on wet surfaces. I will be buying an insole to help with the arch support.If you are looking for a comfortable soft everyday shoe these are it and they run tight in the toe box area so order half a size up.
