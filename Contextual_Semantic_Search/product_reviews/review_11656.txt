Oh, my gosh!  These shoes are so comfortable!  It can be scary ordering shoes online, especially a shoe you've never worn.  As soon as I put them on, I was so relieved!  They are amazing.  They are true to size and just so comfortable.  I am not easy to please when it comes to shoes; my feet hurt in almost all shoes.  I like to line dance, and line dancers wear shoes with suede soles, so I really ordered these to dance in, but I'm not taking them off now.  I'll have to order more pairs so I can wear them every day and for dancing.  And a neat surprise for a 67-year-old grandmother; after I ordered mine, I found out that my teenage granddaughter has a pair too, so I guess these shoes are kind of cool!
