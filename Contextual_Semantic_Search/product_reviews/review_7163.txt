I had tried other brands of athletic socks and they all seemed fine from a comfort and wear standpoint. When my old, well worn socks started to develop holes, my wife suggested I try the Gold Toe brand.  Sure, why not?  I was pleasantly surprised.  They were definitely more comfortable, and have retained their softness after a number of washes.  I never thought I'd have an opinion about athletic socks, but now I do.  These are the best.
