Disappointed with NB. I ordered a 7 4E (wide) but these fit like a 7 narrow. Back they went, thank goodness Amazon pays for return shipping. FYI NB customer service is not as good as they used to be when dealing with a warranty problem.  New Balance customer service kept telling me "you should have bought them direct from NB then we could honor your warranty".  NB wants you to go to their web site and order shoes direct from them.  However, the shoes are cheaper on Amazon.
