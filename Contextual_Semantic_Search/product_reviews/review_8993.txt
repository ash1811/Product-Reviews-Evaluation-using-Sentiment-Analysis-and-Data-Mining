I bought these because I wanted to see if Levi-Strauss made them the way they used to (and I needed a pair of jeans).  The price was reasonable, too.  I got them two inches bigger in the waist (34" to shrink to 32") and two inches longer in the inseam (32" to shrink to 30").  I washed and dried them in warm/hot water and on high temparture, respectively, and they shrank to just the right size.  They fit great now, and the denim is substantial and faded only enough to look comfortable.  The sewing is of good quality.  They are made in Haiti.
