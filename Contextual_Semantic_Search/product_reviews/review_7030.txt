We weren't sure what to expect from such cheap socks. We bought two packs and were very pleased with the product. They fit snugly, feel like they are durable and the color has stayed well for the first two washings.We have rough slate tile floors, and these socks seem to be standing up well to that too. Bit too soon to comment on durability but they do show promise, and at this price, we would definitely purchase them again.
