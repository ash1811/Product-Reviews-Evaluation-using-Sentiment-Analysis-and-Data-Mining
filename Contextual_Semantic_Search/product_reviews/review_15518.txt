Fits just a little small. My girl is long for her age. She fits comfortably in 6 month clothes from other brands but needs a 9 month size in these. Not a huge deal, just good to know.I originally bought these in 6 month size and was very pleased with how they washed & wore so bought the 9 month ones when she outgrew the 6 month size.
