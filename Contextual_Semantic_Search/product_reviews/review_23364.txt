Having had bilateral mastectomy surgery months back without reconstruction, I was looking so hard to find something that I could wear comfortably and without being obvious that I had the surgery.  All of the post cancer garments are higher than a cat's back and I could not afford any of those.  I got very lucky and found your site on the internet and I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
