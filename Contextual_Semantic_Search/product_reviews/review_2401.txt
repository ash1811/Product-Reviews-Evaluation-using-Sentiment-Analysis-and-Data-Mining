I have some very expensive watches but they just are not comfortable to wear or they are too small and hard to see. This watch is every bit as nice as my $300 watches and looks nearly as nice as some of my way more expensive watches. It's not the thinnest watch I have, but it is quite thin and very comfortable to wear. It's easy to adjust and to put on, all by yourself. It's nice enough to wear as a dressy watch, but being stainless, it should be sturdy enough to wear every day. Mine is new so I don't have any long term experience with it, though I've read a lot of good things about this manufacture. I'm very please with my purchase, even though it did take a long while to get it, nearly a month because of backorder.UPDATE: I've been wearing this watch 24/7 for weeks now. It is in perfect condition, not a scratch on it. I wear it in the shower, bathing the baby, sleeping, dressing; it's comfortable, doesn't catch on everything, keeps good time and is really nice looking. I get a lot of nice comments on the watch. It was a good buy.UPUPDATE: It's now nearly a year that I've been wearing this watch 24/7 and not a nic or scratch. I can't believe the price now. I'm tempted to buy a bunch for gifts. People think this watch costs me hundreds of dollars. It is a GREAT buy.
