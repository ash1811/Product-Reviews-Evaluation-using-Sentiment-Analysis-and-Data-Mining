Smartwool socks have proven over and over to be the best sock overall.  They last much longer than other socks, conform to the foot nicely, and keep feet cool in warm weather and warm in cool weather.  I live in Florida and wear them all summer long.  I also wore them in the mountains of Colorado in the winter, and they did wonders there also.  The material is comfortable, it is not pure wool.  It has enough elasticity to conform to the foot and is not at all itchy, and I tend to be sensitive to the normal itchiness of wool.This particular &#34;model&#34; tends to run a little small.  I bought the size I normally wear and the heel part of the sock tends to sit just underneath my heel rather than on it, which means that the reinforcement there does no good.My rule of thumb for Smartwool is to buy one size larger than you would normally wear for the thinner ones, like Margarita and Saturnsphere, and one size smaller for the thicker socks (unless you are going to layer another pair underneath) like the PhD socks.  This makes the socks fit well, keeps the reinforced heel where it is supposed to be, and helps avoid excessive movement of the sock in your shoes (for the thicker types).
