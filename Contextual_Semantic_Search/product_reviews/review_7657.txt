First, I love ExOfficio underwear. It's the best thing out there. If you don't have any, go buy some. You'll never go back.I bought this shirt because it was made from the same stuff as the underwear. The shirt is comfortable, but it looks like you're wearing a mesh shirt. Which shouldn't come as a surprise, because that's what the underwear look like too. I guess I thought it would be a little different. It's still a solid shirt.The XXL is a little more snug than the XXL Columbia or Mountain Hardware make.
