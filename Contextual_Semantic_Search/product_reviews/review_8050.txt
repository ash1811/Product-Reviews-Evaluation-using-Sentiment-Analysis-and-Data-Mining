I like the stability of the straps and the width of the back band. The front is also great. It lacks in support a bit (I have DD) but I suppose that will happen with ANY bra that has no underwire. Overall, I am please with this purchase and it will be my primary nursing bra. The material is better than a few Anita bras I bought. Good fit and true to size. I bought up and think I will fill it in well so I can wear it both as a D and DD.
