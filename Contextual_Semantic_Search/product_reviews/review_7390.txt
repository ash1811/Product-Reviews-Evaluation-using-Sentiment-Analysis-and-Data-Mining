I ordered these for my husband and was disappointed with the quality of this Russell Athletic T-shirt. Thought I was buying quality based on my prior experience with Russell brand tee shirts.  Seems quality has taken a backseat to profit.  Fabric is thin and after one washing the tee shirts fit too snugly.  A few more washing and they will be ready for donation to non-profit.
