I love these Merrell shoes. The only problem is the 8 is too large and the 7.5 is too small. Although these are truly the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn, it's rather frustrating not to be able to find the right size. Maybe if they had wide sizes this wouldn't be a problem. All things considered however, I would definitely recommend them. They're extremely well made and durable.
