I got this and am returning it.  The watch itself seems nice, but the band is too small for me.  I am on the last slot, so it is awkward.  The display is very clear, and about 1/4 recessed from the shields of the G-shock, so I doubt it would get damaged very easily.  If the band was longer, I'd keep it.  Love the idea of the 10 year battery.
