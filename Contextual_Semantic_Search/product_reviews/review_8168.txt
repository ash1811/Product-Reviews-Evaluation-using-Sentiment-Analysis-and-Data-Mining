I just love this watch.  It is lightweight and goes with everything.  I needed a watch that showed the day of the week and not just the date--I am retired and need a reminder of which day it is--every day is a weekend now. I have very small wrists and this watch had enough removable links to fit me.  The clasp required some getting used to but now I can close it with no trouble.  I have purchased several Seiko watches in the past--I like this one the best.
