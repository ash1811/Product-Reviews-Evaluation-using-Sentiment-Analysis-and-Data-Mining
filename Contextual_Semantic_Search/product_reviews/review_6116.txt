I am very pleased with the purchase of these overalls. I have a small farm (very small, just 4 acres) but needed some tough yet comfortable practical clothing. We have sheep and do a lot of organic farming - plus I am always fixing some portion of the fence, pens or some other chore.These overalls look great and perform. The stone-washed denim looks great and feels even better. There are pockets everywhere and for most any use. And the straps are easy to adjust.I'd recommend these overalls to ANYONE who likes comfortable and also convenient clothing. They will only get better with use and washings. LOVE these overalls.
