My moyher love vest, but in my country (Venezuela) is not easy to find vests, so as neither coffee, sugar, milk or toilett paper (although believe it or not). It is a nice best, warm, the fabric is great as the zipper, well constructed, Compared to the Columbia Women's Benton Springs Vest, the Port Authority vest is a little heavier and warmer, and has a better zipper. The brown is kind of greenish. It fit as expected. My mother loved it. I definitely recommend it.
