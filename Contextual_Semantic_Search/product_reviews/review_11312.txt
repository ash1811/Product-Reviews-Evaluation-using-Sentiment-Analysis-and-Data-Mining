Good sturdy backpack on the larger side. This is exactly the size I wanted. Didn't know how the measurements would go just basing it off their diagram but everything worked out. Ok, fitting stuff in is easy, zippers work good everywhere that they are around the backpack. Zippers work good even when the backpack is stuffed to the brim. Straps are curved nicely for a better fit and probably ease on the back from carrying the load. Because this is one of the bigger backpacks, I really do wish the design was more spread out along the backside. The weight that it holds is unknown to me but can feel so heavy when I pick it up from the ground and when worn, makes my son look like a tortoise and I feel bad for him but I am confident that it is one of the best backpacks for the cost. No fraying on the nylon straps. We are 1/2 way through the school year and as rough as my son is, the backpack looks near new. I am impressed. Will probably spray with scotch guard, if necessary, just to help with being water resistant after I see how it holds up in light rain first but the material acts like it may repel on its own.
