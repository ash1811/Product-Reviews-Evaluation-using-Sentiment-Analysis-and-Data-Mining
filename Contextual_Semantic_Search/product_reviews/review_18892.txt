I ordered 1 size up and it may have been ok except a little too large on the opening. It is a very matte black and really well made and after walking around indoors also was very comfortable, except due to a bunion on my left foot it did start to hurt in that area after an hour. Overall for those without any foot issues this will probably be very comfortable yet stylish, but for me it will go back.
