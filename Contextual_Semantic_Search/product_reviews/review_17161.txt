I just love these.  Costco used to offer them every year for about $19, which was wonderful.  I bought them for myself and my daughter and they're always a big hit.  Amazon is the only place I can find them now, and I just ordered 2 more pair.  BTW, the darker colors are better for thong slippers.  The light colors seem to get dirty way too fast, and they don't wash as well as you might think.  I hope Acorn continues to make these for many years to come.  Highly recommended!!
