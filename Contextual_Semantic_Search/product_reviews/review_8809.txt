For years I've been looking for a black version of a sexy slip (like the one Liz Taylor wore in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof) and this slip is very close. I gave it 4 stars (not 5) because the adjustable straps are very short (not a problem for me but could be for others). Also, the adjustable part of the strap is in the front (when it should be in the back (like on a bra)). I suppose this is a manufacturing, quality control issue. I still love the slip and would pay more money for a higher quality version. This slip has me strutting around the bedroom like a blonde Maggie the Cat.
