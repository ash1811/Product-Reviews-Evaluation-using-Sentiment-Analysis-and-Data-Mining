Birkenstocks can actually look, gasp, chic, but you have some cardinal rules to follow:1) Only black or white smooth leather, sorry suede is too crunchy2) Order a size smaller than your normal European sizing, I wear a 37 (6.5) usually, but I wear 36 in Arizona's (had to return the 37s I purchased!)3) I recommend getting a narrow foot bed, instead of the regular width, this makes for a sleeker profile, as the Arizona's seem particularly wide!4) Unless your going for normcore, please don't wear these with socks!
