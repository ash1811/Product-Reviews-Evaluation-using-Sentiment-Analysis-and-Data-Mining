These were the first time I've ever tried, but I was tired of trying to find a slip in brick & mortar buildings. Upon receiving these I wore them first time with a long formal gown. I had my doubts, but they were so much cooler than a slip. Plus, you don't have to worry about all the layers when leaving the Ladies. These work great under everything, pants, skirts, walking shorts. And they keep a clean look on your business attire, no underwear pant line. I would buy again and recommend to friends.
