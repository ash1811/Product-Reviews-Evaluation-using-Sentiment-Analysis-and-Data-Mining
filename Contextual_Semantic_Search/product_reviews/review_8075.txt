I ordered the orange tights for a parrot costume. I was expecing more of a primary colored orange, but these turned out to be neon orange. Still workable for what I needed, but then I put them on. I am 5'6" and these were WAY too short for me. They will work for a costume, but if you need them to wear more on a daily basis I would look for another type. The quality seems fine though.
