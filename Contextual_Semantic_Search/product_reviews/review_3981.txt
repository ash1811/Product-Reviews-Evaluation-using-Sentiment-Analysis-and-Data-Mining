I hate skinny jeans!  I wear boot-cut jeans exclusively; probably because I usually wear boots!  love the cut and fit of Levis bootcut...skinny and tight above the knee, but masculine and flared out at the bottom to accommodate boots.  Don't get me wrong, I will wear regular sneakers and flipflops too, all look good with these jeans.
