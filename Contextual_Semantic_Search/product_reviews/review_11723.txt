I had been looking for a pair of moccasin's for awhile. I wear a size 11 so finding shoes of any kind in stores is a bit of a challenge. I saw these on Amazon and was hesitant to order shoes without trying them on first but I went ahead and ordered.Later that week I received them and they actually fit! I wore them the first time for hours and there wa no breaking in period at all. Very comfortable. I do wear thin socks as I found they were a little too snug with my usual white sport type socks.
