I ordered this bra when I finally realized I was wearing the wrong size. I ordered this and another more padded playtex bra. I like the additional padding of the other one but this bra is comfortable and very supportive. It's made me realize I don't have to put up with underwires ever again for grea support. The strap are comfortable and I love it.
