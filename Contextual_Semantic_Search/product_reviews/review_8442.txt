These sandals are indeed pretty, well made, and last well when used as bedroom slippers around the house. I like the way they look. They have the open toe and thus don't damage a relatively fresh pedicure when worn with bare feet. My one complaint is that they have stretched out a bit after several months of wear, and now if I'm wearing thin socks with them (as I often do), they slip off my feet and cause me to shuffle to avoid it. I wish they had the same style but with a heel strap to keep it on the foot, or a slightly steeper incline would work to keep them on while walking too. With bare feet, they are fine, even after a bit of stretching out.
