There is not a big difference between the 511 and the 513. The leg opening and knee area are slightly more snug on the 511 vs. the 513. They fit really well on my slim frame and it is a new modern update on the old 569 &#34;loose&#34; fit jeans. I'm in the process of emptying all the baggy jeans out of my closet. Pricing is really good on Amazon!
