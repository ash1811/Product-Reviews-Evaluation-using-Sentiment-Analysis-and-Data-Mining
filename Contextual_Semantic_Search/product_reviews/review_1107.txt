There aren't many options for inexpensive cotton bikinis that let you pick the color range you want. So I decided to take a chance on these despite some of the complaints about the smell, since some of those reviews were older. These bikinis did arrive with a very strong baby powder smell. I couldn't stand to wear them until they had been washed 6-7 times. However, after repeated washings, the scent is nearly gone. Now they are very practical and comfortable.
