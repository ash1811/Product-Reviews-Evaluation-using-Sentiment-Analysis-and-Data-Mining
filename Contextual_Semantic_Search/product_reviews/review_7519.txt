I read a lot of reviews on these before I purchased them and it's true when they say to go a size up.  I usually wear a size 8 in a tennis shoe so I decided to buy a size 9 and I'm glad I did.  It gave me a little wiggle room for my toes.  I did find the top part sort of tight.  I had to really loosen it before I could get them on.  Now that I have the laces where I want them I just undo and redo the buckles to get them on and off.  The more you wear them the easier this becomes.  They may seem sort of stiff when you first get them, but I've worn them four or five times now for a few hours each time and they're becoming easier and easier to put on.  I have muscular calves which measure between 15 1/2 to 16 inches around.  These boots were originally designed for women with small calves so if you have larger calves you will have to adjust them to get them where you need them to be.  All in all I really love these boots and can't wait to wear them this Halloween.  Buy a size up and adjust them to where they are comfortable! & remember the more you wear them the better they will start fitting.
