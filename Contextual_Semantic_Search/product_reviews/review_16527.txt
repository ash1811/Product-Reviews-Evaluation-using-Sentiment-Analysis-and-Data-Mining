Just a wee bit long- but what a rugged pair of jeans- the double front was just what I need as beign a photographer, I often have to kneel to get hte shot when the subjects are clsoe to hte ground, and that takes a toll on other jeans- the material is tough too- yet soft enough that they don't feel like wearing steel mesh- Pockets are good and deep and made of good strong material- Rivets everywhere on these jeans- triple stichind down hte sides, double stictch on non stress areas- The back pockets have a kevlar-like material that will really hold up well for thsoe who carry things in their back pockets regularly- Will definately buy again if these ever wear out
