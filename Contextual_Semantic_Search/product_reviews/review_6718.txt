The first time I wore these they ran a little bit in the crotch area.  I have now worn them three times and each time they've ran a little bit in a different spot on the 'control top' portion.  They still haven't gotten a run in the visible areas of the tights, so I'm continuing to wear them, but I am still on the look out for a sturdier product.
