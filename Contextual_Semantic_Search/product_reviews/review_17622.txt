I just received this today and will say I'm very disappointed. I got the outfit on and noticed that the black dye of the bodystocking was all over my hands and my skin. Not to mention I'm 5'7 and very thin and it didn't fit me at all, I know these are suppose to fit tight on the body and mine I could pull away to at least fit another person in and was baggy.
