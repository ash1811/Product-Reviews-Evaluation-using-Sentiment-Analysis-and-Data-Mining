Unfortunately I purchased the Grand Diver first before this one.  Wow what a difference in size.  I decided to keep cause it looks great, and for the price for a automatic watch you can't beat it.  It's 43 mm that use to be big but now it's small to me after wearing the 50 mm Grand Diver.  This is a great everyday watch.
