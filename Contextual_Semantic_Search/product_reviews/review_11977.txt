first off the pic is not accurate.  the pair i got are solid black with no gray on the side of the soles which is fine with me.  i am a golf course mechanic so they will stay clean looking for a long time.  i wish the arch support inside the shoe was a little bit higher and thicker.  the sizing is accurate.  but my main complaint is the hard rubber that they make the soles out of.  you sound like a horse when you come CLOMPING into the room."mr. ed is here!"
