I was pleasantly surprised at the fit of the shoe.  This is the first time I purchased shoes on the internet so I was a bit skeptical.  The shoe is of the typical Clark Quality and fits perfectly.  I would now buy more shoes from Amazon now that I know it works.  the shoe arrived on time (promptly).
