Cant really go wrong with K Swiss , have worn them before and love them.  Dont typically buy black shoes but had to have them for work.  Only thing I would suggest if you have not worn K Swiss before is to maybe try on at a store before ordering online.  They run small- you will probably need 1 to 1 1/2 size larger than you normally wear.
