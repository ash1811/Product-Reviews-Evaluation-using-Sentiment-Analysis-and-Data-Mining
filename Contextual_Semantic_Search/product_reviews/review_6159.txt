I didn't grow up around snow and ice, but now I live in a city that actually gets winter. I used to hate having to slip an dside down the sidewalks and would fall at least once each winter. Then, I bought Yaktrax. I've had mine for two years and they've held up to almost daily winter all winter. They really do grip the ground even with slick ice and work great in snow as well. I've also recommended them to firends who worry about elderly parents or have to commute on foot- they fit over my tennis shoes, but also work with my boots (which have a slight heel). If mine ever wear out, I'll definitely be back for more.
