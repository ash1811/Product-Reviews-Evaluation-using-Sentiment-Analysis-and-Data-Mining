THESE ARIAT ROPER BOOTS ARE NOW MY NEW FAVORITE BOOTS . ONCE I PUT THEM ON THEY FELT LIKE THEY WERE MEANT EXACTLY FOR MY FEET . NICE BROWN DISTRESSED IN COLOR . LOOK GREAT WITH A PAIR OF STRAIGHT LEG JEANS . (Not boot cut-- they are for my  Square Toe boots). Great price and they were here pretty fast ( about 4/5 days ). Not bad at all for FREE SHIPPING !! Thank You for an A PLUS / 5 STAR TRANSACTION AMAZON .
