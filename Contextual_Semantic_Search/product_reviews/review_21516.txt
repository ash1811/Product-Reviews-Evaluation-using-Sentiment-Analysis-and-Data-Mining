My grandson is 2 1/2 years old and as in most two year olds, he loves to play outside.  But in the morning it is damp with dew on the grass and he cannot go outside as he will get his shoes damp and wet.  So I bought him these boots and they are perfect for outdoor playing in the winter months along with being bundled up to keep out the cold.The boots go on easily and he helps put them on by pulling on the "handles" to slip them on.  His feet stay nice and dry and warm even though the outside of them are wet. The quality of the boots are really good and I know my grandson will outgrow them before he wears them out.I had read some of the other reviews and they stated to buy a size larger and I did, but I had to send them back as they were too large.  So be careful when ordering the boots.  I found the size of his current shoe will work for the boot too with some room to grow or at least through the winter months.
