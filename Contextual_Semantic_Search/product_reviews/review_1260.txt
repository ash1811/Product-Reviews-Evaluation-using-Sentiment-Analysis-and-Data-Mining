I used a Domke F 2 bag back when I was  photojournalist. I stopped using it about 20 years ago and went with other brands. I'm trying to get back in the business again, and feel the F 2 is the way to go. It gives me plenty of room for camera and lenses plus my flash. I dig the look of the sand bag, and the straps work great. I really like Domke products, and will never switch again.
