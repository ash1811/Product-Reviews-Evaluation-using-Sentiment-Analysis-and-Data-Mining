A few months ago I ordered and received a different chain but after giving a good review, it broke.  It was really my inexperience because I ordered a much thinner one.  My son needed a chain for a medal he wears and when the first one broke after many years I ordered one that was just to fine for his medal.  This one seems to be much stronger and I believe it will last for a long time.  He is very pleased with it and it is of very good quality.
