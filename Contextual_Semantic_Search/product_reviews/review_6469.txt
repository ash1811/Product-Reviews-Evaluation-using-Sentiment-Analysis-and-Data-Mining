I ordered the size of my last pair, but this time they were too small.  I suspect my first pair may have been labeled wrong? Every time I try these I find you must try them on to decide. I find them to be the most comfortable shoes for standing and walking. I am no longer in medical field, but I still wear them for comfort and slip on concenience.  I'm not sure what size I wear now and will try them again later.
