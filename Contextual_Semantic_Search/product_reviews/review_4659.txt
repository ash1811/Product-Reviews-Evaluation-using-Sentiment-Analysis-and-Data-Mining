It is difficult to find a good pair of jeans these days.  Both Levi's and Lee jeans use such thin poor quality fabric but these new Carhartt jeans are awesome.  The fabric is thick and durable and they seem to be well made.  They fit well too.  I'm very glad I found this brand as I had never heard of them before.  I'll keep buying them.
