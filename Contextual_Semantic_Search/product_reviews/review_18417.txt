I got this to hand out halloween candy in as im doing a Pirate theme for halloween now. gold coin candies in a treasure chest. This chest is made of real wood, has a &#34;hidden compartment&#34; looks and feels the part nicely. The eye patch leaves a little to be desired but i dont wear a patch so no biggie. the coin purse is a nice touch. and the &#34;bandana&#34; or mini flag is decent. all in all its worth the money just for the chest.
