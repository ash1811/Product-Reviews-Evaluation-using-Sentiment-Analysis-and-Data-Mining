I have had the Flexees Instant Slimmer for only 3 days but I can already notice the difference in the way I walk. I thought I had great posture but after putting this on I realized I needed work. I love the way it makes me looks and it is not to tight. I purchased it because although I am doing crunches to get rid of baby weight I wanted something to slim me down a little. It also lifts your breasts! I would purchase this again.
