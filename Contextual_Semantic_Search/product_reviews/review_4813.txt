I bought this jacket on Amazon after seeing one in a store. The material is noisy when you move and there is no liner so it's just a rain jacket shell. The sleeves are slightly too long and I'm 5'7&#34; and usually sleeves are too short on me, so on a shorter person they would probably be way too long.
