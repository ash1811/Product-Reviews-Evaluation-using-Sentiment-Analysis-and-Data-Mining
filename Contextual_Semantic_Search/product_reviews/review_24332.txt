Got these for my daughter, a college student, and she loves them. She can slip them on to ride her bike to school. They are comfortable like tennis shoes, but cute and stylish at the same time. she is an art student and has to stand for hours for some of her classes and these guys have enough cushion and support to keep her feet comfortable.
