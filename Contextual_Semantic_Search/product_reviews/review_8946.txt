I've worn this camisole from National for years and was pleased to see that they're offering it on Amazon despite no longer showing it in their paper catalog.  This is a high quality garment that washes well (it will shrink a bit) and holds up very well for years of wear.  At least, that's what I can say for all of my previous ones.  I haven't worn this batch of new ones yet, but they look to be the same quality.UPDATE JANUARY 2011: I began wearing these a couple weeks after writing the above review and I'm pleased to say that they are indeed the same great quality, washing and wearing just as well as my ancient originals.
