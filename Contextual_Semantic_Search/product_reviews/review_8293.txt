It's a great watch for the price.  I think I paid $130 for it. It runs great, keeps good time, and is probably one of the best watches you can get for the money.  High quality work, very close in look/feel/weight to a R*lex.  We'll have to see how the gold plating wears over time, but other than that, it's a great watch.
