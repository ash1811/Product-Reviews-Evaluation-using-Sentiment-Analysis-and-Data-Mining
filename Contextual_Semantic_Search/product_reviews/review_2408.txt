This isn't my everyday watch,but it is the watch that I wear when I meet friends for lunch or go out for a day of shopping. I've owned it for over 3 years and like it a lot. The features I love is its low profile, silver tone mesh band, the relatively large numbers on its face, and the fact that I still have the original battery in it and it keeps good time. My only complaint is the latch that fastens it took a little time to get used to, but I got used to it quickly.This watch goes with everything because it is both sporty but also works in a more formal environment. I own a similar one in a gold finish that is used with gold jewelry.I've received a lot of compliments on this watch. People seem to like the fact that it is thin and compact looking.
