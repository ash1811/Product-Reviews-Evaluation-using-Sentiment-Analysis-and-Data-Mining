I ordered these for work. I am a network technician and I do a lot of squatting and kneeling and these hold up better than regular khakis but still look good enough to wear in an business casual office environment.One thing to keep in mind is that they are not soft at all and they do not seem to soften over time. You are sacrificing some comfort for durability. They hold up great though.
