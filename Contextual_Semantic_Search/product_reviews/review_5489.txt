These Tees were a bargain.  so I took a chance.  They are red, red as red should be.They are 4XL-, just a wee tighter that I would like - easy fix, before I put them on, run my arms through the sleeves, and stretch the shirt wider.  Works every time.Fabric is soft and non irritating.  Color seems to be holding after about 4 washings.Quality seems above average - only thought here, I wish the fabric was slightly thicker.  But this is a real picky comment.Overall the shirt is good quality, especially considering the price.These are very easy to recomend.
