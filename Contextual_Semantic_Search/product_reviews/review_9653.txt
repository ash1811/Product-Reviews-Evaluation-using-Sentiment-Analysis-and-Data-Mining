The prewashed indigo was true to its word and did not shed any blue onto my load. We live in south FL and it is June, but my husband wore them to the office yesterday. They are a heavier rigid denim, which means they will require some touchup ironing to look presentable enough for the office. Hope Amazon starts carrying some of the other colors, especially the gray, and wish 28 x 28 offered for my 23 year old very difficult to find pants for son--we have had some limited success at Gap and American Eagle with those sizes--he's probably really a 27 x 28, but kid sizes don't fit in certain areas--he works out a lot. Any resources in this area would be appreciated. TY.Oh, and I about fainted when I saw: made in Mexico of US fabric! Getting closer!
