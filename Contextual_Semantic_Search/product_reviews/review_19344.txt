I was worried at first that these boots were too small since my big toe almost hit the end of the boot.  But after wearing them for several days the boot must have stretched because they feel comfortable.  I wear them with socks.  Without socks they are too itchy.  I purchased a size 6 when normally I wear a size 6.5 or 7 in a shoe.  They are warm and the height is perfect with the snowfall we've had.  Sometimes it's a bit of work taking on and removing the boots since they are not slip-ons.  Purchased in black.  Color is good since the boot looks good under slacks and is not obvious you're wearing a boot.  Warm, but not uncomfortable to wear indoors at a restaurant, etc.  The sole of the boot is thin and flexible enough so you can feel the ground underneath, which I've found is an excellent way to prevent slipping.  Boots are very good quality.UPDATE:  Now that snow is melting, I find these boots do not keep my feet dry.  Toes were soaked after I walked through a puddle.  Great in snow, no good in rain.
