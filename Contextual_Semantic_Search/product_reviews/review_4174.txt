This is the first bra that has EVER fit right for me (I've been buying the wrong size and I finally got things right). This bra is inexpensive enough that poor college student me can buy it, but it's SUCH nice quality and I feel a bit sexy. The only complaint is that the center part digs into my chest and it irritated the skin in between my boobs for the first few weeks, but it's gotten better with wear. I'm definitely going to keep buying more!
