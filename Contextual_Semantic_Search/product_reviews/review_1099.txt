Horrible smell gave me an asthmatic attack when they arrived.  Unfortunately I bought 15 jockey underwear so they are going in the trash.  Waste of a lot of money!  Shame on you Jockey!  I have allergies and asthma and only buy unscented products.  There should be a warning label on these toxic underwear.  Do NOT buy!
