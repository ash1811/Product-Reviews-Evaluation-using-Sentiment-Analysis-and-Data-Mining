I bought the woodlore 3" suede bar and brush to clean my new Ugg boots.I am really glad I bought the cleaner in the store, but then I needed a brush (according to the directions).This item shipped quickly. I am very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone that has Ugg boots or any other suede boot that needs cleaning.
