My feet are always freezing cold so I absolutely love these slippers.  They keep my feet at just the right temp. I do think they would be too warm for folks whose feet are not icy like mine.Regarding sizing, I ordered 1 size up from my usual (I got an 11).  I do usually keep my socks on with the slippers and the size I got fits perfectly with socks on.  They are snug, but I think that helps them succeed at keeping my feet warm.  They are fairly narrow but, since I have narrow feet, that's fine for me.
