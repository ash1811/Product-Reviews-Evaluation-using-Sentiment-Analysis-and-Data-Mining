I bought this to wear when walking my dog on rainy days. It's a nice weight and not terribly fussy to put on, so I'm happy in that respect. But it's HUGE compared to what I expected. I'd intentionally ordered a Large -- my husband's size -- so both he and I could wear it as needed. I regularly borrow his jackets for walks with the dog or other chores, so I know how various &#34;Large&#34; size jackets fit me. This one was big even on my husband, which means I'm practically swimming in it. I still like the jacket, but thought I'd mention the sizing issue in case someone else is particular about fit.
