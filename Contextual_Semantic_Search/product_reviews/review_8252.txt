Good looking homage to the Rolex Daytona.  The watch is sturdy and the textured dial looks nice.  There are a couple of drawbacks, though:-  The chronograph buttons aren't really useful.  You have to unscrew the buttons to use them, which makes them unusable if you need them quickly.-  The case is quite thick and sits high on the wrist.  For a 40mm watch I would have liked it to be a little thinner.-  It has the word &#34;Invicta&#34; stamped on the side of the case.  That's a little obnoxious.-  The crystal is only mineral crystal (i.e., glass).  Really would have preferred Invicta's Flame Fusion crystal which holds up better.  I already have a few minor scratches on the crystal after relatively light usage.-  Making this watch an automatic by using the Seiko NH35A movement like in the Invicta 8926 Submariner homage would have made this a much nicer watch.Not a bad watch.  There aren't a lot of Rolex Daytona homages out there, so his watch gives you the look if that's what you're after.  But Invicta could have made a MUCH nicer watch here with just a few adjustments.  An automatic movement and flame fusion crystal could have really done a lot for this watch.
