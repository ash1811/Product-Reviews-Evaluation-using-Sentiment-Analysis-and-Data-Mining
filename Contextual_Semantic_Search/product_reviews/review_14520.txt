I love my Birkenstock sandals. I'm a size * medium women's, so I got the 39 M EU which is about an 8-8.5 women's fit. As I expected, they fit more like an 8.5, but that's fine with me. If I went down to a 38 M EU, they would've been borderline too small. The color was nicer in person than I expected. I've been wearing them a bit so they break in and the leather loosens up and my foot imprints into the footbed, making them fit just great. The leather is already feeling more comfy. I will be wearing these all the time, even if the weather doesn't get warmer anytime soon. ;)
