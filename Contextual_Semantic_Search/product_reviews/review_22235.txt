Lovely chain and great price. I am fond of Silver jewelry because of the shine and the low price compared to the price of gold these days. I prefer yellow gold and always will, but I have been priced out of my hearts desire. LOL&lt;heavy sigh> But, be that as it may this is a great chain at a  great price. It was delivered promptly and so I was pleased.
