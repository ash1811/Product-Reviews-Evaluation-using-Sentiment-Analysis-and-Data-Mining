I received the watch really quick. On opening the package the presentation box had a torn edge. After opening I noticed the back of the watch did not have the 'New&#34; plastic sticker on the back of the watch back case. I put the watch on and the Clasp broke on the watch band.I am thinking this was originally a return being sold to me as a new watch. Very much unsatisfied with this purchase.I gave a 3 because these watches are very good. Just had a bad experience with this one.On the positive side, I set up the return with no issues. Was given a return shipping label, no cost for me to ship back. The watch was received yesterday and I have an email saying the return funds was processed and I will see back on my card in 2 to 3 days.Great Customer Service..
