I love these, I was hesitating about size not because I thought they would be small but because I thought they would actually be too big as second earrings. I recently got a second hole pierced and I was wondering what to get in order to complement my swirly earrings and these guys do the trick. They aren't small so I don't know what people are talking about, but they aren't huge either. I never take them off; I go to the beach with them, shower and sleep with them and they don't bother me at all. Wouldn't hesitate to buy them again!
