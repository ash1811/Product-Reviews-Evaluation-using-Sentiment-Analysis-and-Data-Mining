I wear glasses, and occasionally find that the holders fit dollar bills in them well.  And these do!  The snap-back at the top makes it easy to open, see what I have, pull out what I need without anyone seeing how much I have.  They can slip folded in half in a pocket, or slip it in a pair of knee highs to hide it.  And if it's laying around, someone wouldn't think there was money in it.  I bought the red one, too.
