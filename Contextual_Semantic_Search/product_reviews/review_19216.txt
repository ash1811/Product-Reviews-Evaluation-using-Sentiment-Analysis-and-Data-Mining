I've only used this a few times for snowboarding but so far it seems good.  (Haven't washed it yet.)  The first one I got had a mis-stiched area so I returned it and bought a second one which was better.  It's relatively thin so if you're looking for a lightweight layer it should do the job.  The main thing to be aware of is that this is sized small.  It fits me fine -  I'm a woman with a small sized head.  I can't imagine anyone with a larger head wearing it though.
