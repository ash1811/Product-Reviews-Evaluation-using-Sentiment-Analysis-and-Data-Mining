I like dark colored jeans, and "Midnight Oil" sounded and looked dark in the description, so I ordered them.  Also, the price was $30, on sale, so it seemed reasonable to try them.  However, when I received them, the material was much thinner than the standard "Rigid" 505's that I usually order.  I suppose the thinner weight might be useful in the heat of summer, but it was not what I was expecting.Update: 4/11/2014Having washed these jeans once now, I can confirm my initial impressions.  They washed fine, but the material is definitely thinner than standard Levi's.  This fact should be noted in the product description.
