I make custom T shirts and other clothing items like this locally. I order everything from a specific place but sometimes i will order single pieces from amazon when someone places order shortly after i already made my weekly- 2 week clothing purchase for orders. The price is great because my supplier would charge 10 bucks shipping on my order if it isn't over a certain amount so here i just pay 2.00 more and still have a good turn around time on my products (: which is what i strive for! My customers love this brand, I personally don't like hoodies because of the tightness around neck but i wear them anyways and cut a little slit at the neckline...i prefer sweatshirts and they have those in this brand too which is great and a variety of colors to choose from.
