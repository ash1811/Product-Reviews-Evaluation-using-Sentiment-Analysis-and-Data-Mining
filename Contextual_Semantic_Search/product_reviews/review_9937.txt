5'7 155 pounds in good shape. The medium fits perfect after a wash. It does run a bit longer than the older ones, just about 2 inches under my waist, so it's not a problem. I prefer these for working out/playing basketball than regular A shirts because they give a looser fit. Wish they were only cheaper, as the material is not as thick as it used to be, but all in all they are pretty good.
