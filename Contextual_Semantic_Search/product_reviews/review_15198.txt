T-shirts are my preferred attire during warm weather and when I am working at home.  For several years I have worn shirts with symbols of sports teams or my favorite organizations.  Unfortunately, wearing my t-shirts meant I need to carry more objects in my trouser pockets.The "Hanes Short Sleeve Beefy Pocket T-Shirt" is an excellent choice for me.  The pocket holds my pen, my nitroglycerin tablets, and my cell phone.  Since the pocket is "double stitched" it is sturdy as well as convenient.I like the cotton material because it is cooler and more comfortable than polyester.Hanes provides the product in multiple sizes and 28 color choices.  I chose forest green, which my wife likes on me.  Some other colors are attractive: cardinal, deep royal, deep forest, deep red, and purple.  They also offer orange which may be good for English to wear on St. Patrick's day (My debate partner in college loved orange and wore his orange trousers proudly on St. Patrick's day at a predominantly Irish school.  By noon his trousers were flying from the flag pole, so one needs to be careful)I highly recommend these t-shirts.  I wear mine regularly and intend to order more (while avoiding orange as my wife is Irish).
