I have size 14/15 feet, and bought these socks for when I'm wearing athletic shoes with shorts (very stylish, right?). The problem is, after walking around for a few hours, they start to feel like they're slipping off of my foot and down into my shoe. They're comfortable and seem to be of decent quality, except the fit. I would not order them again.
