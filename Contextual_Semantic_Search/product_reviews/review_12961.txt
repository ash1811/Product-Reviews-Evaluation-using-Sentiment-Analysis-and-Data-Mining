I'm generously awarding 3 stars because this well-known brand of jeans is of good quality, and Amazon's price is excellent. Unfortunately, Levi's sizing is unreliable and the same size that has fit me well for a while is too small to wear as delivered here--so I've had to return the item. (Note that this isn't a one-time fluke: I have in my wardrobe along with several Levis that fit well another that is also too small. All the samples that I've mentioned are the same Levi's model, labeled with the exact same size.)
