If you're looking for a comfortable and pretty panty girdle with firm control that fits smoothly under your clothes, then this is it. This is my third pair of this style.I purchased it this time in black along with theFlexees Women's Instant Slimmer Firm Control Waistnipper #6868and was pleasantly surprised to notice that the jacquard fabric was more pronounced in black. I was pleased to discover that it totally got rid of my pooch and firmed up my tushy very nicely. This control brief along with the waistnipper allowed me to get back into a very elegant straight dress that I had almost given up on. It looks good under fitted clothes and slacks.I find the control brief to be quite comfortable even after wearing all day despite the fact of it's firm control. It doesn't bind, roll or pinch my waist. It also provides good support for my lower back which I find important since I spend so much time sitting in front of a computer for my job.
