This is a great entry level set. I only needed it for band links. The screwdrivers in this set are great. They are almost equal to my Klein tools mini screwdrivers which is saying quite a bit. I can't speak for the other tools as I have no real use for them.I was able to change a Bulova as well as a raymond weil band link and that made this pay for itself IMHOOverall since I didn't and most likely won't touch the other tools, if you are in the market for a tool to remove and replace links look no farther. This is the one.
