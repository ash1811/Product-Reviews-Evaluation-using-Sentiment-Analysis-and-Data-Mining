Very lightweight, but I knew that from the reviews. After washing and drying, they fit nicely (I ordered size "large")......with products such as these, most mediums are too small and many of the larges are too large.....however, these fit me almost perfectly. I indicated that they were "somewhat small" because of the way size large often fits me (i.e., they're too large). Nice summer weight, though, and I would buy again.
