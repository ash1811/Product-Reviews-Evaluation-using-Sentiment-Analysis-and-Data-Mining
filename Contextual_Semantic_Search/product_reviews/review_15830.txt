Ok heres the scoop. I needed some god sock to hike in. Then play deck hockey in. Also to work in and walk in and just to have for daily use.  I love these socks, they are super comfy and seem to dry off from your sweat real quick.  My feet feel magnanimous after wear them, even after wearing work boots all day.  They are well worth the price. I am slowly buying more and rotating my old boring white walmart socks out of rotation and turning them into rags.
