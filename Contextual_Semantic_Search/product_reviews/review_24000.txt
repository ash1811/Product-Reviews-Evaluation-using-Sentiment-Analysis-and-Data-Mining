I'm pleased with this purchase.  As a plus sized woman it is difficult to find scrubs that are comfortable (not to big, not to small). I will be ordering another pair shortly so that I have another pair for my clinical.  I love the cargo pocket, I only wish it had cargo pockets on both sides.  I'm giving them five stars for the fit and color (they match my scrub top perfectly).  The drabacks are not having cargo pockets on both sides and there is no pocket in the back on the women's cargo pants (I have a pair of men's that have pockets on both sides and a back pocket for money, credit card, etc.).
