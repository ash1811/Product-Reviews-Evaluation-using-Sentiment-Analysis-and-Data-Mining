I just purchased this watch for the third time in the last 13 years.  I love it and it works great and forever. It is simple and easy to read. It has a date and indiglo light which are the two must haves I was looking for in a watch. I've had to replace batteries and bands occasionally over the years but they last quite some time.  I wear it daily so it gets lots of use. The other two I still have and technically they still work.  One I must have bent the back metal cover when replacing the battery as it won't stay on. The watch works but the battery falls out (my mistake, no fault of the product).  The second still works but the indiglo light just went out recently.  Again, I've had it so many years I'm not disappointed and will keep it as a backup for when the new one needs a new battery or band.  The other 2 I purchased at K-Mart two separate times.  K-Mart still sells this online but not in stores and is more expensive than Amazon.  Walmart also has it online for similar price but I couldn't get it as fast as here.  I'll continue to buy this watch whenever I need a new one as long as it is made.
