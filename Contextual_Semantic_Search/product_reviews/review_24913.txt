This is a fabulous bra.  I ordered the 34DD and it is comfortable, supportive, provides lift, and the cups are nicely lined.  It provides good, supportive coverage so that you are not "spilling out."  The bra was true to size and I could not be happier, especially for the price.  I just wish some of the other pretty colors were available in my size!
