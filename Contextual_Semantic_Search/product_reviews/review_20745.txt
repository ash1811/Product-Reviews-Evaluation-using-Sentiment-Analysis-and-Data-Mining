Very comfy, waist of 33 was true to size, flexible in crotch to work comfortable in warehouse. Carhart quality, with a thin, (not very heavy) flannel lining.  I have been wearing them in 20 degree weather and they keep me nice and warm, I ended up putting on suspenders as they are a little heavy to just wear with a belt, but this does not take away from the purpose, to keep you warm, and they do the job.
