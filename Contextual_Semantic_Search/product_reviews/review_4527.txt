My husband likes these but I very much don't. The edges at the open neck are only serged, not turned in. Not only does that look cheap, the rough edges are gathering pills from other fabrics in the laundry. The stitching of the button and the buttonhole that shows at the open neckline is cruddy, too. Where collar and beard stubble meet is getting pillie and worn after just 2 or 3 wearings. He bought four of these but I'd be happy never to see them again.
