The delicate top curve of the expandable bracelet with its understated brushed gold and the clear, classic analog watch face combine to become the almost perfect watch.  The indiglo function generates terrific contrast when looking at the time in the dark.  My wife's wrist is fairly small and this fit hers perfectly -- it should be noted that she owns a previous example without the date mechanism that has the finish worn off and a lower quadrant below the top the numeral six of the indiglo not lighting up probably due to her forgetting to take it off during a shower -- and the band has loosened somewhat in the years she's owned it but not overly so.Upon reception and comparing the older and newer they are virtually identical except for the date function which one shouldn't get hopes up to actually see or be able to use. :)  Otherwise the numerals are clear, even, and very readable.  A good purchase.
