This thing is thick, warm, and comfy! This thing runs wide on the bottom on upwards. This thing is so baggy its like wearing a dress. This thing runs fairly long too, wore this to school for a while and the heal part of it started to rip off. This pair is still great though for home wear maybe. Go with the firebird thats what i ended up getting. Thinner on the lower legs.
