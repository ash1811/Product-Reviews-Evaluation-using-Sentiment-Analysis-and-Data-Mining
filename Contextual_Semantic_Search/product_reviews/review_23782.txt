I don't like the front closing where you have to tie it to keep it where you want it.  It becomes especially horrible when you have to run to the bathroom and untie it.  I ended up cutting the time in order to respond to natures demands.  I cut a small slt in each side at the waist band and use the holes in the frond to thread a piece of elastic through the waste and that takes care of the problem.  Wish I had thought of the problem be for it arose.  I do like the scrubs though and once the waist band was fixed I will be wearing them often.
