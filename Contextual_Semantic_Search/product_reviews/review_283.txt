I knew I had the best shoes when my then 10 year old cousin went nuts for my pink hi-tops a few years ago!And he was even more excited when I gave him the key to my SUV so he could see the new pair of limegreen ones I had just purchased.I think that I wore the pink ones while travelling in California a few years ago.  While we werehaving lunch in Santa Barbara one day, I noticed a store across the street and found some supportsthat allowed me to do even more walking while on that 2 week vacation.  I was in my late fiftiesat the time, and it was fun to see the expressions I got while wearing those shoes!!!  Since Imisplaced the old pink pair, I am now replacing them.  My favorite shoe of all time!!!Mary
