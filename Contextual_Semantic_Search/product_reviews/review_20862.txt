No jeans fit right anymore. Trying to find a loose pair of jeans with decent pockets is next to impossible now. I have made the switch to cargo pants for life. Also, I wear a 36 in every brand I have tried, and these are goofy huge! For a loose fit, they sure do have a fat waist and skinny thighs...
