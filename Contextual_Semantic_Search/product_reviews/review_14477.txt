These were not birki flor,but leather. I always love Birkenstock leather sandals because they are comfortable for hours on end.  I paid only $50 for them so they were a great deal.  My favorite Birkenstock is the Florida Sandal because it is more feminine than the Arizona style, but the price was so good, I decided to buy the Arizona this time.
