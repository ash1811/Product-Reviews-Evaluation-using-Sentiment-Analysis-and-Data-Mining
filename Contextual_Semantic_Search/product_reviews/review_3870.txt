I just received my bra in the mail and I am so happy.  I am a 36F (I bought a size 2) and this is the first sports bra that actually fits without making my breasts ooze out in my arm pits.  I have run around the house, jumped up and down and no bounce, NONE! Yay! I will be using it for roller derby and hopefully I will stop getting penalties for having my elbows out because I couldn't tuck them close to my body.  This really feels like my centre of gravity has changed.  Very pleased. Oh and my husband says it's very flattering also.
