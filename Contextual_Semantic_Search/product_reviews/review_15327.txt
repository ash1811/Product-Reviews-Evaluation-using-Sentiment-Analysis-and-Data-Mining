These are my first Olga panties and I am so happy that I spent the extra money for this quality panty.  It feels so sexy and the material is so soft and smooth.  I love the wide lace waist band.  It does roll a bit but that's because I have a little bit of a tummy which I hope to trim off this summer.  This panty is so beautiful one almost wants their special person (lover) to see them wearing it.  I'm hoping to occasionally expose my sexy lace waist band to that special person.  Thanks to Olga for making such a quality and sexy ladies panty!
