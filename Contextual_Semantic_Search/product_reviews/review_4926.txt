I have tried a number of travel underpants, and this one is by far he best.  Pricey, but well worth the money.  You can really get by with 2-3 on a long trip.  I squeeze dry mine, wrap it in a towel and the stomp on the towel.  They are ready to wear in a few hours.  If not, finish the job with the hotel's hair dryer.  The best!
