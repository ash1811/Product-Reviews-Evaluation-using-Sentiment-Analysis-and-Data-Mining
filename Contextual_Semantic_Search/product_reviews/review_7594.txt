I purchased 2 of these chains.  I just love them.  They are very attractive and have never pulled or got tangled in my hair.  They are perfect with my pendants to give them an antique look.  Also they are very well made so I don't have to worry about them breaking.  I'm very happy with them and if you want a nice sturdy, attractive chain that doesn't pull your hair, this is it.
