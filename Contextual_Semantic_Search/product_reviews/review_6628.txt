Really thin tights more like nylons and would be great for that purpose.  I wanted for dance classes and still finding them uncomfortable to wear due to small elastic waistband that really cuts into your waist and makes your skin ripple over it, so it causes skin rolling over and looks bad with leotards over the tights.
