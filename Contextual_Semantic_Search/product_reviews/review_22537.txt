Really like this watch. All components are high quality and the watch looks nice with dress or casual wear. The strap is very stiff but is starting to loosen up with use. Wish Citizen had replaced the 1/20 second dial with a day indicator as I don't use the tachymeter function and would have preferred to have the day of week indicated. I have no problem reading any of the dial info and although the watch looks heavy, the titanium case keeps everthing light. Proud to have this as part of my collection.I am only buying light powered watches as I usually keep 5 to 10 watches in my collection at a time. Battery replacement was becoming a real hassle not to mention a considerable expense (my Tag Heuer costs me $250.00 every 2-3 yrs for battery replacements).
