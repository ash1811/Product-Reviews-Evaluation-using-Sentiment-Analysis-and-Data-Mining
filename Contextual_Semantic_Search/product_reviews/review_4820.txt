I searched and searched for a nice rain jacket, and I definitely found it in this Marmot Precip Jacket.  With a rainy spring and summer this year, I've had cause to use it many times, and it's always kept me dry.  The fit is perfect.  I'm a size 14, and the X-Large fits nicely around my hip/thigh area without being tight.  A very comfortable and stylish, casual jacket, and I love the Dark Rose color I chose.
