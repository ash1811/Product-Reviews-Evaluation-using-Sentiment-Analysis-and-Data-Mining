I was really apprehensive about buying these jeans online after reading several negative reviews..  I've been buying 511s for my so for several years and have noticed a lot of variations in fit.  I ordered the 511 in Seaweed and have no complaints with the fit or fabric.  Overall, I am happy with the jeans and the price.  I am not sure how I will feel after washing them, but if anything changes, I will update this review.UPDATE:These jeans wash fine but if you put them in the dryer, they will shrink drastically.  I accidentally dried one pair and they shrank about an inch in the waist and inseam.
