I had flexees panties I previously bought at Costco and was searching for something similar.  This particular one was tight, heavier fabric than a panty, and felt more like a girdle.  They were not what I was looking for.  Bummer.I finally found the ones I wanted.  They are number 44450/44154 and come in a 3-pack, but do not appear to be listed on Amazon as of yet. 44450/44154 are sized perfectly by the chart on the package, and are a light-weight panty that holds in the tummy just enough to help without being uncomfortable.  Can be worn all day without feeling like you need surgery afterwards.
