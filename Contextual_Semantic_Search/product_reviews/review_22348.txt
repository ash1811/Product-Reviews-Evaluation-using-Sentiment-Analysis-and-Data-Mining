I LOVE the way these sandals feel, they also look nice, and I can walk for miles in them no problem -- the best thing since sliced bread, and they are all I wear all summer long -- only small problem is the dye rubs off a bit, and, so, I have black bottoms of feet all summer as well!  Oh well, I guess we can never "have it all!".  But I'll take the comfort, simplicity, and supportive arches over clean looking bottoms of feet any day!  They're still well worth it!
