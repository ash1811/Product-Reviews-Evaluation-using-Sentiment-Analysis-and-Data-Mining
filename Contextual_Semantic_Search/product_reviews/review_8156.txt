I really like this robe. It is very absorbent and warm. It is also very thick. It seems to be well made and sturdy in the washing machine. I've snagged mine a lot but that's to be expected with the terry loop. I am 5'7 and weigh approximately 140 pounds. This robe JUST fits me. I would have been more comfortable if it would have been a little larger. I consider myself to be of average build for a woman so the OSFM sizing is a little off. This would not be a good robe for a man.
