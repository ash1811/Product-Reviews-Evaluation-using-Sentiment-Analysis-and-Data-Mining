3 Stars for a beautiful bag.  It is exactly what I wanted. However, I thought the partitians would be fully adjustable...they are not.  The only interior layout this bag has is a four-part partition quadrant held in place by velcro. If you remove the partition, it's just an empty space with no partitians.The quadrant partitian is moveable left and right from extreme side to side.  However, the partitians inside the quadrant itself are not adjustable.  You cannot adjust the sizes of the four partitians inside this moveable quadrant which is the only partitian system in this bag.I could not fit my Canon EF 100-400 L IS into any of the equally sized partitians inside the quadrant.  I could have moved the quadrant all the way to one side, but then the slot would have been too large for the lens and would have left no place for my Canon 30D.  The fixed partitian quadrant takes up over 2/3rds of the interior of the bag.Taking the quadrant partitian out, leaves you an empty cavity necessitating using the cases your lens came in....unless you're ok with them just rattling around in there.If you have small, thin lenses...this might work.....but there is no customizing of the interior partitian arrangement.If this bag had moveable, individually adjustable partitian panels, it would be wonderful.  With only one non-adjusting quadrant....it was not acceptable.A very minor point:  I didn't like the clips on the front holding the top flap down, two of them, are very small.  The clips need to be updated with either larger ones or the plastic type used by many bag manufacturers.....retro is nice, but a little updating is also good.Thank you Amazon for standing behind your sales; I returned the bag.
