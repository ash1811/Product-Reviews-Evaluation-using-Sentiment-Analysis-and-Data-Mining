I love this bra and amazon prime too!  It was nice to know I could return it if it didn't fit but the other reviewer's recommendations were correct.  I ordered the next size up than I normally wear and it fits perfect!  This is the best bra for riding horses that I have found.  It really holds the girls in place.
