I'm very impressed, because I had imagined all the possible things that could be wrong with buying based on this photo, yet this boot covered all the bases excellent.  I wear 13W tennis shoes & ordered 3XL which fits perfectly over that.  The top flap buttons over to narrow thethe right amount to keep water from splashing in but not constricting ankle.  The amount of space all around my shoe & ankle with this boot on  top is perfect amount of space & that had to be the result of consiencious engineering.  Wow.  I cant think of anything to improve about it.
