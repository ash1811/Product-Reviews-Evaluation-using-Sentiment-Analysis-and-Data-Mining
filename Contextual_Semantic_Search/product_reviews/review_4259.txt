I have been purchasing Reef Slap sandals since they first started making them.  Living in Florida there is no sense investing in any other flip flop.  These hold up for years with everyday use and the toe strap does not ever pull out.  I throw them in the wash machine if they get a little smelly, dry them in the sunshine and they are fresh again. For the first time ever I have a pair that the sole became slippery so my husband roughed them up with some sandpaper.
