The shirt seems very well made (stitching is well done and heavy duty), the color is great, the two pockets handy and the array of extra buttons is most impressive!  Oh, it fits perfectly (on my 6' 195 lb. frame... with a little more belly than there should be).  I'll buy more of these as experience has shown they wear like iron!
