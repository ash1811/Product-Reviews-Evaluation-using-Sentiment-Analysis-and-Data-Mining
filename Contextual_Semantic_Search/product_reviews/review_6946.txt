These fluffy cushion crew socks by Gold Toe are very well made and they keep my feet warm. In fact, they have that extra heavy cotton fabric to absorb any perspiration and that's a nice feature. I started to wear these not just during the day but also when it's cold at night and I want socks on my feet to help keep them warm and comfy!These crew length socks have a reinforced heel and toe; this makes them last longer and they still feel very comfortable on my feet. The socks come in white and other colors including navy blue and brown; I like that.Whatever you do, don't dry these socks at high temperatures. Exposure to very high heat in the clothes dryer will eventually result in your socks becoming too loose on your feet. The fabric loosens so much that the socks will "bunch up," perhaps even as low as your ankles when you wear them--that's very uncomfortable and it doesn't look too good, either. Dry these socks at low temperatures and they'll stay as comfortable as ever.These socks by Gold Toe are some of the best out there for us guys. They keep my feet extra warm during colder weather. They are manufactured very well so that I get my money's worth.Highly recommended.
