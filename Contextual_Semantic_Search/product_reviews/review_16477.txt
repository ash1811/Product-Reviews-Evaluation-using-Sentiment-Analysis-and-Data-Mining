I&#8217;ve had lace up BatesUltra-Lites before and I love them. They&#8217;re comfortable, look good and a much better price than $250.00 for other brands. The zipper is genius. I will never buy a pair up boot without them. When it&#8217;s 5am the last thing I want to do is fight with my boots while wearing 20 lbs. of other gear.
