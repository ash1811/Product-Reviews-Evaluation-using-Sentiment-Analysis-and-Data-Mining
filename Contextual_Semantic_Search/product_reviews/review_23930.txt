Initially I bought one pair for my brother.  When they arrived (together with other items I bought from Amazon), I asked my husband to try them on.  They looked good on him and he liked them because they were very good in the sun.  So, I ordered another pair for him.  He simply loves them esp when he's driving.  Very good sunnies.  Highly recommended.  Would like to get a pair myself.
