This  is  my second  seiko dive  watch  the  first  i  bought  8  years  ago and  paid  400  hundred bucks  for  it  !  wore  it  until  last  mo  when  i  spoted  it  on  amazon  for  197 . the  old  one  still  was  working  great  just  a  little  scrached up  ! bottom  line  is  this  is  a  hell  of  a  durable  watch and for  197  jump  on  it  . you  can't  go  any  better . its  big  heavy and  no  doubt  a  man's  watch ! it  does run  a  little  fast  but  big  deal .
