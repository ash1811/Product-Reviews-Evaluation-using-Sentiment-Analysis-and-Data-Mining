These hats are ridiculously cheap though as it turns out not in price! Nearly transparent, stiff acrylic material, lousy stitching that is coming apart, ridiculous semi structured shape. After I returned the 25 I ordered, I went to WHOLESALEHATS.COM.Great selection. wholesale prices so you buy by the dozen - which was perfect for me as I needed two dozen.I learned what to look for- 100% cotton, brass clasp adjuster rather than Velcro, unstructured shape.I received, for half the price, ( $3.50 per hat ) a very decent product. Not top of the line, but really decent heavy brushed cotton, great unstructured shape, good bill length, and perfect to put the logo on.
