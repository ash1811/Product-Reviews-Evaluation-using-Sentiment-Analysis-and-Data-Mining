This is a beautiful, simple watch. It does nothing special. However, it is the right size (not too big); it is very easy to read with great contrast between the black face and white numerals and hands; it is also nicely luminescent so I have no trouble reading it in the dark. I happened to have an 18mm leather watch strap from the Timex that broke, so I switched that strap onto this Citizen. That makes it look like an understated elegant day-to-day watch, rather than a quasi-military watch with the cloth strap. What I appreciate most, though, is the exactness ... the second hand always exactly aligns with one of the 60 indicators around the dial; the day and date are perfectly aligned within their respective window. It provides a sense of being well crafted.
