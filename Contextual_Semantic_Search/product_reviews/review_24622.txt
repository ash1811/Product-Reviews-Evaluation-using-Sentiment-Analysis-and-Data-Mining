These slippers fit and feel terrific.  As important as fit and feel are, durability certainly ranks right up there.  These slippers are of excellent quality and made of tough, durable materials.  My second pair (and not the last), the first pair lasted for nearly 4 years and the only reason they "gave up" is that I walked through the soles (outside).  As these are "slippers," they performed well above their intended role.  You can pay more for slippers but it is unlikely you will find better at any price.
