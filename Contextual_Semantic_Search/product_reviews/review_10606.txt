I bought these shoes in size 9W.  I like how they look, but somehow they are big in the back and at the same time tight around the toes. It is the first time I'm having this problem with wide shoes. I ended up getting blisters both times I wore them.  Also, the second time I wore them they made a squeaking sound when walking, so I'm not sure I want to wear them again, at least not at work and public places.  I'm disappointed because I wanted to buy these shoes in every color before trying them on.
