I've been wearing Russell Athletic tank tops for a number of years now both for workouts and casually during the summer months and I gotta say that I always enjoy the look and fit of this shirt.The cotton material is thick and sturdy. The fabric matains well even after many washings. The shirt also feels pretty comfortable during my jogs, not too heavy and soaks up my sweat nicely.
