I ordered the shoe because it was on sale - hard to beat $15. It is a decent shoe, never had any problems with Simple Shoes, but the design of this shoe is a little bit different than expected. The sole is pretty large and extends past the walls of the shoe.Many reviews mentioned the size difference. I ordered my normal size (10.5) and when first worn, it was somewhat snug. I would suggest wearing them around the house and they will loosen up and be comfy. I am wearing them as I type, and am happy.FYI - I would plan on only wearing them with pants...mighty ugly on their own.
