The Citizen BN0000-04h diver arrived yesterday, and it has really exceeded my high expectations. Here is a brief review:- Looks: The watch simply looks awesome. Pictures I've seen online don't always do it justice, it is really beautiful.- Size: Yes, the watch is smaller than most divers, but for my 6.5" wrists, it's PERFECT. If your wrists are larger, you'll only like it if you prefer a mid-size watch.- Quality/Finish: I can't believe I paid only $165 for this, it has the quality of watches that are much more expensive. The second-hand and the bezel line up perfectly, the bezel clicks nicely, overall finish is outstanding. I love this: when you're setting the time, pushing in the crown does not cause the minute hand to jump. This watch is just flawless.- Band: Reviewers hate it. I don't think it's that bad, but I am a fan of NATO and Zulu straps, so I put it on a 20mm NATO right away and that's the way to go.- Crown: Reviewers point out that it's tough to use the crown due to the guards. Yes, it's a little tougher than with my other diver, but it's not a big deal at all. Ideally, I'd say this watch ought to have a bigger crown displaced at the 4:00 position, but the current configuration works fine and it does look good.- Lume: Very bright when the lights go out, still legible after 7 hours!- Legibility: the minute indices on the chapter ring, coupled with long indices on the bezel, make it very easy to tell time and elapsed time accurately at a glance.- Date Window: Small, as mentioned by others, but no problem for me personally. I really wish this watch had a day/date function, but just date is ok.- Durability: This watch gets 5-stars for toughness.  I dropped it on a paved road and it survived the impact without missing a beat!Overall, I am really, really impressed. This watch is beautiful, functional, accurate, and it exudes quality. I love it.
