I've used my Yaktrax maybe 10 times, 4 of them were when I was running. They were great at first, helped me not slip on most ice (still slick on certain surfaces), and I could run in them. But last time I ran I noticed that two of the elastic bands snapped, same band on both.I'm thinking it was caused by one or two things:I take them off my shoes almost every time since I use them on both my hiking boots and my running shoes, I'm thinking that could have given the metal spirals to shift a bit and pinch the elastic band.The last time I ran on them I would say it was clean cement 70% of the time and ice and snow the other 30%, so another possibility is the rough cement caused the elastic to fray easier.Will definitely buy heavier duty ones next time.
