I always buy Wrangler Jeans, but this is the first Jacket I purchaced.  A one hundred pound weight loss has forced me to buy all new clothing.  This is a great jacket.  It's tough and washes beautifully.  The Wrangler jacket is priced at about 20% of what I have been paying for Harley Davidson jean jackets and its quality is better.
