I only just received this watch and am highly impressed by its looks and weight.On one hand it feels like a professional piece and on the other its size and careful use of the gold circlets and surround of the unit makes it look like an expensive dress watch.I usually do not like the blend of gold and silver on bracelets but this watch married the colour and design very well, and I like it.The only negative I have is that the stop watch function had me baffled as I expected the sweep second hand to stop /go rather than the small circlet at 6 O' clock.The function here is a bit fidgety but it does not really worry me as I did not but it to measure speed/time, I bought it because it was so well priced I just had to buy it and am pleased I did.I like a watch to feel solid and weighty and this one is just that, looks great without being too ostentatious.Stan ChunWellingtonNew Zealand
