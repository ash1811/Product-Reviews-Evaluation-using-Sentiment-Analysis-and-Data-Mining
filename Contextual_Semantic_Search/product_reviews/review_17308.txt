I wear a size 7.5 to 8 depending on the shoe- bought a size 8 and it fits great. This is my second pair of this type of sandal. My first ones broke after a year and an unfortunate accident involving bleach and tripping. So right away I was on Amazon looking for a twin- easily found it, reasonably priced. Love these shoes. Durable. fit well. comfortable.
