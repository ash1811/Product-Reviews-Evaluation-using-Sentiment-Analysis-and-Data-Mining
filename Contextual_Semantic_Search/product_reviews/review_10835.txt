This shoe is basically the same shoe that Florsheim sells as the &#34;Riva&#34;  The only difference that I can see is one has &#34;Florsheim&#34; printed inside and the other has &#34;Bostonian.  The difference in price is astonishing.  The Riva is $110.00.  I have been wearing &#34;Rivas&#34; for 15 years so I know the shoe.
