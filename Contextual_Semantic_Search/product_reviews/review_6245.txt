If your waist size is larger than 42&#34; I would think twice about ordering this &#34;one size fits all&#34; belt. My waist is 44&#34; and the belt will barely fit around me and buckle. I kept it because I am losing weight and it does seem to be of good quality. The buckle is easy to secure and doesn't loosen although I did have the buckle end tear out due to it's small size and not being properly secured. I re-did it and I'm watching to see if this will be a problem. I&#34;m wearing it with Dickies scrubs for work and it looks fine.I would recommenr this belt to anyone with a waist size of 42&#34; or less.
