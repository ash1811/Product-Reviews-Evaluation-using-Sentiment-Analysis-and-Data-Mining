I began using Shoe Goo on my tennis and running shoes in 1983. Since then, new uses have emerged every week or so. I keep a few extra tubes in the workshop because it is durable, pliable and waterproof and a valuable asset in many hobbies. It will adhere to any clean surface that's not coated in oil, grease, paint thinner or acetone. The important thing is to clean the threads on the tube and the cap after each use and it will last for months. I use a small rag dampened with acetone or mineral spirits to clean the tube and cap after each use.Before I apply Shoe Goo, I clean whatever I'm "gooing" with 91% Isopropyl alcohol.For a quick and effective repair, the uses are endless.  I've used it on vehicles, ATVs, outdoor electrical projects and small construction projects when I didn't need an entire tube of caulking sealant or adhesive.Just recently, I attached a 2-inch wide nylon strap to the sole of a pair of tennis shoes to use with exercise latex bands.  The sole of the shoes will rip off before the strap comes loose.If this stuff will secure a loose sole onto a running shoe and allow for another 100 miles or so, what else can it do?  You name it.I keep both black and original on hand.
