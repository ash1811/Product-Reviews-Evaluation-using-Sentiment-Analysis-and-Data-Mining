I ordered these earrings and received tons of compliments. I love them. The blue topaz is vibrant. Then one day I lost one of the earrings! I was so devastated I had to order another pair. They are so affordable-- that was not a problem at all! These feel so high quality, not chintzy at all. They look GREAT with denim and also are fabulous when dressing up. Very versatile. I LOVE these earrings and they are even prettier than the photo depicts.  You won't be disappointed.
