I love these pants; they are far more versatile and comfortable than jeans and are cooler than tired old khakis. My only gripe is that there is room for quality control improvements with regards to sizing. I bought these in three different colors, and two of them fit similarly, but the third is quite a bit slimmer. I've found this to be the case throughout the 511 line. No matter; I highly recommend them.
