The bag is HUGE!!! I am very happy with the size, but it is hard to use for school books as it does not provide any comfort to your shoulders, it'd be great for overnight/travel/one class, but multiple books will be a little painful! I do love the bag, and the color(smoke) and would definitely recommend this product
