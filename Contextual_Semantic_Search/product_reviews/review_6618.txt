The size chart on Amazon lead me to believe that I could pull of a small/medium, but when I received the tights, I realized that I should have gone up to the bigger size because I am 5'8&#34; and 115 pounds.  They are still great tights and the quality is awesome.  I am a clutz and I don't believe that I can put a run in these.  Really nice tights.
