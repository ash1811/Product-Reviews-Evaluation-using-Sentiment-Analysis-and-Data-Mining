So typical for so many companies I see these days advertising a &#34;pouch&#34;.  this one has a slight pouch, but not much more.  Your jewels too get a but crammed.  I am used to Obviously and Ergowear, two companies that know how to make a pouch.  Not this one.  The fit of the thong though is nice.  The medium I bought fit the waist nice and the strap was comfortable.  I would give 5 stars if the pouch were bigger though.
