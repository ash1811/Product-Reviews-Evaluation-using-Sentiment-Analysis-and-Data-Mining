I have been wearing Gold Toe a long time, but these socks were not made well. The threads are not tight, with some spaces not woven well. They also shrink when washed (and I do wash them in COLD water), and I need to stretch them with my hands before putting them on. They were also expensive for an Amazon sock product. A waste of money.
