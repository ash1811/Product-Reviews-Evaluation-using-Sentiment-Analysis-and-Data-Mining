These are a few dollars more than the socks I can get locally that say they are the same fabric.  When I got these ones I was shocked.  This fabric is 100x nicers that the ones I have.  This is just a wonderful sock.  I like fleece ones but they have heavy seams.  These ones do not have that.  I love these socks.  You will not be disapointed this is sheer luxury.  I got some other colors also, but will be ordering more black ones.  I am sick and these things are a great comfort for my daily wear.Match them to the color of the croc so the cros are more subtle and the color that shows throught the holes is the same color of the crocs.  These socks are loose, but not too loose.  Just perfect.
