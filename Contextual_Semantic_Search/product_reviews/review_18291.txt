I wear a 8 1/2 shoe and bought the 9, which fit snugly. Definitely get a half size larger.Pros:  super warm. Whatever the furry lining is, fake, Chinese, whatever, it is really warm. I can go outside and get the paper at 30 degrees, no socks needed.Seems like tough soles, ready for anything. Holding up ok after two monthsof use.  They are also very comfortable.Cons: possibly too warm.  My feet start to sweat after a couple hours inside with room temp. Also the looks leave something to be desired. They are clearly your grampa's slippers--not cute,stylish or anything else.These cons are not a big issue for me hence the good rating.  For the price, these are great winter slippers.
