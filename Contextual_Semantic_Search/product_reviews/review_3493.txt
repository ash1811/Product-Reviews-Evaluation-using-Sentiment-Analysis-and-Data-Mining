Wacoal doesn't make the style I've been wearing anymore but this new style is a good substitute. It fits well, is true to size and quite comfortable...for a bra, that is. I like this style as well as the old style. Kinda nice to have a change. This is a good everyday bra...should last a long time. Wacoal makes good quality, good fitting bras that wear well. A bit pricey but worth it. I got the white but would like to get the other colors when they become available.
