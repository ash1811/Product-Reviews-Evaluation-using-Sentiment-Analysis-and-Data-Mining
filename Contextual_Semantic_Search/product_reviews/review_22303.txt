Although these shoe covers look like all the others out there, as a Realtor, I'd say this is false advertising to call them "Large", and Amazon doesn't seem to offer an "Extra Large" option.  Mostly women and children were able to fit these on their shoes, but not men, so they aren't of much use at my open houses.  Com'n Amazon!  Read all the reviews and amp up the sizing option.
