I seem to be buying watches more often these days.  One reason is because my partner is very hard on them, and this Christmas I decided to go with something a little more rugged and purchased the G-shock.  Not only is the watch well put together, but it also looks great and is very easy to use.  If you need a watch that can stand up to the abuse of being knocked around everyday, than this is the product for you.  I also don't expect to be buying another watch to replace this one next year ;)
