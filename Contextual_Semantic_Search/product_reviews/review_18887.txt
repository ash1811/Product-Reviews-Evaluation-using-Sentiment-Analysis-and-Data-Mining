I am a fairly fashionable person, and have fought getting a pair of these for years, because I just didn't like the style of them, and saw them as a passing fad.  I regret not buying these earlier.  They are a fantastic pair of boat shoes.  They go with khakis, jeans, shorts, anything.  The colors are true, and they fit perfectly.
