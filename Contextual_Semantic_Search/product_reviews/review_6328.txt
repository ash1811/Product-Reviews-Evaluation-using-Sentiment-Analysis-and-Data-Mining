Apparently, a great value (can't speak to long-term durability).  From previous comments, I gathered that I should order one size smaller, and it worked out perfectly.  These sweatshirts are apparently marketed by various distributors and possibly even different manufacturers under the Hanes label.  Mine came from &#34;Hippo tails&#34;.  Addressing other complaints I read about (different manufacturers?&#34;, I bought one to check the fit at one size smaller (XL), then bought two more XLs in a later order.  All the ones I bought were 90% cotton and were very soft when worn next to skin.  Washing shrinkage wasn't all that noticeable.
