First reaction is it is a good slipper, warm and comfortable.  From past experience I get slippers a bit smaller than my regular shoe size because I've never had a slipper that didn't stretch and in a short time fit loosely. This slipper fits like expected, except maybe a bit more narrow than expected.  I can't seem to keep the laces tied. No problems with quality so far, I will update if that changes.
