I love these slippers. Whenever I am at home they are on my feet. They feel wonderful on my feet after spending 12 or more hours on my feet. They do run a little large but I am just going to order the next size smaller. I have really wide feet and I normally have to go the next size larger to get things that fit but not with these. I am going to buy some as gifts and give them to my whole family for their birthdays and Christmas. I am also ordering a pair for the man in my life for his birthday. He is going to love them.
