This bra seems to run small.  I ordered this in the size that all my bras are in and this sports bra seemed slightly small.  I like the fact that it has the cups because it keeps everything held down firm! Other plain sports bras without the cups just squeeze me to death and aren't comfortable.  I think you might want to order up in the band size.  I ordered the 36 D, and I think a 38 D would have been better.
