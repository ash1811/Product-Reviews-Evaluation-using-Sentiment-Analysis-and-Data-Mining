These onezies are made of nice cotton (thicker and softer than usual).  They are a little wider (around the trunk) than the ones from Old Navy.  The opening around the neck is a bit wide and when you put the baby's head through it, the fabric folds that form the opening (on the shoulders) do not close up nicely. They tend to bunch up. The snaps are better than on the cheaper Gerber onezies, but not as nice as the Old Navy ones.  Overall these onezies are better than the ones from Gerber but not as great as the Old Navy ones.
