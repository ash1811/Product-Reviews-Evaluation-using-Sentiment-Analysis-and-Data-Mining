These 550 relaxed fit jeans look good, but the waist was way too tight.  Levi's jeans shorts ordered about the same time -- same waist size -- fit perfectly.  Go figure -- and so much for the relaxed fit.  Items like jeans that can be tricky to fit may be best purchased in a retail store where you can try then on.  These 550's are on their way back to Amazon.
