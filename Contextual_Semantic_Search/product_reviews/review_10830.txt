As at least one previous reviewer had noted, these shoes come just a little too high at the ankle, which made wearing them, even for a few minutes, too uncomfortable.  They're nicely made and were exactly as advertised (other than a little larger than I expected based on my usual size).  But because of the height issue I couldn't imagine wearing them even through a single day.
