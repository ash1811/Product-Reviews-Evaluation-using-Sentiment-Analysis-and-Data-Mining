I purchase this bag, and a LARGE from another seller. However, I thought I was receiving two different sizes, but they are BOTH LARGE! For travelling, this is a perfect size, for everyday use, it is too large. I thought it would be a medium, but it is large, exact size  of the other one. I need to return this one and get one that is truly MEDIUM.
