For the past few years I've been buying GAP relaxed fit jeans and paying well over twice what these Lee jeans cost.The Lee jeans fit me perfectly, are extremely comfortable and sized accurately. I can't imagine what else I would want from a pair of jeans.From now on I'll be ordering my jeans directly from Amazon and saving myself quite a bit of money.
