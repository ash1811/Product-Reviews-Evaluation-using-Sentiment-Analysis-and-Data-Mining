My wife has worn Thorlo socks for a log time and I never could understand why she spent so much extra for them.  That is, until I bought my first pair.  Within days I ordered seven more because they are, by far, the most comfortable socks I've ever worn.  The Lite Running style has the padding exactly where I want it -- the toes and heel area -- without adding bulk where I don't need the padding.  I'm now going to try the men's dress socks (my wife also ordered a pair of women's dress socks to try).  Thorlo's web site will send you a pair to try for $6 shipping, so that's a great way to experience the socks for the first time at minimal cost.  Read the reviews.  These socks seem to last forever.
