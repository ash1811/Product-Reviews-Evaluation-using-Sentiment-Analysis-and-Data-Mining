I bought these last year.  I never wore them because the seams are sewn badly, with knots inside and pressing on my foot instead of knots on the outside.  The leather also folds inward near the edge.  It's like they are only allowed a certain amount of &#34;thread&#34; and they just have to finish even if it is wrong.
