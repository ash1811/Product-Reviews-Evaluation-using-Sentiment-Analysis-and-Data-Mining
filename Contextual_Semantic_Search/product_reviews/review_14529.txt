For the first half of this year I suffered with Plantar Fasciitis and Metatarsal Stress syndrome(a bone fracture).  My foot was improving slowly, until I discovered Birkenstock shoes.  I noticed that the orthotics that the specialist had made just for me, looked like the foot bed in Birkenstocks.  Sure nuff!!!  I bought me my first Birkenstock sandal and within 3 days I could tell a hugh difference in the pain subsiding.  I now wear Birkenstocks everyday.  Bought these so I could wear socks with them.  I love my Birkenstocks.  I now own 4 pair and will be buying more.  My foot pain is gone!!
