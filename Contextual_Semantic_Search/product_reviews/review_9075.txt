This is my second pair of these and I love them - and so I already knew what I was getting when I ordered online.The price seems to be the same everywhere- meaning there are not better deals online - so buy in a store if you don't know the fit and want to try on.Also - not sure if this review is for the individual color I ordered - or the jean style in general - but you should note that in addition to being different colors (obviously), the fabric finishes may vary - and thus the fit will be slightly different depending on which color you buy. For example I ordered the grey color - which is a stiffer rougher denim than usual.
