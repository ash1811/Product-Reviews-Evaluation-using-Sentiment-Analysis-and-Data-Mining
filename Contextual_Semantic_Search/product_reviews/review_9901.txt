When I get any kind of shirt, jacket whatever I have a recurring issue that either the sleeves are too short, or the length of the shirt is too short (doesn't go far enough past my waist). Since this doesn't have sleeves obviously that wasn't an issue, but I was worried it would be too short. I was pleasantly surprised however when it arrived and it was actually the perfect length! The tank top is 30in long! This thing is PERFECT for any guy who is slim but tall, actually having the tank top reach down far enough so I can reach up to the sky and NOT have it show my stomach, while not being baggy because I had to go a size up, SO NICE.
