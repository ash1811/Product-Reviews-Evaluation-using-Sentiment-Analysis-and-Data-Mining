I was on a hunt for the best pair of sandals I could find. I went to a store and actually bought both a single-layer pair of Rainbow sandals and a pair of Olukai Ohana sandals at the same time so I could try them out. After trying both of them for a few weeks, I just didn't feel like either of them were &#34;the one.&#34; The single-layer Rainbows left something to be desired with comfort and the Ohana sandals were comfortable, except they were a bit bulky and caused a sore on the top of my foot.So, based on a recommendation, I opted for a pair of double-layer Rainbow sandals. I couldn't find the double-layer version in any local stores so I ordered them online and I am so glad I did! The difference was night and day! That extra layer of cushioning goes a long way in adding comfort to every step. I live in an urban area, so I'm generally walking on unforgiving sidewalks, and these have been great! They're incredibly durable, stylish, and they fit like a glove. Plus, the quality materials are backed by a great guarantee from Rainbow.I wear a size 12.5-13 shoe, and it was suggested to me that I order a bit smaller so they would stretch to my foot size. The XL size was a tad tight at first, but after wearing them for a while they fit perfectly! I highly recommend these sandals!
