I thought this was supposed to be a fairly high end and durable clothing line for working class people? first I have to return a pair of carpenter jeans because the leg width is laughably big - seriously, like clown pants. and now I have a tshirt that has little holes and looks faded after only a handful of washes. a $4 dollar hanes tagless t-shirt holds up better.
