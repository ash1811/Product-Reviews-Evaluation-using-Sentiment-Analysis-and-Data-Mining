First off these things are soft as hell on the inside and it feels great wearing them. Downside, I am 6 foot tall 190 lbs with a 31 inch waist. I ordered the 32x32 and the problem is that I had to cut off the adjustment hardware all together just to make them fit. They were riding a little high on the boys if you know what I mean. With the adjustment things removed they work just fine for me. I would say order a 34x34 or 34x32 but then they are going to be a bit long and it might not add any extra strap length. So tall lean muscular guys or gals? Be repaired to do some minor modifications. I bought these as a joke, since I am from Alabama and everyone out west thinks this is what everyone back home wears. Now I am in love though and I wear them often.
