I purchased the X-Large bag and this bag is huge!  I purchased it to put my sports equipment inside and should have purchased the Large bag instead.  I have loaded the bag with all of my martial arts gear and still the bag is too big.  I have all my sparring gear which includes a set of boxing gloves, 2 sets of 4-oz gloves, head protection, leg gear, Thai pads, various hand wraps, and a large gi.  I also have some extra dry clothes in there and there is room for much more.  The material of the bag is a little on thin side.  The bag will not hold its shape unless you fully load the bag.  I am really happy with this bag and will purchase the Large sized bag.
