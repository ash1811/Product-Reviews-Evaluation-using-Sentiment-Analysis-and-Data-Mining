My husband has been wearing this brand and style for several years. They can be difficult to find in his size, so I was pleased to find these at such a great price. These are great fitting jeans that hold up very well. My husband is a rancher who puts his denim thru a work out. He will typically wear a pair of these jeans for a couple of years before the knees give out. He's caught them on barb wire and everything else and they really do hold up well. They do fade fairly fast, but I do wash his denim with frequency since he wears them daily. I am very happy with these jeans and will continue buying them for him!
