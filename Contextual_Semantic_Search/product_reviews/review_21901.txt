This is a good liner to add to your baby's swimwear.  The fit is a little bulky on my 19 pound son, even though the elastic around the waist digs into his skin leaving a red rash.  I don't think this is the perfect fit.  I wanted to love this.. but I just don't.  I probably won't order any more of these.
