I'm loving this watch.It's just as shown in the picture.I'm 54 years old and wanted a watch that would make easier for me to see the time even without my glasses on.This is the one. The anti-reflective coating on the mineral crystal really works, the black dial combined with the white hands and time markers allow you to see the time precisely.I'm used to wear my watch at all times, When I'm at the gym, When I'm swiming, etc. and it's of utermost importance the watch is 100% waterproof. The 330ft waterproof feature is just perfect for me. Few women's watches have that feature.It's not a mid size watch though it's rather small: 6mm thick, 2.4 diameter total, and 1.9mm diameter, just the black dial alone.Not having to replace batteries of course is a plus, also because once the watch has been opened for battery replacement, the waterproof feature in most watches I've had goes away...Great price, wonderful timepiece!UPDATE July 12, 2008:I've had this watch on my wrist long enough now. Just wanted you all to know it works as great as the day I got it. Precise time display, no leakage (I swim with it). Just perfect!!!
