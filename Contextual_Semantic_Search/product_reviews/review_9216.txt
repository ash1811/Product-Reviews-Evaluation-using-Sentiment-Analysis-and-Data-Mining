I love Anne Klein watches.  I bought this one on impulse as I was browsing through Gold Box deals.  I love the rectangular face of the watch and I like having a watch that is silver and gold because it goes with all my jewelry.  It is a classy watch and looks like it is more expensive than it really was.  I also am tickled that it has the double clasp so you can make it into a bracelet watch or have it tight on your wrist, as you wish.  This is one purchase I am delighted I made, a gift to myself!
