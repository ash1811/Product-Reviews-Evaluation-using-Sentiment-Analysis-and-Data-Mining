I work retail and am on my feet most of the day, so shoes don't last me very long.  The last pair I bought only made it 3 months so I hoping for better out of these.  My initial impressions are as follows.  Not as dressy in person, ok for pants and a tie, but a little under-dressed for a suit.  Also its not all that apparent but the leather has a wrinkled look, I was expecting a smooth leather.  I just hope they last longer than sketchers, those last me a few months at best before the upper starts pealing.
