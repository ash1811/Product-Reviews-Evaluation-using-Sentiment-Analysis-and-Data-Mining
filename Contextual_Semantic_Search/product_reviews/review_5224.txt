I love this wallet!  It has a lot of compartments, but somehow it is fairly lightweight.  The red color and design are just gorgeous.  I guess these went on sale just at the right time for me.  It's been a few months now, and the quality is excellent.One little weird comment which some people might find helpful:  the coin purse section is large enough to hold lip moisturizer!  This means if I switch the wallet to another purse, I don't forget the lip moisturizer.
