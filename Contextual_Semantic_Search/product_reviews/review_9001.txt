It's probably been 25 years since I bought any Levi shrink-to-fit jeans, and I'm really sorry I bought these. I have no trouble wearing any brand 32x32 jeans, but these shrink to fit 32x32 are way too small, too tight. And worst of all they come out horribly wrinkled. I bought two pairs on clearance for $14/pair, but what good is that if they're too small to wear? I doubt I can return them since I washed them but I'm going to try. Not recommended. Jeans have really changed, and these are a giant step backwards. Very disappointed.
