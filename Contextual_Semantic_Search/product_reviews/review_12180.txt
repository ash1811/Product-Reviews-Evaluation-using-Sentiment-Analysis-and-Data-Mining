Stout boots.  Medium agressive tread picks up our red clay when it has been raining - as you should expect it to of course.  Not heavy.  Easy enough to use as a slip-on when laced up only part way.  Plenty of ankle support when laced up all the way.  Good fit and feel - smooth inside.  Snug with heavy socks.Waterproof only up to bottom eyelet.  Tongue is not connected to sides beyond that.  Feet will probably get wet in water more than 2 1/2 to 3 inches deep.
