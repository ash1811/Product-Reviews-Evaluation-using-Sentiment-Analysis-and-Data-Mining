The watch is very small. The face is about the size of a quarter, and the band is thinner than a half an inch. Some people say they can't see the date displayed on the watch, but I think those people might need to get their eyes checked. The date display is small, but plenty big enough to see if you have the right glasses prescription. Some people say the glowing wasn't bright enough, but I think it's great. I hate when it glows too bright to the point where it looks like you're trying to take down an aircraft with your watch. You can't see it glowing if you're in broad daylight.
