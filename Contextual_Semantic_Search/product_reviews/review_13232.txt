I love my Playtex Secrets Cottony Gel Comfort Strap Underwire bra. I wear size 38DDD so I absolutely love the Gel Comfort Strap. It is a real life saver. It takes almost all of the pressure off of my shoulders. Which is a huge relief. The cups fit me well, but there are not as thick as I would have liked them to be. They have no padding at all. With some thin shirts you can see my nipples. Nevertheless, I will be buying more. The wires provide excellent support and for my lifestyle that is a must. There is no digging in or any of that "muffin top". Most importantly, I don't fall out when I bend over. These are my favorite bras so far but I am going to keep looking for some with thicker cups.
