I liked it, but I felt the cup size was too big! I don't know if it's the style or what, but I am 5'5 and 250 pounds, and size 40B bra. And I felt like..the cup size was too big. It's not my favorite bra, and I didn't notice the memory &#34;contour&#34; aspect of the bra...The color is pretty. Just too big in cup size.
