I purchased this as a surprise for my husband.As soon as i opened the discreet amazon packaging i saw that the material used was very cheap polyester, and not what i had expected for the $35 i had payed. It was also hopelessly wrinkled.I was on the smaller side of the 1X/2X and the chemise fit me strangely. The open back was pretty and a neat idea, but it fit too large on me, also the adjustable strings kept getting in our way. Contrary to the body being too large, the bust was too small, it smashed my breasts down in a very unflattering way which made it look like my nipples hung to my hips! I was not a fan of the chemise, but then again, I had only purchased the product with the robe in mind.The robe was nice. Easy fit, very comfortable, looks good. I loved it so much that I would use it to just lounge around the house. Then I started noticing black smudges being left on every thing i touched. It was only when i took the robe off in the light of the day that i realized that every skin imperfection was now black and i was covered in little black dots! the dye had rubbed onto my skin! Another confirmation of the poor quality of my product.Had I not spent as much as I did on the product, I would have been much more accepting of the quality and its imperfections, The good things i have to say, are not about the actual quality of the product.Delivery was very speedy, arrived days before estimated delivery, in very discreet packaging. (and I live in the middle of nowhere)Im sure this would be a good product for some one who had a bit fuller figure, and did not have very large breasts and was "perky" (mine are not due to breastfeeding). Just keep in mind the quality of the material, that's what disappointed me most.
