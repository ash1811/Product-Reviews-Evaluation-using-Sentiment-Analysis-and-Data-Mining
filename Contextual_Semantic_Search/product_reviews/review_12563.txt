This were purchased for a reason other than to hold up pants...but they work great anyway!  (I needed to find a way to hold a &#34;pet blanket&#34; in place on the back seat of our jeep.  My husband removed the metal fastener in the center, giving me two extra large fasteners that hold the blanket in place nicely, protecting the back seat from dirty dog feet.  I purchased 2 of these suspenders so actually have 4 extra large fasteners holding the blanket in place.  Sometimes I come up with a good idea that actually works!)
