I ordered these as part of a &#34;quest&#34; if you will, to find the perfect workout shirt. This shirt runs larger than I would have liked and I don't wear it. I wish I had returned it during the order return period. That said, the quality appears to be good and it's hard for me to knock the manufacturer for me not really knowing if I was a L or M in their shirts.***Be advised that the Medium was too tight for me in the cotton variety but the performance fabric version in size Medium fits perfectly and is an amazing product!***
