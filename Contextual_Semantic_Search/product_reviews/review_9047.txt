These khakis are amazing - they fit well and are extremely comfortable to wear all day. Nice business casual look to it, goes well with shirts and polos. The design is probably a hybrid between traditional Dockers khakis and denims. What I particularly like is that these fit like denims around the waste giving an overall slimmer look, but fall towards the bottom somewhat like trousers. This, in my opinion, is what makes them great for business casual dressing. The added coin pocket is a bonus, not a fan of carrying coins in regular trouser pockets.I have bought several of these in different colors and have realized that the sizing can be slightly off based on the color you get. For example, the Dusty Khaki is made from a thinner material so my regular size (32x30) fits me perfectly. But with the Trunk color, the fabric is slightly more matte-ish or closer to denim's thickness (may be the fabric itself or the dye used to color the fabric). As a result, I have to go one size up in the Trunk color.
