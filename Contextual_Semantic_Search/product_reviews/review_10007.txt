I have only had this for a few days, so I can't give a great, in-depth review - but so far it seems well made and it's nice a comfy.The only complaint I have (and it's really not much of a complaint) is the sizes seem to run just a little on the large size. If you are going for a fitted fit, I might recommend going down a size.
