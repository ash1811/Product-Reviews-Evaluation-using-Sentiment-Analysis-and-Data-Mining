The construction is good and it will keep the sun off your neck. I gave it three starts because the size adjustment is a draw string in the back that both sits on the back of your head and gets bigger as you reduce the size of the head band. For me, a guy with a fairly big head, it was still a noticeable problem so if you have to draw it down much you're going to have a big knot of material poking you and the base on your head. Any movement or wind also had the side flaps flowing out so much that it was reducing the ability for the flap to provide sun coverage to my ears. If you're looking down or bent over doing whatever you're doing in no wind, you should be good to go but any wind, walking, etc. (and you're going to be getting a combination of those) will result in reduced effectiveness. It's ok, I guess but I would not buy it again.
