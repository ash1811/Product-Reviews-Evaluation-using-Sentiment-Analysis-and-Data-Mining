This is the third Pathfinder I have owned - All three have been great watches, with one minor exception and hopefully this watch will change that -This watch is a SOLAR watch which IS NOT supposed to require battery replacement - If that is true, then all should be good - Because, on the replacement of batteries, you can't do it yourself - You can try, but very doubtful if you will get the watch to function normally again -One last thing on Pathfinder watches - Take them off when in the shower, the soap buildup from after a few years will jam up the mechanisms for the different functions of the watch -
