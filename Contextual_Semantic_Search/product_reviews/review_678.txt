Great gown and the material is wonderful. Bought the red and petal pink. Red bold, pink deep. These are quality. Little long bare foot, but perfect length in slippers. 5'3&#34; Will come back and purchase other colors and from this company bought darker colors due to not wanting to be sheer looking in the light. These are what I wanted. Wash delicate HE machine and use Tyler detergent. Hang to air dry. Then quick fluff in air HE dryer. Wonderfull in feel and fragrance.
