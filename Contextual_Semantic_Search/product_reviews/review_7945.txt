I purchased this visor to replace one I thought I had lost.  Fortunately I found it!  This visor is small, short and white under the bill.  It does not protect my face from sun and the white reflects the glare into my eyes.  My original visor is about 2 inches longer at the bill and black underneath.  This one is for kids!!!
