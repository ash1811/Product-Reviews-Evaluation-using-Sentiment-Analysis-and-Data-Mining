These shoes are a classic. I bought them 6 months ago and I wear them every week (at least once a week). In my opinion, these shoes are meant to be used with suits. Anyother outfit would make them see out of place and ordinary, but with a nice suit, these are really elegant.The only &#34;but&#34; is that they are not THAT comfortable.
