They fit great. I even have some muscular legs that can be hard to fit, but they're awesome. I'm 5'7", weigh about 140, wear a size 6, and the medium fits perfectly. If it's extra cold, You can pull the leg bottom down past your ankle so no skin is exposed. I don't know it anyone else has tried it, but I live in Minnesota and run in absurdly cold temps and these work just great.
