I love these slippers !!! I recently had surgery on my foot and these slippers are exactly  what i needed after getting out of the post op shoe and gigantic dressing. They can be adjusted with velcro across the top to make snug enough for secure footing and accommodate swelling. The footbed is soft and supportive and the sole is safe and sturdy!  Where have you been all my lifeACORN Women's New Spa Slide Slipper Powder Blue,Large Med,(8-9 M US)???? Ahhhhh :-) I would recommend these for anyone regardless of surgery or not.
