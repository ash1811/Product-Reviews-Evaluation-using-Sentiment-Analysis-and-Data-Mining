Nice watch.  Not too big, not to small.  As noted in other reviews, hard to read the digital date around 6:30.  For me that is not a problem as I normally just read the position of the hands.A couple of complaints:1)  The band seems somewhat short.  I'm not that big a guy but have the buckle through  the third to the last hole.2)  Setting the date can be frustrating because there is no facility to go back is you pass the desire date.Otherwise, I am happy with its function.
