Bought at my significant other's request, and I turned out to like it more than him. Not only are they cute and a flattering cut, but the lace is a charming pattern and the feel is comfortable against your skin. Too often those skimpy string-thongs start to chafe, but wearing this pair throughout the day you end up forgetting it's there. Great for under tight dresses or other clothes that show panty-lines.
