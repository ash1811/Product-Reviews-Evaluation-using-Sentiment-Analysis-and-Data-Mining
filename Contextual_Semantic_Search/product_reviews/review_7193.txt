These will do the job on small scuffs and everyday wear and tear marks. Just dont expect them to much more. After trying to remove a few light marks from grease or mud, i found these to be ineffective. They are only ok at some of these types of marks. I would recommend for light wear but these just dont cut it for anything more intense.
