I've had many types of Minnetonka Mocs but these were my first Moose ones.  I'll never buy any other kind!  Hardly know they are on my feet and truly soft.  Love the hard sole and wear them out and about as well as for house shoes.  I wear a size 10 and while they fit a bit tightly when I first started wearing them, within days they broke in.  Beware though... I wore some thick socks during cold weather and they stretched out a little more.  Now almost floppy with regular socks.Moose Mocs are the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn in my life!  (hate to wear any other kind)
