I bought it to remove the back of my watch. All it did was scratch it up. It won't stay in place while you try to apply the necessary force to unscrew. It slips and slides around and you are constantly readjusting it back to the size required. In the end, I gave up and took it to a jeweler who removed it within seconds. It looks nice but it is worthless.
