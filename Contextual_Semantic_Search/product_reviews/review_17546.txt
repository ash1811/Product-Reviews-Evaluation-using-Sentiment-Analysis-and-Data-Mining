How did this get such good reviews? SO SMELLY, a real drawback for a product that is supposed to go over your face. I got the brown and it is truly the most unattractive color ever. I've never been able to bring myself to wear it but my friend used it once (during NEMO in Boston) and he did think it was pretty warm.
