Very nice boot.  The boots are heavy, but that's probably a good thing for the snow.  These boots are very warm and seem to be durable.  Sizing - I ordered a 1/2 size larger than I normally wear in shoes, and they fit well.  Overall, I am satisfied with these boots and would recommend them to others!
