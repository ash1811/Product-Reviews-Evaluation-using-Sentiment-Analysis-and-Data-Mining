a great little watch.  I'm a 50 odd year old woman, petite frame and I like my watches to fit loosely; this watch fits like a  regular ladies watch does, with two buckle holes to spare.  The dial is large enough for me to see it without my glasses and small enough to look feminine.  Indiglo is great, and all of this overshadows the fact that the band isn't genuine leather.  I agree with some of the other reviews, Amazon should change the description, however synthetic band or no, this watch is a great little watch and a good value.  It therefore deserves a five star rating.
