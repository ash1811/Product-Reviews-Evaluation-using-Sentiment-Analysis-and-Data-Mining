My teenage son has big feet & is picky about socks.He LOVES these because they are medium thickness & soft like sports socks.There is enough cotton to be soft & enough elastic to remain stretchy.I wash in hot water on heavy & these socks are holding up perfectly!My son said he will ONLY wear these from now on.
