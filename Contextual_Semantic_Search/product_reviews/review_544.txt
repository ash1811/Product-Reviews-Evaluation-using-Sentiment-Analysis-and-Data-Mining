This is the 2nd time I have purchased this wallet.  I love it!!  It has two places for folding money and a divided coin purse.  It also has many slots for credit cards and other cards you need to keep up with.  It also has a place for your driver's license.  Buxton makes a good, quality product at a very reasonable price.
