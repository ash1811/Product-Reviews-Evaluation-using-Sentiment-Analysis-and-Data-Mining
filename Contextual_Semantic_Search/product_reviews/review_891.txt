I bought this brand and Danskin tights to see if there would be a difference in quality (I haven't been big on Hanes, as a brand, before), rather than stock up on a bunch of colors in one brand.I'm glad I did it this way, as I won't buy these again.  They ended up getting a run the very first night I wore them, then they just tore into a hole.For starters, I didn't even like the way they felt.  They didn't stretch well (I have big hips and bought the size supposedly appropriate for me, according to the chart), and they were too snug around my upper thighs, of all places.  It's like they designed it for children's legs.. very runway model, ignoring that women's thighs are typically bigger than their calves.And they were SO THIN, I might as well have shaved and wore nothing.  I bought white because I was hoping to get some white sheer like the picture, but it was nothing like that.  So don't expect these to hide any hair/blemishes you have on your legs, or even look like you're wearing white tights.The only reason I can think of that this gets two stars rather than one is the price and I'm pretty sure they arrived when expected.
