LOVE the material, because not the shiny &#34;racer&#34; fabric; for me they slide down on the waist and pull the undies with them a tad doing weight machines, so I'm going to order a medium just to compare.  I'm a 10/11 and had to order the large because afraid initially they'd be too tight in the medium. 5'8&#34; tall.
