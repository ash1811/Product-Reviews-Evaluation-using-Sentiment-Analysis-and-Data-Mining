This is a review of the Crimson color distressed nylon bag, extra small.I have major back problems and chronic pain, and went on a search for a lighter everyday bag. This is perfect. I work in a casual office and can carry this everywhere without worry that it won't be suitable. I have a smaller clutch that I use for occasions that call for more formal attire.While not one of those women who carries around everything but the kitchen sink, I am still amazed at how much I can fit into this bag. Everything that was in my regular purse fits in here, with room to spare. What's more, this bag is noticeably lighter than my purse, which is precisely what I needI agree with other reviewers that the inner water bottle holder is small. However, it does a great job of holding my sunglasses, which is more useful to me for daily use.The only negative is the small, narrow size of the two outer pockets. I love the magnetic closures, but the so-called cell phone pocket is too small for my iPhone with Otterbox case. Instead, I use it for my little pill container. I haven't put anything in the smaller side pocket; seems to small for most things.Other reviewers have rightly pointed out that this is NOT the classic bag, no matter what the advertisement says. It's the newer HBB-evo bag. That doesn't bother me, but it may bother someone else, so I think it's worth mentioning. If you look closely at the picture of the crimson bag, it shows only one flap pocket on the side. There are actually two.I guess I'm so impressed with the overall weight and function of this bag that the outer flap pocket design is really not a big deal. For an organized person like me who strongly believes there should be a place for everything and that everything should be in its place, this is almost perfect.
