This shoes are very nice, I bought them in Tan snake color and are really pretty.  Certainly because of the brand they are very comfortable though these ones  maybe a bit big. I already have another pair of the same brand in size  8.5 and they fit very well, nevertheless these are  lightly big.  They are ideal to walk comfortably
