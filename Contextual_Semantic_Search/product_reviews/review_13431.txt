I tried this as my sole wallet for a few days and found that it simply did not meet my needs.  I went back to a fat bifold, and found that didn't either.  The balance I found that works perfectly is to keep everything I need for walking around in this slim front pocket wallet - my ID, train pass, door tags, and pocket cash - and keep the cards and &#34;well maybe I need it today&#34; things in the bifold in my bag.  This keep the bulges out of my clothes while letting me have all my essentials on hand.
