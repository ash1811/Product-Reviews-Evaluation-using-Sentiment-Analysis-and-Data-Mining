I think the current fashion of so-called &#34;shorts&#34; that come down to the knee to be utterly ridiculous, both in terms of function and appearance. If you have thigh muscles, those idiotic &#34;shorts&#34; will cling and bind on the front of your legs when you've worked up a sweat. Shorts are worn to keep cool in the heat, and the longer the short, the less cool they are, even if those preoccupied with appearance think they are &#34;cool.&#34;These are real gym shorts. They have a six inch inseam. For function and comfort, four inches or less would be better, but I can't find any except for women. They have no pockets&#8212;why would you want a pocket in shorts intended for exercise and sports?The waistband is sturdy elastic and may be adequate to hold them up without the drawstring, and still comfortable. They are durable &#8212;I've had three pairs in constant use for about five years, and they barely show it. Very comfortable for strenuous activity or lounging.
