For the money, Timex is hard to beat for the features provided.  Timex's "Indiglo" dial lighting is hands-down the best in the watch industry.  This is a sturdy, basic feature watch that will last for years if properly cared for...Several "common-sense" things to consider - water resistant is not water proof.  Don't get this watch wet, don't shower with it, don't swim with it, don't submerge it PERIOD.  It will fail.  Only the very best "divers" watches costing hundreds of dollars with "water proof" guarantees to specific depths should be allowed in a wet environment.  If you have a very big or very small wrist, don't buy this watch - the expansion band isn't adjustable and will have to be replaced if you don't have an average size wrist.This will be my travel watch because it is easy to read in the dark and if it is lost of broken I am out less than 30 dollars.  I highly recommend Timex Indiglo watches - trust me, if you are not a "brand" or high-dollar watch snob, this is a great watch for you.
