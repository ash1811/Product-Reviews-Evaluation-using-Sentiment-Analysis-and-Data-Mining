I've worn this bra as an everyday bra for a few years now and I like it because it is very reasonably priced, provides great support, is durable and gives a nice look under clothes. I wear a 34D and, as the ones I had were wearing out, I purchased a 34D. When I received it, I found the band EXTREMELY tight. I could just BARELY hook it. I should have sent it back but I didn't, I just ordered a 36D. Surprisingly, the band of the 36D was also tight on the last set of hooks. Not TOO tight I decided, as a little more tightness gives some extra lift and support and after wearing and washing the elastic will have some more give. I have found that to be true and I am happy with it and will buy another one. I would suggest that anyone buying this bra probably should go up a band size. Also, the straps are not adjustable but I have never found that to be a problem.
