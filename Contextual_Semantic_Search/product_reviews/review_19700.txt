While I've been warned by other bikini competitors that these types of shoes will be tight at first until they stretch, these are not only way tight and uncomfortable...the toe is shaped extremely odd and extends way out in a pointy fashion. The strap across the toes is even more odd and seems like the shoes are rejects??? Not pleased at all. And of course, I'm expected to pay the return shipping.
