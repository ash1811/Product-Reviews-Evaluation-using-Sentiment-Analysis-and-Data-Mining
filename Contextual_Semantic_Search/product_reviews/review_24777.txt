"Poncho Liners are part of my household, open-trail adventures like, Camping, Guiding, Hiking, Spelunking and other uses. They keep you Warm during Cold weather and Cool during the Summer, there isn't anything else that comes close to these products. If You take good care of them, they will take great care of you, when you need them. I became a fan from my old Army Jungle days and would give them 6 Stars, if I could!" * Has many uses and also makes an Excellent PET Blanket!
