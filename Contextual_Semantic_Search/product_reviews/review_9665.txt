Fit is o.k.I own some ``normal`` Wrangler Cowboy Cut Jeans- this George Strait Superitem is thinner than my cowboy cut jeans and have very poor and faded color.The fabric is well made, therefore 2 points.To this poor color don't fit indigo jacket cause pants color is too poor and faded. Can't go out with this jean.Color in the ad is better/darker than real.The Material is thin- nothing about heavyweight on it!Living in germany there is no chance to return, but for this -Is'nt worth the money- item i switched to carhartt jeans.
