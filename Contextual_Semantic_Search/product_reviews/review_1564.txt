Carhartt is a great brand for sweatshirts, which I own 3.  I thought I would try their t-shirts and I wasn't disappointed.  The first thing was the length was perfect for me.  I am 6'1&#34; and hate shirts that I can't tuck in because they are too short.  LL Bean is a good example of being too short.  Second the pocket is as well made as the shirt.  Great product.
