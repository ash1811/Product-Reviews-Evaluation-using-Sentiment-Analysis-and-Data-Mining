What can I say... my daughters have it in orange, black, white and pink and I am thinking to buy for they the fuccia one. It is a very good way for exalt a dancer outfit: great colors, comfortable, looks great, easy to wear, durables and little girls love it. I think it is a great buy for costumer and play too.
