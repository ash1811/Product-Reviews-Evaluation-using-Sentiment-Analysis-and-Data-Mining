I have been wearing the Reef Flip Flops with the thin band since 1998.  I LOVE THEM.  The thinner band that is soft and flat makes them SUPER comfortable.  These flip flops have an arch support in them, which is hard to find in a flip flop.  The arch support combined with the soft band, makes you feel like you aren't wearing anything.  Plus, unlike other flip flops, which hardly have any sole grip and the bottom and can be slippery, these have a great textured sole.  The textured sole makes them grip the ground better, so you're less likely to trip in slippery areas.  They also last FOREVER.
