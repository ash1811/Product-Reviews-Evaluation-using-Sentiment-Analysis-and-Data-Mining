My son has been so hard to buy jeans for since he entered his teen years.  He's a big, tall, thick athlete and finding jeans that are roomy enough for his thick butt and thighs, while also not falling off his waist has been a challenge.  I love this cut, especially since he absolutely hated wearing hip-hop logos across his butt :)
