Delivery was on time. Watch band is smooth and nice but not necessarily soft; however, it feels nice on the skin. Wrist band is good length and my hubby has small wrists, so it works out great.The ticking sound can be loud in quiet room. Room with some sound noise may be OK.Adjusting the day was difficult. You have to adjust the time in 24 hour increment in order to move the day forward. That is a hassle. But I guess once it is all adjusted then there wouldn't be an issue anymore.To change the date, just pull the dial out once. Pull the dial out twice would be for adjusting the time.Overall it seems to be a good daily watch.
