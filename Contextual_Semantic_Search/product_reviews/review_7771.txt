I am a nursing student and this watch is just what I needed. It has a pretty large face with easy to see numbers. I love that it has the military time since I haven't quite gotten that down yet.The band is a little stiff at first but softens up quickly. I like that it doesn't have a bunch of grooves or material that can harvest bacteria.The only down side (for me) is how loud it is. I have to take it off when I'm not in clinicals because it ticks so loudly it drives me crazy in a  quiet room.If it goes out I will definitely be purchasing another one!!
