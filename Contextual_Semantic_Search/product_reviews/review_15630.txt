Bought this for my 11 month old. It's a little big but it gives it room for her to move around, not too snug. Headpiece is also a little bigger, but enough to cover her head. As far as the white costume, I think it's nice and it'll keep her warm when outside, sleeves are long, but it looks real nice.
