Online this Bra looks Delicious! I mean it holds the Babies in while looking Nice and Fashionable. The problem?I think my Babies were a little too Big ... a little too much for Poor Old &#34;Felina|Harlow-Unlined Demi-Bra.&#34;They, I, didn't feel comfortable, nor safe walking or playing around in it.  I think this Bra is best designed for smaller Babies, cause HOLDING my Babies was a bit Little Shady with The FELINA-Lady!YOu dig?
