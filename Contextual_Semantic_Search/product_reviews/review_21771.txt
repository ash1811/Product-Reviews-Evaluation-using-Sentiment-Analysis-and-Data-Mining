Bought this right after I turned 21 as I found my regular purse too difficult to deal with at the bars. This is a very thick, heavy canvas. The shoulder strap is adjustable. The closure is metal. I'm going to add a different type of closure for added security. One big pocket and two cellphone sized pockets.
