I have two of these jackets.  and Love 'em.  I'm 5'6&#34; tall, and 150 pounds.  So I'm made for a Med.  The synthetic fleece lining is soft and warm, and the rip-stop shell is durable, and wrinkle resistant. The hood, is lined, and adjustable, via stretchy  shock cord, which is also used at the waist. The sleeves, are lined with nylon, and insulated.  This makes it easy to pull on and off over a heavy sweater.  Since this jacket is of all synthetic materials, It will dry much more quickly than cotton.  One inside pocket, Slash hand warming pockets. The chest and waist, are very roomy.  but the sleeves, not so much.The elastic in the cuffs, is snug, and not adjustable,  but OK.
