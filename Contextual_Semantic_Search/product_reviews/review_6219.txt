I ordered three pairs of these Izod Metrix chinos, and they fit beautifully.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that one pair had some stitching and pressing that was off, but not really a fatal flaw.  The other two pairs were well finished, and all three fit the same (try that with other brands!).  Their big selling point is the "Metrix" idea which adjusts the fit to the waist/inseam configuration, and it certainly worked for me.  They wear well and look good.  The pocket material is in a blue striped material, which is odd, but no one can see it, so who cares?  And the good thing is that the pocket material is substantial (compared to other similarly priced pants).  Obviously I like them because I ordered three pairs, and I would order more if they came in other colors.
