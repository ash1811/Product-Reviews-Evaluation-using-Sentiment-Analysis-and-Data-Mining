After having numerous disappointments with several different New Balance walking shoes, primarily from ill-fitting, mis-sized defects, I finally found a shoe that works for my size 15 feet.  I am no longer a runner (total knee replacement put that pastime out to pasture), and was therefore unsure if this type of shoe would work for me.  I am so overwhelmingly thrilled with my shipment that just arrived today (perfect fit, total comfort, plus really, REALLY nice-looking shoes!) that I immediately went online to my Amazon account, and ORDERED ANOTHER PAIR!  These are an incredible buy for the price, easily worth two or three times the $42 I paid for them.  As always, Amazon Totally Rocks.
