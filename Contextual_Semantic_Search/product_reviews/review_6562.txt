These seem to run half size smaller than the Emma style which I also bought @ Amazon.  For $35 on sale who wouldn't love them.  They are stylish and warm but feet don't sweat at the office.  They may not be Ugg quality but they aren't Ugg price and they are cuter.  Only worn 3 times so not sure about longevity.
