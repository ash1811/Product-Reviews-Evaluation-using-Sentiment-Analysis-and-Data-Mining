The color (red) is wonderful.  The fit is great; I ordered a half size larger as suggested by other reviews.  This a very comfortable shoe and I wear them a lot. They are holding up very well. I even wore them with socks - once, just to see what it was like; socks are so not needed with that removable insole. I love these shoes!
