I bought this dress for a wedding (worn by the Mother of the Groom) and let me say it is absolutely perfect! The dress fit exactly as stated on the sizing chart. The satin material made the dress look much more expensive that it was. (You can't be the $50 price tag!) It also includes a beautiful shawl. I ordered the dress at the last minute, literally, to replace a &#34;nightmare of a dress&#34; that was custom made for my Mother. Placed the order on Monday morning and it arrived Wednesday afternoon...with no alterations needed!
