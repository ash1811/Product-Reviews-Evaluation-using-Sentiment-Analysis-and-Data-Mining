I live in Boston, and this winter, we got pummeled with ice and snow, and I love to walk -- but not on ice -- so I decided to give these a try. They actually do work on ice! However, psychologically, it's still daunting to step onto a sheet of ice. It was hard to get over that fact and not walk really carefully and slowly. Also, you can walk on dry pavement with these, but it's not comfortable to do so. I found myself putting these on and taking them off again, which is of course a bit tedious and annoying. I suggest getting these if you live somewhere where it is completely icy/snowy for miles, or you just need to run to grab the mail walking on an icy driveway, but in the city, where you constantly go from unshovelled sidewalks to perfectly fine sidewalks and back to icy again, these aren't the best option.
