I have other pairs of this same style by Easy Spirit in the same size and this pair is really tight on my feet.  I am trying to stretch these out with stretchers to make them fit better.  Might want to consider ordering a half size up.  Other than poor fit, they look nice.  Color is not as pictured at all, it is more of a hot chocolate color.
