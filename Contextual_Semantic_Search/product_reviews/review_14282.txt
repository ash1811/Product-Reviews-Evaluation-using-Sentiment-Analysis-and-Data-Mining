I like these, but they are the not really meant to be used for any type of work that requires bending.  While most work clothes for men are moving in the direction of more space for the...ahem...equipment...these things are the opposite.  The material does stretch I grant you and some viewers may appreciate the tight results, but I am of a mixed opinion.  And maybe it is the style, but these things are about an inch longer than most of the 34's...not a big problem...just trying to give a heads up.
