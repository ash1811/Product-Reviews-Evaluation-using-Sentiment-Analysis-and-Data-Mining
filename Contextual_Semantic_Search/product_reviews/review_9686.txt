I have other colors of this that didn't fit so loosely. Unless I lost a cup size or two in my sleep last night (that would be my luck), the robe I got today is more of an XL. I'm a 38B-C, and the fitted bosom of this peignoir look like empty pockets - not the look I was going for. The bodice material is quite stretchy, so I'd order a size smaller without worry.
