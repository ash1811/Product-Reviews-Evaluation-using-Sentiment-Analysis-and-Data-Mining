I buy these for my son, and have never been disappointed. They have a perfect fit for his slim hips, and skinny legs. He's always been tall and slim, and now that he's a teenager, it's hard to find jeans so small. These have a perfect fit without being clingy. They wash well, and don't require ironing. They are thick and sturdy, and will last until he outgrows them.
