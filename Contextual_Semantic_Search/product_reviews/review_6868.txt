I've been wearing these socks for quite some time, and was excited to find them on Amazon. If I'm lucky, I can find them at TJMaxx or Marshalls, because much cheaper there. But it's a rare find, so I'm happy just to have them. My 10 year old son steals them from me now- loves them, so I've ordered more for him.
