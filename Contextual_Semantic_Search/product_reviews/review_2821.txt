A great pair of jeans! I'm discontent with the design of jeans for women and  decided to purchase jeans for men. They fit high on the waist(which is wonderful. Something women jeans lack!)and this particular pair  keeps me warm during the unpredictable Northeast winter weather.I will definitly purchase another pair.
