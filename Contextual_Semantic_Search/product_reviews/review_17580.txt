I bought these to wear as part of my Halloween costume. I dressed up as a character named Wendy from the "Where is Waldo" books to match my boyfriend who dressed up as Waldo and my Pomeranian who was dressed as the dog. I received them in less than a week. They are very comfortable and they looked great on. I haven't worn them for any other occasion just yet but I hope that I"m able to incorporate them in another future Halloween costume.
