My husband ordered the size his head has been all his life and it was too small.  The company was very good about us ordering a new one and sending it back (it was never worn).  The new hat, a quarter of a size larger is still too small and gives him a headache, so now he doesn't want to wear it.  I didn't mind spending that much if he wore it to keep the sun off his ears and nose, but what am I to do now?
