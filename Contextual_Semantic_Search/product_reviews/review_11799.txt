These mocassins give you the ease of a loafer, the comfort of a sneaker and the look of a casual shoe.  They work great on casual Friday and if you've sufficient seniority any other day that doesn't call for a suit.  Merrell's reputation for quality is well deserved and these are no exception. They are comfortable and well constructed of high quality materials.  You can't go wrong with these shoes.
