Slip sliding away... If you have no foot problems these shoes are perfect for almost all the thinks you use a slip in for.The build is good, the appearance is excellent !  The padding a bottom give good relief from the pain of walking on tile. For me, there is so much room that I my toes slide forward & they are wide. But I have Morton's Neuroma, if you have pain issues these might not work. Back in the day, when I wore high heels these would have been great.
