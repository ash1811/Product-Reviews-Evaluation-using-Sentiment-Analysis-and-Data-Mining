My husband loves, loves, loves, these shirts.  This is the fourth one he has acquired.  Just got him another hunter green one because he used the previous green one for painting.  They are very sturdy well-made shirts and he really likes the pocket it has. He rarely requests specific clothing items but he did for this shirt.  Very good quality!
