I ordered these for my husband recently and was so happy when I got them today! These thick-weave thermals are EXACTLY what I've been searching for! the last couple years I have been searching for thick, high quality, all cotton thermals to keep my hubby warm, and with no luck until now! The last time I found him decent thermals was about 9 years ago on clearance sale in the hunting/camping section of a walmart and he's STILL wearing them all these years later! But they are so worn, with holes in the elbows of the top, I'm so glad I found these on Amazon. I will definitely order more in the future!!
