I bought this one and a Rick Steves ticket organizer, this was by far, much nicer! Sturdy, kept things neat and clean, easily accessible. The RS's organizer crumpled, was difficult to get in and out of, wrinkled my stuff and was a waste of money. I got this one in orange and I like the unique colors!
