I had ordered white thigh high socks before and they were too short and too tight and I am at 125 pounds and 5'11, so it was to be expected. BUT these were amazing! Beyond my expectations! They go to my thighs and higher if I wanted to, and they are not too tight, so it is comfortable to wear. Perfect and cute too!
