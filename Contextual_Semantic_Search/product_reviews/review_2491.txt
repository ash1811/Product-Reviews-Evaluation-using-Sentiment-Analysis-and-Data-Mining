Over the last six months  I have experienced joy and agony.  I found myself losing a little weight which gave me joy.  However, my favorite comfortable trousers kept slipping down.  The agony of slipping pants:  slip when I rise from a chair;  slip when I walk across a room; slip when I exercise; and slip when  I breathe out.  A person has to breathe!  I became bored with constantly pulling up my pants so I decided I needed some suspenders.I have a attitude problem concerning suspenders.  First, guys in my generation have claimed that one doesn't wear suspenders except with formal wear.  A belt is what a man wears - especially if he can get a fancy belt buckle.  I did check and John Wayne wore both suspenders and a belt with his cavalry uniform in "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon", so it is ok.Second, I always get ones with weak clips.  Weak clips  lead to a bad fit and pants that slip.  So, I want strong clips.The Custom Leathercraft Suspenders meet the need.  First they have great, heavy duty clips - clips that only come off  on purpose, not by accident.  And, of course, you do not need a belt.  Finally, a real bonus is that they are stylish.  Red, while, and blue "go"  with anything.I highly recommend these suspenders.
