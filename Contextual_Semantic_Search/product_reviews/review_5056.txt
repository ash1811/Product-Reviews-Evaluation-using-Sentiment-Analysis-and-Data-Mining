I may not need to go 30 days without washing or changing my underwear like the advertisement suggests you can, but these are GREAT to mitigate the hot humid swamp conditions that can arise in the summer. These will not stick to you like regular underwear no matter how hot or sweaty you get. They dry out very fast and are comfortable.  The material is a little bit like basketball 'swoosh' shorts, so don't expect a fuzzy soft cotton, but they're not uncomfortable by any means.
