I have gotten these socks for quite some time, and wear them for work.  It appears that the actual size is determined by which ever manufacturer happened to make the socks for Gold Toe.  The last three times I have ordered these socks I have gotten different sizes each time.  The most recent order, the socks have been noticeably shorter, and tighter, especially in the ankle area of the socks.  Yes, I wear a 13 shoe, and I'm a bigger guy, but that is why I order the Big and Tall size.  I'm starting to question if it is worth it to pay the premium price for Gold Toe.  I want a good quality sock, but also need accurate sizing.
