Bought this to support a holster and mag pouch for recreational use of a Remington 1911 R1. I wear a size 34 pants and the large was right on the money (do not use this to hold up your pants, wear it over your pants and belt to hold your weapons) plastic closures metal adjustment cam type locks. easy to use, should last for years.
