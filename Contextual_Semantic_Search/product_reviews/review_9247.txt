I have 4 or 5 pair of these now, and I even wear them outside to go to the doctor or on shopping trips.  They have wonderful traction, and are easy to keep clean.  They do show lint but a lint roller takes it all off.  When you wash them just put them in a lingerie bag on the gentle cycle and then air dry themThese are a great help to me, as I have MS and need to feel the floor and have traction with my Hugo Elite Walker when I am going up and down ramps.  Did I mention this is also the best price I have found for Isotoner Terry Ballerinas?  Thanks, Amazon!
