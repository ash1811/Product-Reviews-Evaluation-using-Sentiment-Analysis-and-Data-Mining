It was a pleasant surprise to get this medium heavy shirt. Got it for the brisk weather conditions we have at present.Quite perfect when one doesn't need a heavy sweatshirt and this long sleeve fills that niche.The overall price shipped to Hawaii, made this a great value when prices here would have been much higher. Still very impressed.
