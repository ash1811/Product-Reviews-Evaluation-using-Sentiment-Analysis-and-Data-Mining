Five years ago, a slip on the ice caused me a catastrophic knee injury - a total quadriceps tendon rupture.  Since then, I have investigated and employed a number of ice traction devices for both walking and winter cycling.  In this review, I had the opportunity during a January 2013 Chicago ice storm to perform a head-to-head test of the Yaktrax Walker and Duenorth ice cleats worn with my lightweight Northface boots.  Essentially I walked a mile on the worst conditions I could find (sloping sidewalks, unsalted curbs, metal surfaces, solid ice, slush).  In short, both traction cleats massively improved my stability over the use of my Northface boots alone.  The Yaktrax came out ahead in virtually every scenario but unfortunately the rubber matrix broke during the test. This was probably due to my aggressive test on an icy sloping sidewalk.  Even so, I prefer the Yaktrax coiled steel design over the Duenorth tungsten studs. My suggestion is that if you weigh over 200lbs, you would, might consider a heavy-duty version of the Yaktrax (pro, etc.) or a different brand that employs the coiled steel.Initially, I was drawn to the Duenorth design as I already had much success with my tungsten-studded bicycle tires from Finnish company Nokian.  On dry concrete, the tungsten studs will literately score the surface when aggressively breaking. Riding on solid glare ice is doable with the tires, a feat that is impossible with conventional bicycle tires.  The material properties of the tungsten such as exception wear resistance and extreme hardness allow the tiny studs to puncture solid ice and even very slightly depress metal surfaces.  As such, the Duenorth outperforms the Yaktrax on very hard and solid thick ice or on ice over metal surface. In every other scenario, the coiled steel design is superior.  This possibly could be explained by the use of only six studs on the Duenorth design.  Tungsten is expensive.Overall, the Yaktrax won the test.  Yet, users should identify the appropriate version for their weight and usage patterns.  Spending an extra 20 dollars to save thousands in knee surgery is a worthwhile investment.*Yaktrax Walker evaluation on its own meritsProsPortableExtra heights helps with prevent water penetration into shoesCoiled steel design provide larger traction surface over tungsten cleatsTurns shoes into boots in certain situations -- unexpected snow shovelingConsRubber matrix not durable.TEST - JANUARY 2013 CHICAGO ICE STORMYaktrax Walker versus Duenorth1)Icy flat sidewalkWinner: Yaktrax2)Icy sloping sidewalkWinner: Yaktrax3)SlushWinner: Yaktrax4)Icy curbWinner: Yaktrax5)Icy asphalt roadWinner: Yaktrax6)Ice over metal surface (e.g. railing)Winner: Duenorth7)Large flat hard ice surfaceWinner: Duenorth8)Dry concrete:Tie - No clear winner
