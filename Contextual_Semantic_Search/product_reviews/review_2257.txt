The quality of Levis jeans seems to be a decline, an endless abyss. The back label, which supposedly should be leather, cardboard seems now. The jeans manufactured in Mexico and Egypt are the worst labels or at least, in my experience, has been. I think there should be more oversight by Levis in its factories around the world. Previously, a Levis jeans was a piece "almost perfect", today I can not say the same. I totally agree with all the people who are disappointed with diminishing quality of these jeans.
