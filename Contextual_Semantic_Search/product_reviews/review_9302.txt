This is a very comfy little slipper to wear around the house - rubber sole, soft terry! You could even run to the mailbox in these in dry weather.  I wear a 6-1/2 size shoe and bought the medium size for size 6.5/7.5.  If I buy another pair, I think I'm going with the small.  This is just a little bit too loose fitting for me.  Well made slipper at a great price.
