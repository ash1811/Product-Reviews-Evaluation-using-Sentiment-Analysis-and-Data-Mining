They're great for work. They fit and are long enough. I'm a big girl and the large fit good but may be a bit tight in the booty. They have to work though because the XL's are super huge. No in between obviously so these will do! Color is as expected and the pants hold up relatively well in a strenuous 12 hour shift.
