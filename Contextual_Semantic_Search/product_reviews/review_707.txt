I find &#34;control top&#34; pantyhose very uncomfortable.  Thigh-highs are the best solution, and these are reasonably priced.  I ordered one size up as I have large sized thighs (I am &#34;pear shaped&#34;).  The color, &#34;nude,&#34; is a bit whitish for my needs.  I have medium color caucasian-type skin.
