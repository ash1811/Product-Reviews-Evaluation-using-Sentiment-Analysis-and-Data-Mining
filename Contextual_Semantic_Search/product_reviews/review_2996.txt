This is the best Jacket i have ever owned.  when it say Arctic quilt it is true, the jacket keeps you so warm it is crazy.  The jacket is so tough, i have ran it threw the washing machine a couple time and let it hang dry.  i beat this jacket up.  i uses it for atv ridding and outdoor work.  this winter in NY has been rough this is the only jacket i have wore, with a tee shirt. Most of the time i had to unzip it a little bit because i was so hot.  Love the hood acutely fits my head.  Most jackets have poor hoods and it dose not fit.  When you get the jacket it is going to be supper stiff but it will break in the more you wear it. This jacket will last for ever.  The size is perfect i am 6'2 295 and i am happy with the size i got. Most of the jackets i tried on at stores were all to short they felt like belly shirts and they just were not long enough, not this one.
