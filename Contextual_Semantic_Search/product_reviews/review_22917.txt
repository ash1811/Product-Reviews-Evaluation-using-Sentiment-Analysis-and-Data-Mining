Recieved this from the east coast in about a week after ordering, so no issues with the seller. Can opens up with a twist of the turn dial, and I used a regular hand rag to apply to shoes after applying generously to rag. I used plenty of elbow grease and rubbed it in all over shoe. After I was done it looked like I just brought them home from the shoe store. Looks like new, but as with any shoe polish it depends on what kind of work or walk environment as to how long the polish will last, but I didn't use that much so there is plenty to go around for the low price I paid. I have never used any other shoe polish before so I don't have anything to compare it to otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. Would recommend though for sure.
