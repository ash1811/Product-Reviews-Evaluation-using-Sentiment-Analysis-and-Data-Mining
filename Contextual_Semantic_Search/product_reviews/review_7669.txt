These clip on Perry suspenders are much better than the alligator type snap ons. These clip on your belt and do not ruin the top edge of your pains, or come loose because of a poor grip.  Since the clip is plastic it will not set off airline devices. I have worn several of these over the years and have never had a clip to fail.
