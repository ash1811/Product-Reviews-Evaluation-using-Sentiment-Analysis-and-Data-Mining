I ordered a pair of these shoes in my standard size. My toes were jammed against the front of the shoe and they could only be laced at the maximum width. I exchanged them for the next size up and I could not tell the difference in fit, same undersize problem. Material is nice, seams and sole fit well and they look good, just not true to size.
