I am a little big fat man, am over-weight for sure, but in spite of my fat waist line, the waist band on these boxers stretch to fit and are very comfortable.  I have probably about a 46-47 inch waist x 5ft 11-1/2in tall and i can wear these (XX-Large Size) all day without any discomfort.  They are especially good in warmer/hot weather.  And i think that even if i lost some weight the waist band would probably still hold up the shorts and i would not need to buy a smaller size.
