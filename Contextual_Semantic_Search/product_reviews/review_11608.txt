These training pants work pretty well.  We used this 3-pack and about 6 pairs of similar Gerber training pants to potty train our 18 month old daughter.  We used a nylon cover over these when going into public in the beginning, and did a lot of &#34;naked time&#34; at home.  I found that the Luvable pants were baggy around the legs, and poop wasn't as secure (could fall out on the awkward toddler shuffle to the bathroom) as with the Gerber pants.  These pants were also tighter around my daughters waist than the Gerber pants.  It may depend on the size of your child (my daughter is in the 90+% for both height and weight, so ~34&#34; and 28.5lb at 18 months).  I do prefer the Gerber pants, but these are pretty decent too.
