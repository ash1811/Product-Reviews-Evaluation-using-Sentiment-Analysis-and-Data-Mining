I am normally a big fan of the UGGs product but this one didnt work. I bought this one for my mother for a Christmas gift but she said the soles of these slippers are too flat and gives her a leg ache. I have a pair of Ugg slippers but they are thicker soles. When I tried on hers, she was right that they didn't feel as comfortable. We ended up returning them. I would recommend the same design with thicker soles.
