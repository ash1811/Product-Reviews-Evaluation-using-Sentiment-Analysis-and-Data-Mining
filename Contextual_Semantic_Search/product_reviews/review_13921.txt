I take a 31Wx32L, and I got the plain front khaki. They fit just right and appear to be well-made [looks like they were made in Mexico...possibly of US materials...the label was not very legible].Amazon seemed to have a database problem: they canceled my order without asking, claiming they were out of stock...but, in the end, they made good by acknowledging their error, and let me re-order them.
