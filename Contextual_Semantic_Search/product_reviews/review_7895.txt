Was looking for an inner layer jacket, to wear under a nylon shell jacket, so for me the top priority was the cut: I have a Land's End Polartec 200 jacket that's over 15 years old and still going strong, but it's got that big billowy, built-for-big-fat-Americans fit that drives me nuts and makes it difficult to wear under an outer jacket or coat without looking like The Michelin Man!I have an athletic build with wide shoulders and a narrow waist; for most clothes sold in the US I am somewhere between a size M and a size L.  Usually size L fits me best in the shoulders but is way too loose around the waist.  So I took a chance and ordered this jacket in Medium, sight unseen...bingo!It seems to be cut for Europeans or Asians: it has a straight cut from the armpits down to the waist.  Amazon's first 2 photos with the young male model is completely off, making it look like it's actually TAPERED or CINCHED in the middle, like an hourglass---thank god, it is NOT cut like that.It's light and thin but nevertheless quite warm, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the two outer pockets do have zippers on them.  There is no inner pocket, though...but that's probably one of the reasons for it being ten bucks cheaper than theColumbia Men's Fast Trek II Full Zip Fleecewhich has a top front pocket and seems to be made of a thicker material.  If I were buying this jacket to wear alone outdoors, I would probably pay the extra ten bucks...but for my purposes, this Steens jacket is EXACTLY what I was hoping for!
