These slippers seem wide and huge even though they actually fit and are comfortable. But they are ugly and make my size 7 feet look enormous.  I would not say they run small as other reviewers have mentioned, rather they fit me very generously and if they stretched at all I think they would be too big. Mine are black - in a light color they would probably look even chunkier.If you just want comfort, they are fine but if you like to look attractive even in the privacy of your own home, I do not recommend these slippers.  I also noticed a tendency to shuffle when wearing them if I'm not careful,and I do not want to go around the house with a shuffling gait. Can't say how durable they are as I am returning them tomorrow.
