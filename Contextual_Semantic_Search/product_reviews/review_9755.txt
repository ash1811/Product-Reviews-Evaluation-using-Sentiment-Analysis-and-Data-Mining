May through September is swimming season at our backyard pool and I do laps every day I happen to be home, unless the weather is terrible. Since I do laps for more than one hour at a time and given the secluded quality of our residence, 'privacy' is not an issue but 'comfort' is.The best I can say about this bathing suit is that swimming with it on is as close as swimming naked as I've experienced yet. And, believe you me, I know what I'm talking about. In other words, it's comfortable and it's light - whatever drag wearing this swimsuit may cause it must be very little because I did not notice it. In addition, the material it's made of dries quickly because it retains very little water.Now, on the aesthetics... I would not wear it at the beach. It's simply not meant for that. I personally don't care much about the 'square leg' design and, contrary to someone else's view published here, it is NOT 'discreet' at all. If you examine the Amazon picture you may agree with me. So, unless you have something worth showing and you really want to show it in a rather crude way, you better keep this on for swimming only and change into something else after you're done with it.It gets a perfect score as a swimsuit but it's losing one star for the 'looks'.
