I ordered both the black and white socks. Despite the advertised ratio, which included no polyester, the black ones are labeled having 1% polyester.  The white ones were as advertised.The price was so favorable that I didn't send back the black socks.  But I can really feel the difference that 1% polyester makes and I would not buy them again.  Also, if you take a pair of black socks on one hand, and squeeze, and compare to doing that with the white pair in the other hand, you'll notice a giant difference.  The black socks feel like 50% polyester.Both the black and white socks feel pretty thick and warm.  The white ones, upon wearing and washing, have shed clumps of material.  Higher quality socks cost disproportionally more, I think.Do not get the black ones.
