As some have mentioned, these glasses are pretty dang good for the price. The lenses are surprisingly good considering the money. I will say they are not meant for anyone with a face or head that is anything considered big...or even somewhat large. I have a pretty average sized face, and these are as small of frames as I would ever buy. If you like compact frames, these are for you, even if you don't have a small face.I bought these as a "low risk" set of glasses for times when I won't really care if they fall in the river, or get a bad scratch. But compared to my Oakley Straight Jackets and Oakley Pit Bulls, these are a smidge snug. But that's OK...can't expect awesome for this cost.
