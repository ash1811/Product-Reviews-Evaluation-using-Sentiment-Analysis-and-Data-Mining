I like a simple "t-shirt" that feels good and looks good. This shirt does what I need. The color is great and it looks good on me. The shirt is an XX-Large, not an easy shirt to find or, if found, looks good.. This does!I have been a "fan" of IZOD, but I feel this is a better shirt, better quality, fit, and PRICE!I feel CAHARTT goes the "extra" mile in making this product. Great shirt..
