I ordered these as a somewhat less expensive alternative to my usual jeans (Wrangler 47MWZ), in which I normally wear a 33 x 30. Based on reviews here on amazon, I ordered (3 pr) one size up&#8230;.i.e., 34 x 30. Unfortunately, they fit tighter than the 33 x 30 47MWZ's, so I had to return them. Going to an even larger size in the waist would make the rest of the jean much too large. Don't get me wrong, these are nice jeans (though they are thinner than the 47MWZ), and the waist line is not too high&#8230;&#8230;I guess I don't have the correct body style to make them work for me.
