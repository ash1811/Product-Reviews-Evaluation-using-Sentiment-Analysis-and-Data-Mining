These pants fit perfectly in the length department and very well in the width as well.I will say if you are looking for a pant that is skinny all through the calf like it is in the thigh, you may want to go with the 510 from levis as they are a tighter fit. These fit great and can be worn in more situations that the extremely tight ones.
