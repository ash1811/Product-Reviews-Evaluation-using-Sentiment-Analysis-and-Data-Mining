I wear bibs to be comfortable while working. I understand they aren't stylish, but I want bibs that look nice. These have the right denim weight and blue color. I like them.I normally wear a 36 or 38 waste and ordered size 42 because that is how I like my bibs to fit. This upsizing was dead on.These bibs have a different hook than I'm used to, but I like it. Seems like it will be less likely to come loose on me when I'm working.The only thing I can complain about is the straps are really difficult to adjust. Getting the seams of the denim through the adjuster rings is quite a challenge.
