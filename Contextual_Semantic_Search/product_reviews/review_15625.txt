My son was drafted into being Yoda for Halloween - and this costume served the purpose well. We had to pay $16 for it at Halloween, but it was worth it to see how people reacted to his costume.  I will guarantee you this, Yoda never moved as fast as my son did in this costume!  Good deal considering the options.
