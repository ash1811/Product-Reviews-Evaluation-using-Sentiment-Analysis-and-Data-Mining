I love these !  I bought them for my granddaughter to wear at a western theme photo shoot.I bought the size 1 based on the advice online that they run large.  That is not my experience.I already ordered and received a size 2 and I will return the size 1.They are very cute and well made.Even though I had to go up a size, and return a pair, I would do it again. Cute !
