I purchased two of these bags for a recent event where we needed to trasport a tux and gown with us to a location where we would be dressing later in the day. The bags served that purpose very well, and for that type of use or for storage purposes, I highly recommend them.But, please don't think that this would be a good garment bag to use for any extended travel or as checked luggage on a flight. It is not intended for that purpose and would not perform well.The picture is a little misleading, as there is no handle or loop at the top end of the bag. There is one at the bottom. What you do is allow the hanger(s) to extend through the top hole, and then gently fold the bag and loop the lower handle loop over the hangers. This lets you carry or hang the bag in shorter areas.A good one size fits all type bag. A full tux with about four hangers fits fine in it. It offers good protection and is simple to use and carry.
