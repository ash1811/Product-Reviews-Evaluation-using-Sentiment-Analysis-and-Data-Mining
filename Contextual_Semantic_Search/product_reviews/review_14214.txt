I wear a man's size nine, medium, shoe. I have never worn Sperry shoes and I was a bit surprised to see how narrow these shoes were. They did NOT fit my feet.  Quite a narrow toe area, fine in back and length. Luckily I was able to use a shoe stretcher, combined with some leather stretching solution (alcohol and water) to open up the toe area.  I stretched them a lot.  They are okay now but I hope they stretch a bit more from use. Perhaps a wide next time.  Never wore a wide shoe in my life.
