I'm a fan of Invicta watches, having owned three.  All have been of fine quality, the only &#34;knock&#34; on this brand being that most of their models are far too big for my wrist. (Anything over 44 mm is too big--I'm not a large guy.)I owned the coin-edged bezel model of this watch previously, and decided to buy this model as the price as always was great, and the appearance is way above average.  I swim and snorkel (but don't scuba dive), and prefer a 200m watch for these activities.The 8926 is a great combination of a timepiece suitable for outdoor activities as well as business or dress wear.  The Rolex-clone appearance lends itself for wearing at work or with a suit.  The band is solid, but not too heavy.My two criticisms of the 8926 are these:1.  The bezel is virtually impossible to turn.  I don't really care about this, since I don't dive, but I need one of those can grippers or latex gloves to move the thing.  WAY too tight.2.  The fold-over safety clasp, while a great security feature, is extremely difficult to open.  You need pretty long fingernails to flip the thing up.  Maybe a little WD40 spray will alleviate this.Timekeeping is average for an automatic movement watch.  Since I own quite a few watches, and this requires winding daily, it can be a bit of a hassle to reset it, but that's what you get with an automatic.All in all, great watch for the price.  I look forward to years of service from this one as with my previous Invictas.
