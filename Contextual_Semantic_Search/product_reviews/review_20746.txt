I got the green, as I wanted warm, strong, casual pants that can also be dressy enough to go in winter.  They are a work pant but nice enough to wear business-casual with a dress shirt & tie if you want, and in the winter when it's freezing they are exactly what I need.  They are so comfortable that I don't get hot when I'm inside reg temps, (I often wear them at home) and when outside, I don't notice the cold.  I work in sales, which means having a professional appearance, and these look pretty good.  And, in Chicago winter, these keep the frigid air out.  Who cares if they do not look like suit pants?  When slipping on the ice you'll be quite glad you have these.  I really notice the difference on days that I don't wear them.  Now, I'm ordering black for a dressier look.  And b/c I wear them almost every day, along with Carhartt lined jeans.
