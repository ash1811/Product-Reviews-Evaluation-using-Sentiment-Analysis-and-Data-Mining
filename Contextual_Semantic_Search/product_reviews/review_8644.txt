The thickness of the material and quality of workmanship is good. However , it is a little bit on the tight side and I do not have big legs . It still fit me okay and comfortably and provide enough warmth with out being so bulky. It has a nice knit design. But when I laundered and dried it in the washer and drier, it shrunk quite a bit . I have not tried it again but I think it would be quite tight because it  just barely fit me comfortably before it shrank. I think the company should make allowance for this shrinkage when making the measurements. Otherwise, nobody will buy them again because they will need to be washed and dried. They are too thick a material to be just hanged in the clothesline to dry.
