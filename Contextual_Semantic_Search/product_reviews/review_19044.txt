This hat serves the purpose it was designed for:  it will keep the sun off one's neck.  My husband ordered it for working out in our yard.  His only complaint is that the material that covers the neck is rather stiff.  Hopefully it will soften over time.  My complaint is that it is rather ugly.  Sorry, I know beauty wasn't its purpose, but when my husband threatens to wear it in public, I cringe.
