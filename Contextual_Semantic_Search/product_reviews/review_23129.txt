I bought this for one reason: To look cool.Ok, not that. I bought it to see fish. And it works perfectly for that. Really great polorizability. To prove it, I can say my iphone screen is completely versicolored while wearing these. Also, the yellow color is great for low-light conditions and protects a bit in the sun as well.Definitely does the job for me. I wear them every time I fish.
