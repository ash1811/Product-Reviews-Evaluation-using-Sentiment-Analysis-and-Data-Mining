I got these during a summer sale and they were very inexpensive. The stitching seems very tough and the fit is excellent. The leather patch on the right front pocket is a bit odd and causes the pocket corner to not lay perfectly flat. One of the rear patch pocket tops wants to fold over slightly and looks a little unusual but doesn't really affect anything.
