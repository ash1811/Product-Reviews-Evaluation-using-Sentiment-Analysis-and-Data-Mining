I cannot tolerate underwire bras. I am on the lookout for a comfortable and supportive bra. I normally wear one style of JMS brand. I am looking for something different because the JMS bra has a seam on the cup that puckers over time and shows through clothing when I wear t-shirts. I thought I'd try this one since it didn't have seams on the cups. It feels true to size in the band and cups. It is actually pretty comfortable. I didn't give it 5 stars, because with a couple of changes it could be outstanding. The straps need to be elastic. I have a little trouble with them sliding or digging in if I tighten them. It has 5 hooks in the back, so it is a little trickier to fasten. It doesn't completely conceal the n!pple, but I haven't noticed any show-through when dressed. It looks well-made and the materials feel high-quality. I have only had it a short time, so I don't know how well it will hold up over time. It has held up well so far. I machine wash and hang to dry.
