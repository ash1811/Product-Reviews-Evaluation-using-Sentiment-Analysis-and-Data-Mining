I bought these for my son bc he goes through shoes like crazy and he needed something really strong.  These boots are definitely sturdy and strong.  But they are not exactly &#34;school shoes&#34;.  They are a bit bulky and are probably more geared to work situations.  However, as far as fit and durability, they are very good.  And he likes them so much that he does wear them to school.
