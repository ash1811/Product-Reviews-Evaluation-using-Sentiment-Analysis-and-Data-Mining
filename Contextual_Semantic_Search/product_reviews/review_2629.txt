I'm in vegan shoes heaven. I love all the different colors these come in.  As for the fit, they are minimalist.  I need a lot of arch support so I bought inserts for mine.  These are very hip looking and when people notice them I get compliments.  I wear them with jeans and causual clothes, not for working out.  I would love for Saucony to come out with a line of vegan running shoes.
