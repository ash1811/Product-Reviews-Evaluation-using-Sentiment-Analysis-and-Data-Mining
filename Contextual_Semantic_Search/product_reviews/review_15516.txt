I have these in three sizes and I use them all the time. Three is a great number to have so you can keep one in your diaper bag and have two for rotating between washes and wearing. I use these especially when layering on cool mornings and afternoons and for keeping shirts from traveling up my baby's torso when he is picked il or put into his car seat. I use these as undershirys basically since traditional undershirts don't keep the shirts from riding up or stayed tucked in. I tell everyone who comments on how great these are. All my sisters who have had multiple kids each love them and know to what atvantage they can be. The tank top feature is just totally cute too. I like how these fit. I don't have a verychubby baby...he is more long. These stretch to fit for a long time before you have to move up another size. I want these in every size...wish they had more sizes. Also, forgo the newborn size. The 3 month size is just fine for babies in the 7 lb range too.
