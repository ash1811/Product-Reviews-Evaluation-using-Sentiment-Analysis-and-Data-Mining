The last pair of Rockport shoes I owned have lasted me for over four years (!).  They have been the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned and have held up under sometimes very punishing conditions due to the nature of my work.  I have really liked their cushioned Vibram soles. Alas, all good things come to an end and it finally got to the point where my poor Rockports were looking pretty grungy and worn at the heels.  I paid several visits to various Houston stores that carry Rockports, but none of them carried the Classic Walking Shoe type, which is exactly what I wanted. I then decided to give Amazon a try.This is the first time I've ever taken the chance of purchasing shoes on line.  I'm usually VERY picky about my shoes because I have to spend so much time on my feet in my job, which also includes having to stand for many hours at a time at conventions, etc.  Too often, shoes just don't fit properly on my narrow feet.  When my Rockports arrived from Amazon, I was only a little disappointed that they felt just a touch smaller than I would have liked.  I told myself, however, that my old Rockports have been well worn in and have probably stretched out over time to arrive at that perfect feeling that they now have, so I've decided to hang on to these and give them a chance to break in as well.If this works out for me, I will probably consider making my future shoe purchases online with Amazon as well.  Their prices seem to be competitive and the shoes were delivered to me in a matter of a few days.  I highly recommend these shoes as a kind of casual dress shoe for those who spend a lot of time on their feet but need something more than sneakers or other less dressy type shoes.
