I just got my new bra 3 days early than my est delivery date. It's very supportive & fits really well. The band is great & holds me in place like i'm suppose to be. I've been hunting for awhile with no luck & u take a chance ordering online & i took a chance doing so. The straps are wide & comfortable & the front isn't too low. I don't spill out [lol] @ the top either [i'm not too big or real small either but with other bras i have spilled out a little] cause it's well made @ the top to where it holds u in place & i'm so glad it does. No cone shapped either [that's terrible i hate that] so when i get around to wearing a tshirt that will help. I don't wear tshirts very much so time will tell on that aspect. But this is a great price for this really great bra. I also took a chance on my size since i've gained weight [as we all do from time to time when u get older] but it had to have been God having me come across this since i did take a chance & it fit perfect [thank God] & it is very supportive too. Order this bra u'll be happy. It's true to size & comfortable & soft. Nothing scratchy or itchy & don't poke me anywhere. Everything stays in place & very comfortable & i like black. I will order more a bit later on [taking this on a test drive but i know it will continue to pass all tests] so by then i will be ordering more. Great bra great delivery time great company
