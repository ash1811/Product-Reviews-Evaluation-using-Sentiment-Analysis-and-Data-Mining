In my quest for perfect underwear: (thong, trunks, boxers, briefs, whatever) these are better than good but not spectacular.The fabric is super soft and comfortable.  It breaths well is perfect for those hot summer days.  The picture is a little deceiving.  There is something of a front pouch but it is not that well defined and does not proved nearly the support I was hoping for.  The legs are pretty good and, as most trunks do, ride up a little but not too much.
