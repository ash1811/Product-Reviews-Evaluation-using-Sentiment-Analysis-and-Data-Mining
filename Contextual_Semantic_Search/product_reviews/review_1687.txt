Just what I wanted. Everything you expect from a Carhartt. I am a small lady, (5'5 120) but I wanted the sleeves to be long enough so I got the men's small, and they are. I also like the longer fit over my hips a little, so you can do work without the jacket ending up above you waist all the time. The ladies have shorter sleeves and ride up on me.
