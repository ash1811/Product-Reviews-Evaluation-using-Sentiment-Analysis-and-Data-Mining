I took a gamble on the size, and I got it right, however the way this bra is constructed it gives you pointy cone boobs that will appear under your clothing. I am returning it in exchange for the Bravado silk seamless nursing bra, which is super comfortable and has sufficient padding to cover my lady bits, but looks natural.
