Va-Va-Voom!  Take the time to look up the sizing, I wear an 18 and needed a 4X.  If you can get past the sizing, this is a fabulous , I put it on and was amazed, the bottom edge is less compression so that it doesn't create a dent on the hip.  I haven't worn garters in years, and can't wait to wear them again.
