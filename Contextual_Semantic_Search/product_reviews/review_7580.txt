My husband loves caps and hats. I purchased this one for him to wear in warm weather. He says it's great for most of the year. It breathes well, so the heat doesn't build up inside when he wears it. The gray color is a lighter charcoal, not too dark, so it works well as a neutral color. Looks great too. Highly recommend this cap.
