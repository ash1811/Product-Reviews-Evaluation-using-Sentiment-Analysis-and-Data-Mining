This is good watch that I like a lot. I still prefer my Longines and Omega watches, but this is a great bargain and worth having in your collection or as an only watch. Seiko watches are very good, and this is a serious diving watch. It is an automatic, and judging from some reviews here, some people are clueless on the workings of an automatic watch, on power reserve and the need to wear it daily, or to invest in a watch winder. To those people I suggest Quartz, battery or solar.
