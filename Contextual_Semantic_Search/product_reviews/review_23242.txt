BACKGROUNDAfter two years I realized my old leather Diesel wallet had come to the end of its life. I received a Kenneth Cole Reaction Mens Wallet for my birthday.USEAGE & APPERANCEThe wallet consists of 11 slots for all your credit and business cards. There is a protective pocket that flips for your ID/verification card. There are several hidden pockets that you can place such things as emergency money into.RELIABILITYThe wallet has sturdy sewing in its seams and is made of quality leather. The wallet feels durable and has held up rather nicely the past six months I have used it.PROS:++ Plenty of slots for all your credit cardsCONS:++ Does tend to get rather bulky with all those cards and cash if you do fill up every slotCONCLUSION:This wallet is durable, stylish, and very functional. It is a worthwhile addition to any mans wardrobe.
