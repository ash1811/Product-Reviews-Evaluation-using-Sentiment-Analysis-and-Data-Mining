I bought a pair of these a number of years ago.  I wore them so much that after about 5 yrs. the elastic gave out.  They are just the perfect thing for traveling.  They take up practically no space in your suitcase and I wore them around hotel rooms, stepping outside for a bit.  Extremely comfortable.  Also around the house in wamer weather is an ideal place to wear them.  When the elastic started giving out on our last vacation a couple of months ago, I looked in stores but was unable to find any.  So...I turned to Amazon and, voila!  Here they are and I am ordering a new pair.  I'm unable to comment on the fit of the ones I'm ordering, of course, but if they're anything like my old ones, they'll fit perfectly.  I wear a med. size 7.
