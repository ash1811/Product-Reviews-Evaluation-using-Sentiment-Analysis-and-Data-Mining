Here is her review &#34;First off, love the color! (Periwinkle) It's a great size to pack away and the clear pockets are wonderful for finding everything without having to open every zipper.&#34;~I bought this for her because she is in a wheelchair and this bag makes it easy for it to be hanging and in full view & access for her limitations. My son is going away to college this Fall and I think I'll get him one because he is an unorganized mess & this should help!
