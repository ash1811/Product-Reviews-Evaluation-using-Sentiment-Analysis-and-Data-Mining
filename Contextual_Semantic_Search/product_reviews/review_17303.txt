These Reef flip flops are fine, but I think they are overvalued and overpriced.  If they were under $10., I would have no complaint.  Over that amount, I expect more arch support and cushioning, and a more comfortable fabric between the toes and over the top of the foot than what these offer.  Also, they are a little long, and I bought a half size smaller than my normal 8 1/2.
