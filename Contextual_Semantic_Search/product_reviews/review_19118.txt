This pendant is beautifully made and not too big or gaudy. It is subtle and smaller than I thought it would be, but the best test of how well I like it is if she (my wife) likes it. Guess what? She loved it. In part because it was a gift, but it's a good gift at that. I rate this five stars because it is a quality product and has a high likability factor.
