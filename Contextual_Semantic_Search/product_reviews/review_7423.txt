My boyfriend works at a garage/gas station where it can be cold and damp half the year. This jacket protects from the elements, including the rain (though it is rain proof on the inside so it can get very heavy!) And it holds up to everything he puts it through, very very durable.He is also rather tall but not at all overweight so it is often difficult to find clothing that is long enough but not too baggy. This jacket when ordered in tall sizes was perfect.
