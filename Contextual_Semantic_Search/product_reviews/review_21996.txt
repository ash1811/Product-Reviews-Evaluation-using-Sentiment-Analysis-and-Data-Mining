I thought that the shorts were going to be small on me, a 4x, but after wearing and washing only once the material became softer and actually became larger, a perfect 4xl. I know that some reviewers do not like the length, but I perfer it. The waist band is heavy duty and well sewn. The draw cord is of good material and heavy duty as well. I would buy more than three pair but I think that they will wear so well, I will not need another for a very long time.Update 2/15/13I received the other two pair that I mentioned in the opinion above. Well, the athletic shorts are not the same as the first pair. The material is of lessor quality, the waistband is of lessor quality. At the price I paid for them, they are worth the money, but the first pair are a much better buy. In today's world things change quickly, this change is a sour note.
