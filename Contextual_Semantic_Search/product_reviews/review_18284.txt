As is usual, this is a product you buy when your old slippers are just embarrassingly ratty to be seen in public.These are pretty decent for the price, about what you'd expect for a Made in China product.  The sole is sturdy and the felt upper with faux wool lining has just enough give to be comfortable.  The stretch elastic gore on the tongue is not strong enough to hold up to frequent stretching as you put the slipper on -- you can tell that when the elastic doesn't return to its original shape.But the sizing is generous and though I usually take a size 10-1/2 or 11 Wide shoe, these fit well (but snuggly) in a size 10 Medium with sports socks on.  They fit more loosely when worn without socks, and probably even with socks when the &#34;wool&#34; lining gets packed down from frequent wearing.  I don't think the chintzy elastic gore will be a problem.Buying these was a shot in the dark.  Really, anything with a hard outdoor sole would have worked for me.  These will do the job and on balance I'm satisfied with them.
