I have these socks and love them. Unfortunately Amazon sent me the wrong size not once but twice. I think this was because of the mislabeling of the product in the Amazon's computer system. The manufacturer has numerous international as well as US sizes on it and someone at Amazon must have mislabeled it. Once the computer gets straightened out, I think it'll be great. These socks are hard to find in rurual areas so I'm hoping Amazon will have this sort it out soon. The socks last forever.  I've worn my old ones for two years and still they keep going.
