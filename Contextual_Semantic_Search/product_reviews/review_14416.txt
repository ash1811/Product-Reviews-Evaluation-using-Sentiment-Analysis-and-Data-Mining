I have owned several timex ironman watches over the years. Loved 'em all. I don't if amazon sent me one with an almost dead battery, or if it's a flaw in the watch. However, when punching through the modes, everything is REALLY SLOW. If I go to alarm, I have to wait a few seconds for it to appear, then wait a few more when I choose to modify it. Not quick an easy like my other ironmans. Great features though, if it wasn't for this annoying delay, 5 stars easy.So I don't know to blame amazon or timex for this. Either way, it is a problem that dropped the score for me.
