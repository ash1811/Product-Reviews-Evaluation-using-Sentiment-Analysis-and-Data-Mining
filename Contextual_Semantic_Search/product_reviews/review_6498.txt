These tights are a lovely shade of ballet pink, and the material is thick and looks like it will hold up well with repeated washing.  But they have one major flaw:  the waistband is way too tight.  I always buy tights one size larger than the manufacturer recommends, so I first purchased these in Large/XL.  They fit nicely except for the extremely tight waistband.  Since I was impressed with the quality of the material, I decided I'd go up one more size and try the XXL.  Unfortunately, the waistband in the XXL was still much too tight.  For reference, I am about 5'7&#34; and 135#, and I usually wear a size 4-6 in ladies' skirts and pants.  If Capezio fixed the waistband, these would be perfect.  I will probably wear them until they wear out since they were fairly expensive, but I'll most likely buy more of the Theatricals XL tights (which are lower quality but half the price and more comfortable) when I need new ones.
