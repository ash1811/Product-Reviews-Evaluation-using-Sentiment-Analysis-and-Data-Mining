Love them - wear them all the time - have multiples and will buy more.The sticker label in the back neck of the shirt has worn off, and so have the R symbols on the sleeves.  The stickers lasted about 3 months worth of washing (never put in dryer - always hang them).I still wear them without the logo - great shirts!
