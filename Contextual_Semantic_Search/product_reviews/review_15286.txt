You won't have to worry about breaking one of these rubbers, though you could still have an accident if you aren't careful, as the tread on the bottom is not going to grab a slippery driveway or sidewalk.I wear Size 11 men's shoes, and these rubbers fit a little loosely.  Typically, a loose rubber would be a bad thing (grin), but these are intended to cover up to Size 12.5, which explains the looseness for me.  Even with the extra space, I like them.  They are easy to put on and take off, and I don't have to worry about tromping through the sloppy elements of a Minnesota winter.Order a pair.  Then, tell your wife or significant other that you just bought some rubbers online.  Should be good for a few chuckles.
