It's such a pretty bra, and comes in wonderful colors - I especially like the black and honey - the honey doesn't show under white or light-colored blouses like white does.I find that it's POSSIBLY a bit small for size. .but not much.  I have gained a bit of weight, after all. (OK, there!  I admit it!)However, sometimes the lace around the band at the bottom can chafe a bit.  Not terribly, and not all the time. but .. I do wish they'd leave off that bit. .or move it away from the skin.Where I live, Playtex bras are easy to find in stores, but difficult to find your size.  They're inconsistent with size markings. ..The bras are stored in bin drawers, and you have to paw through the mess to find your size ..and it's only possible to read size from FRONT of package, not top.If I were designing their packaging. . I'd put clearly readable sizes and colors on TOP of the package AND front.  after all, what is the customer looking for?  SIZE!!! Duh!because it's difficult to read, the customers paw through the bins, mess up all the sizes, and you have to look in EVERY bin to find yours.  And it's not easy for me to stay hunched over pawing through the bottom bins. ..Come on, Playtex!!!!
