These are amazingly comfortable and look nice enough to wear to work (as a teacher).  Downsides are that they get smelly after a few wearings - but I've thrown them in the wash and they come out fine.  The biggest disappointment was that even though I've only had them 6 weeks, the soles are already losing their tread and they are becoming slippery on wet surfaces, even outside on cement.
