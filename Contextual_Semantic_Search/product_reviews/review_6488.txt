I purchased these for workday hosiery, as I'm tired of pantyhose that run after the first wearing.  Coming out of the package was disappointing (shapeless), but these actually proved to be quite comfortable.  They do run a bit short (I am 5'7&#34;, 135 lb, and B didn't quite come up as high as I'd like), but they withstood multiple wearings and washings.  The shimmer adds a nice touch.
