I was partial to the black one because it does make the watch look slightly smaller.And this face, at first didn't attract me, but I did not want to keep the blk and silver one (too flashy), so exchanged for this one and I am stunned. It's too beautiful to put into words. I think this might be my favorite Invicta, and I have some nice ones..about a dozen.Don't pass it up, they'll be gone sooner or later.
