A warm sock, but not so heavy that you cannot wear it indoors as well.  I love wearing these in cold weather with boots because it keeps my feet warmer when outside, but not too heavy so that they are sweating when I head indoors.  It also makes the shoe or boot you are wearing more comfortable.  Lounging around in just socks inside is also more comfortable, almost like wearing a slipper.
