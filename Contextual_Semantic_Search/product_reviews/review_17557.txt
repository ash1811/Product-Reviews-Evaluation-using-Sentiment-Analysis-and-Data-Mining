I love the look and they are comfortable. My only problem is that the lace tops aren't smooth like in the picture, they actually do a strange ruffle at the bottom, near the seam, which destroys the illusion of a smooth leg. Other than that, I am satisfied and they arrive only 3 days after I ordered them, which I was shocked about.
