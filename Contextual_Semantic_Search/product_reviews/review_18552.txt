This is an excellent watch with clearly marked number and good white contrasting dial. The black strap tones this down to as formal as it can get. It isn't showy but amazingly good looking watch. The strap has a good finish. This style will last forever. Very much recommended as a must have watch for every lady who is looking to survive all fads in watch fashion.
