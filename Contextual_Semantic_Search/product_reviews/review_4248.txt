I have loved and worn this style sports bra for years.  When it was time to replace the current crop, I went to my normal bra store, only to discover they were out of it in my size.  On a whim, I checked on Amazon.  They not only had the bra, in my size, but at a cheaper price.  What's not to love?This is a great bra for larger busted women.  It really keeps the girls in place.  And unlike most bras, it doesn't seem to stretch out.  Maybe that's because I don't put them in the dryer.  It also helps that the straps are not elastic.  But there are slots so that they can be adjusted.Fitting note - I find all Natori bras to be true to size.  So, order what you normally wear.
