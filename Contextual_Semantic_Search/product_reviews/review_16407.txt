I normally wear a size 8.5 bought in a 9 was wondering if i should have gotten and 9.5 because it doesn't seem like enough room at my toe area.  Will see they are very comfortable except for that there is room but not alot I guess I should have gone to the Dance Studio store to purchase them in the first place
