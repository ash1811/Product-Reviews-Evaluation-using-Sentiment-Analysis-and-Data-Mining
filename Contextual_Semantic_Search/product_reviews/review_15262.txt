Its very soft, a bit ribbed, and longer than the picture, thankfully! I've got older shirts like this that are baby tees practically, I love the design but needed the length, this is it.I got a size bigger than what I would normally pick- small- but it fits very well without making me look like a sack of bones with a t-shirt skin over me. I wear medium, sometimes, but I got large, and I'm sure a small would look beautiful if you like your shirts a bit more fitted to form.I have small boobs and they look good in it, which is hard for smaller ones, so I can only imagine a gal with a chest it'd probably look even better lol! I'll let you all know if it shrinks or frays in the wash, but for right now I'm very happy with this product. I'm gonna order more colors and in my actual size
