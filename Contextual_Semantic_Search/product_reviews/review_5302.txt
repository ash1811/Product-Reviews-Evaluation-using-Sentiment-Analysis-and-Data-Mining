We lost our Army Surplus store with some base closings.  I really liked my old regular and hot-weather BDU's from my service time...but these are close.the most annoying part is the little pocket at the knee - when I ride my Harley the wind catches this pocket and makes it a bit irritating as it fights the winds.  The other thing is that they are cut more like loose jeans - which are still not as loose as BDU's - so if you are used to having the freedom of movement that real BDU's offer....you will certainly notice the difference.all  that said, for getting them Prime and inexpensive...they work just fine. At least until I visit a surplus store somewhere in the future.
