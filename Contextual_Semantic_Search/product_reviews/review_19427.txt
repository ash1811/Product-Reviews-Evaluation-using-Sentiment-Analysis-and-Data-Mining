As some other reviewers stated, these do run a bit on the small size.  I ordered my normal size and they are tight.  However, I decided to where them and try to break them in rather than going up a size (which I knew would be way to big).  I've now had them a couple of months and they are quite comfy.  They are still snug but not a bit painful.
