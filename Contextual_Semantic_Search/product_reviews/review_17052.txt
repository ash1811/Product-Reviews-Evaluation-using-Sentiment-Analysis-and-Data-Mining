I got this watch tool to replace another one I had lost. I found this one to be lighter, but also not the easiest to change some bands that were a tight fit in the lugs. It was an ok tool to replace bands, but I worked to find a tool more similar to the one I had lost. When I would use it to change leather bands it's angled tool made it harder to use than one of the tools with a flat end all the way across.
