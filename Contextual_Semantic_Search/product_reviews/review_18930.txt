I've bought 2 Atlantis watches and 10 Ironman watches over the past 25 years.  Lately I've been buying watches for both myself and my wife.  When my wife's expensive ironman band failed, causing her watch face to disappear from her wrist forever, after ONLY THREE MONTHS - I started to reconsider my recent purchasing decisions!THIS WATCH USES A STANDARD WATCH BAND.  It has all the features of the Ironman, more or less.  If you've been using these timexes for 25 years as i have, you know that eventually the band snaps and you want a replacement.  Well, I won't fall for this B.S. from Timex, who has made all their Ironman models use custom nonstandard bands !!  So, I am switching over to Atlantis ~ I already bought one for my wife, and I'm getting one for myself !!This new model has the same user interface as an Ironman, with chronograph and 3 alarms, and the iron is probably the alltime best-selling digital chronograph (since about 1986.)  I predict that this will become the new #1 seller in the Timex line of sports watches !!
