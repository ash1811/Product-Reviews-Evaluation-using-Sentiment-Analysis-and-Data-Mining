Love these leather oxfords !  I have worn them continually every day since I got them 3 months ago and they show no wear and tear even gardening,  no dirt sticks to the leather although I washed the laces.  They have no insoles but are comfy as is, flat shoes as what was described.  I cant find them locally so viola here on Amazon !  Keds company is perfect if the shoe is the wrong size or color re: an exchange.  I will buy again from them as I also bought the eyelet oxfords as well many times5 stars on this item,  will DEFINITELY buy this one again.  Great shoePS this picture shows a black or navy canvas shoe NOT the awesome white leather ones i bought
