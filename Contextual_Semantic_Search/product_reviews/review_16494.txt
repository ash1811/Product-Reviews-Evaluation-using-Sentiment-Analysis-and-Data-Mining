I followed the suggestion from previous posters and ordered a size down from what my husband usually wears.  Once washed and dried in the dryer, they shrank to the size we needed.  He is very pleased with the fit of this t-shirt, and I am very pleased with the quality.  We will certainly be purchasing this brand again.
