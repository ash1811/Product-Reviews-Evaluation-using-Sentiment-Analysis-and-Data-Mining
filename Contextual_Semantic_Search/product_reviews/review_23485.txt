Much better than the last pair of disposable sunglasses I bought. The frames are very light and thin but I'm hoping they'll last a while despite that. My biggest concern with these was the fit - I saw some reviewers complaining about the size and fit. They look like normal sunglasses to me and I think they're very comfortable. Really comfortable actually - the rubber on the nose and frame part behind the ears is a plus in my opinion. I know more sunglasses are doing that these days and I like it. The rubber or silicone helps them stay put on my head if I'm biking.If they last a few months at least - I'd buy another pair. These are a good value at this price.  FYI: there's no case or anything extra - not that I expected it - they come in a plastic bag. But, so did my last pair. I moved to disposable sunglasses after my last pair of awesome and expensive glasses mysteriously disappeared.
