505 (straight): A looser fit, comfortable, seems to stretch out pretty quick with wear. So far this is the only of the 3 pairs which I commonly need a belt to keep up. It is my wife's least favorite in terms of the cut / look, I think mostly because she thinks they are to loose / to big, I think when I first got them or right after they shrink a bit from a wash she likes them more. Currently thought she says this is her least favorite of the three.511 (slim): These are a slim fit as the style claims, but they aren't to tight and seem to have some stretch to them when you move around. They feel a bit to  tight the very first day out of the wash, but by the second they are about perfect. They are probably my favorite of the bunch, in terms of look, feel, and comfort. They are tight enough to not look baggy/loose, but not so tight to be uncomfortable or give me a silly skinny jean look. They are my wife's favorite in terms of the look as well.527 (low rise boot gen 7): These were my least favorite or the group. They were uncomfortably tight, when sitting I am constantly pulling, and 'adjusting' to try to sit comfortably. I have pulled on them and wear them a bit extra long trying to stretch them out. They are still wearable, but I really only put them on if my other two pairs are dirty. My wife thinks they are the second best in terms of look, putting them in the not to loose, seems to look pretty good on me middle of the road. Obviously since they don't feel good and are to restricting for movement, etc I give them last place. I wouldn't buy this style again.
