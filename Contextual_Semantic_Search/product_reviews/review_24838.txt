I was debating to get this medium or large since it was the same price and I'm glad I ordered the medium because this one huge but still manageable. You could fit easily fit 1 wk worth of clothing.  In the main compartment and 2 pairs of shoes in the end pockets. This duffle bag come folded and fit into a small bag which can be use as toiletry bag. The handles can be held together by the Velcro wrap and there's a comfortable detachable shoulder strap to free up your hands when necessary. The water resistant canvas like material made this bag very light compare to some other duffle bags.
