No surprises here -- this classic design is still a hit! The shoes fit perfectly with no gaps or rubbing places. They're comfortable right out of the box, and (maybe best of all) unisex! They don't streak the floor, make weird noises, or cause pain. If you're a Vans fan, these shoes are nothing new; but in this case, that's a good thing!
