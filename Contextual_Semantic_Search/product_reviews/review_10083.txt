It's nice to see that you can get an inexpensive, high quality, heavy weight sweatshirt, without spending a whole paycheck at the local Big & Tall men's store.We picked up the 6XL Cardinal Red when it was only $9.60 and the 6XL Forest Green at $16.00... regardless of the price, they were a steal... especially with the Free Shipping!The stitching is very tight and durable. The neck sizes were perfect and the cuffs are nice, too. These are perfect cooler-cold weather sweatshirts. Being that the fleece inside is very warm and plush. Also, they look great with a turtle or mock neck, too.All in all, we're very pleased with with the quality and fit of these sweatshirts. We definitely plan on purchasing even more, in the near future.
