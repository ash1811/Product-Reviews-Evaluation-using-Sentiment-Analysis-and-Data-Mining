I would greatly prefer this shoe in brown to be a darker brown rather than &#34;mustard brown&#34; - the shoes themselves, I love. They are so comfortable from the very first day and only get to be more comfortable as they are broken in. So if you need a &#34;mustard brown&#34; shoe - this is the shoe for you!
