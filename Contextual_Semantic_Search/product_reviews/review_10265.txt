I got two of these shirts with a company logo about 6 years ago and wore it only in the house - knockabout.  It's still in great condition.  I bought 5 of the white and 5 of the black and couldn't be happier.  They wash well, last a long time and are soft - so you can wear them all day - and to sleep in.  Absolutely fantastic product.
