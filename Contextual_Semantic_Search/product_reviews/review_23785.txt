DICKIES UNISEX SCRUBS ~ Very rarely do I review pants, simply because I frankly can't ever decide whether to call them trewes, trousers, breeches (britches to me and mine) or pantaloons. It'd be easier if there was only one acceptable name, such as is the case with Dungarees. Ah well. English is so redundant isn't it?Due to this specific item, I will offer a warning: whether you're an Olympian, a healthcare worker (get back to work) or a cripple like myself, I really do suggest avoiding drawstring scrubs. It's nice they are honest so you must know: elastic-waist, which is ideal, is labeled as such. Drawstring are just floppy rectangular pants and that drawstring will bring you heartache after heartache.The pants are about what you'd expect. The fit is generous (or damned dangerous if you get them even one size too large, as I did). The fabric is tough as nails and I can't imagine any proper loungewear wardrobe without a few pairs of these ~ they are strong enough to fly out the door (with you in them) to work in the garden or to visit the store. Naturally, if you are in health care, get off the web and get back to work!!As a final word of advice: better you stick to CHEROKEE brand scrubs with an elastic waistband ... and if you can, avoid cargo pockets because they can interfere with movement. I advise this because my needs are special ~ due to my size and other necessities, I get CHEROKEES in a 5X and they are a delight.Naturally, if you are big-and-or-tall, I'd skip Amazon and go to King Size Direct. Tell 'em I told ya.
