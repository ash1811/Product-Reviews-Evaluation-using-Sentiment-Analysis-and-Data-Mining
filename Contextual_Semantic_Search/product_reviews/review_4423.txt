I have searched for years for a strapless that didn't head south at the slightest provocation or cling so tightly to my ribcage that it left grooves in my flesh. Finally, I have found one! This bra is awesome; it has tape on both top and bottom to help it stay in place for hours. Which it does. Just wore this bra out for a six-hour evening, and I never once had to adjust it! It is definitely snug, but not so tight as to restrict blood flow as some horrors I've worn in the past. WORD OF CAUTION: the cup sizes run small. I usually wear a C cup, which is what I originally ordered. I had a problem with &#34;over-boobage&#34; with that one, if you know what I mean. But I ordered a D cup, and it fits perfectly! The bra even gives a little lift so I don't look droopy, like in most strapless bras. Oh, and it comes with detachable straps that also work well with the bra. Definitely recommend the seller as well; the bra shipped immediately and arrived promptly.
