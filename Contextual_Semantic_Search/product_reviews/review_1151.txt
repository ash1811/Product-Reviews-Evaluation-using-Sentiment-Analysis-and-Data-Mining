great bra, runs big in  the cups....I am small in the back, but, this, the cups not for me anywayHad to return mine, even though I did try it on in a hurry, purchased the bra, and had to return both...I am a 36 DD, very nice, cups run big.  I am a 36 DD in all bras, this one, not to good.....Fav bras, Bali new "comfort bra" awesome, Bali "t back bra", Gap," full coverage lace", and my very fav. "Champion everday bra", wonderful, perfect fitting in each styleSo beware....
