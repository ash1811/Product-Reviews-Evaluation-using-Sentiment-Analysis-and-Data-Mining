We have at least 20 baseball belts in different sizes and colors, from our two sons' many seasons of baseball.  But, we didn't have a black one in an adult size, which our older son needs now that he's bigger.  I ordered this one from Amazon because I didn't have time to drive to Walmart (which usually doesn't have what we need) or Dick's (an hour away).The belt is perfect - long enough and adjustable for adult sized waists, wider than youth belts, and made of stretchy elastic.  Our son's baseball team didn't give them belts with the uniform, and his first game is in three days, so I was happy to receive this one so quickly and have "belt" checked off my list.
