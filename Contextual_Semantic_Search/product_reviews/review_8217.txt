The Invicta Pro Diver Automatic watch is a quality watch. The case and face look similar to the Rolex Submariner. Invicta is a Swiss company, but the self winding mechanism is Japanese. It works well, it runs fast just a few second a day. This does not happen with quartz movements, but the advantage of self winding is evident. It is a rugged watch at a good price. Case and stainless steel band's finish is quite good.
