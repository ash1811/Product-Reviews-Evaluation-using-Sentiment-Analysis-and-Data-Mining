I have been wearing this brand of Minimizer bra for over 15 years and I won't buy anything else. The fit is great and it lasts. I wash mine by hand and hang to dry and it fits fit like it just came out of the package. It does a good job of minimizing and this helps with finding tops that fit better. Not only does this bra have great support, it is very comfortable.
