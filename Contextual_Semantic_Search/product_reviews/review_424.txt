Unlike what other reviewers said, this shoe is EXACTLY the correct size. I will say, though, the tag on the inside of the shoe has weird sizing information. for instance, it says that my size 11.5 men's shoes (US) are size 9.5 Mens (US)... I ordered 11.5's and these are, in fact, 11.5... I have no idea why the sizing info on the tag is wrong as these do not appear to be counterfeit shoes.
