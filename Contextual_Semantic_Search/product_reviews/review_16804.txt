This is a very well made shirt.  The design is very well thought out and the fit is as expected.  I am between a large and a medium and the large is just too big in the body.  This medium fits great In the body but a little snug in the chest and shoulders.  It is a lighter weight than the other denim shirts I have, but, it is still a great shirt to own.
