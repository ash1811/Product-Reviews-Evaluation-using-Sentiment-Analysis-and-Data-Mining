I ordered this from the discovery channel store. When it arrived, I was shocked as to how this suit was made. It looks authentic in the pictures, but for fifty bucks it should come with a helmet. Sure it's made well enough, not like you got it over the counter at walmart during a halloween sale, but it's not worth the price. They do come with all the fancy badges sewn on, but the sizes run way to small. I ordered a 8/10 for my eight year old who barely weighs 60#, and is only 52" tall, and it was way to small. The legs are really short on this suit, it looked like it would fit a young 7 year old. Needless to say, I ordered the helmet with sounds too, but that never arrived either. I sent the suit back because they said they were out of a bigger size, and asked for a refund. Shop around before buying this, it's way overpriced for what you get. If you can get this on sale, then it's worth it, but keep in mind they run small. This suit would be worth the price if it came with a helmet too. My son was really disappointed with me sending it back, but I am going to look around before buying another one in the future.
