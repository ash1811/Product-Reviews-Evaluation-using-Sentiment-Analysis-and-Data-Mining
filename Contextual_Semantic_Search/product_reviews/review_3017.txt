These are nice heavy coveralls. They seem well made and heavy duty. I cant speak much beyond that because I had to return them due to size.  Determining the proper size on these is difficult. I did research and read several reviews by people on here that are similar size to me. They stated that sizes between 38 - 42 fit perfect. Sure 40 would fit perfectly, if I wore 5 pairs of jeans, 3 sweat shirts and a ski parka underneath. Its huge! IDK what fitting perfectly means to most people, but to me, looking like the Michelin man isnt fitting perfectly. So if you are 5'11 and about 180 lbs, I wouldnt order higher than a 38. I personally ordered a 36 and debated about a 34.***Update*** Got the size 36 today and it fits just about perfect. The lower half of these are still kinda puffy but thats how its cut. It was 12 F outside today with strong wind gusts and I didnt feel very cold at all. And I didnt even have a full base layer underneath like I normally would for those temps. Im pleased with these coveralls. I would expect to be warm down to 0 F or maybe -15 F with the proper base layer and the optional hood with a beanie underneath. This is a great product!
