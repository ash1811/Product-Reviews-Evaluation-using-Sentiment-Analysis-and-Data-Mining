I'm an RN. I needed something with a sweep hand and that was water resistant. I also wanted something inexpensive so if it ever did become blood soaked, contaminated or just broken on the job it could be easily replaced. Exactly what I needed. Keeps excellent time and is super light. Don't even know I'm wearing it. I also like that it has the military times since that's what we now use at work so I can give it a quick glance and see what time I need to put into my documentation. For the money, can't beat it.
