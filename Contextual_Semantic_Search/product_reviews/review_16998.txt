I work as a snowmobile guide and found them to be warm, and fit my size 10 very well.Problem: alot of stitching in leather. Conditioned/sealed all leather and stitching with mink oil and they have stayed water tight even in the slush. Highly recommend you do this! Leather is pretty dry out of the box and clean at this point. So, condition your boots before going out in them.
