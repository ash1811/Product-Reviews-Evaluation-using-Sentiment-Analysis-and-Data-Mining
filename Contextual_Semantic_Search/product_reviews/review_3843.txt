I would recommend this cincher to any lady who wants to nip her waist down a couple of inches.  Or, if you want to cut back on your food portions.  :)Seriously though, it's a tight fit and may take some wear to shape to your body.  But, I purchased two cinchers and this one fits exactly as expected.
