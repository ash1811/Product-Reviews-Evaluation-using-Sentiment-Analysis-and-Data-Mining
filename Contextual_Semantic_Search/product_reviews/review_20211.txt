I workout somewhat aggressively for a 60+ guy and I perspire very heavily . Since my fitness area is in my home these are my workout briefs . They are cooler , absorb more perspiration , and do not &#34;ride&#34; like synthetic blend fabrics . Also the neutral color is recommended in the presence of sweat for avoiding rashes and irritation ( treadmill mileage ! ) .And the &#34;brief&#34; style furnishes good support for the ballroom .  Also at two pairs for 16 bux they are a real bargain . However for standard wear I prefer a roomy silk boxer .
