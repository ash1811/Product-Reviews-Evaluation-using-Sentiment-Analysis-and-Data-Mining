This watch is great, it is simple but has everything you need. Works great very durable. Absolutely love it. I work with coal on a daily basis. Coal is corrosive and seems to find its way into everything. This watch has stood the test of time. It has remained water tight despite being hit and knocked on everything you can think of. Would recommend. There of course are much nicer g shocks on the market. But this one is simple and rugged. And doesn't have a lot of clutter on the face. My only thing to improve would be the glowing hands and tick marks. They glow but not very long. You do have a digital read out but it would be nice to just look down in the dark and see the hands without having to touch my watch. But small thing. No big deal. The face is recessed in behind the brim on the case. So there is good protection for the face.
