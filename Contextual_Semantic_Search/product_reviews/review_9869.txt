i bought this shirt for my boyfriend so I was nervous bc he is very hard to please, he has a small frame/build and wears mediums so that's the size I bought.  at first it looked a little silly but now that he has gained more mass its sexy! I'm about to buy him another,.it is now his favorite workout shirt! ah I was also worried about it being itchy or short (his top 2complaints with clothes) but neither was a problem! he is 5'8' it fit fine long ways!
