This is a Christmas gift for my sixteen year old son. He likes things basic, and this is exactly that. A basic passport and money holder for travel. The color is not like the picture at all, but I am keeping it and letting him decide.The very light beige will get dirty quickly.The zippered section is fine. I wish the passport section had a zipper instead of velcro. For the price, it is adequate.
