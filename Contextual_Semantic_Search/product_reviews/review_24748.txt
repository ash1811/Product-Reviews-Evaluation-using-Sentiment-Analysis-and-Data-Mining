I love wearing sandals more then anything else, and for the most part these delivered what I wanted. Worn almost everyday over the summer, I never felt that the quality was lacking.Now wearing them around the house, they do seem softer then they were, and give in a just more then I would like. This does cause minor back pain, and so I won't be able to wear these next summer. I had hoped they might last longer then one summer, but hey they were just sandals.
