I was looking for a bigger pack, and didn't have ideas on size dimensions.  Oddly enough, I'm growing fond of it.  I carry my gym shoes and clothes, towel, protein bottle, vitamins, and bathroom goods.  With a main pouch and single size zipper pouch, the pack is essentially full.  It serves it's purpose.
