It seems that for so much money there could be more comfort. I think snow/winter boots all should have wide toe boxes, and it'd be nice if they had more comfortable insoles or room for you to put in your own. Up here in the winter, you find yourself wearing them for long periods of time.Otherwise, they look great and are put together really well.
