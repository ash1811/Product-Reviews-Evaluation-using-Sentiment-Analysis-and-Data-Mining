I had some of this style Jockeys from back in the daywhen we still made stuff.  Lasted at least 10 years.  ThoughtI would go up a size due to shrinkage and so forth.  If you aregoing to wear these under chest high trout fishing waders oryou are Pee Wee Herman these fit great.  My wife fell out ofbed laughing since they almost covered my nipples!  Do yourselfa favor guys, just go &#34;commando&#34;, cause you can't purchase adecent pair of under ware in the USA anymore.
