These are good quality, comfy and plush inside, plenty of room for my wide feet, and just enough heel to keep from sliding out yet be able to slip on with ease. I am female and wear a woman's size 9 shoe, but I had to get these in a men's size 9 which fits perfect. I double checked the gender when I got the replacement pair (originally ordered size 7) and they say men's size 9, so be warned.
