i really like these a lot and have no complaints except for i listened to the reviews about it being to big for kids. i thought since i have not so big hands id get it... it fit perfect all but my thumb. it doesnt really go all the way down between my thumb and index finger. its not that big a deal and i can still wear them just sucks lol but i still have complete use of mmy thumb... i recommend them a lot they are still super cute but if you have bigger hands get adult size
