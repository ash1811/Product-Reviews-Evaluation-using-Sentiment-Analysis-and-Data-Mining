I LIVE IN VENEZUELA AND THIS BRAND OF SHIRTS HAS GREAT DEMAND HERE.SO,I HAVE PURCHASED SEVERAL ITEMS AND THE QUALITY AND DURABILITY ARE PROVED. THE ONLY THING ONE BUYER HAS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IS THE SIZE. THESE SHIRTS ARE "HUGE"- IN MY CASE I AM SIZE LARGE,BUT IN THIS BRAND I AM SIZE SMALL. EVERYTHING ELSE IS GOOD.....
