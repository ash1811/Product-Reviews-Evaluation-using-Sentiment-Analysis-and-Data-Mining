I have heel spurs and one leg longer than the other.  I spend my shift plus more hours on my feet as a nurse.  I didn't want shoes that would become tight after hours on my feet.  These shoes fit true to size.  There is room for me to add the individually sized orthotic inserts that I had made to treat my heel spurs.  Also, the soles were amenable for the othortist to slice open and add an extra 1/2 inch lift for my shorter leg.  I like that I could order a nursing shoe in a basic black because I can wear either scrubs or jeans in my job and these go well with either.  If anything, they could use maybe a slight more amount of cushioning.  With the amount of time I spend on my aging feet, there may be no shoe that is perfect.
