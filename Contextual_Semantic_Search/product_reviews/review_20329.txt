These shirts shrink very little the first wash then none after that. They are not the softest shirts on record but they are pretty true to size. A large fits as should. But the great thing Is these shirts come In around 30 colors to choose from! It a dream to get colors to match your outerware. And at less than $5 for a large they are a great deal even with a small shipping fee. I received some sand and some chestnut which Is a nice color besides the black shown.For the fit, and value they are 5 star shirts. Hope you enjoy.
