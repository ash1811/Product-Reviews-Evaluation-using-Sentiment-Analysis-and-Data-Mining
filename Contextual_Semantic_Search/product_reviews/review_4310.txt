This is the most comfortable shoe my husband has ever worn, but the soles wear out (fall apart) fast! He finally decided to never buy them again as they were too expensive to keep replacing. However, after wearing many other shoes, he's returned to these as they are the only ones he finds totally comfortable with perfect support in all the right places.
