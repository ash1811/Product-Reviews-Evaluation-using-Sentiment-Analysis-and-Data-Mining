This is a new brand for me to wear but I knew it must be a classic for some reason. Brick/mortar stores don't usually stock my size so I was glad to see it on Amazon.This is well made, smooth & comfortable. I can wear it under the smoothest most fitted knits & for extended periods of time comfortably.The sizing is exactly on as far as I'm concerned.I've just received it so only 1 wash but it looks great so far.
