These are warm socks, doing what I expected keeping my feet warm in work boots during mild winter nights at work.  One thing I don't like, though, is that they don't breathe very well.  At the end of a 12 hour shift plus and hour before and after, my dogs are BARKIN bad and the boots need air fresheners in the garage between shifts.
