A high quality product. Not an ordinary T Shirt, heavy 100% cotton, during this cold weather I'm wearing a white T shirt underneath. Cuffs have elastic, long length I can tuck in but I wear outside like the model; great for cool to cold outdoors if you are active you won't need a jacket unless it's really cold.I'm usually a Large 5'11 170  lbs athletic build - wear a 42 Regular suit with 34&#34; waist athletic build - Medium fits me best but I am slim, if you are larger in the chest and belly then a Large might fit you better.You can find work shirts at stores for half the price, at around $20 for a Carhartt you will get a much better product, double stitched every where, washes up real well and will last a long time.  I try to shop for sales but Carhartt doesn't discount much, so go ahead and pay up for the real deal and you will be glad you did!Only problem is I wear it all the time, should have followed my wife's advice shoe buying, &#34;if the shirt fits buy it in every color!&#34;
