We've bought a few pairs 2 years ago and we haven't been disappointed so yet. Feet stay warmer, drier and more comfortable with these than they do with regular cotton socks and they appear to be reasonably durable. So far they lasted trough two cold seasons and through many washing cycles.It should be noted that these are not wool socks but they do a good job at keeping you warm and comfortable when 'wool' is not required. I tend to use wool or some wool blend socks when out in the winter but wool is expensive and these, being so durable are what I wear when I run on the treadmill - socks beat sneakers.This is what the manufacturer's official 'contents' statement has on content:50% Polyester22% Nylon21% X2O Acrylic7% CottonThe maker, Wigwam Mills, promises to replace any pair of socks within one year of purchase if it's returned with the purchase receipt and a letter explaining why they are returned (no cash refunds).Oh, and did I mention that these are actually 'Made in the USA'? More exactly, Made in Sheboygan, WI, USA :)
