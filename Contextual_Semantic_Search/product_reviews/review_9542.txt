I am a police officer and I purchased these socks for cold winter nights.  Any police officer who has been stuck on a perimeter knows what it is like to stand still for hours on end in a back yard at 2 am in winter.  I've worn these socks with Danner patrol boots so I assume the combination of the two is what has kept my feet so warm.  Regardless, they are all I will ever purchase now.PROS:Very warmComfortable and thickCONS:Holes after 1 year (for 7 bucks each who cares)Tend to smell after the night is over
