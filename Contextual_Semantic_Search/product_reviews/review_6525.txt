I bought these at the same time as another pair. These are good gloves - the leather material has a nice feel, provides excellent grip on a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and the gloves help keep hand oils and other contaminants off the steering wheel's leather. The only thing about these gloves I don't care for is the use of velcro on the straps.
