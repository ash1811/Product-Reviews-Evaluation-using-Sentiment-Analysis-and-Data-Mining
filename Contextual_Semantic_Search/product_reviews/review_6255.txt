I like the shirts, no tags, nice and soft... the only reason why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that they shrunk length-wise. So now they look very wide and not as long. My daughter is tall and skinny, so the last thing I wanted was for the shirts to get shorter, but it still works. She wears 5T and the size S works for her right now.
