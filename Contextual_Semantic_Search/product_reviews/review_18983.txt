Timex Men's Outdoor Performance Digital Compass Expedition Watch #T77862I wanted an inexpensive watch to tell me direction when I got lost on the motorcycle.  This watch does the trick.  Although I can't steer the bike and get a heading at the same time it serves the purpose.  Easy to read display most of the time (except in somewhat dim lighting).  The band is very comfortable and I don't know I have it on most of the time.  Great watch, great price.  I'd buy again.
