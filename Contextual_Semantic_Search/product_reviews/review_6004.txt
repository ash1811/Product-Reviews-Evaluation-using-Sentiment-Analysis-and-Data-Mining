I love these thigh highs, and have come back to buy several more pairs. They do not run very easily. Also, the great thing about thigh highs is that even if one stocking does get a run, you only need to replace one of the stockings, not a whole pair.I like &#34;little color&#34; on my fair skin. It looks very natural.
