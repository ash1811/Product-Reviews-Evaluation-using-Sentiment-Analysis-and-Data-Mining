I got the sweat shirt and I like my sweatshirts to be really large and roomy as I sometimes wear them over other shirts.  I ordered and extra large thinking these would run closer to men's sizes --but I wish I had ordered and extra extra large.  The sweatshirt fits and it is comfortable enough, but I was looking for a more roomy oversized fit and I didn't really get that by ordering the extra large.  So I believe the sizing is not what some might be expecting since it's a man in the picture wearing the sweatshirt.  But the sweatshirt is labeled unisex.  Just beware of the size you are ordering.
