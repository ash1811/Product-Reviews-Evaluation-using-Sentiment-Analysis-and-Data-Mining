I ordered a 32F. The band seems looser than my others and was riding up in the back when I tried it on. A 30 would have worked well. I did not notice any itchiness or stabbing from the wires like others have posted. However, the cups give my breasts a cone shape and that is not something I find very flattering. Also, this bra did not have any tags (sales tags) other than the one attached to the hooks, this is something I expect when ordering something new. I will be sending this back.
