These are really cute- and the fit is as expected for small 0-3 month shorts.  They will be perfect for the collectible reborn dolls I make, and need something to cover the upper part of the thigh, where the cloth body connects to the vinyl legs for 3/4 leg sculpts. I will reorder in this color and the pink set.
