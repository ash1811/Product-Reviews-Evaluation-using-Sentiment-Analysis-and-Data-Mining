I have Size 13 ground pounders.  These are nice socks.  They are thick like most other new socks.  I'm sure they will thin out with time like any other.  The gold toe helps me pair them up when doing laundry.  Other than that, I've never understood the gold toe hype.  I gave it four stars, because how can you love socks?  I like them.  If you need black socks, I recommend these.
