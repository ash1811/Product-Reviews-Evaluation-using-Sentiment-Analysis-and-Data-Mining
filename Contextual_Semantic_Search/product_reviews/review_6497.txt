I have spent a great deal of money on tights recently, and these are by far the best.  They don't run, rip or snag if you handle them properly. They look good. I wear them in place of stockings with business clothes and they look good, feel good. There is some compression so it's a nice supportive feel and slenderizing.  The nude really is a nude color. Pink is nice with pink shoes. I will be buying more now that I know they work. LIght weight enough for warm weather.
