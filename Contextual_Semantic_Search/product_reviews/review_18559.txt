I had a watch like this for about 30 years before it died. Well, actually it didn't completely die, the band came apart and the light quit working, so I got a new one.  Keeps perfect time.  For the price you can't beat it.  I've had two much more expensive, dressy Seiko watches and they aren't nearly as reliable.
