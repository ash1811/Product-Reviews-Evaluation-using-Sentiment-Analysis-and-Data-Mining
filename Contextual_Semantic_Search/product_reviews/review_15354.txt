I bought this because it was the closest thing I found to the bustier I borrowed at the bridal salon when I tried on my wedding dress. I like it because it smooths the front and the cups offer good support. However, it created a bit of back fat when I put it on, and I could not put it on by myself, so make sure you have someone to help you. I ended up putting it over my 24-bone underbust corset to hide the corset strings. I would not recommend wearing it by itself it you are self-conscious about your tummy rolls--it will roll up unless you have a bone-in corset underneath.
