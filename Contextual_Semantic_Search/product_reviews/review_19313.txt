Bought to wear with halter dress.  Used the invisible straps as the halter straps made the bra fit funny with gaps.  Half way through the night the left strap snapped at the hook closure in the front.  The band was uncomfortably tight and if you are buying would size up your band size.  All in all not a good purchase.
