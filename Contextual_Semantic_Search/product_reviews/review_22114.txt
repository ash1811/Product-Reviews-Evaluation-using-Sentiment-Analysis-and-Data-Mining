the shoe is comfortable and attractive with crop pants.  don't know if it's a great walking shoe as i have not worn them yet.  plan on wearing them when i travel as a review i read prior to buying them was that they are easy to travel in and quite comfortable.  we will see.  like the looks of them tho.wanted the white with navy but the only color available at the time i ordered them was natural.
