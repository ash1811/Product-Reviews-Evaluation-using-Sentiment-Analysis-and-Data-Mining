I have been debating about buying this sandal for quite some time now, since it was on sale  I bought it. As usual Clarks has always made a very comfortable shoe and sandal. however, in my opinion they went and put  the Strap for tightening the sandal on the WRONG SIDE. This makes the strap for tightening on the outside of the Sandal unlike their Hudson where the Strap is on the inside of the sandal. Although, it is livable, but inconvenient for anyone reaching to outer side of the sandalWill I return them? Hell no they are just too comfortable as they make the best Sandal I have ever worn in the past 55 years.
