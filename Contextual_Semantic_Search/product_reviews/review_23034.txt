This is about my fourth pair of Rockport Oxfords.  They last about 1.5 years, wearing them two to three days a week (I alternate a chocolate and a black pair).  They're the most comfortable semi-dress shoes that I've found.  I sometimes take several mile walks in them in downtown Honolulu, and they don't hurt my feet!
