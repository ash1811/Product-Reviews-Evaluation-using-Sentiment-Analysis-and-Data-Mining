The first time I saw Mocs, I thought they were ugly shoes. But wearing them is a different story- they are SO comfortable. It's the only shoe I've worn for about 15 years now. I used to buy them from REI, but REI only carries standard widths (at least the store I go to does) and Amazon had them in wide, which is what I prefer.
