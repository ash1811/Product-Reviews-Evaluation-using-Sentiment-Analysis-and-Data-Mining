I really wanted to like this little canvas bag but it has too many shortcomings.  The pockets in the portfolio are too deep for regular credit cards - they slide way down and it is very difficult to remove them.  I just leave the cards I use most often standing up so I can reach them, which isn't really secure.  The velcro that holds this portfolio part shut is very loose - it opens all the time from the weight of my normal cell phone.  The clasp that holds the top of the bag shut was so hard to open and close that I just cut it off.  Since I can't close the top, my cell phone tends to slide out of the bag.  I was living with all of these minor issues, but now the lining of the pockets has started to fray - and it's a pocket that I almost never use.  It's one thing that I'm not happy with some design issues but the fact that I've had it for less than six months and it is wearing out lead me to rate it one star.  It's a great size, has a nice strap and with a few changes could be a wonderful little bag.  Without those changes, I advise you to keep looking.
