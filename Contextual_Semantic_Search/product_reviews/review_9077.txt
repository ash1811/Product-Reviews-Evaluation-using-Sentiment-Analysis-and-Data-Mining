They are great! Great looks and comfort. These 511's fit incredibly good because of their very thin (yet strong) denim and the fact that they are stretch too. Colour is very nice and does not wash off. I am pretty sure they are pre-shrunk as well. Note: They are not made in the USA, so if you expect American jeans these are not for you. The ones that I received are made in Colombia and do not have the word LEVI'S on the red tab on the back, just the 'R' Registered mark, but they have very good quality and looks.
