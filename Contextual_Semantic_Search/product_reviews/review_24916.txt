In over 30 years of wearing bras, this is the most comfortable and best fitting bra I've ever worn - and I've tried them all.  The cups on this bra are seamless and lightly padded against show-through, and the shoulder straps stay in place without digging in. It has the standard sliding adjustment on the straps, and two hooks on the back strap.  It runs true to size and the underwire is comfortable too.  It offers full coverage, and yet is low enough in front to compliment cleavage.  I love the way it fits!It is a little expensive - $25 at the time I purchased them.  But for a great fitting bra with quality elastic I am happy to pay the price.  With free SuperSaver shipping on Amazon, it's a great value.I wish it came in more colors - I've only been able to find electric blue, fuschia, white, beige, black and a dark purply/brown color called La Perla Pink.  If Vanity Fair would make this one in some patterns or more colors I'd be in heaven.  As it is, I bought six of them, because as all women know,immediately after you find a style you like it is discontinued.As a side note, I found these bras at JCPenney's too.  They had limited sizes and colors, at the same price as Amazon.
