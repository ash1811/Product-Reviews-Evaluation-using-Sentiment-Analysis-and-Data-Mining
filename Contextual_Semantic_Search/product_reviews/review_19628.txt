These boots are very well made and the fit is true to size.  First thing I dd when I received the boots was rubbed mink oil over all the leather to protect them from water and to condition the leather.  The mink oil did not change the color of the boot.  the boots are very comfortable and light weight.  Feet will stay dry in up to about 3 inches of water.  The boots also look better in person than on here, and I have already received plenty of compliments.  Boots are comfortable to wear in warm and cool weather.
