These are the most comfortable sandals in the world.  HOWEVER, watch the sizing if you have owned an earlier version of these since Keen has changed the fit (sales person at REI confirmed that they fit smaller than they used to).  After getting a half size larger, all was good, but it's just something to be aware of.
