I've been thinking that it might be time to get some more Thorlos.  The old ones are starting to get thin in places.No, not the ones I bought three years ago.  Those are fine.  The ten year old ones are starting to give up the ghost, and I've had to toss a number of them.But I'm not going to complain about 10 year old socks (worn and washed an average of once every couple of weeks) that get worn out.
