The watch is nice.  Small and compact, short profile (ie. height) on the wrist, no side pushbuttons to accidentally activate. I also like that you see the date, day, time and am/pm without having to push a button. However, the band is very inadequate. It is barely long enough to span my average-sized wrist. It's also very narrow and digs into the flesh. I will keep but by the time I replace the band, I will likely have exceeded the price of the watch.
