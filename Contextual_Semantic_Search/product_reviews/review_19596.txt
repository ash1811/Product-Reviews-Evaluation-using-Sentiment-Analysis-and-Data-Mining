Shipping was quick and it was packaged in cute little round ring box with green bow.However, the color of the stone is a light yellow, not the honey champagne color depicted on the webpage. The size 5 I ordered is more like a 6.5, way too big! It's too expensive to return because of shipping costs.Very disappointed.
