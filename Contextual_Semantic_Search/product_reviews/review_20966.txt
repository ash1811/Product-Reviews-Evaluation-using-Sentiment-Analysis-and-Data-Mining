I have a very hard time finding bras that fit. In this bra I'm a 34F (it runs a cup size large so order a cup size down), and it's very hard to find supportive bras that are durable, comfortable, and that hold the ladies up without looking ridiculous. This bra holds my breasts up where they belong, looks seamless under any shirt, and fits perfectly around my rib cage and under my arms. My husband commented that I've never looked better wearing a bra, which I think is a testament in itself. My ONLY complaint is that the material used for the straps makes them loosen easier than other bras I've owned, but it's as simple as tightening the straps every few days before I put on the bra. I'd recommend this to any ladies wanting a supportive bra that holds up :-)
