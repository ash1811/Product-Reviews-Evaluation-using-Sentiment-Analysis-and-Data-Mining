I bought two pair of these earrings in April 2005 for $10 each, one for me and one for a granddaughter.  Now Amazon is running them for $9 on the Friday sale.  It's not too soon to be thinking about Christmas stocking stuffers.  These would be perfect.  These are real gold, quality earrings.  I love mine and have worn them now for almost two years with no problems, having to be careful about metal allergies.  What are you waiting for?
