This is my first pair rainbows so don't have to much to compare to, other than friends telling me they're the best. The fit of these seem a little big, but I don't really mind that. However they seem to need a lot of breaking in. Like many other flip-flops they rub a LOT. I have to wear them a little at a time so I won't blister. These do have great arch support and I feel that when I break them in I will be comfortable walking all day.
