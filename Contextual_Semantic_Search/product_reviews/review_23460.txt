On Gossamer mesh panties are the perfect material for travel and for everyday.  They wash easily by hand, are very lightweight and dry fast.  The elastic trim and waist band is as flat as possible and there is barely any panty line for a non-thong.  Plus they are available in a range of basic and seasonal colours.Sizing tends to run large as the material is so stretchy (but never slouchy) and this Hi-Cut style is exactly as the name describes; it is very high cut.  Regular torso ladies will find that the waistband falls at the belly button or just slightly below.  Ladies with longer torsos will find that this sits an inch below the belly button. Petite ladies should order 1 size down.These panties are quite delicate and care needs to be taken when donning and doffing to avoid poking a fingernail through the mesh fabric.  Handwashing is best [why not, since it is so easy?] and dryers = immensely decreased lifespan if not instant death.
