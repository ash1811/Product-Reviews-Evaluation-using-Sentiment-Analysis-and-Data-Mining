I got the medium size and they fit my shoes perfectly. I wear size 9.5 medium width. They have a nice smell to them and really fill out the shoes. I use them on Allen Edmonds and A. Testoni's and they fit good on both of them. If you want to spend the extra money, the allen edmonds shoe trees feel sturdier and seem to be of better craftsmanship. Another thing with these is that one of them seems to be cut incorrectly, it just looks odd compared to the other half. But all in all, there should be no reason to pick the allen edmonds over these, they do the job, and do it right. Unless you're a picky perfectionist, you will see no faults with the quality of this shoe tree.
