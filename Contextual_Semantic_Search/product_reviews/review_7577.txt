This really was a beautiful cap. The fit was awesome; the fabric looked top notch; the detail to the stitching was very well thought out; the back of the cap looked awesome when I put it on but when I turned around to look at in the mirror I looked like a fool. LOL! It just didn't suit my face or head. My face is roundish and my head is squarish. I need a little height to my caps. This particular cap has no height whatsoever. So I had to send it back. I purchased the http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0071NER9E/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_18 instead and that looked really great when I put it on.
