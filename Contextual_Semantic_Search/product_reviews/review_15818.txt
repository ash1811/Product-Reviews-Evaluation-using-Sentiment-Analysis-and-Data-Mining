I like these socks, and have worn them for several years in all kinds of climates. There are price deals now and then, you also can get a free pair from the manufacturer if you want to try them out. OK as slippers but they are slippery on wood floors.  As far as wear they don't last forever, and I find the heels wear first. Also on my Dunham Cloud boots I had to tape over the insides where the lace eyelets are located to avoid abrasion on the socks. (A boot problem I think).
