Item was as expected. It was a goodbye, so I purchased two. I have no concerns. I do realize now that the B cup that I bought was too large, but she will grow into it. I'm considering repurchasing the same in a smaller size. Thank you for the transaction, as item was mailed and received in a timely manner.
