I purchased these for my husband, and I will not purchase them again.The canvas began tearing, and actually got holes in it on the toes ofboth shoes - after just a few weeks of everyday wear.I have purchased the Saucony brand in the past, and really expected aMUCH higher-quality shoe from this company!
