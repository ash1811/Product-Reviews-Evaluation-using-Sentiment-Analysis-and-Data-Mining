These are good dance shoes and hold up well! However, I have a foot that is somewhat narrower than normal, and these slippers are extremely wide. I had to pull the strings for a while until I got the proper fit. But then the material from the slippers started to rub at my heel bones from the tightness. It was a little painful so I readjusted the strings to loosen them in the heel area and now the slippers fit comfortably. I did notice, however, that after using them for just one dance class, the sole started to darken significantly. It's not a big deal to me, but others might be bothered by it.
