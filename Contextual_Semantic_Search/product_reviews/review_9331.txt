I'm a bit surprised that so many people are confused by the texture they've received here, but I am not surprised that they're confused they received it.  The Dane finish is part of Levi's "WATER|LESS" finishing process and is waxed. It's a highly sought after finish which can be ruined or washed away and normally is only recommended for spot cleaning and not regular washing machine washing. You can, it just wont be as shiny afterward.It doesn't put wax on your hands. It feels like something between waxed and oiled, like you might think of a garment that is waterproofed. They don't wear any "hotter" or seal dampness in any more than regular jeans, and simply have a unique sheen to them that is trendy, and probably wouldn't be considered a 'daily wear' pair of jeans.I am on a huge hunt for this finish because it's my new favorite thing. I don't know why Levi's isn't more direct about this finish because it surprises some, and isn't easy enough to find for others.
