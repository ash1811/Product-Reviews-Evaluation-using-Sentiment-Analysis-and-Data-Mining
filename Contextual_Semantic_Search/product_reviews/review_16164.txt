This shoe horn is ok but nothing to bragg about.  The spring makes it very difficult to handle.  I wouldn't stay in place and keeps shifting.  Just get a sturdy, one piece shoe horn and you'd be much much much better off.  And a another piece of advise - at all costs avoid the ones with a &#34;hook&#34; on the back that is suppose to keep the shoe in place.  I have it and it is even worse that this one...
