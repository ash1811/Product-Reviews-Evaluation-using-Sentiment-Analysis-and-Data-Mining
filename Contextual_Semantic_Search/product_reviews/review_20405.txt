These pajamas are perfect for summer if you have air conditioning. They are soft, lightweight nylon tricot and feel very good on. They're just great if you want to have a some coverage but not too much. Just toss them in the washer and dryer on gentle, and they come out looking like new. In addition, they are very well made, with nice seams. My only negative comment is something I can fix: the bottoms are too long! I think the manufacturers are making pajamas for a new race of giant women these days, because I'm going to have to cut off a good 3 or 4 inches, and I'm 5'6&#34;. It's possible to just pull the bottoms way up, but they always end up falling back down, so I'll get busy with the sewing machine this week. These are still well worth the money.
