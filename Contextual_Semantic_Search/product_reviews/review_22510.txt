I just got this watch today and really like it. Fairly light weight compared to my Pro Diver (which is a nice change). I wanted a watch similiar to Obama's but did not want to spend over $300 for the one he rec'd as a gift from the Secret Service. This is almost as nice plus it is an eco drive. The chronograph dials are hard to read, esp the minutes but thats ok. The strap is just OK. I have smaller wrists so size was not a problem. Can not give it 5 stars due to the strap and hard to read sub dials (date hard to read too) but these are minor issues. Also the glow in the dark luminecense is not very good. Lasts less than an hour. I put a black leather band on this and it dresses up the watch. The dial is not a deep solid black but more of a very very dark gray/greenish color but looks black for the most part. Overall a solid 4 star rating.
