I just purchased these boots in the buff color on sale yesterday at R.E.I. for $65. I would have purchased them from Amazon first, but I wanted to try them on before buying. First off, these boots are VERY heavy and the foot is VERY large, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. I am usually a true size 8, and I went for the size 7 in these. They come with a lining, which is the white part you see sticking out on the top. I tried to wear them without the lining, and they dug into every part of my foot, so keep the lining in! I wore them around my house in the morning, to get used to them. At first, they feel so heavy that you almost want to drag your foot instead of lifting it. But after 20 minutes of wearing them, my feet/legs adjusted. They have quite big "spikes" on the bottom, which will be great for trudging through ice/snow. I own 2 pairs of the classic UGGs, and just purchased the new UGG Kensington (which was SUPPOSED to be a heavier snow shoe) and let me tell you, I have slid on ice, tripped in snow in UGG's more times than I can count. So if you're looking for a snow boot that will give you grounding (literally) from sliding this is the boot for you. I also usually double or triple up on socks, and a thin pair of socks worn with these boots keep my feet VERY warm! I know I will get a ton of use out of these in Pittsburgh winters, and trudging all over campus in the snow. They're also quite stylish if you ask me, and look really cute with a pair of leggings or skinny jeans. Amazon is probably the cheapest place you will find them, I know they go for well over $100 at Nordstrom.
