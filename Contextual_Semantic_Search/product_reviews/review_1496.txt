These pants are awesome but they run small and that's why I rated them with 4 stars instead of 5. If you are a big guy (I'm 6'4 275lbs) that likes to have room YOU MUST ORDER 2 SIZES BIGGER!! Trust me, save time by doing so but in the other hand if you are skinny w/ no behind then order your regular size or maybe 1 size bigger just to be comfortable. Overall I'm very happy with my pants after 2 returns.
