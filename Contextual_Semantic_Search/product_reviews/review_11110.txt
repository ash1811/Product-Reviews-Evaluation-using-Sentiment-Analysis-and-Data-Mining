I love these sandals. I had a pair when I was younger and couldn't resist buying these once I saw the affordable price. The massaging nodules do take some getting used to, but once you do they feel great. Your feet will thank you for them after a long day at work or even a long walk around the mall. I'm so glad that I got these again!
