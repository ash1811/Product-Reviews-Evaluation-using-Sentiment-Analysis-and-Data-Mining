Large breasted women will love this bra! This bra makes me look and feel like I've lost 20 pounds! Good support. Very comfortable. Perfect in warm weather. No shoulder ache or cutting in. The straps stay in place! An underwire bra that doesn't poke me. Ideal for wearing under button front blouses and retro fashions such as sheath dresses. Highly Recommended!!!
