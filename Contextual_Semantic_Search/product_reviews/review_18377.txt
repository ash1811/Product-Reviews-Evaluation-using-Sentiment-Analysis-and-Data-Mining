I bought these slippers for my husband's April birthday and he loves them! They are extremely well made, very comfortable, fit perfectly and are nice looking. I have bought him Ugg's in the past and appreciate the comparable quality and more reasonable price of this slipper.  We live in the Pacific Northwest so warm shearling slippers have become a necessity. These slippers also have outdoor soles, so if you need to walk your dog you do not need to change out of your comfortable indoor slippers.  I would highly recommend these slippers to everyone, and plan on buying a pair for our son's birthday in July!
