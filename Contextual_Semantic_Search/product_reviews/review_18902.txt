After my son "appropriated" my G-shock, I looked around for a comfortable digital watch to wear during long bike rides.  While the G-shock worked well I believe that the Timex carries the edge in comfort and readability.  The compact case doesn't overwhelm the wrist while feeling light and sturdy.  The display has an odd green cast, but the digits are large and easily read, which is a relief for one with poor eyesight.
