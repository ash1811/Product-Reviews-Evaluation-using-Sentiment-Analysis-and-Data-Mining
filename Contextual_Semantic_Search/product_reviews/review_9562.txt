I bought these on a chance they would be the right color, the right length, comfortable at the waist and look good as he walks in front of me; if you know what I mean. The chance turned out great; he loved the cut of these jeans and was very pleased.  They are the heavier material famously known as jeans; not some updated jean material.  If he is happy, I'm happy.
