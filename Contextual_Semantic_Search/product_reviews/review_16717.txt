First of all if you have a short torso and small boobs than this outfit is for you. This is not really made for women whose cup size is C or larger. Don't get me wrong it's a cute outfit but again if you are big busted there is no way you can fit in the top part and it's really meant for somebody who has a short torso. I really don't like the way it's made but otherwise it's cute but just not on me. When I modeled it for my friend he liked it but said that I wasn't &#34;comfortable in it&#34; I agreed and promptly re-gifted it to somebody else.
