I am very happy with these slippers. Very comfortable. Perfect for my needs. We live in a relatively moderate year round climate so I don't need really warm slippers, though I think these would be perfectly fine for a colder climate. I wanted the solid rubber sole as I do step outside wearing them, and sometimes the driveway or patio is wet due to morning dew or from our lawn sprinklers. The rubber soles do a great job of protecting my feet and preserving the integrity of the slipper. So far they have held up great and seem to be solidly constructed. I don't wear them for extended periods of time (i.e.: I don't lounge around the house in them all day). Usually just an hour or two in the morning or in the evening, so they don't get a rugged work out by any means. I expect they will last a long time with the way I use them.
