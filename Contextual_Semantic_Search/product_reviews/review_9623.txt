The larger size 46 has always been my  problem in Good Jeans.I came across these and was on caution because of ordering thru on-line finding receiving the correct fit in waist size and proper length and having to then send back was my concern...For the Brand &#34;Wrangler&#34; and the cost for BIG sizes these that I ordered these came exactly as I needed...The quality is also very good and should wear well...  I will be ordering more of the diffferent colors.
