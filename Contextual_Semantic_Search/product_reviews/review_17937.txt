Finding a company that puts pride and honor into their products, no matter how big or small, is hard to find. Great quality socks, made in the USA, for a fair price. $10 for 3 pairs might be a few dollars steep, but I would rather spend a few dollars extra to support USA made businesses that guarantee quality, than buy some cheaply made knockoffs from lord knows where. All positives here. Go Wigwam!
