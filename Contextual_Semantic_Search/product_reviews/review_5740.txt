Got dooped by the reviews on how they'd fit.  This company needs to get their s*** together man.  Mine showed up and first off; they are a lot more cotton than they are poly.  They look good - I like the pocket placement.  It appears as though the two snaps over where the Medic scissors on the photo are will break off in about  4 minutes.  The biggest complaint however, and the reason I have to turn around and sell them, is that I wear my jeans in a 32/32 or 33/32 if I can find them.  I got the "31-35" size.  The waist fits out of the package like a 33, which is great.  Unfortunately about 7" down on the top of the thigh/side of the crotch they fit like a 28.  It's the strangest way they tapered them.  The rest of the pant fits great, everywhere.  The only reasolution would be to pull the belt line up above my belly button...which I assure you there is enough crotch slack to do.  Dammit.  Buying pants online is always such a bastard.
