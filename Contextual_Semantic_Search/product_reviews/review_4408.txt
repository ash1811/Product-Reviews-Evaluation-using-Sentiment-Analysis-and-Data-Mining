I'm 6'4" and 300lbs, ordered a XXXL and it fits just the way I like it. Sliped over the t-shirt/sweater I was wearing with room to breathe.  Quality of stitching and workmanship overall is quite good.  Has a permanently attached hood that would do well to go over a baseball cap to keep it off your eyes. Stuffs backwards into the zippered front pocket fairly easily.  Not lined, so don't expect it to keep you warm but it will contribute to warmth by acting as a wind barrier via layering effect.  It will be a while before I have the chance to try the rainproofness. Very happy with the purchase.
