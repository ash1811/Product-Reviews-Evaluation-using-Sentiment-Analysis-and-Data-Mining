I own 6 diver watches on rubber straps including a new Doxa Sub 1200T. This Citizen cost a fraction of what I have spent on my other dive watches. However this is the one I get the most satisfaction out of wearing. The one piece case is unique to any others that I own and it is really a work of art. The stainless is nicely finished and the edges are all rounded over and polished. I have about 6 Eco Drives and have never had any issue with any of them. They just keep running, and it is nice to know that most likely you will never have to open up this watch for service. I don't dive and I really like the medium size of the watch. Some say it is too small, and it may be if you use it for diving. It is a great size for my taste however..I don't care much for the huge watches that are popular now.  Maybe if you are ordering online try to see one in person first to see if the size is an issue for you. I just love wearing this even if my Seikos are a little larger. Oh, and that Doxa, it is very similar in size to this Citizen!!
