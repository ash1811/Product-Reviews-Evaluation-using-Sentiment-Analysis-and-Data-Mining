These were actually the 3rd pair of Softwalks I've owned.  The first two pairs were given to me by my girlfriend as they weren't wide enough for her (she's gotten very heavy)  I wore them till they were work-in-the-yard shoes and then even too beat for that. I ordered the new shoes in an 8 1/2 medium, but then surprisingly I had to return them for an 8 1/2 wide.  No, I haven't gotten heavy.  They still look brand new and I'm confident they'll turn into the soft as slipper comfortable shoes as the other two pairs. I would highly recommend them.
