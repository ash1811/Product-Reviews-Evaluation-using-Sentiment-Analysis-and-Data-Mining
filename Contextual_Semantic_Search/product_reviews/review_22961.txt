Originally bought these to wear at dog shows, where one may need to stand in a wet field, while wearing something nicer than jeans and sneakers.  These shoes are truly waterproof, and offer good traction on mud, wet tile, and even ice.  I've since taken to wearing these shoes on business trips as well.  The soft soles contribute to the good traction, at the expense of rapid wear.  The brown works best for work.  The black looks a little clunky, like a safety shoe.  I may pick up a pair of the nubuck, as well.  I like these shoes enough that tonight I am ordering a replacement pair here on Amazon (I got the original pair at a discount shoe chain several years ago).
