I ordered these for lounging pants.  I normally take a &#34;large&#34;, and ordered that size. However, when they arrived they were TIGHT in the thigh.  My thighs are muscular, but not anything like a weightlifter.  Not only were they TIGHT in the thigh, but also loose around the stomach.  If you have big thighs (or if you ever plan to squat down in these) go up a size.
