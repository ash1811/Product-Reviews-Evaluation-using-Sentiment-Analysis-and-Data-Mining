I loved the &#34;Isotonor Classic Satin Ballerina Slipper&#34; so much that I thought I would try these. The terry cloth version is too clunky, has thick rubber bottoms, slips off my feet too easily, and seems harder to get on that the satin version. If you are looking for something that is low maintenance, looks nice, and feels good on your feet then I recommend skipping the terry cloth and ordering the SATIN Ballerina Slipper.
