I received this shoe and love it.  However,  the sizing is off.  I wear a 7 1/2 medium ladies size.  So in sandals I have always wore a size 8.  This size 8 is more like a size 7.  I would return the item, but will cost more than I want to pay.  So I will give these to my daughter-in-law who wears a size 7 so hopefully she can wear it.  I think she will love the style.  I am debating if I will buy a size 9 in a different color.  Otherwise, it is a very nice sandal.
