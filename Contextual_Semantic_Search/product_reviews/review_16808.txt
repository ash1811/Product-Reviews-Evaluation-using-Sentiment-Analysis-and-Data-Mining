I had bought my husband a denim shirt years ago, and he used it as a light jacket until it was a rag! lol! I wanted to get one for him for Father's Day but couldn't locate one locally. I'm glad I found this seller; they had the right shirt and the right size, and most importantly, my husband's thrilled with it.
