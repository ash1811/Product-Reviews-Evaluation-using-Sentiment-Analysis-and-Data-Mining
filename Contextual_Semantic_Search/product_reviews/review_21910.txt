All swim diapers are designed to let liquid (including urine) go through them, so yeah, it won't contain pee but no swim diaper will.  This one does fit snuggly though so it will hold poop in until you can get out of the pool (that's the only purpose of a swim diaper) but I like this one more than the other reusable swim diapers because it has the snaps on one side making it easier to get off of a squirming wet baby withou spreading the mess.  We love it and use it under his swim trunks everytime we go to the pool and have never had an issue.
