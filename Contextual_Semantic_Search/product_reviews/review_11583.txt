I've purchased this brand and style before, it's a firmer hold and shape than Spanx and sometimes that's needed. I like the boning, yes good old fashion boing, keeps you aligned and no slouching allowed. Don't fret, there's a hole in the crouch to alleviate oneself. So no up and down 3-4 times during the day. Lasts for years with 'delicate' laundry setting and air dry.
