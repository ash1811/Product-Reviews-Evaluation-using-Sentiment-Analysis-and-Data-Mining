It's a decent scarf, but nothing special. I'm not a fan of the corners, since (when folded) one edge is squared but the other is rounded. It looks curious. It's also somewhat thin, but made of a warm material. Besides, that's what layers are for... better to wrap an extra time, than get muffled by an overeager scarf!Overall, I'd suggest you hit up Target or Marshall's and find something with a little more personality.
