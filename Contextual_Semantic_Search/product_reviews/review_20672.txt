I have been looking for comfortable shoes to wear to work. I teach so I am standing most of the day. All the brands of comfort shoes I bought did not five me enough support and my feet would ache at the end of the day. Not these shoes.  They also don't look like "old lady" shoes. I am ready to order the brown pair.
