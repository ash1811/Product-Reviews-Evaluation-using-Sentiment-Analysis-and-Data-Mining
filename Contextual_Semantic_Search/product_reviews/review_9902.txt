Just wanted to warn people to check the fine print and notice that Black Heather is not 100% cotton, but a polyester mix.  I little more scratchy than I expected though the fit is fine.  I have other polyester mix shirts which are very soft, so disappointed in the feel.I bought another performance Russell Athletic Sleeveless Tee which I like much better.
