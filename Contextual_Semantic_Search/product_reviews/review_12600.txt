I'm 5'9&#34;, 34&#34; waist, 30&#34; inseam, 170 lbs., with thick cyclist's thighs, and these (medium) fit very well. The waistband is tight enough that I don't have to use the drawstring, but it's nice to have the option. I like the material. I don't know if it &#34;breathes&#34; or not, but it keeps me warm enough without making my legs sweat too much. I'm getting another pair or two.
