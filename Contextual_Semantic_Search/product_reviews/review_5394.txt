I have to agree with one of the reviewers about the printing on the leather diamond piece.  The picture of the product (on Amazon) shows this blank.  This isn't a problem for me, all it reads is the company's name and it isn't tacky.  And the other issue about the shades of red being different didn't apply to me.  My suspenders are the same shade of red.  The suspenders are made well with strong canvas type material for over the shoulder and the elastic pieces are attached to the back.  I think they're great and will order another.
