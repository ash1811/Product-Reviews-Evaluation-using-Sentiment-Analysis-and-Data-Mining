I picked up this hat on sale. But like it so much that I would have purchased it at full price. Very comfortable fit and material. The design is awesome.1) You get a brim which I very much like in hats. One thing I never liked about knit caps is there is no feel of front and back. I am one of those who do like that feel. It gives shape to the cap. I do appreciate the sun protection of a brim.2) There is roll down ear protection. Most of the time I don't cover my ears. But when out and about and it is super cold, I appreciate the ability to cover them.This is a great cap for a colder time of year. Other than feeling like Radar O'Reilly from MASH (Which is why I prefer black over green), I think it is quite stylish.
