I really liked the &#34;dress&#34;, but panties were way too small. I'm 5'10&#34; and my behind wasn't fully covered. Also, coat was horrible, just threw it away. I guess, this is exactly the case when some decorating would be more than welcome. And be careful, the fabric is very sensitive, make sure your nails and cuticles are all smooth.
