These briefs work OK if they fit you. Maybe I'm between sizes, because they aren't that comfortable on me. I prefer the sports briefs from Champion and Adidas that are sold here for much lower prices than ExOfficio. The sports briefs are made from a stretchier fabric to fit more body sizes comfortably and wick/dry just as well as ExOfficio. I use them for both sports and travel.
