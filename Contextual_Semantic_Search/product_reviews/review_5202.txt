First, it's great that Under Armour has a fairly complete catalog on Amazon. It used to take a trip to the sporting goods store, but now I can buy online.These are the heavy, thick but breathable fleece sweats, finished to a nice, clean surface on the outside. They're warm, but not so warm that you couldn't wear them outside on an early summer day. They also hold up well from repeated washings...my last pair lasted a very long time, and I suspect these will, too.The fit is slightly on the large side. The elastic waist holds them in place, but there's plenty of room all around.Only small complaint is that they are a bit long for me. Last pair I bought was perfect in length, but these - supposedly the exact same style - are 1-2" too long for me. Still, overall I'm satisfied and would recommend these to anyone wanting top quality at a fair price.
