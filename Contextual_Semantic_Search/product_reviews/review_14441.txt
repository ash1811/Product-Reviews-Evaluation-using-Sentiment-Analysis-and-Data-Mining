I bought a pair of the Seawalker's 8 years ago and wore them almost daily for about four years, and then occasionally for the remainder. One day I noticed the soles started to fall apart, and I hated to throw them away, since the uppers were still in good condition. These are great shoes, very comfortable and very well made. ECCO makes some of the best shoes I've ever owned.
