Is this the perfect messenger bag?  No, but for the money, I'm amazed that people complain about it.  I'm part of an organization called the Hash House Harriers and we do runs together.  The person leading the run leaves trail markers with flour, so I needed a bag that could hold the flour on me while I was running.  This bag is great!  Doesn't bounce, perfect size and comfortable.  I highly recommend it.
