At some point this item changed completely. What I have has thicker material and is comfy soft and well made. I have since tried to find these, and I cannot. They are perfect. Some say they are too short. I am 5'1" and they are perfect. Probably too short if over 5'3"I would order 5 more pairs if these were still available. They are tight in all the right places.
