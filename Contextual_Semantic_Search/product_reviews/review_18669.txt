I have owned this watch for 3 yrs now and I honestly cannot say enough great things about it. It has been on plane trips, hikes, horse back rides, walking dogs, cutting wood, rain, wind, gardening for food and pleasure, to my job in the medical field and borrowed by others. It has withstood some extreme heat and extreme cold. I've not yet had to replace the battery and it still keeps impeccable time. Love the indiglo feature. The color has faded a "little" on the watch itself and the band, but with all of the sunlight and everything else it has been exposed to thats to be expected i guess. Pleasant sounding alarm. It may not be the prettiest watch on the block, but she sure aint ugly and she is a tough one. Have NEVER regretted this purchase!!
