I gave these to my boyfriend for Christmas.  He washed them in our front load washer before wearing.  I pointed this out so that no one can blame the damage on the agitator.  He put them, walked to the kitchen and came back with a shocked look on his face. All of the stitching on the side of the crotch gusset unraveled...from crotch to waistband.  He is a competitive cyclist and is very lean and trim so it is not like he was too big/heavy for these pants.  They fit him as you would expect but didn't last more than ten minutes.  I am returning them.  It stinks that Amazon is charging me for the return when the item was defective.
