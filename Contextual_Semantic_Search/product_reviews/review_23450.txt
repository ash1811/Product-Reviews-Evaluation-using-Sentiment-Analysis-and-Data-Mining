As with the other reviews, I found the strap re-adjusted constantly during wearing (I had to put stitches through the strap to keep it in place).  Also, the bag had a tendency to slide around a bit, probably because of the fabric.  It does have a lot of storage, which is great.  Allow plenty of time for delivery (took longer than I expected, and much longer than the usual prompt Amazon delivery).
