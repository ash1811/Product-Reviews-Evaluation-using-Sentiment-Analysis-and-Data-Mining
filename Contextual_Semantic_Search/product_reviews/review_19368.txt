I was worried after reading reviews that I did not order a size down. I am a 9 and thought I should have ordered an 8. I got the 9 and they are perfectThey are so warm. I love themI do not know if they are real uggs but they have the label on the back and look good to me and no one has asked me about them. For 50 bucks how can I go wrong. My bear paws were more than that and these are way nicer
