I bought this watch 7 months ago, and I've worn it almost every day, including in bed, in the shower, in the sun, etc. The colors have stayed bright; the watch tells time perfectly well; and I've gotten a number of compliments on the cheerfulness of the design. However, a month or two ago, the clear plastic coating on the band started to bubble and peel up, exposing the stripey colored layer beneath, and it now looks pretty shoddy as a result, so the band hasn't stood up to 24/7 wear.
