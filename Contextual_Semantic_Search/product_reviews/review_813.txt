First off it fits way too small. I bought it because I was under the influence that it would fit a plus sized woman like me perfectly. Don't be fooled by that! This bra is not for plus sized women with larger busts. It looks nothing like the one in the picture. The under wires are so uncomfortable. I always buy under wire bras and this one felt like it was poking me to death and digging in under my breasts. The front of the bra sticks up and out (the under wire) right between the cleavage and it is very visible under any top. Getting it on was no picnic. I can usually reach back and snap it shut but this one refused as it felt too short. I had to turn it around and snap it then turn it back. It was horrible and too tight. I tried to adjust the straps and that helped a bit but still my breasts were sticking out (muffin top). Nothing I did worked. All I keep thinking is that there is a reason they show these bras on skinny people in the pictures.If you do buy this bra buy it 3 sizes bigger than your normal size otherwise you will be disappointed like I am. The price for this bra is too high. The materiel is horrible and stiff, no softness to it.
