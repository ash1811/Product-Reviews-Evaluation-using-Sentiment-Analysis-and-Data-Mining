I purchased this watch three years ago on Amazon. It has been reliable, and great to use. It has a very legible dial with numbers that stand out. The bezel is polished stainless, which looks great and stays clean. It has a nice large crown, making the time easy to set. The solar cell has soaked up enough energy during normal use to keep the watch maintained. I've never had to leave it out in the sun specifically to charge. It's a good idea to leave it face up when you take it off though.
