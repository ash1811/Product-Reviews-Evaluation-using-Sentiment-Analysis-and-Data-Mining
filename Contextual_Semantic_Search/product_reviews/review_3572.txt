These socks are comfortable and give good support throughout the day. I especially like that they are athletic socks as before I had to wear compression stockings and then athletic socks over them so that my feet wouldn't slip around so much or get too hot in my tennis shoes. Overall, I think these are a great buy and a great compression sock for working on your feet all day.
