My only complaint is that they are really warm...almost too warm sometimes =).  But GREAT for stepping outside to grab the paper.  Very comfortable and true to size (I bought the size 15 and they fit me well.  I wear a size 15 narrow and was bummed they don't offer it in a narrow, but it's only a little lose having ordered the Medium width.  They leather looks very nice and overall the shoe appears to have good fit and finish--I'm very pleased with the purchase.EDIT:These slippers started to fall apart within 30 days of use.  The stitching started coming off and then the rubber started to peel back from the leather.  By month 5, the sole completely slit away from the slipper.  In this price range I expect the slippers to go a few years, not 5 months of LIGHT usage around the house.  I had to change my star ratting to 1 start because if a product doesn't hold up, it's useless how comfortable it is.
