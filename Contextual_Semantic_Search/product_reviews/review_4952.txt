I bought these in the hopes that these would be the boxer briefs to rule them all. I didn't find them to be so.Maybe I didn't get the right size, but the others reviews going down in size if you're in between. I am about 30-31 in waist so I went with the small. They fit well! But even so, they can ride up and produce a wedgie. I found the wedgie goes away after several hours of wearing.The moisture management is great... IF YOU'RE MOVING. Otherwise, you get a lot of sweat buildup in the nether regions, even when it's not hot! Then, the smell accumulates, and when you get up, the smell releases. I don't know if anyone around me notices and is too nice to say anything, but it's gross. I find this happening less with my cheap fruit of the loom cotton boxers. This is probably the most disappointing part to me.That being said, if you're moving around and being active, these work flawlessly.
