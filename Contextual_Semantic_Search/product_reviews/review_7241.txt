I am not a watch-wearer. I stay away from most jewelry. However, the annoyance of carrying my phone everywhere so as to know what the time is finally got to me and I ordered this watch. I love it. It is incredibly easy to put on and to adjust (who knew the size of a person's wrist could fluctuate so much?). The mesh band is unique and feels smooth on my wrist. The face is very flat. The face does have a subtle mother-of-pearl thing going on, where it is slightly iridescent in the light, that I didn't see in the picture. Overall, this watch is a great value.
