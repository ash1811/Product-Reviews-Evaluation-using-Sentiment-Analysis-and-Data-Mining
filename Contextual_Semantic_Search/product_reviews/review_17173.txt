These slippers are very comfortable. I bought them because I wanted some cushioning walking around my apartment's wooden floors, but it was too hot for regular slippers. These are a great alternative--they feel like terry cloth and don't make my feet sweat. They're very cushy and have held up well to daily use. They have a rubber bottom that grips and prevents slipping.I found them true to size, as I wear a 6 and the 5-6 fit perfectly. I've gotten and will get lots of use out of these, great value.
