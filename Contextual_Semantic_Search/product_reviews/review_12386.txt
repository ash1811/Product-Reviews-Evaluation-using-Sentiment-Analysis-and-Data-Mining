I purchased this dress in several colors for my elderly mother who lives in a nursing home.  It is difficult for her to get dressed and these are easy to wash, easy to put on, and have proven to be very durable.  I recommend them.  Note:  They come out of the dryer crinkled and  don't need any touch-up if you get them out quickly - but they will wrinkle badly if left in the dryer.
