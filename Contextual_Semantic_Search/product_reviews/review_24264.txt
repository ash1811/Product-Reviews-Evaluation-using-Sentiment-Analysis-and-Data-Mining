This bra was super comfortable, but that was about it. Under a tee shirt it showed parts of my body I buy a bra to keep covered. The cups are not molded, and it looked suspiciously like something you'd find in grandmas laundry basket.So it didn't make it past the try on stage before I stuffed it back into the shipping envelope and sent it back.
