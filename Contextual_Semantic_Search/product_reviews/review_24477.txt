I was introduced to the Reef &#34;Sandy&#34; flip flops about 3 years ago, and I now wear these (almost) exclusively.  I have driven several places to find these in my size. My husband went to Macy's and asked for the brown ones.  He was told they no longer make the brown.  While he was telling me this, I was already into my Amazon account, and had the shoes up on the screen.  Clicked &#34;add to cart&#34;, and in 3.5 seconds I had a pair on the way.  In brown. In my size.  In 2 days (I'm a prime customer).  Sweetened by the fact they were $11.00 CHEAPER than Macy's.  Love, love, love these flip flops.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE AMAZON!!!
