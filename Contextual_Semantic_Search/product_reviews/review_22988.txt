I've been wearing these shoes form many years.  I wear them every day. They used to be made in the US, then China and now Vietnam.  Unfortunately when they began manufacturing these shoes in Asia the left shoe became  slightly tight by my pinky toe. (I buy the &#34;wide&#34; size.)  I bring the shoe to my local shoe maker. I have the shoe stretched the shoe in that area and then it is fine.  By wearing these shoes daily I find that by the end of the third month they have to be replaced.  The heal has worn down.  This heal on this type of shoe, similar to a sneaker, can not be replaced.
