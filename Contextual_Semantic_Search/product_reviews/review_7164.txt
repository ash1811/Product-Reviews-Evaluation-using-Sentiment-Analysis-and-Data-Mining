Pros:-Very comfortable fit! My shoe size is 8.5 and I got the 10-13/Shoe:6-12.5 sized socks-Will last long thanks to the thick cotton layer-Elastic on the ankle is just right. Not too tight or loose. Won't slip downCons:-I don't like the yellow color, prefer all white but they wouldn't be called Gold Toe socks for a reason
