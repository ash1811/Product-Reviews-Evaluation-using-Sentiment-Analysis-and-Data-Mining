I am really impressed with the quality of this watch, especially taking into account the very reasonable price.  It's a very handsome watch, it looks elegant and very well made, doesn't look cheap at all.  The band is a little stiff and thick, but it's comfortable for me, it looks good and looks like it will last a long time.  I like that the display is very easy to read, looks elegant, and has the Indiglo back lighting.
