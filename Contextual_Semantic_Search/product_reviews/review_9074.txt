I checked and rechecked the product description...says 100% cotton.  I was concerned because the color is &#34;light poly&#34;...but there are other odd color names... rigid dragon, muse, etc.  so I got them.  Turns out, they're about 50%/50% cotton poly and so thin you can practically see through 'em.
