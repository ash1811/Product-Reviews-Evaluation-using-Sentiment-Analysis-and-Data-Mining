I have already used this kit to adjust the bands on three watches. With one exception, the tools are quality pieces that are set in a nice case using quality foam (not the cheap large celled foam).The pin remover (the blue device on the left in the photo) is not of great quality. It works, but I doubt it will last as long as the rest of the kit. On one of the watches, the pin remover started to flex before I was able to get the pin out. In this situation, you'll have to tap the pin out using the hammer and pin setter or buy a better quality pin remover (which I did).
