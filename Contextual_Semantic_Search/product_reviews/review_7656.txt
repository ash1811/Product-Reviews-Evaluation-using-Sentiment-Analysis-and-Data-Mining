I am not a fan of regular, cotton t-shirts.  They hold perspiration and odors - although inexpensive - there are better options.  I have used this shirt numerous times since purchasing it and have enjoyed the fast-drying fabric and lack of odor-holding of the garment.  The only complaint I have is the collar seems to be a bit on the "ragged" side.  I don't pull on it and have hand-washed the shirt exclusively, but the collar just doesn't look very good.  While it may not be important to most people it is the one negative thing I personally noticed.  Otherwise, besides the premium price, this is a great t-shirt to wear!
