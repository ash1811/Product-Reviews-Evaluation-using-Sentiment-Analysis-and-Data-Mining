I bought this watch as a present for my boyfriend and he loves it. He doesn't care that much for buying things in the internet because many times you don't get what you expect, but this watch is a great deal: very good price and looks sooo nice (people ask him if it is a rolex). He has been wearing it for over 10 months and it still looks like new.
