I've worn ThorLos for years. They are my favorite sock for hiking, walking, working out or just wearing at home with fitness shoes. The elastic on top grips the instep and the arch. The ball of the foot and the heel are padded, the toe is sturdy. I've actually never had a pair wear into holes. I love these.
