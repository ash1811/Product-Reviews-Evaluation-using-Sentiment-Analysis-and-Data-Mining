I recently had dramatic breast reduction. The size I became ,no one could find it in front closure. I have always spent 50-80$ on bras. When I saw this , I figured yeah I will give it a shot. Well it FIT. Smooths the back ,has great support and I'm not having to reach around to snap. Ladies give this a try. We have enough trouble being women. This is one less problem
