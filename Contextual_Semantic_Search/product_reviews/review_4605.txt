This is a good pair of overalls, thick denim, triple stitched...will probably last me a few good years out in the yard.But, like others have said, order them at least a size or two than what you would normally wear for jeans.  For instance, I wear a 34X32 Wrangler regular fit ("five stars"...the Target/Walmart variety), and I ordered these overalls in 38X32...I'm sure glad I did.  They fit perfectly after a few washes.
