this is thinner than most hoodies, but that was what i was looking for. it will be a great fall/spring hoodie that i can wear with shorts and be just perfect. seems to be made of same quality as other hoodies. hood is pretty large and fits loosely just like i like it. very satisfied, great for the price.
