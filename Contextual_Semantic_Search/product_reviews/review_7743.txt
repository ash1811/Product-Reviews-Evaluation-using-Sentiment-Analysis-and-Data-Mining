The waist tabs wouldn't hold, which is common for cheap BDU's. For the money I paid for these, I am not happy about that.  I had to fix it myself.  The cloth is much different than I was expecting too.  While I wasn't expecting rip-stop or defender M, I was expecting something more like the rothco BDU's.  These are much thicker, which by itself isn't a negative.  Overall, I will just buy surplus ACU's from now on.  Sizing is better, and they are more comfortable.
