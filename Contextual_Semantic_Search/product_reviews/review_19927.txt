This arrived at my door on the coldest day of the year so far (-13F) and I could not believe UPS was even delivering. I got them, put them on and they warmed up (despite being really freezing from being outside in the box) and my feet have been toasty ever since.They run a bit big but they will be perfect with socks.I am SOOO happy with these.The bottom is so soft that it is a bit like walking on memory foam as well. All around a GREAT sipper and a SUPER GREAT slipper for the price.
