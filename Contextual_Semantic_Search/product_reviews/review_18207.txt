Tthe positive points about these slippers are:- they are warm- they have a fair amount of cushioning in the insole- relatively inexpensiveNegative points:- they have no arch support- they feel fairly heavyI would order the next size up if you wear a half size especially if you wear heavy socks, because of the lining they are a little snug at first. How the stitching holding the outersole to the leather holds up, only time will tell.After wearing these for a couple of weeks, I thought they deserved one more star. They are nice and warm and I inserted a spare pair of insoles to improve the arch support which solved that problem. Just keep in mind that the memory foam is very soft so it doesn't provide arch support. Other than that, it's a decent shoe for the price.
