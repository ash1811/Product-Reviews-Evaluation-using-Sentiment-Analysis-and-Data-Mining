To anyone that likes pants that are durable and will last for years, these pants are the way to go!!!  I have many different styles of the pants as well as colors.  I have no problems with these pants. I have had them for a while now and have purchased them previously.  I spend much of my time outdoors and I have had nothing but strength and durability.  I have had embers jump from a fire and land on my leg....lo and behold it burnt my leg but not the pants, awesome strength!!!
