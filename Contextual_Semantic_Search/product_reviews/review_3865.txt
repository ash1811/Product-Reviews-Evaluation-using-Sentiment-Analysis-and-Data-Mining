Pros:>This product provides a lot of support>Has a great little hidden pee vent>Looks a lot nicer than the photograph>Works great around the hips and for fitting into jeans>Provides decent back supportCons:>Definitely runs on the small size (I bought a size up, but I wish I'd made that 2)>Despite nice loose rubber lace edges to smooth out the lines, still leaves very noticeable indentation rings right in the middle of the thigh>Distributes tummy above the top resulting in a very noticeable spare tire tummy above the waist (looks extremely odd and noticeable)>Permanent metal garter clasps that can be painfulSum:Probably good if you just want to fit into jeans, but buy at least one size up, and don't even think about wearing under any but the loosest clothing and probably with a jacket.
