I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my son, 6'3&#34;.  It was important for the scarf to be light weight but very warm.  I am giving this  4 stars because it hasn't been worn yet.  I'll return and update after he has a chance to use it.  It is exactly as I had hoped; looks dashing, and is warm.
