These things are hard to come by these days. I remember growing up we all had them to slip over our shoes during inclement weather. These fit fine over my Clarke's dress shoes size 10. I'm glad I read some of the other reviews and ordered the XL which is a size larger than listed. I don't think I could have gotten smaller ones over my shoes. Very happy with the purchase.
