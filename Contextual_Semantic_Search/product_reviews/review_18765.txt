My previous pair of these shoes, purchased years ago, were beginning to show the wear and were doomed to become my gardening shoes; it was time for a new pair.  I have in the past purchased a 1/2 size larger in tennis shoes to allow room for socks: however, in this case it may have been a mistake; they are a bit big.  In the future I may try my usual, size 7B or 7W (shorter but wider). Nevertheless, if they wear as well as my last ones; I'll consider my purchase to be a success!.
