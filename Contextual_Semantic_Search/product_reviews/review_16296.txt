I would not expect anything less from FRYE...and I was not disappointed. These are a bit heavy, but they sure are good looking, comfortable,  and durable. Besides, depending on where you live and/or where you work, it may come in handy to have a shoe that is both a fashion statement and a potential defensive weapon.
