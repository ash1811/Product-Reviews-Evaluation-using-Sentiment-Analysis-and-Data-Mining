Not sure if I did something wrong... but I have some golf sneakers that the soles came loose from sitting in my car (hot Florida sun).  So I used this on it... and they lasted a week or two before one of the soles came loose again.I put the &#34;goo&#34; on and let it set for probably a week before I used the sneakers again.  Again, not sure if I did something wrong or what.  I would give it a 1 star, but it could be my fault.
