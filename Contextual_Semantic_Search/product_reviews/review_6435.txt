The sleeves on this tall size shirt are too short. The sleeves on this shirt are not like the picture where the sleeves look as though they are also tall sized. Its obvious that the factory just sewed on the regular sized sleeves onto this shirt, not a longer version as you would expect wih a tall size.The additional length on the body of the shirt is actually too long, much longer than a Carhart large tall t shirt for reference. The body of the shirt is too narrow, this shirt is more of a medium extra tall for the body then its a large regular at the shoulders and sleeves. Why does it matter? its just a t shirt right?........well as someone who wears t shirts everyday, for both work and off, such a simple garment actually is very important to get right. Not slim, not baggy, again, not slim, if I want slim i'll buy a smaller size.Will keep trying to find a proper fitting large tall. This shirt is not the one.
