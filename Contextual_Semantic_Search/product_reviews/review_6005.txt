They arrived quickly. Nice quality, very smooth and silky look and feel. Hopefully they will last more than one or 2 wearings.At any rate it is beyond me why more women don't like thigh-hi's. It seems to me they are very practical, and they definitely look good. I hope the fashions go back to more legwear - bare legs are nice but stockings look very dressy and classy.
