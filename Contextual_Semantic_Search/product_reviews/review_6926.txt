These were great... haven't had calf socks in ages and these felt great, comfy... best compliment I can give them is that I didn't notice them!I was wearing them in some new shoes that were barely broken in...black-tie wedding... I stood, I walked, I stumbled through a puddle, I danced... they held up... great socks!
