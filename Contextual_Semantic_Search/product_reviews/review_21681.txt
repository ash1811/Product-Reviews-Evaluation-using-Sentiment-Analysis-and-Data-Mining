This is a large silver pendant. It's very sturdy, as is the chain, and while it's not a handmade piece, it is still a lovely necklace and could be worn with casual or dressy clothing. It has a nice smooth finish, and the chain was a nice round chain. It also came in lovely packaging that required minimal effort to package as a gift.
