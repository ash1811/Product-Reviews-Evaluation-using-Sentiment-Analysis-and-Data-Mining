This is a heavy, well made T-Shirt at a reasonable price, something I haven't seen much of of late. It's a bit darker than the pics here suggest...but still looks good so I don't mind. It didn't shrink when washed(cold water), and fits true to size. More than this you really can't ask for for the money spent. I will definitely be buying from this make in the future.
