Love the weight of the cotton and the smoothness. Tried to see if they fit when they arrived and they did albeit they were a bit baggy in the buttocks.Thought maybe they would shrink a tiny bit and be perfect after laundering. Cold water, delicate wash cycle with organic soap and then inside line dry. I'm still kind of shocked that they shrank so much.I would need to order a size larger than normal to get perfect fit.
