I absolutely love these jeans because they fit perfectly and they cost so little for so much quality workmanship.  I'm a 38&#34; waist, 32&#34; leg and these jeans are absolutely true to label.  The double black (slightly stretchy) material is made in the USA and assembled in Mexico...a perfect combination in my opinion.  I was so happy with these jeans that, when they arrived and I tried them on, I immediately went online to order another pair!
