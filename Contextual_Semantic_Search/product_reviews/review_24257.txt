Yes, it is itchy. I have tried 5 different Bali bras and they are all itchy! Like really itchy, immediately itchy. Only Bali. What is that about? Anyway...The cups were a little small. On the top and bottom. A little quadraboob going on there. The bottom of the cups have no support, although the sides have a little. Did someone forget how gravity works? Perhaps it is made for another shape, but it didn't work for me.
