I have been a fan of carhartt pocket t-shirts forever, long  sleeve and short. They are extremely durable and can weather the grind I put them through in exttreme temperatures here in Phoenix , Az.  what is really special is the relaxed fit they have when you order your size , Comfortablity is a big factor for me and these allow a comforable fit without armpit tightness. So don't hesitate and buy these, you won't regret it.
