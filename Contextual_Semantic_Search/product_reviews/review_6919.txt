Gold Toe Men's Windsor Wool Over the Calf Dress SockI've been wearing these socks for 20 years, of course different pairs over the years, as they do eventually wear out.  Depending on how you wash and wear them, you can get a little over a years worth of wear from the socks. What I found interesting is when they do wear out it's not in the foot area, it's in the calf area.  They develop holes in the interlocking weave as the thread wears thin and breaks down.  This happens from the ankle to the top of the sock just below the band which keeps the socks from falling down.Now, as to being comfortable, they are very comfortable, and they do wick perspiration away from the foot area.  So your feet remain dry, even on hot days.  It's important to have a good pair of shoes for foot support and these socks will help in the support of the calf and ankle.  These, over the calf socks, remain in place and you do not have to keep pulling them up as with other brands of socks.I have a size 13 foot and I find that getting the sock over the foot to be a bit of a struggle, but once you get the sock over the foot to the heal pulling them up to the knee is easy.  The ribbing in the weave of the sock can be straighten out for a well-finished look.  I like the over the calf look because they do NOT show flesh when you cross your legs.  These socks give a finished look to your slacks.You may get a bit of restriction from the band at the top of the sock, just below the knee, especially if you wear them for long periods of time, you stand a lot during your work day or if you experience swelling of the feet and lower legs.  If you experience the latter, I would consult with your physician.  These socks do give a mild support but are not designed as a true support hose.All in all, I'm satisfied with the quality, wearability, and life of these socks.  Any other socks wouldn't last as long as these.
