Actually, I purchased two of these, one in black and one in white in the 32-inch length, not by design but because I mistakenly thought that they didn't have the black one in XL.  In any case, if you are around size 18, you can make do with a size large if you have to (because of the size slits), but the XL will be more comfortable.  This is a no frills half slip but well worth the $12 price, including super saver shipping.  Because it's so basic, you could hem it if you needed to.  Just try to find this item in either Penney's or Macy's.  You can't.  I needed this to go under a long, gauzy skirt, and it does the job; no more see-through.  The reason it loses a star with me is that it isn't antistatic.
