I ordered two of these shirts before leaving for Prague for 8 days. The first thing I noticed is that the shirt has some heft to it. It is well-made and very comfortable. It also feels warm when worn underneath a sweater or shirt. I did wash these shirts a few times while on the trip. It took a good 12 hours to dry, but that depends on how well you wring it out. This shirt does not wrinkle easily and looks good. So I am satisfied.
