My husband originally had a comparable Silva product which turned out to be defective (two different ones both got moisture under the face when he wore them out working in humid, not wet, conditions!).  So I decided to get the Casio and he loves it.  The readings are accurate and he does not have to carry the instruction book around -- very intuitive.  We hike in the NYS Adirondacks so all the features are fun to play with.
