I wouldn't call these "military" but they're ok for civilian use. They are NOT ripstop, they are basically black slacks with pockets. The material seems heavy enough for wear, but only time will tell that. There are waist cinches on either side and drawstring cuffs (both good add ons). Sizing is at least one size over normal for that baggy relaxed fit. If you want a standard fit, choose a size about 1 below your normal size on the chart.  I doubt they will keep their color, so I'm not sure if you'd want to rely on these for consistent looks in a uniform scenario or other "team" type of situation. The zipper is going to be the likely fail point in my opinion, it's not milspec or heavy duty, we'll see but I do like it over buttons if you're not planning on major wet weather or submersion situations, otherwise stick to buttons. I intend to push these pants to the brink, so I'll update this review if and when I destroy them.  That all being said, they do seem to be worth the price. Keep in mind, they are ROTHCO brand even though they don't admit it. (I wouldn't either).
