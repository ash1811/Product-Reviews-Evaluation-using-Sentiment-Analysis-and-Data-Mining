Great lightweight visor with comfy fit band. The visor brim is just a bit larger and I like the extra coverage from the sun! Comfortable to wear, stays in place.FYI: When this visor arrived, it had been packaged carefully, but the bill on the visor was a little warped. It didn't curve properly. I misted it with water from a spray bottle and laid a long wooden handled brush (just what was handy) over the top of the visor to hold it in proper form. It quickly dried to a perfect curve. This will be an easy method to use again in case the visor gets smooshed in my carry on bag when traveling.
