Maybe is was the supplier but these socks are not what you expect from Gold Toe and my experience was different from 70+ other reviewers.  The elastic will not keep the socks up and the weave in the sock shaft seperated on the first pair when putting on for the first time.  Will not reorder and makes me hesitant to purchase Gold Toe in the future. Update - December 30, 2012.  The seller responded to my complaint with an adjustment and a comment that they were surprised at the quality problem since this was one of their best selling socks.
