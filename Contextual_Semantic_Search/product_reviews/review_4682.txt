These Carhartt Jeans fit better than any jeans I've tried including CK.  They fit nice in the seat and legs without being too snug in the crotch.  The fabric seems to be of good quality and they wash up nice without noticeable shrinkage.  I really like the belt loops; perfectly placed.  I purchased three pair of these jeans and plan to buy more.
