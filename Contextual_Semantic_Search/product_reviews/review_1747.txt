Well I've been wearing these jeans for a few years now. Levi's and others seem to have lost their quality and fit goal and so a number of years ago I stopped buying levis. The particular jeans fit well...I'm not the smallest guy around at 6 foot tall and 285lbs. These jeans fit well and are comfortable to me, they fit like jeans should on a man...(certainly not skin tight). Good product and well made (the product line pics don't really do it justice). I will continue to buy these jeans as long as Carhartt keeps the product on course. Well made quality product that fits right.
