and I hope that these work as described. I tried them on and the fit is fine and they feel comfortable. I will update this review when they become necessary as temperatures drop.Update: Well, the frankenstorm arrived and though there was only about a half inch of snow on this side of the state line, the temperatures dropped and have stayed on the chilly side since. The thermals worked perfectly and after one washing I am pleased. They shrunk ever so slightly that no doubt will relax with the next wearing. I didn't read the washing instructions until after they came out of the dryer but no problem  since I always wash with warm water(not hot). The next will be as directed. As a result of the experience.... five stars now.
