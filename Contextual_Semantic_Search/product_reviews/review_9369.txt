These are so comfortable, 95% cotton. I love it that the waist can be rolled down, they can be worn however you want. I ordered a size bigger than I normally wear due to the snug fit. If you wear size large, purchase size XL. The XL is not baggy at all, they fit perfectly.Yes they are too long but you can always cut them off. I would definitely order more. I hope this review helps.
