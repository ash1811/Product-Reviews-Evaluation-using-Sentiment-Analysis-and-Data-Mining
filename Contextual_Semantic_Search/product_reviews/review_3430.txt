A style bra by Playtex I have worn for several years is not made in the band size I need now so I'm searching for another. I've ordered several styles by several companies including Playtex and the cups are always too big, sometimes by a lot, sometimes by a little. If I ordered the cup size I get when I measure myself by the way to measure for a bra, I would be ordering an even larger cup.This bra was okay other than being too large in the cup.
