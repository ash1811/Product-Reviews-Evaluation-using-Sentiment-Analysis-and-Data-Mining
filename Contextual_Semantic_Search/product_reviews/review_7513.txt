We try to walk every day for 30-60 minutes, but in NW late fall, winter and early spring can be miserable with cold winds.  I had the old wool ski mask that I used for years, but it was prickly, got damp inside from breath exhaust and shifted out of place.  This item intrigued me so I bought it based on reviews and also experience with other products from this company that were of high quality.  This hood fits well, stays in place, has adjustment options depending on how much cover one needs.  This fabric seems to breath better when mouth/nose is covered.  I have already used it several times this late fall and it is a keeper.  I also either wear a cap or hoody over it for extra warmth.  The combination keeps my head and face warm and comfortable and can enjoy my walks. It's a keeper!
