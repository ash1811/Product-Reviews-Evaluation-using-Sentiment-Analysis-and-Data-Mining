I own several G-Shocks and love them all.  This is a great watch, the features are just what I want & need.  My only two nits - and they're minor nits to be sure:1) The buttons are *very* tough to hit.  I was expecting "stiff" buttons, but on my example they require a very (very!) deliberate push to operate.  I guess the plus is you don't need to worry about accidentally changing modes with this watch.2) The tail of the band likes to slip out of the retention strap.  I have a big wrist and wear the watch on the 4th set of holes from the end.  At that setting, the tail likes to slip out and flail about.  Not a big deal, but none of my other G-Shocks does this.All-in-all a great watch.  It's more casual and sporty, but nothing too obnoxious (in my opinion).  I also very much like the back light - it's very bright and crisp!
