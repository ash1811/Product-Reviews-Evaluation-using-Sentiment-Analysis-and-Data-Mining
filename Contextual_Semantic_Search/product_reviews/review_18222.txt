At first these slippers seemed to be very nice.  My husband wears a 10.5 shoe so I went with the 11s.  They were still pretty tight across the top of his foot.  After just a few days of wear the lining inside at the heal started separating.  Definitely not the quality I expected from a slipper at this price range.  Thanks Amazon for your great return policy :-)
