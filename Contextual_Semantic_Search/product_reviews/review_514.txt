I was looking for a bag that was small enough that I wouldn't have to carry on my shoulder or would be too heavy (I have a medical condition).  This bag had enough space for all my important credit cards, and a handy one for my driver's license and a mirror next to it.  It has a change compartment in the back, also a compartment for bills and another zippered compartment on the inside.  On top of that, there is space to fit my cell phone, lipstick, nail file, and it could accommodate a couple more items (small though).  It has a small hand strap that pulls out from inside the bag and a long strap if you wanted to use it as a shoulder bag which can easily be taken off.  The leather is quite soft and the bag itself looks quite classy.  The only complaint I would have is that the snap that closes the bag can be hard to close, but it is very secure.  i would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a small bag that accommodates all your important stuff.
