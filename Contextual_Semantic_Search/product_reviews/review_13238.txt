This bra fits true to size and the straps are so comfortable that I forget they are there, having said that...i dont forget that the bra itself is there. The lace in the front kind of digs in after a few hours and starts to hurt and the wire on the side eventually start digging in but all in all this is a good comfortable bra that doesnt give you a funny shape
