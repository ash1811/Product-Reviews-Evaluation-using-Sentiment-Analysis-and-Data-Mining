I felt like my 44D boobs were being herded into industrial-style containers.  Wow, it definitely supports them, and they'd better not ask questions!!!I went around all day feeling like my boobs were 'out there', well-managed, and not going anyplace.It's not something I'd buy again - it's just a bit too uncomfortable - like they were stitched from the same material used to make backpacks, but the one I have will probably last a good while.2 stars because it is indeed well-constructed.  SOMEBODY at Playtex said, by golly, I wanna design a bra that MEANS it!
