My husband purchased these almost in frustration from having difficulty in finding comfortable and well-made jeans.  We both were pleasantly surprised and very pleased when he tried them on.  It's always a bit of a risk buying clothing/shoes on-line that you've never tried on or worn before. However, living where we currently are...one does what one must!  The fit of these jeans is just right for his tall (6'3") slender frame.  The 34-inch length hits him just off the ground at his heel.  The relaxed fit, isn't too baggy, but still roomy enough for comfort of sitting at a desk for long hours.  The denim is a heavier weight, perfect for his job where at times he visits the "project site" and gets "dirty."  The "antique indigo" suits his tastes.  He prefers jeans that are softened by pre-washing but not worn out!  After three washings in cold water and drying on medium heat there was minimal shrinkage.  We're buying more and recommend these Relaxed Wrangler jeans to others with similar needs and likes.
