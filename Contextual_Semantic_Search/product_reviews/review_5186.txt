This is the 10th Timex Ironman watch I've purchased since 1987, and it will be my very last.  Timex has begun using "chi chi" watch bands.  Well, my wife looked down at her christmas present after only 4 months, and the watch WAS GONE FROM THE BAND!  What a piece of garbage, I'm out $35 !!If you use Timex Ironman watches, you know that the plastic bands eventually fail.  What are you going to do when this band fails?  NOTHING AT ALL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO THROW IT AWAY !!!I'd rather own a happy meal than this watch.  From now on, I'm going to buy the Ladies Expedition model, which uses standard watch bands.  TIMEX THIS IS MY LAST IRON MAN PURCHASE !!!
