The lining falls apart too fast.  The 'uplift' band crumbles over time.  I ended up cutting the material under the arm and trying to empty it out.  The straps are too short for a tall person, so the back keeps riding up and the gel shoulder pads position in front of the shoulder, not on top.  A lot of money for such a poor fit.
