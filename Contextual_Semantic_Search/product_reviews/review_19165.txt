My mom loves sparkly earrings and these were perfect for her. The size of these earrings is good, not overpowering but big enough to elicit remarks about their sparkly-ness. They seem to be well made, leverbacks are the way to go. My mom has arthritis and these are easy for her to open and close. I am now her favorite daughter ;)
