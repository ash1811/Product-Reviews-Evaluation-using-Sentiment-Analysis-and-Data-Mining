These are quite comfortable socks, and they fit much better than other socks I've purchased. I wear a size 13 shoe, and many socks are sized 6-12. Very roomy in the foot, and not too tight around the ankle or calve. Have only washed once, but they came out of the dryer looking and fitting just as well.
