These are my first ever Caterpillar shoes and I'm impressed. I've owned a fair number of timberlands and these don't feel like a step down. I wear them with Jeans and Dickies and they are comfortable, warm, and not at all bad looking. Some boots can be hard (well, relatively speaking) to put on but these are easy as well.
