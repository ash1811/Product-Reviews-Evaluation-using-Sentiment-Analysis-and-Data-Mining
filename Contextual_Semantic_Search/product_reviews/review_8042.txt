These were ok.  The fit was too big, I got a medium and have  always been a medium in gloves and followed the size chart.  The material looked very cheap, but it was warm enough for chilly weather. Not warm enough for cold weather.  Not enough friction for driving, in my opinion.  The fingers had strange bulky seams that probably should have been sewn differently.  I do like that they have a small clip to keep them together and they arrived quickly.  The price was cheap, so I was expecting cheap quality.  However, with the added problem of inaccurate sizing and weird finger seams overall I was disappointed.
