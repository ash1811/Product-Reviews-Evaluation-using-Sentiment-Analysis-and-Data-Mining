J&M; shoe trees.  Also, they keep the cedar scent for longer.  The arch, under the tongue of the shoe, helps support the shape of the shoe much better than other shoe trees.  I like how there is a pull string, which makes removing the shoe tree nice and easy.I bought the extra large for a size 11.5 and they are perfect.
