These socks are thick enough, kind of like an athletic sock, to keep business shoes from sliding around. They are cotton and not nylon or polyester so they don't ever stink, and they wick the moisture away instead of holding it close to the skin. Excellent sock stands up to many washings and remains comfortable and fitting well.
