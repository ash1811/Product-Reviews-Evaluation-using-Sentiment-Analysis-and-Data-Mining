I purchased this apron for a dear friend who does arts and crafts. She loves it. It is not too long, heavy or cumbersome, so it doesn't get in her way. It does what it is supposed to do - protect her clothing from the assortment of paints/glues/sparkles/etc. she works with. It's great not hearing about her ruining her clothes any longer, and she's saving money not having to go buy replacements.
