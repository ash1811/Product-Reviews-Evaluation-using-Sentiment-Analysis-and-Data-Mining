I was looking for a jewelry box that could be picked up and hidden around the house. It also had to be rather large. I bought one of these last year and I love it. It has a remarkable amount of space if you organize it well and I have found it to be very sturdy, even after months of daily use.I have since bought a second one for myself and 2 for gifts. I highly recommend this product!
