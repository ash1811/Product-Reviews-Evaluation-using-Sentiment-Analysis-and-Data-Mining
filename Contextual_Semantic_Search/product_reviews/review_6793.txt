I bought these as winter-weight work socks, and they're just right.  The cable-knit is especially pronounced, but the whole sock is nice and sturdy and warm without being too thick to wear with my work shoes.  They do shed yarn-bits on your toes a bit, the first time you wear them, but the first wash takes care of that.  I'm glad I got these.
