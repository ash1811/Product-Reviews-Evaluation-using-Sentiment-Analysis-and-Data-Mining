Really soft and nice.  Easy to customize for your needs.Unfortunately I am only giving 3 stars (wish I could do 3.5) because my sister said that the proportions were off on her baby (there were other brands that fit the baby better, obviously it varies by brand and baby) and that these often slipped off her shoulders.
