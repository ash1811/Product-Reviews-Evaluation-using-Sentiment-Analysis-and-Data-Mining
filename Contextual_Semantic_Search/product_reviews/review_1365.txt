Have not had a pair of K-Swiss since the 80's. These look and feel great. Plus it's not the everybody is wearing it shoe like a Nike or Adidas well at least around here I have not seen anyone wearing them but I get compliments on them. A forgotten brand? I will look to them in the future when I make my next purchase.
