I was trying to replace a discontinued bra. When I searched for my old bra, this was suggested. It was a great price so I tried it.The bra is at least 2&#34; smaller around than any other 36&#34; I've purchased.The 3 part cup makes anyone who's larger than average look very pointy. It doesn't appear to look like that in the picture.All and all it was a big disappointment.
