Expensive.  Yes.  Worth it... yes.I bought these and similar competing products that cost less.  These are perfect, fit great, and down "roll up" or "roll down" like the competition does.  I haven't tried washing these in a sink while traveling, but in terms of comfy, high quality briefs to no bag up like tradition boxers, I think these are great.
