the total price of almost ten dollars(including shipping) wasn't worth it. the quality was very thin and the sewing wasn't professionally done- the buttoned down part by the neckline was not straight and there were threads loose here and there. i would have kept it if it was just thin but the sewing was just too cheap looking.
