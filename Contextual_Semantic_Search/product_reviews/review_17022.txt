Does the job, removes those pesky pins instead of the annoying paper clip confusion. No more jabbing myself, just make sure you use the right pin direction so as not to hit the ridge on the pin.I am looking forward to continual use, but need more of the pins that fit in the device. I would like to figure out how to get more of them.Florio
