I've come to know what to expect from the Hanes brand but I havn't figured out the sizing quite yet.  The briefs are medium and they are quite loose and I have purchased large sizes in other briefs and they fit much tighter.  I guess the brand just runs big in it's sizes.  Apart from that I'm content.
