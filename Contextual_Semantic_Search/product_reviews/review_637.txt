I recently bought several wrap and faux-wrap dresses that could show off WAY too much leg if there's a slight breeze, so I needed something a bit modest to spare the world a view of my blindingly white legs. This slip works PERFECTLY. It's beautiful and comfortable. It also makes me feel a bit like a '40s film star. Women need to dress like this more often!The fit: I ordered my bra size. I've got that lovely pear shape going, and it still fit perfectly over my hips. I'd order more colors (I got the black), but they're all out of stock! Bummer.
