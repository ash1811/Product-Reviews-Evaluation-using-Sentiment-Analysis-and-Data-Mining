I ordered one of these in a B cup a few months ago and wore out the adhesive on it by wearing it so often, which isn't a bad thing.  I really, really like this adhesive bra and often forget I'm wearing it.  It is very light and provides enough support to wear with tops and dresses.  I am between a B and C cup and ended up ordering the C cup this time.  I would definitely recommend this product!
