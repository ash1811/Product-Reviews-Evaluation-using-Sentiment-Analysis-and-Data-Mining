I was looking for an understated casual watch and this fits the bill.  To many watches today have huge faces and look oversize on the average wrist.  The eco-drive is a plus. No batteries.  The only criticisms I have are regarding the band. The adjustment holes are lined with stainless grommets, and because they are slightly thinker than the band, taking on and off is harder than usual.  Also because they used canvas for the band instead of nylon, its lined with leather.  That guarantees trouble if you sweat in it or get it wet.  A nylon band would have been better.  An easy fix, but one you shouldn't have to make.
