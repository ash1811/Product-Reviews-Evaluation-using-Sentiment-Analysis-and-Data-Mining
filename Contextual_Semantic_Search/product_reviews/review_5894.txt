When I recieved these sunglasses in the mail, I noticed it was missing a nose piece. I thought maybe I could just glue it back on or something but I saw that it was missing a screw. I don't feel like going through the hassle of returning these so I just threw them away. The pouch could be useful to me so I decided to save it.
