These are so comfortable! I wear these for hiking, camping, every day, even for amusement park visits. Open enough to breath but closed enough to feel comfortable in cool weather. I will be wearing these until it gets really cold out. Great sole and grip too. Worth the price. I was also impressed at the color and style options - mine came delivered as accurately as expected too.
