This is my second casio watch and I like my purchase.  The face of the watch is bit larger than a quarter.  It is pretty much unisex, I had no qualms using it.  My wrist are thin, and this watch looks great.  The best part about the watch is that it is pretty much waterproof so I don't fear it breaking when I forget to take it off when I for instance wash the dishes.  It is durable, the face can scratch easily but so far I have taken good care of it.
