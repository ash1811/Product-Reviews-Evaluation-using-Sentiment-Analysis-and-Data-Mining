I don't know why, but these shirts are not sized according to normal standards. My husband wears a large in all of his shirts so I ordered a large in this one. I also got a large pique polo in another brand. This shirt is SO MUCH BIGGER than the other one. It looks like it's probably actually a 2XL at least.
