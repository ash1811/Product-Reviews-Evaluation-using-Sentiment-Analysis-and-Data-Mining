Dissapointed, noone makes a good t-shirt anymore! I like the tank tops from russel but these shirts are horrible.The texture of the shirt is very very scratchy, and they wrinkle pretty bad. I only wear them around the house because of the wrinkling bull crap.  Well, on to the next brand to waste some more money on what is probably more chinese outsourced junk
