Iv'e been weraing Woverine boots for several years. I have a pair of of 6&#34; Bulldozers that are over 6 years old and are finally getting to teh point where the soles are worn enough that the boots are nearing retirement. The other day one of the upper (hook) lacign points broke. I was heart-broken... these are my favorite boots. Then I saw the Fultons. So I decided to try them based on a number of reviews. Thet arrived a day early (kudos to the seller Shoe Station on that one)! I put them on and me feet fell in love immediately. My feet were tired from a day of work and they actualy felt better when I put these on. I walked around a store for a couple of hours adn had no issues. NO BREAK-IN PERIOD!!!
