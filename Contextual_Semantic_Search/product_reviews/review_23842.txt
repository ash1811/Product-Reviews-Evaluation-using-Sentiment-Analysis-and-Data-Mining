Being a purist, I hesitated in buying these, since I had a pair of the Original Wayfarers, also in black,  But after trying these on, I was impressed.  Unlike the originals, which have deep lenses that cover most of my cheek and can actually get uncomfortable, these are more lightweight and cover just enough of the face. They still are sturdy, and still have that classic look.  A good option for women and persons with a smaller face who feel lost in the originals.
