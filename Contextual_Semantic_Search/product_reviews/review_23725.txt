Buying things like this is sometimes difficult online since I have larger breasts than average. I ordered XXXL since I wasn't sure if it was going to fit up there or not. Maybe I should have ordered XXL. It was definitely roomy, but I expect things like this to shrink. The sizing chart is not right so don't go by that. I have a 50 inch chest and XXL would have fit me perfect. This will do though. The quality and fabric is very nice and in a great color. Just order down one size.
