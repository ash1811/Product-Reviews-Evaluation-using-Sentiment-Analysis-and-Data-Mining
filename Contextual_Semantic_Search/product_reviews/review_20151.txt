I've been using Shoe Goo on my running shoes for about 30 years with great results. Once you identify the high wear areas on your shoes (e.g., the outside of the heels), a thin layer applied every week or two will extend the life of the shoe. But even better, this stuff forms a tenacious bond between just about any two materials, so it has dozens of uses around the house.
