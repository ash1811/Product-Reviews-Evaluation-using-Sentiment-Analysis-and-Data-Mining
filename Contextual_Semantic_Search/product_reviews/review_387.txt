DONT stop selling the low top of these chuck taylors. I keep finidng high top ones but finally found these low top ones and boy EVERBODY loves these shoes on my baby boy!! I must admit they look so much better on him than I even thought. I am so pleased Im gonna buy another pair in a different color. They really do look awesome on and as long as these shoes havebeen around they still top the cake with comparable cloth sneakers!
