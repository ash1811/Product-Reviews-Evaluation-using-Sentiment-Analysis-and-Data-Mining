These shirts fit close to the skin but are EXCEPTIONALLY comfortable with almost a silky feel. But, luckily there is no silky sheen. I typically wear a small t-shirt, but I ordered mediums, which fit perfectly. Order a size larger than you usually wear unless you're looking for a compression fit. They are very long, so they stay tucked in all day. I love that they don't create that bulky Big Fig look around my waist under my dress shirts. I should also note that they are slightly sheer but look fine with a dress shirt and open collar.
