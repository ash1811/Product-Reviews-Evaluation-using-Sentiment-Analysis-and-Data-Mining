Served its purpose for a 10 year-old's costume. The sizing is a little tough to decipher, definitely runs small. I went by the number sizes and compared it to clothing stores. A 12-14 size was adequate for the kid. The legs were a little long, but the rise was a good fit, and that's more important. Not very breathable so keep in mind the duration it will be worn.
