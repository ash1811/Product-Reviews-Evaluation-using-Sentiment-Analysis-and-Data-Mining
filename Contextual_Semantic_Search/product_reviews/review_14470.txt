Never liked the idea of paying 100 plus dollars for what seem like fairly simple sandals, but when a doctor recommended them for plantar fasciitis I gave them a try.They took a bit of breaking in, and felt a bit uncomfortable after years of wearing really cheap footwear.  But after a few weeks my foot problems and pain went away.  I felt my posture improve.  Knees felt better.I've worn various styles since then.  Arizona's are the classic and great for summertime.
