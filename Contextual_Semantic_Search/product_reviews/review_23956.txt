The workmanship is good, and the fabric is good, but I found that the legs were a bit too long, and the rise was a bit too shallow.  I know how to lengthen the rise (and shorten the length of the legs in the process), so for me it's not a problem, but if you don't sew, be aware that the legs are a bit long, and the waistline rides much too low on the hip.  But, that might be just me; fit is such a personal thing.
