Bought this as a gift for a friend who is not really into watches, I figured I'd get him an eco-drive so he wouldn't have to worry about battery changes/handwinding/watch box etc. This watch is perfect for him; it's easy to read, good-looking, low maintenance, and it was a great deal for me (I got myself the BM6400, another fantastic watch).Bottom line, you can't go wrong if you like the looks, the only complaint I have is that the band isn't really that great, I feel like the holes are too far apart to allow you to get a good fit (either slightly too loose or slightly too tight). That's an easy fix though... 10 bucks on NatoStrapCo or CrownandBuckle and you've got the solution :)
