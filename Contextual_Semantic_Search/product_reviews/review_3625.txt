Earlier this year i bought the exact same size, style & color levi's and liked them so much that i purchased this pair on line.  Big mistake!!  Does not fit even close to the pair i bought at the store.  Plus the pocket stitching on the back has two different color thread: some is orange and some is white. What's up with that?
