I wore these years ago and then I thought Olga quit making them, have occasionally looked for them. Was surprised to find them offered recently on eBay. Ordered a part to see if they were the same. Fit was basically what I remembered. I plan to order again. Fit is like a hip hugger, maybe slightly higher.
