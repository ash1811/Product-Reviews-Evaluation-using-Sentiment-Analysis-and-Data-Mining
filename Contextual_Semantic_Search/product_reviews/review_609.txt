Love, love, love this bra.  It fits well, the underwire doesn't poke into my arm, and the bra cup stays put.  I wear it all day long and it is still comfortable at the end of the day.  I usually get home from work thinking "I can't WAIT to get this bra off."  Not with this one.  It's pretty and it fits and it's very comfortable.
