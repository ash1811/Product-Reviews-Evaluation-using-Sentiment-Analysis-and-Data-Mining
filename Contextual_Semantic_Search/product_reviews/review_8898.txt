This is exactly what I was looking for.  I don't think it's gorgeous, but it's nice and  holds a lot (not bulky things) in a very organized way.  (I was surprised at how many things I forgot that I had.)  :-)  The traveling box stays on my dressing table for my every day favorites and everything else is stored out of the way, but easy to get at in the big case.  Taking the traveling box out makes room for a few bulkier bracelets.  After ordering, I checked out the Shining Image website for a more detailed description.  Sadly, they had a better price.  Grrrrrrr!
