It's inaccurate to say that they're 'somewhat small'. The fit is off, but it's due to proportion rather than size. I am a tall man and I have much more height in my back compared to my legs than most tall men. As a result I end up having to wear Tall shirts and the like. As a result, the legs on these are just a tiny bit too long, and the area btween the crotch and the bib is just a tiny bit too short even with the straps loosened up to their fullest extent. It's noticeable, but it isn't overly uncomfortable, especially since I washed them a couple times and they loosened up. The fly is a bit too high-set for me.However, they are a wonderful product. If my body were more normally proportioned I'd give them five stars. They feel quite well-made, they look as nice as overalls are going to work, the denim is good and thick (which I like) and all the fasteners are sturdy brass. I've been wearing them around the house with a heavy flannel shirt this winter, since the 'one piece' construction of the overalls seems to do a better job of keeping my body heat in than just a shirt and pants would.
