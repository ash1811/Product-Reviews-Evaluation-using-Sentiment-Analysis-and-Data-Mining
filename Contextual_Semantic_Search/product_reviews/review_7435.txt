I bought two pairs of these shorts for my wife for our Taekwondo class to wear under her uniform.  Like others have mentioned, they are not very tight fitting and run a little bit big, so my wife wound up giving them to me to use (they are unisex shorts, the packaging is the same as the men's shorts).  Still, they aren't as tight or as well-constructed as my Franklin compression shorts, nor are they as form fitting as my wife's compression shorts that were purchased from Wal-Mart.  These aren't necessarily bad shorts, but I'd have to rate them as average.
