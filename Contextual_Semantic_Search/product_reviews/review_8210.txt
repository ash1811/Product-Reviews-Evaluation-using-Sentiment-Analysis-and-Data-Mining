I got this watch because i wanted something fancy and decent without breaking the bank.  I looked at all the awesome reviews and took the plunge.  I'm super pleased.  The watch does an amazing job at keeping the time, looks really really good, and will last a while I hope.  I love that its completely battery free (end of days watch)..
