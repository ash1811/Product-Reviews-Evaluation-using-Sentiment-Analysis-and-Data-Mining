The fabric of this shirt is remarkably comfortable, and fits wide shoulders very well. This would normally take an XL at least, but the Medium worked perfectly. Layering this under dress-shirts adds warmth and looks classy, a great deal for the price. Better to layer-up with clothes than carry around the heavy and hot 40+ pounds that used to gird the girth! Those with wider tummies may prefer to order-up. Good luck!
