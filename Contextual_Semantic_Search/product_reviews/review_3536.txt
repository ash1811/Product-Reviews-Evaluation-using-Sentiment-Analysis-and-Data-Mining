These are very, very comfortable nylons. They are like a late-spring/summer weight. I normally don't wear anything on my legs when it's warm out, but I can see that they may be helpful for professionals or women who like to wear stockings in warm weather. The lace stretch panel is pretty, and they are true-to-size. The nude color is odd--it's kind of a fleshy putty color. I was also scared to death that I'd put my finger through them every time I had to pull them up or adjust them because they are so thin. Us pregnant ladies go to the ladies room multiple times a day, and I don't expect the nylons to last long if I'm constantly yanking them up and down. I'm really surprised that they even lasted a full day for me. I also didn't like that they got all stretched out after one wear. They pretty much kept my shape after I took them off. I'm scared to death to wash them too, based on the lack of elasticity. On the plus side, I like that the support leg area is pretty short, and didn't show under the bottom of my dress. I have been wearing Assets nylons, and although I like the quality much better, I feel like I constantly have to yank my clothes down to avoid looking like I'm wearing bike shorts underneath. I may buy another pair of these because they are comfortable and less expensive that other brands, but I'm definitely not in love with them.
