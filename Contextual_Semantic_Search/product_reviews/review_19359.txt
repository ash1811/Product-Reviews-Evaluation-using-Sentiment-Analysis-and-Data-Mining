I ordered this short boot to keep my feet and ankles warm in the house this winter. They are wonderfully comfortable and warm, and I wear them all day and evening if I'm home, and never get cold feet. I wear a size 7 shoe, but I have discovered that it is important to order down one or two sizes with UGGs.  So this pair is size 6, and I wear them with socks.
