While I am a big fan of vintage foundation garments this is my first long leg panty girdle. I typically prefer either an open bottom girdle or panty girdle which I wear with gartered stockings. However, I started looking for a girdle that would provide me with some thigh control as well as addressing my other problem areas. I was a bit skeptical at finding a long leg girdle that would fulfill my needs and still be comfortable and feminine. I am a fan of some of Rago's foundation garments and came across the Rago High Waist Long Leg Shaper Girdle and decided to give it a try based on it's feminine look and my luck with past Rago purchases.It actually fit and looked better on me than I thought it would. I find that it does a great job of addressing my trouble spots and makes my clothes look better on me. It also helps in improving my posture and gives me a more feminine look. My job requires me to spend a lot of time sitting so comfort and posture control are very important. The lace is soft and doesn't bind and I also find the split crotch a very convenient feature. Another plus is that I can wear this girdle without worrying about the legs rolling up if I am not wearing stockings.While the medium fits me well, it can be a bit challenging to get it on. I sometimes use some powder to help it slide up.This girdle is definitely not going to be for all of you girls, but if you're looking for something that you can comfortably wear for long periods of time and that has strong midsection and thigh control as well as aid in improving your posture then you should consider giving this girdle a try.
