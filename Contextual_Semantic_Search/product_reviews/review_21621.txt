They're Uggs, Dude...it is a sherling boot, straight forward, with the quality that only money can buy.  If you don't understand...the natural wool turned in and still attached to the hide facing out.  Ridiculously warm, unbeatable moisture/vapor wicking and dispersement means no sweat even in warm weather.  No socks needed. This is wear nature is the perfect scientist and man was a pretty good engineer. There is no substitute for quality...NOT WATERPROOF...but not the point...
