Ok, so I liked the shoe itself, but the description and pictures made me think this shoe was not cloth material.  I was wrong! When I pulled it out of the box, this white cloth began looking for dirt and dust immediately.  The shoe fit well and seemed comfortable.  If they had been black, maybe it would have worked, but I returned them.
