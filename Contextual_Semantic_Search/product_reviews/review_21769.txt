This item arrived on it's estimated shipping date and is well made.I have read a lot about people complaining about the size of this product and thinking they could put their laptops in it. It will not hold a full size laptop but will hod a toshiba netbook perfectly with a little room to spare for notepad and pencils, i-phone,i-pod and such.It is just the size I was looking for since I looked at the dimensions before I ordered it and I bought it specifically looking for it's smaller size.Putting a camera in it is fine unless it would be of large SLR type with detachable lenses, if that were the case it would feel like a bumpy sack due to the bags thin depth from front to back unless you carried the camera with the lense detached from the camera. It's just not thick enough for a camera with any length of lense to it.The outside pockets give some extra space for a cell phone (notice I said cell phone because I'm not sure if any of the apple "I" products with a wide screen would fit the outside pockets). The pockets are perfect for a compass and other small wilderness utilities such as a tinder box and striker, whistle or mace, and travel size bug spray if you are the outdoors type of individual.Overall it is a good, well made product for smaller items.
