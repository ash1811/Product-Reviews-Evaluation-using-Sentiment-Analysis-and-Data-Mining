I bought this watch over 5 years ago. I set it and have not touched it since other than DST one hour changes. It knows how many days in every month and which year is a leap year so you never have to do a thing to it once it is set. Other than daylight savings you never need to adjust a thing on this watch. The eco-drive concept had me concerned back then and I wondered how long it would really charge and discharge before it wore out. Well like I said I have had it over five years and I recently left it in a dark display case for over a month. Took it out and it was still within four seconds of my atomic radio wall clock!The look, color, detail, fit and finish on this Eco-drive is beautiful. The ocean blue face color is very unique and is best appreciated in the bright light of the sun. The band is very solid and comfortable. It has a unique/aggressive design to the links and how they interface. It is a substantial watch on the wrist but it's sleek and does not slide around, pull your hair or cause any discomfort. It fits with activity or as a dress watch.I have over 10 watches in my collection and the Calibre 8700 is at the top. It is my go to watch more than any of the others and I set all my other watches (time and date) by this one. The accuracy is within a handful of seconds per year on mine and I am sure this is pretty common for the Citizen Quartz watches. I sure have my eye on the Eco-drive Diver to go with my two Seiko Monsters but this one keeps me happy in the meantime! The price of this watch makes it a no brainer for me. If I had it to do again I would in a heartbeat.If I were ever stranded on a desert island and had to chose a watch to have with me...this is without a doubt the one.
