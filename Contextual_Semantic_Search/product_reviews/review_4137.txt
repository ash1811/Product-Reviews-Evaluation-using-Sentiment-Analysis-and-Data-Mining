This bra in a 30G was very supportive (one of the best I've tried) and fits well if you have some projection; however, I was not a fan of the shape--it made me way too pointy.  If you tend to prefer smoother cups (tshirt bras, molded cups) then this is not the bra for you.  I also found it to be pretty itchy.
