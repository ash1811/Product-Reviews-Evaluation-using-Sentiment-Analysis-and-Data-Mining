Smartwool is the BEST.  These socks are comfortable regardless of the temperature outside.  My husband is really hard on socks and he gets two years of wear out of these before I have to mend the heels.  NOTE: With wool socks you do NOT have to wash after each wearing unless you have gotten them really dirty or smelly.  As is true for all wool products, it is important to air them out after every wearing....do not store them away in a dresser or closet to air out.  You will wear out wool products much faster if you are constantly washing (or dry cleaning) them.  Also, even though these socks are machine washable/dry-able, unless you need them right away, it is better to air dry them.  They will always dry overnight unless it is very warm and humid.
