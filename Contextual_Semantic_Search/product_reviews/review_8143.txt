I love wearing sarongs in the summer to the beach and the pool! If I need a great quick cover-up I always go to them. This came packaged, and when opened it felt damp to the touch, and a dead beetle fell out :( YUCK. It did not wash well with the tassles. I have had one that I picked  up for about the same price 13 years ago and it still looks great compared to this. Sadly this went to the garbage can.
