These seem to be made pretty well, and while I can't comment on longevity yet, I anticipate these will last me a while.Of course, they do have a bit of a tendency to fall below your ankle if you wear slip-on shoes (I do.). My shoe size is 11.5 M so YMMV.So I'd say they're pretty good for most people.
