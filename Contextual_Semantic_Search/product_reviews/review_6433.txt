These are low cost shirts and are great for tall people. I am 6'4" and if anything they are too long, however my wife says I am just not used to buying shirts that fit.A few notes, these shirts do have tags (which is why it gets 4 stars), which is anoying, but I was able to rip them out without putting a while in the shirt. They are also just a little small in size, but I have an athletic build and they did fit me.UpdateAfter wearing these for several months the tan color shirts have faded and one of them fadded within 2 washes. I would avoid those. I have since worn The dark blue and black for several months and they are are fine.
