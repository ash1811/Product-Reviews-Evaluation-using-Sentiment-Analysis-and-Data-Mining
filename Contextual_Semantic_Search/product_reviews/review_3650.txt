Well-made, well-fit cotton jeans - but I had to return mine due to a huge discrepancy in color (between what was picture on a product page and the real thing). The ones I've received were dark indigo rather then green frost. Last time I bought this same model / color, i didn't have this issue. I ended up buying CK instead - those were true size and color.
