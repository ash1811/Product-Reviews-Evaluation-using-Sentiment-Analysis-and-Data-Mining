This bag is perfect for the new 10" netbooks. I have an Asus 1000he and have been having trouble finding a lightweight and attractive bag for it. The larger battery (9.5 hrs) makes it just a touch too big for most 10" bags and sleeves out there.I can fit my netbook in its neoprene sleeve in the main section, portable DVD drive, portable HD, power brick and cords for them all. The outside pocket holds my wallet, Ipod, Iphone, pens and a small pad of paper. My plane ticket goes in the back zippered pocket. There are NO MAGNETS anywhere on this bag.The best part is when I want to travel light, I can take out the rest of the netbook accessories and the bag slims right down. Or I can use this as a lightweight crossbody bag that just happens to have my netbook in it. There is plenty of room for that and purse things.The vertical profile makes it easy to get the netbook in and out and redistributes the weight more ergonomically. Fully loaded, it feels much lighter than a similar horizontal bag. I love that this bag is lightweight to begin with, unlike specialized laptop bags that weigh more than the laptop itself empty!It is not meant to be a laptop bag, but the extra space in the bag enables you to add more padding and protection if you want to and still end up lighter when fully packed than an empty off-the-shelf Staples netbook bag. You'd be a lot more stylish too.The black, navy and slate colors are guy friendly and look like a cool and compact crossbody bag. The shoulder strap extends to comfortably fit a medium-build guy. The main compartment measures 2"depth & the front compartment is an extra 3/4".
