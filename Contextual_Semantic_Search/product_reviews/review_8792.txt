Purchased this for my teen to help her with her posture and the concept was correct. I even went up a size as most comments stated. She wears a 38B and I ordered 40B BUT could have gone up to a 44 with as tight as it was. It didn't even come close to closing on this one. Amazon was good and I was able to return. Hit and miss on this one.
