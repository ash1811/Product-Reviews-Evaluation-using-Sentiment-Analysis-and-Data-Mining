I love Clarks, but do not like to pay mall prices.When these arrived I was impressed. I slipped them on and noticed how snug they felt. However, give them a few days of wear. The leather will conform to a better fit (and loosen up a bit).The arch support is lacking because there is none. Not a great shoe for long periods of standing. Overall, a good quality and simple shoe.
