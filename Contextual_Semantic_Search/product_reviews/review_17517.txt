Not quite as comfy as I wanted them to be.  Have tried these on in store and I think some of the colors just feel nicer than other due to materials.  This pink leather is a bit stiff.  The pink is PINK.  Like NEON pink.  A bit shocking actually but got them at a good price so what the heck, I'll have neon pink feet.
