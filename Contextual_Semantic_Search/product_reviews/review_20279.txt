I was looking for a spacious bag simple enough to carry stuff to daycare for my son.  this bag is spacious and durable.  has a little flap like pocket inside to stick something small like a couple of pacifiers.  very happy with it, the only thing i would suggest is that it had a hard bottom, but that wasn't necessary for what i needed it for.  keep it mind it doesn't have a closure at the top.
