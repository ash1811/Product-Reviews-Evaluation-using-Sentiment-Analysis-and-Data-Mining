I got these in my size but in a W because I wear very thick socks in the winter. They were huge, and the more I looked at them on my feet, I felt as though they looked like old lady shoes. Sorry. But what I did like was the comfort of the shoes. Very comfortable. Also buyer, beward of return charges. Free coming in but $ going back :-(
