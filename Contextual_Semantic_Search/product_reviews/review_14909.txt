I buy a couple of these for my husband and me every year because they're great for our camping trips.  They're soft, and durable. They can be washed. And the good thing about inexpensive hoodies like this, is that when the campfire sparks burn tiny holes in your hoodie, it's not the end of the world because it's not a $100 jacket or coat. We buy a couple for him and a couple for me, and wear them out hiking, camping, biking, playing. You can be as hard on them as you'd like. I like the many colors they come in, because I like the bright colors, whereas he'll go for the Irish greens, every time.
