I just bought these for my daughter's recital. She just turned 6 and is tall, 46&#34;. I was worried these would be too small, but they fit perfectly. She is very thin I might add, but length wise they are great for a couple more inches.I wanted to help on the color-I was hesitant to buy these because of a couple reviews noting the orange color. Yes they are pretty orange in the package, and my first thought was &#34;oh no&#34;...but once they were on and stretched they are beautiful. The color is a very soft pale pink when on...so don't let the initial color scare you!They are very soft and seem very thick and sturdy. Definitely not the thin tights from WalMart! I am very pleased with these.
