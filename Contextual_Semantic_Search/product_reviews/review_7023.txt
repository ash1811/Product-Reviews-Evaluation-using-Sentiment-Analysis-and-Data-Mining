I had a 6-pack of these socks before (but couldn't remember where I got them) and I wore them completely out over the years. When I started looking for them again I turned to Amazon (where you can get everything but a haircut). I was glad to see they had them and at a reasonable price. I hope this 6-pack lasts as long as my previous one.
