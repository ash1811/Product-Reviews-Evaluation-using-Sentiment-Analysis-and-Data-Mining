It was a gamble buying pants online because you never know if the color shade is what you are looking for or if they'll fit correctly.  I've found that a lot of jeans understate the waist size.  A 36 would be more like a 39 in.  Anyways, I was happy with this purchase and followed up with buying 2 more pairs.  Good price.
