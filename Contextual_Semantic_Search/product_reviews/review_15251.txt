I ordered this t-shirt keeping my expectations low. After all, what can you hope for at this price? Well, it's definitely not a fashion t-shirt, but it's  a lot nicer then I imagined. The material is soft and the fit is fairly well tailored. Best of all - it stands up to my constant washing (over 6 month now) with no visible signs of ware and tare.
