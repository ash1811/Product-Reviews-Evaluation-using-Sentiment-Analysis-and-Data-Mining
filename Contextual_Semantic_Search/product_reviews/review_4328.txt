Let me preface this by saying they are comfortable and appear to be well made.  They have a very sturdy feel to them and provide excellent support and cushioning.So, why did I deduct two stars?  First, while I said the fit was somewhat small, this is not strictly accurate.  When they are on, they are comfortable and my toes do not contact the front of the sandal, even walking downhill.  It was only after I got them that I looked at the manufacturer's website and noticed the Fit Tip that said this style tends to run about a 1/2 size small.  That annoyed me because if it was true, they should have relabeled the boxes these sandals come in to reflect the true size. One shouldn't have to go to a website to learn this.  But, remember when I said somewhat small isn't strictly accurate?  What is wrong is the amount of space you have to get your heel into the sandal.  If you have thicker than average ankles (or if your ankles swell), getting the back strap over your heel is a chore.  The back strap needs to be about 1/4 inch longer.  That would make getting your foot into the sandal easy.  Possibly this would be solved by getting 1/2 size larger, but then I'd have a sandal larger than my feet.One last thing.  Considering Chinese pay scales and the cost of materials, these sandals are priced too high.
