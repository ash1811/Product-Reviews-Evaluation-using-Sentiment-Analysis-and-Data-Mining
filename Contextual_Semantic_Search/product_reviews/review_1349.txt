I've worn these shoes for years.  Thy've been VERY kind to my feet.  The medium width is a good B size.  I bought my husband a pair of white ones last summer, which--miracles never cease--he's still wearing.  They're the only ones I've seen that are wide enough for him (He wears the XW.)  These shoes are good for walking and playing tennis.  I also wear an old pair to workout in the gym.
