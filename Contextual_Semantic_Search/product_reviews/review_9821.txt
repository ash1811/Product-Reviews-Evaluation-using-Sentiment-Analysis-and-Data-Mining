I had been to many jewelry stores and looked at many watches and I liked this one love the blue face it looks good wearing anything I wear it in shorts and flip flops and wear it all dressed up has that casual but dressy look to it. I am very happy with it. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A NICE CASUAL BUT DRESSY WATCH THIS IS THE ONE
