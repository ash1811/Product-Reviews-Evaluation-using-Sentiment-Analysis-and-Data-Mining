The fabric is a little rougher than nylons and it doesn't feel too great at the end of the day.  Also the stomach part does shape beautifully, but it does this with boning/underwire inserts.  The "trap door" for trips to the bathroom doesn't really work.  Prepare youself as you normally would to use the restroom and don't rely on this device.
