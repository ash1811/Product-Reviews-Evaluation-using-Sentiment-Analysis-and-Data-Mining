In the late 60's and early 70's all I wore were Levi's.I quit buying Levi's jeans for over thirty years due to their unreliable fit and construction. I chose to try them again recently and found they had addressed the issue's that caused me to leave them as a brand. All of my jeans are once again Levi's products.
