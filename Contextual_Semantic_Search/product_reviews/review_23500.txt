I agree with a previous reviewer.  It did not fit my 18 month old's head.  Granted, he has a rather big head, but as one of the previous reviewers stated, it won't fit a 3 yr old with a head circumference in the 50th percentile range (which is where my kid's head is if you went across the growth chart).  I bought it because it said it was for kids 3 and up, so I thought it would fit my son's head.  Oh well.  The search continues.  In terms of durability, it seems rather sturdy and heavy, so I'd imagine it would last quite a while. It's made out of hard plastic.
