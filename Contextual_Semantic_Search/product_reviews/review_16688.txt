I got this for my girlfriend. It was priced cheaply, and Iknow why. It's made of flimsy nylon like a halloween costume.  The seller allowed me a return, but I couldn't find packaging to send it back and figured I wasn't really out that much.  I'd recommend spending a little more on something  nicer.
