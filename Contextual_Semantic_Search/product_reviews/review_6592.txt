Great boot comfortable and good quality although short but the quality is beautiful I love bearpaws, you uggs people can keep spending your $$$$ on uggs I love bearpaw and I love amazon!!!!!!!!! I ordered a supposedly bearpaw from another online store that claims to have great sales and had to return it because it was obviously a FAKE!! This is a real deal and the prices are great!!! I ordered the black in size 8. // Feb. I now ordered the brown and water definitely does not go through. The wool inside is luxurious and the boots are warm. Sometimes I don't even wear socks.The leather outside is soft enought without being weak and easily damaged. I look like I spent $$$ and I did not. The buttons are stylish and make the boot easier to slide on. YOu are going to love this boot. I'm a size 8 and these bearpaw size 8 fit perfectly.
