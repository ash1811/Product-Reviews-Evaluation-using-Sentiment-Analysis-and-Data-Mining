All of these reviews are based on nostalgia, this was a great watch in the 80s but now is trash,i don't even think Seiko care about this anymore since young people don't used watches as they use to. If you want a mechanical buy an Orient diver, is a lot better than this Seiko diver. The past is gone, this is not what it used to be, be real.
