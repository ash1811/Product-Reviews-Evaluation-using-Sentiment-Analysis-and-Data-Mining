I highly recommend this bra.  It covers and supports me quite well. I have been having a problem finding a good leisure bra that and supports well that I can wear out and about on my casual, "running errands" day.  I found it.  I love this bra so much,  I am going to order more.  I am a 34D and the 34C/D/DD fits very well.
