My great nephew is 8; can tell time but has some issues with keeping track of time so I got him the watch to help.  It's "cool" enough for him to like and with the alarm and other features enticing enough to try the different features.  The alarm obviously helps with the time tracking; it's too soon to tell if it's successful or not but I was pleased to see him want to try.
