I did as others suggested and washed it before wearing to reduce the possibility of itching. It fits well, is lightweight, and although the really cold weather hasn't hit yet, it keeps you warm enough while sedentary. I've worn it for duck hunting and at an outdoor football game.  Would definitely purchase again.
