Pretty good bra. It's a bit firm for my taste (I like them a bit more stretchy), but it's still pretty comfy. I'm a 36D and I really have a hard time finding bras that fit nice and don't do the uniboob thing - or spill out in the underarm area. This bra does all that. The firmness isn't too much so it still fits and looks nice under clothes.
