I am a 20 year old nursing student. I spend most of my days either in a hospital or sitting at a desk with my head buried in books and assignments. I wanted a watch that was not only functional but also showed my love for all things classic and geeky. At first when I got this watch I was a little concerned with how light it was. I have a Casio g shock also so that is why this watch felt a little light. Unlike my gshock, this watch is not meant for hard work. You shouldn't shower in it or beat it up too bad. This is for the person that spends most of their time in a safe environment. With that being said, this is an excellent watch which is something I have come to expect from a great company like Casio. It has kept good time so far and the calculator works like it should. Yes the buttons are a bit stiff but come on, this is not meant to replace your TI-84. It is just for simple quick math. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who values a good, simple watch but also likes to sport their geek side as well.
