I bought this shirt because I just wanted to replace an undershirt of my husbands that I had accidently ruined.  For the price I expected to get just a simple white shirt.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. Instead of getting a thin shirt that will be worn out in about a year, I received a nice, crisp sturdy shirt.  I was especially excited to receive it days sooner than expected.
