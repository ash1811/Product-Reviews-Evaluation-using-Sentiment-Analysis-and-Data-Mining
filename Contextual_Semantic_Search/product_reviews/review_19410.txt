Just purchased the classic short uggs in grey and they are definitely a hit with my grand daughter. She has been wanting a pair for some time now. I decided to get her these even with the cost being rather high. I have 2 pairs myself and adore them. My feet stay so warm even in the coldest weather.She was so excited that she called to make sure they arrived. I was hoping that the size would be accurate. Happily, for me and for her, they fit perfectly!! She was wearing them when I left her home with the biggest smile on her face. That said it all!!I would highly recommend these. Plus, being an Amazon Prime member, shipping was so quick with free return if they didn't fit. Thanks Amazon for the great service.
