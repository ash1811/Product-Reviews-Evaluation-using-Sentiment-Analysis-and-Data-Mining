I read a lot of reviews, I wanted a front hook and something relaxed to wear around the house instead of a sports bra or nothing. Even a little support is nice, without as much constraint. This is comfy, thin and I have slept in it without it digging into me. If you wear a low cut shirt it will show the bra a little, sometimes unhooking the top couple hooks hide it but generally it will show. As a casual bra, I highly recommend.
