I ended up getting a more expensive one for my sixth grader and it was not enough space inside and it was really heavy. This one still isn't that light, but these wheeling type of bookbags tend to be a bit more weighted than regular ones anyway and at least my daughter could handle it, so it's not that bad in weight. My third grader has used it last year and this year in fourth grade too. Held up nicely, roomy on the inside and the wheels are still functioning well. It looks like it might be good for next year as well. Wish I had ordered this kind for my older son from the start.
