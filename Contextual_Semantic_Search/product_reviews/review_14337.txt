while these are cute, and they do fit me. I am a size 12-14. if you are any bigger than that I do not recommend you get these. they are tight on MY thighs so if you wear a 14+ you might find these small for you. also the bows wont last, I can tell that by just trying them on. the actual stocking are really nice and of good quality though.
