I've been looking for a sturdy hiking/walking boot that would provide arch and ankle support, and wouldn't feel like I was walking with 3 lb weights.  This is it.  I wanted to be able to wear a medium weight wool ankle sock, and I am usually a straight size 8.  Reading the reviews it looked like these boots ran slightly small and I have a wider foot.  I bought both a size 8 and a size 8.5 to determine which would work best for me and went with the size 8.5 since I wanted to wear wool socks and my feet tend to swell.  The width was fine in both boots, but the overall length was slightly short on the 8 and I have short toes.  I'd say it runs 1/4 size to 1/2 size smaller than usual, so if you have longer toes, order up.  There isn't much of a break in for these shoes so if they don't feel right the first time you put them on, try a different size.  Good product, love the leather and soles are great.
