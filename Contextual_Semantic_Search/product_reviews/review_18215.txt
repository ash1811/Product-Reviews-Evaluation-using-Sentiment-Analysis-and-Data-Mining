Bought these a couple of months ago and they are great! They grip well and can be worn outside for quick trips if you don't feel like putting on shoes. Really keep your feet warm, even after they have been worn in and the lining becomes a little matted. The memory foam sole is great! Not cheap, but pretty worth it.
