Husband asked me to find a pair of &#34;inside/outside house slippers&#34; so ordered these hoping they'd work. They fit perfect -he loves them - says they're warm and super comfortable. They appear very well made with high quality materials and are attractive - to him anyway :-) - so he's happy!Mission accomplished - would recommend!!
