I never understood spending over 20 bucks on a pair of underwear.Now I do.  I've replaced all my underwear with these.I never went totally cheap on underwear, and they can last a very long time... With that in mind when it's time to get new ones splurging a bit doesn't matter.  I'm glad I did.Breathable, comfortable and fresh all day.
