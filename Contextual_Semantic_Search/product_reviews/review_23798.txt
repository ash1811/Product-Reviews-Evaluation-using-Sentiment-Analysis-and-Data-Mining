I was a little concerned that the sunglasses were not the real deal due to such a cheap price.  But several forums confirmed that these can be had at this price.  Truthfully, I have no way of really knowing if these are the real deals or not but they seem like great glasses to me- very happy with them!As for a review of the product- I thought the 52mm would be too small for my face and ordered the originals in the 54mm as well- turns out the 54mm had too much of a drop for my face while the 52mm looked the best.  My face/head is more along the lines of what they call &#34;heart shaped&#34; thus narrow glasses that have more-or-less straight lines to them tend to look the best on me.  The tortoise pattern on these are nicley sub-dued and not too overpowering as some other brands (persols).
