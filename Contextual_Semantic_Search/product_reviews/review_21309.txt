I have bought Clark Shoes for many years. I always buy a 1/2 size larger than I usually wear.  It makes them just right for the type socks I wear.I get many compliments  and recommend them to anyone that likes a good looking, well lasting shoe.  Really comfortable to walk in. Will buy another pair soon.
