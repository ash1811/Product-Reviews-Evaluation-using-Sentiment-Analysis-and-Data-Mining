The underwear fits like a charm and is very well made. I haven't worn and washed it out every day as it is designed for, but I do use it in regular rotation. But in the future I will take it with me when I do go away. It is long like Bike shorts but it fits great. I prefer their regular briefs though as these are a little longer then I'd prefer. Highly recommend either one depending on your preference.
