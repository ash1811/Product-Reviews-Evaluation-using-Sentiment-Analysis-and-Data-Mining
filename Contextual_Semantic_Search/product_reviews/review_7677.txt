This is the first time I have ever owned a pair and I like them.I really don't have anything to offer as far as a review of thesecompared to others on the market. The look good. The onlyreason I gave it 4 stars is because of the leather on the back.I'm not a huge fan of Leather with name brands printed on thembut that is the compromise I made to have this style of Suspenders.
