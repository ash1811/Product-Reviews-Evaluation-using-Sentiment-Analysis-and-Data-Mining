The anklet has a fantastic fluidity and beautiful shine to it. It looks very fragile and delicate - but on first impression the clasp was solid.Girlfriend used to wear a snake chain anklet but fell in love with this instantly. However, she lost it in about a month of wearing - simply fell off somewhere. But this looked so great that she now wouldn't wear any other anklet.Needless to say, it was worth it - and I'll buy another one nonetheless.
