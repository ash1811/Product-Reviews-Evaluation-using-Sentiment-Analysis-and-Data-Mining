These aren't all THAT bad, but seem slightly long.  I'm a big guy, and the sizing was pretty much spot on in the waist.  The only real sizing complaint I have is the thighs.. they are abnormally tight for some reason.  I am a cyclist and have pretty meaty thighs, but these are oddly tight.  Don't get me wrong though, they aren't spandex tight.. or so tight that I wouldn't wear them.  Just tight enough to not fit perfectly.The quality of the material is impressive.  Adidas is normally good about using good quality material, and that they did in this case.  They are a bit warm, but they do well on rather cold fall jogs.  They have lasted me about a year and still are in good shape, so even though they are a bit expensive I suppose I got my money out of them.
