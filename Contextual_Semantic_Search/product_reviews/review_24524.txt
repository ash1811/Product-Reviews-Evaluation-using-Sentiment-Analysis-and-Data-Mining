I absolutely love this watch.  I find myself admiring it on my wrist all the time!  I have a very small wrist, so was afraid it might be too big on me, but it's perfect; not too big and very stylish.  Love the little bit of bling.  I've only had it for a little over 2 months, so will check back if have any problems.  So far, though, FABULOUS!
