I am a guy who just happens to love Vanity Fair nylon panties. Kinda weird perhaps? Not really ... these panties fit perfectly, are lightweight, dry quickly, and don't have the fly front that guys rarely use and detracts from underwear being comfortable. These panties happen to have some lace at the hips which makes them more feminine than some other panties, so you have to be a bit daring to wear them, but wearing these panties is a delight!
