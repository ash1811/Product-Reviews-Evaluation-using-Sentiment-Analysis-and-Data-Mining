Horrible product.  Bought them for one vacation trip and the second time I wore them on the trip the strip snapped on a walk around Philip.  I looked at the strap and the reason they broke was because they did a horrible job gluing it on. I looked at the one that wasn't broken and I saw that the strap was already beginning to tear half way down.  They looked good until they broke after my second time wearing them
