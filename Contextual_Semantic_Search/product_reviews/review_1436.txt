I have been buying Thorlo socks for decades.  I just bought several pairs of these in black and the Thorlo quality is every bit as good as they used to be.  These socks are so comfortable, great in summer as well as winter and not just for hiking.  These are wonderful for walking the city pavements but you have to have shoes that are roomy enough to fit these wonderfully plush padded absorbent socks.  These are a treat for your feet!
