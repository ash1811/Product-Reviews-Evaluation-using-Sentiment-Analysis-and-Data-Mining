Great watch.  I was concerned about ordering a watch online, but it turned out perfect.  The clasp is a little tricky.  It's called a "hidden clasp" so make sure you show the user how it works before they damage the watch.  The price on Amazon was amazing compared to the local retail stores.  Highly recommend.
