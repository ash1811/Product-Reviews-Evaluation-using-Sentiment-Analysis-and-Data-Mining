Very pretty Nightgown which is made even prettier by the purchase of the accompanying coat. The lace and fabric are very soft and delicate. I am 5' 10&#34; 147lbs. C cup(dress size 8 or 10) and the small fits like a glove. If you like a little more room in your p.j.'s and are my size I would get a medium. But I am happy. I feel like Betty Draper in this gown. Shadowline should make more retro peignoir sets. I don't know why they ever went out of style.
