I'm 5'2&#34; but I like the extra layering at my ankles. When I got these I thought they were super long, but they conform right up your thighs and that consumes their length. I do however like to wear them baggy at the ankles for extra warmth, and the stirrup stops them drooping or dropping in the way of my point, keeping my arches warm, and point still clearly visible!I use these for rhythmic gymnastics too, and occasionally, if I need to bulk them up over my knees to soften impact on my knees that works too.
