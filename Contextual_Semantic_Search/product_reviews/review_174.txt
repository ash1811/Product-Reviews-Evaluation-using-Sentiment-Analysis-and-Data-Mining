My 20-month old granddaughter loves to go through Mommy's purse so I was sure she would love this one - but not so.  The phone doesn't do anything and doesn't look mom's smart phone, the mirror is tiny, the credit card wallet is hard too open. Mostly, the things just aren't 'real' enough to match what Mom has. It was tossed in a corner after the first day and hasn't been used since.
