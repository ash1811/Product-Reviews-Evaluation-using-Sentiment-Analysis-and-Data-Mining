I like these pants a lot. I got black and the black is sleek. The material feels nice and crispy. Very comfortable. For anyone looking for pants of this kind, these are a solid choice. The waist measurements are precise and the waist is NOT at all stretchable, so make sure you don't order too small... if anything, go a size too large and use a belt.
