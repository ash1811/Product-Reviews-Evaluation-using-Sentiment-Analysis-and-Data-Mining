Keeping with the Carhartt name these Bib Overalls are well constructed and worth every penny paid. I bought a size larger then normal and they fit perfectly with or without a pair of jeans beneath them. I also like the moss color so much better then the normal brown. You might spend a little more for these but as I said they are worth every penny and the material is so much better then anything cheaper.
