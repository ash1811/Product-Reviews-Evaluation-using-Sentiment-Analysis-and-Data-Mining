I bought this for general use when hiking and working in the yard.  It also works fairly well as a rain hat.  Simply, it's a good boonie hat.  The material and stitching aren't anything amazing, but they are sturdy and consistent quality.  If you want a decent, cheap, functional hat, then you'll be satisfied with this one.
