This is my second pair of this shoe.  I thought my first pair was uncomfortable because it was a half size to small.  Wrong!  This Gordan Cap is just stiff and uncomfortable after a month of break in.  I've bought a number of Dockers shoes in different styles over the past 10 years or so.  I have always liked them and that's why I tried a second pair of these.  Not again.  They look really good, but they are never comfortable.  For those of you old enough to remember these are the going to church shoes you had to wear once a week.  And pinched your feet the entire time.  Two stars because they do look good.
