Good scope of protection considering its desing which expose lateral view. Light weighted to use them for hours.I drop them by accident into rocks about 6 foot high and did not suffer even 1 scratch which is pretty cool. So you can expect quality of product. I am looking foward to buy a sporty look ones now.
