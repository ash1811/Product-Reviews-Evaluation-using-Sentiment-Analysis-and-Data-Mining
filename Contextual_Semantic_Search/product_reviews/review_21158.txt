I had a pair of these in womens, and after watching my boyfriend rip his feet apart last summer wearing cheap flip flops I bought him a pair of Sanuks. He's obsessed! The man who almost never wore flip flops wore them this entire summer. They are amazingly comfortable, and while a little pricey they are well worth it. I've worn mine consistently (read as daily) for two summers in a row and they just now wearing out. I will definitely be replacing them with another pair. I may order another pair for my boyfriend too, just in case!
