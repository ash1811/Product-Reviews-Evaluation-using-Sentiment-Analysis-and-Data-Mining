I am a 32DDD and was excited to get this bra. It looked about right in size but when I put it on I realized the cups simply didn't hold enough boob. The bra is wonderfully made and incredibly tight, so I may end up keeping it, only for use with strapless dresses, because it's just so tight. If I am able to return this bra for a better fit I highly recommend it. The material on the band is very thick and durable, and it has 4 hooks in the back, which I was thrilled by.
