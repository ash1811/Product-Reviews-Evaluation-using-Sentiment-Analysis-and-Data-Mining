If you're trying to connect two 50 lb suitcases together, this is not the strap to use. Look for the Travelon Multi-Bag Stacker, Black, One Size.This simple buckle and strap looks easy to use but it isn't. When you're in a hurry and you need to adjust the tension on this strap, you're fussing around with it in baggage claim. The Travelon Multi-Bag Stacker has extra "tongue" to quickly pull on (like a backpack strap) so you can clip, pull to tighten, and GO.This Lewis N Clark strap is good for light loads and smaller bags.  For larger ones, this one was a pain to use. You get what you pay for. Choke up the extra $5 and get the Travelon, you'll be glad you did.
