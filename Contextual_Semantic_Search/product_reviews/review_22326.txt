At 1st I thought the color wasn't as vibrant but it has this pretty lace pattern which redeems it in that regard. I am 5'9, a 34 C & 127 lbs & if you like the look of the laces exposing some of your skin in the back then the item is true fit. Usually with corsets, you're supposed to size down but in this case I would order my true size or size up. We tightened it up without any problems & I like that the laces are into 2 seperate pieces because it makes adjusting the top & bottom parts eaiser. All hook & eye corsets are difficult to fasten because the hooks wanna keep coming undone as you fasten them. Also, all top portions of corsets from my experience are hard to fill out nicely & get good cleavage unless you have really big boobs or breast implants. The reason for 4 stars is that you see stomach skin between the eyelets when you fasten it up all the way even if the item isn't fitting tight. Usually, in well made corsets there is a flap of fabric on the inside that is supposed to cover the skin & hooks & eyes but I guess because it is *somewhat* reversible they left that off. Because the skin of my back & a little on my stomach are exposed I would not wear it out of the house as a top like I wanted to do but my husband sure doesn't mind me wearin' it in the house! *wink wink* ;-)
