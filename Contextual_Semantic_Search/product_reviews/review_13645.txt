I bought these as an extra gift for my wife at Christmas because her slippers had finally worn out. She said these are super comfortable and she loved the color. They are bright and shiny but not too much if you know what I mean. For a pair of slippers they look very nice. Material feels very durable and very well put together. Plus I've never had any bad product from Isotoner overall. Definite thumbs up from my wife.
