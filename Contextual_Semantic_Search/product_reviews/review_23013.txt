I bought these to replace similar ones that had worn out. The size is perfect and they are extremely comfortable. There has been no breaking in period. The quality may not be quite as good as I had previously, but I am very happy with them.4month follow up: After wearing these shoes for a while, they have become increasingly uncomfortable. The crease that has developed over the toes is painful. My toes feel pushed forward due to the. Tapering. They are OK, if one only wears them for a few hours. Not as good quality as previous similar model that I had used for years.
