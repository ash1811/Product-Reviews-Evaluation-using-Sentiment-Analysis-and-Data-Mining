Based on the stellar reviews here, I was expecting more.  I was disappointed with show-through (the cups were fairly flimsy and not well-lined in my opinion), but the bra is comfortable overall.  I'm on the fence about returning it, though, because of the show through problem.  In addition, the lace looks a little cheap and the &#34;relief&#34; of the lace also shows through under garments.  Going to keep looking.
