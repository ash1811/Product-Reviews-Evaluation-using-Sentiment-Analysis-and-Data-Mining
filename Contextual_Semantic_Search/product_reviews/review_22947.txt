I have recently become subject to a dress code at work which has taken me far out  of my norm on footwear.  So, I was looking for something quality and comfortable that I was willing to wear.  The shoes fit that bill and I thought it was a reasonable price.  With narrow feet it is also a godsend to be able to buy my width.
