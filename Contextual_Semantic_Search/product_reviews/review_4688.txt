I generally like Carhartt shirts quite a bit. Because of my experience with the shirts, I decided to try their jeans.  I have two pair of Levi's which I also like, but I also have several pairs of Wally World Faded Glory jeans. Well, you get what you pay for.The thickness of the demim, the tightness of the weave is far superior in the Carhartt jean. Also, sizing is VERY consistent.  I bought one pair 36/32, and then months later bought a second pair, same size and they both fit perfectly.With Faded Glory, every jean is a crap shoot as far as sizing, some too big, some too small, some shorter, some longer. Also with cheaper jeans, the denim does not go far into the pockets and you can see the white pocket liner. (I hate this)The Carhartt jeans and just much better made., and it seems they will wear and last much much longer. As of right now, the Carhartt jeans fit great, look great and are very comfortable. They are easily worth the little extra $$ that they cost compared to the lower cost "bargain" jeans.
