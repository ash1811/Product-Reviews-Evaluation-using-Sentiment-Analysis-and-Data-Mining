The first day I wore these I thought I had finally found the perfect slipper. These were true to size and very comfortable. After just a few days, something inside the soles started bunching up to the point it felt like there were pencils stuck across the soles under my heels as I walked. I wore them a little longer hoping maybe it would get smashed down after a time, but it only got worse. When I looked up the manufacturers warranty, I found on their website you had to pay to mail the defective slipper to them and enclose $5 to pay for their return shipping of a new pair for you. At $13 for a brand new pair, this just isn't worth it. When I went to throw them away I also noticed the fabric on the bottom close to the soles was starting to wear through.
