I always wear an extra large, but after reading the reviews, purchased a 2xl. After a couple of washes, it fits well but a bit baggy. If you line dry these or shake them well before you dry on low heat, they are fine and close to true size.  The 2-2xl's I bought are hanging in the closet as maybe a backup. The black fades nicely after several washes. If you are a borderline XL..on he lower side..they will work great.
