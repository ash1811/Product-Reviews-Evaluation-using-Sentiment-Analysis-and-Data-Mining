I ordered these a size down based on other reviews. Mistake. I am a size 4 jean, small shirt, so I bought the smallest size panties, a 5. They were too small. The sizing is accurate. My hips are 36 inches, I should have bought the size 6s. I am now stuck with 3 pairs of panties that are too small (they still fit, but are not very flattering)
