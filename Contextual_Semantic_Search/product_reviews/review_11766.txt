Extremely soft and flexible, fits well. I have order a size 9 shoe twice now and they have been perfect.  I usually wear a 9.5 size shoe.The soles of the shoe do stand up to outside wear surprisingly well. I will keep getting these shoes until they don't make them any more. The usually last 2-3 years of constant use. I re-laced my last pair; they are still wearable.
