I think someplace it was mentioned that these were equal to those in dept. store for $27.95. I would imagine that to be true, the workmanship and material is well worth the price and the delivery and service great. Plan to purchase more items from this vendor, based on this purchase.The only reason I did not rate them higher is that I have yet to get the pants back from the Tailor,so I have yet to wear them. Buttton's are not included.Time has past, these are working real well, I anticipate buying a few more colors and possibly some other products from this vendor. If I was rating them today I might consider 5 stars.
