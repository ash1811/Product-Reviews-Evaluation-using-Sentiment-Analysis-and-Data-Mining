I'm 5'6&#34;, 150lbs and bought the size 2.  They're a bit large, but that's what I was on the chart.  So I do notice that I have to pull them up here and there to keep them from folding up at my ankles.They're a good thickness for work -- not so thick you can't see your legs, but warm enough to keep your commute not miserable.As a note, they are NOT AT ALL control top - not quite loose, but almost.  They won't slide down or anything, but if you want to keep any kind of shape in your midsection, butt, or thighs, it's not happening.  They won't hold ANYTHING in place.
