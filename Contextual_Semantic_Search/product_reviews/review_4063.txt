I know most people just want to hear the NEGATIVES straight of the bat so we'll start with that.NEGATIVES:1) The 2 wiring that goes down your rib cage on your left, and right will poke while: Sitting, Bending, Walking, and when you wear it with jeans. After a few hours the wiring could irritate your skin. I wouldn't suggest it if your skin is sensitive.2) If you are curvy, as in you have the COLA body, with a little bit too much tummy, and waist, that you would like to completely hold in, I would go a size down. There was a chart recommendation below this rating by a reviewer for sizing. I used that chart it was a perfect fit, but not really what I was going for. I bought the clincher to suck in some unwanted fat and to try and retrain my tummy muscles to retract. The waist line part adds on more curves. If you want a sleek clean look go a size smaller.3) If you like to wear fitted clothes that shows the smallest wrinkles if you wore something inside than I won't suggest this. It shows the clippings inside. The boning (wiring) inside shows. I bought a white one to wear with a white dress and it shows.Positives:1) Material is PERFECT!2) Clippings inside are durable3) Shows up before the expected date4) Washes great in a laundry bag5) Although mine was not as tight as I wanted it to, this actually pushes my water weight down and now I am going for a size smaller :) I want to have a dramatic change to my physical appearance. If you want that than try to workout with this on. Even if it's power walking. Wear it outside of your pants. Your weight comes off within days and you have the curves with it :)FEEL FREE TO LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.
