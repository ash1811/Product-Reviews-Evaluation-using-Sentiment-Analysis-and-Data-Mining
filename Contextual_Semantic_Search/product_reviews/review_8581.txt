These are basic, they are nice, and since they are Vanity Fair they should be durable.  My only issue is that the elastic isn't as soft as most Vanity Fair panties.  It seems like that harder cheaper elastic (which is the way of the world now).  I wouldn't spend a premium price on these. I'll find the nicer Vanity Fair panties in the future.
