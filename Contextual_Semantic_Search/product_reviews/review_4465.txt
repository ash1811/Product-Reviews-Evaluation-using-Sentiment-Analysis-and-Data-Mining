These are very nice shirts, though you can tell that they're &#8220;uniform shirts&#8221;even if you don't wear them with the matching pants. The material starts out kind of stiff but is comfortable after a couple of washes. Shirts fit well and the collar isn't annoying. Others say they wear very well, I haven't had them long enough to tell, but they are convenient enough.
