This chain looks good with any marcasite or oxidized pendant. No problem fitting the end through the bale of any pendant. It's definitely thicker than the starter chain that comes with pendants. I do wish this chain were a little thicker (2 1/2 -3 mm?) I have a marcasite enhancer that is a 1" square and it looks a little thin for it, but the dark tone of the chain does go well with the marcasite. I think the picture of the chain on the web site is a pretty accurate representation of the color - a medium gray. Hope this will be a nice, strong chain for my pendants.The lobster claw clasp did break after a few wearings as some of the other reviewers reported. We replaced the clasp and the chain is now wearable and is fine. Clasp should not have broken but at least I have a wearable oxidized chain.
