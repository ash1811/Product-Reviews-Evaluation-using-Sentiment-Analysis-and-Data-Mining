I bought this for a trip to Spain; it worked at times, but I wished I had gotten something larger.I used it as my regular wallet kind of bag.  It can hold a bottle of water, sunscreen, wallet, a little makeup - and that is with it all crammed in.Better to use it as a backpack or over the shoulder, not really as a crossbody bag.I did use it as a crossbody bag at times, but it was very tight - good in some ways, as I don't think anyone could have taken something out of my bag without me noticing.
