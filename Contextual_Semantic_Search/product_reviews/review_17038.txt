Generally nice product.  Performs as expected.  The build quality on the tool is cheap plastic with metal.  Feels flimsy and cheap, but it worked, even against hard set watch bracelet pins.  The only suggestion I have is to turn the spindle slowly with one hand, then guide it into the pinhole, to get it out.
