This is a great lightweight sneaker that can be worn with a T-Shirt or a Dress Shirt. I loathe the way sneakers look today with neon green lightning bolts and ugly trimmings. These are a breath of fresh air for those not into the Air Jordan scene.Arch support is moderate ( I would have liked more) but for the price these can't be beat.A running shoe ? IMO &#34;NO&#34;. When you run you need to spend a little more money on a shoe with shock absorbers. These would not the fit the bill.
