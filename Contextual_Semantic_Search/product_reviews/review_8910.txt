I purchased this robe for my mom for Christmas.  She took it out of the box and put it right on. I bought her a medium.  She is about a 10-12 .  The medium fit perfect.  The color is a very rich burgandy color.The robe came in the expected time.  It was well packed and well made.  I would purchase this again.
