Bra Fits nicely around the torso giving a snug but comfortable fit. Like the extra padding on the shoulder straps -- this extra padding fits around the straps and slides neatly in place where you want it and can be removed if you un-thread the shoulder straps to slide it off then re-thread the shoulder straps.Color is a vibrant blue with an ever so slight hint of indigo.The shape of the bra is a little pointed (1950's shaping), but it does make the bust look like their are breasts instead of their being a wall of flesh sitting front and center.
