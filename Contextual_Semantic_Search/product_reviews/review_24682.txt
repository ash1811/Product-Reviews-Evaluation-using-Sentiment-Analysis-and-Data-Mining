Some of the reviews made me worry that the texture would be off but these are perfect, silky with just the right amount of sheen. I was also needlessly afraid that the reversible color would show through (it does not). I got these for when I travel. My travel wardrobe is grey and black so these work perfect for me. The size seemed right, I am 5'4&#34; and 125lb and got the size A. The legs were a little short but they are stretchy enough to work. The charcoal color is a really nice shade of grey.
