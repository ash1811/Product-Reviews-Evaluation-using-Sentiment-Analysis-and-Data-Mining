This costume is sized as a child small 4-6. This costume is the largest child small I have every seen. At first we ordered the size below which was too small a 2T-4T. We retuned it and purchased the next size larger. Acutally it ended up beeing 4 or 5 sizes larger. On the bright side, my 3 year old will be able to wear this costume for a long time. We rigged the suit with rubberbands and he loves it! He feels like a real superhero! The Teen Titan cape is really cool and makes the costume look amazing, (it also covers up the rubberbands that are sqeezing handfulls of extra material in the back). One more piece of advice, the mask that came with the child small costume was the same size that came with the toddler costume. Unfortunately both masks are too small for my 3 year old child. We had too purchase another mask separately to complete the costume.
