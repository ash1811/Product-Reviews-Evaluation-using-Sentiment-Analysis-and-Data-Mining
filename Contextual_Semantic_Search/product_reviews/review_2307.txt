Although I haven't really put these jeans through the &#34;Ringer&#34; yet, they fit great.  I'm between a 34 & 35 Waist and it's just nice to be able to have a comfortable pair of jeans.  I know it wouldn't hurt if I lost 10Lbs either but until I do these are very nice.  Wish some of the other colors had this size in stock.
