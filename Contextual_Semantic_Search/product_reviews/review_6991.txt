I was sure these would be good socks based on the brand name, company history and positive reviews.  But this was a disappointing purchase and I would not recommend these socks to anyone.Six pairs of socks.  Put the first pair on and found them to be comfortable, fit perfectly.  Second pair of socks, the elastic on one sock was unstrung and hanging loose but I wore them anyway and clipped off the dangling elastic thread--this sock will not likely stay up in the future after several washings.  Third pair of socks, I found a hole in the foot of one of the socks--a small hole that will undoubtedly grow larger over time.  Fourth pair of socks, discovered a rather large hole in the ankle area of one sock.  I haven't worn the fifth or sixth pair yet.Let me be perfectly clear:  these are the worst made socks I've ever bought.  It is an insult to charge 20 bucks for 6 pair.  The socks I bought have a multitude of flaws and they cost considerably more than the bargain white crew socks you can find at any Walmart or "dollar" store.  True, they are comfortable and soft on first wearing but, really, three out of the first four pair having manufacturing flaws should be a hint as to what you can expect for future wear.I originally thought about returning them to Amazon for a refund due to the poor quality but I decided to do a negative review instead so prospective customers would be forewarned.UPDATE 04/28/2013:  I've worn the other two pair of socks now.  One had two holes in the ankle area and the other was unstitched at the top.  Really...I cannot overstate how poorly this item is made.  If you happen to get a package with no defects, I'm happy for you.  But I will never buy Gold Toe socks again.
