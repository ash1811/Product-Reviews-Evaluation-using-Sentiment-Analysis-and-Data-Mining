This is definitely a feminine, delicate looking chain. I bought it to use with some of my larger pendants that were just too big for close-to-the-throat wear. I have worn it at least a dozen times in the month or so I've had it, and have had zero issues through my one year old god son playing with it, or my various daily activities.It is a beautiful, long, delicate chain that goes with anything and holds up well to the requirements of daily life.
