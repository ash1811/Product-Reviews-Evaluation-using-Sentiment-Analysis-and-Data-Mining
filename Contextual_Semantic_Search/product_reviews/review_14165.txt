This is my 3rd pair of Sperry Top-siders.  My previous pair lasted for over 12 years and I LOVED them.  Time to buy another pair so I went back to my Sperrys but I am not thrilled with the shoe itself.  The leather and sole are thinner than my other pair.  They don't appear to be as hardy of a shoe and I am sure they won't last as long.  The leather also appears to be of lesser quality.  Kind of disappointed.....:(
