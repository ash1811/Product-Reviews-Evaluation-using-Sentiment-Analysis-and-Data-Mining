Really like the watch - nice value for the money.  It's attractive and practical.  However, the instructions on how to adjust the band are intended for several different models so it was difficult to decipher how to adjust.Adjusting the band was a challenge, but did NOT require a jeweler.  We used a cheap earring post to pop the links apart. You can probably use a pin, but have to be careful not to stick yourself.  It wasn't the easiest thing to do, but wasn't rocket science either.Wife enjoys the watch and isn't concerned about damaging it in normal use.  Good value for the money.
