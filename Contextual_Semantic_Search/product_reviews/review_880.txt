We received these shoes as a gift, and I'm actually ordering a larger size for my daughter now.  I love these shoes!  They're so adorable, and we constantly receive compliments on how cute they are.  My daughter has been "standing" since she was about a month old, and she's actually started to wear out the bottoms from pushing herself along when she's in her walker.  Even so, I'm really quite pleased with the construction and materials.  They're very easy to slip on wiggly feet, too.  These have become my go-to gift for expectant moms with a baby girl on the way.
