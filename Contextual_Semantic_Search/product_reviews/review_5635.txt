This is the 2nd pair that I have purchased and are planning on getting several more pairs shortly (pardon the pun).Reasons to purchase these shorts:1.  They hold up well wash to wash2.  They are so comfortable you wont want to take them off3.  The colors do not fade4.  They move well with you (in addition to the fabric being soft)5.  They do not pill after wearing.6.  **THEY ARE CHEAP**
