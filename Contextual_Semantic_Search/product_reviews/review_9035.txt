My favorite pair of jeans. Great jeans.My only comment is that you may not need to buy them as big as Levi's prescribes. Maybe add two inches in the length but none in the waist, especially if you like your jeans more fitted and less loose. Still my favorite pair of jeans though.Can't beat the price for raw denim.
