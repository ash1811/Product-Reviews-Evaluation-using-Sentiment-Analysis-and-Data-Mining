I am now considering buying another pair of these.  I have always been a Teva fan for outdoor shoes for lakes, beaches and rivers but the keen's felt awesome.  the extra support in arch and the footbed are really nice.This will not be my only pair I can guarantee I will be buying a few more pairs in different colors and styles.
