Natori bras are notoriously wider than regular bras. I've tried their Cool Contour bra; the only size that was close to my fit (32G) confirmed this issue. This is why I sized down to their 32DDD for this sports bra. It supports from the band but does not lay completely flat in the front center. If you are in-between sizes like me, know that this will not be an absolutely perfect fit. I love the adjustable straps though.This is also a great bra for low-impact exercise. It definitely minimizes side-to-side bounce. However, for high-impact, I have to layer it with a compression bra to ensure minimization of up-and-down. This could be partly because it is a cotton material with soft cups (no padding or contouring). Also, cotton is not the best for major sweat-sessions; so keep that in mind.I ordered this one for the low price. It does encase the breast tissue; but it does not look as pretty as some other sport bras for women with bigger cup sizes (e.g. my breast shape is round/full on top, but this bra make me look fuller on bottom). If you need to supplement your exercise wardrobe NOW and have a big cup size, this is a decent bra for the activities I listed above. Otherwise, save your money for Wacoal or Freya Sport bras (and get a proper fitting).
