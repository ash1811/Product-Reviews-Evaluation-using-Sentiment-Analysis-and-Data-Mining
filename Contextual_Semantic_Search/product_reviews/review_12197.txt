My husband who is a size 12, needed new flip flops.  I have always worn Rainbows and love them.  He was hesitant about buying in the past.  Great price so I bought them.  He did complain for the first 2 days that they were too small.  I kept on him to wear them around the house.  Now, he is sold.  He can't believe how comfortable they are.  He even wore them hiking to waterfalls in Maui and couldn't believe how well they help up, no slipping and stayed on well.
