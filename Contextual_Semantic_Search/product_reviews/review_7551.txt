This is a lightweight stretchy bra that is easy to get on and off over your head.  It breathes well and has two layers for modesty.  It does have the &#34;uniboob&#34; look, and I would not recommend it for running or high impact sports unless you are quite small.  It suits my own purposes well, since I do weight training and exercise biking, and I wear a lightweight tank over it.  For reference, I wear a 42D and the XXL fits just right.
