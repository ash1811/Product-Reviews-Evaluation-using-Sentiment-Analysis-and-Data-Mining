OK so I bought 3 of these tanks:1st one: It was a grey one. I bought a Medium and it looked GREAT. It was a little too big on me so I was like why not buy a second one?2nd one: I bought a white one. WTH?! Is this made out of paper?? The material was complete crap, nowhere close to the first grey tank.3rd one: I stupidly forgot I bought the 2nd one and gave them another try. This time it was a blue one, HORRENDOUS MATERIAL.Bottom line: Buy the grey color one, it's actually uses clothing material.
