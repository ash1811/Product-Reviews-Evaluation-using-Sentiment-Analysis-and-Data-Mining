Really don't have much to add other than that these shirts are actually comfortable enough for casual wear as well. Just an all around solid shirt from dickies that is pretty cheap. I will echo the sentiment that unless you like swimming in your clothes get the smallest size that will fit you comfortably. For me that's medium (I'm 5'11 and slightly overweight at 195).Good luck.
