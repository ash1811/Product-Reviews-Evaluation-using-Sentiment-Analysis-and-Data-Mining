I have Cerebral Palsy and Rett syndrome. I plan to hopefully get into a medical career but if it doesn't happen I still have some awesome scrubs, clothing, whatever it is called in my situation.With spasticity you can't have clothing that limits your movement, check, the Dickies scrubs allow full range in the arms and neck with no restrictive feeling.With spasticity and sensory sensitivity you need comfort, the fabric is simple and comfortable, nothing fancy.When you deal with a condition like this, things can get messy, drool, spills, etc. These wash really easily and even if i get a spot of drool in the middle of the night its quickly cleared off with some alcohol wipes. perfect there. Cleanability is 5 of 5When you deal with these conditions you want clothing to last, you dont have money to spend on new stuff often. This stuff has been worn day in and day out by me for the last 3-4 months and washed every week, no fading no nothing, no pulled threads nothing. PerfectWhether your in the medical profession or not, the Dickies scrubs are a great way to go for work wear.Oh and another great plus, its split at the sides at the bottom (i aint no clothing genius, i think this is called a hem?) but this is a huge benefit for wheelchair users!!!
