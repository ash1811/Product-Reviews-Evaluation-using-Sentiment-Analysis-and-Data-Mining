I know all brands are different, so that may be the problem.  This is my first pair of Carhartt pants/jeans.  But, before ordering I tried on two pairs of my current jeans to make sure I liked the size they were.  I did, so I ordered that size, but these are much tighter than my other jeans of the same size from other manufacturers.  They are tighter in the legs and waist.  I think part of the problem with the waist may be because if you look at the picture you will see the waist band is higher than many other types of jeans.  So, the higher waist band rides higher up closer to my belly button compared to my other jeans.  And, ummm lets say my six pack of abs bulges out a bit more by my belly button than it does down on my actual waist.  I've never had jeans that ride this high in the waist, so that probably explains some of my sizing issues.But over all these are constructed well, and I have quit doing situps in hopes that my rock hard bulging belly muscles will get smaller so the waist will fit better.  If I don't put these through the dryer I think I can get by with them.
