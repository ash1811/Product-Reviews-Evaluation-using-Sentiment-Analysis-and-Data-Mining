Today's Levi's just don't measure up to what they used to be.Get an old army surplus wool blanket.Lay out jeans and trace a pattern about 2 inches larger along the entire outline.Cut & sew together into a pair of ugly, green pants with an opening for the fly.Flip your jeans inside out.Insert jeans into army blanket pants.Sew army blanket pants to jeans at the hem & waist.Flip jeans right side out.Wear.You've just made a pair of insulated jeans that's better than anything lined with flannel.
