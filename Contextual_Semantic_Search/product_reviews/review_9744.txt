This is a great bathing suit for training.  I swim on a regular basis for exercise and this suit allows me to have a snug fit but not be a brief style suit.  I am in my sixties and I perfer to cover more than to show more.  I ordered the suit in my pants size and it fits just right.  Not too tight and not too loose.  I plan to buy another one so I can alternate them.
