I got what I expected- I agree with one reviewer who said the lilac is not really lilac- more of a pinkish lavender- but I like the color.The stitching at the waist is not very stretchy- I admit I am a little chubby and this binds just a little.Next time I will get more of the Jockey spaghetti strap tank top as it has spandex and is more stretchy- and the cost is the same with no shipping charge.The top I received was made in India.
