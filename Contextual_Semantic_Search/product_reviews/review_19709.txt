This was for my son, who is young enough that he doesn't have many credit cards nor a driver's license, so we intentionally looked for a slim, small wallet - and it is.  There is room for a limited array of credit cards and a clear window fold out for a driver's license, and you can just squeeze currency in.  The bill holder section is long enough, but just.  It works well for my son, but I personally would be stymied by how small it is, but then I have a lot more to put in my wallet.  If you're looking for a small compact unit, small enough it could even go in a front pocket, this is a good choice.  Seems well enough made, but it's too early to really judge that.
