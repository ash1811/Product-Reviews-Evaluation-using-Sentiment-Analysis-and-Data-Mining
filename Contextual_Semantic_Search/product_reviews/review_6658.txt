I purchased these shoes for Salsa lessons.  I wanted a dance shoe with a low heal and this shoe was perfect for that.  Ordered 1/2 size up as suggested by other reviewers.  When I first tried them on, the shoe was way too narrow for my widish foot.  I sprayed some water on them and put shoe stretchers in them for 2 days.  The stretching worked and I was able to wear them comfortably for a 2 hour salsa workshop.  Overall, I am happy with this shoe.
