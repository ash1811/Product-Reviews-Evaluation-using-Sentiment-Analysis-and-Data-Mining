The good:  These robes are well-made and the terry is dense and thick - not the cheap stuff!  They fit well and the chocolate color is beautiful.  They are very long and the sleeves are long, we both wear the medium.The bad:  They are very heavy and take a bit long to dry.  We put them on after showering and have to hang them inside out to try to get them dry enough for the next shower.  They don't breathe too well, so sometimes it feels as if they aren't absorbent - I had to check to be sure they were 100% cotton because that's a tendency common to polyester.Overall, these are really good robes and I believe after enough washing and drying they will become better and better.  If that happens I'll try to remember to update!!
