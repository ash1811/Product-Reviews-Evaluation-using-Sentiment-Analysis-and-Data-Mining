I usually wear a size 8 shoe. Got a 7 in these. They are perfect. Very comfortable and I love the color.Update: I wear these for water aerobics. The sole in one shoe started to move down to my toes during my workout. Solution - I used my hot glue gun in the middle of the sole. Perfect! Doesn't move at all now.
