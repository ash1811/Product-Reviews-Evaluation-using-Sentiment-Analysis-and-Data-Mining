I really like this watch.  I had a two-toned watch a few years ago and wanted another one.  This is very classy-looking and would be the finishing touch for a special outfit.  I had to remove two of the links in order for it to fit my wrist and it's not tight, but feels secure.  I would definitely recommend this watch to anyone.
