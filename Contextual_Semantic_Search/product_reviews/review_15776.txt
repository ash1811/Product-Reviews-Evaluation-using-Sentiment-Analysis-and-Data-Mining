These socks are very comfortable for running, and are excellent in every way.  The only problem is that cheap socks have become almost as good.  I bought two pairs of these for about what 18 pairs of similar cushioning socks from less respected brands would cost.I agree that these are great socks.  They just aren't that much better than what comes in a multi-pack of cushioning socks at a retailer.Negatives:- Priced too high- No bulk package discounts availablePositives:- Very comfortable- Well cushioned- Don't bunch up- Even fit, that doesn't cut off circulation at all- Last very well, durable- Fit well- Don't stretch out- Retain their shape- Wick moisture well, and dry quickly- accurate sizingI don't regret buying these socks too much.  When I am in the middle of a long run, I'm not as worried about how much my gear cost, compared to how it works.  That said, I honestly think that the multi-packs of running socks that they have at Target, Sam's Club, or Costco are almost just as good, at a fraction of the price.
