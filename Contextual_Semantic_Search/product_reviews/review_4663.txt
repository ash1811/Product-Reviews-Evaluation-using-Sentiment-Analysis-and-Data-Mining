I am buying more and more Carhartt products lately, it seems...why?  QUALITY!  They have great products that are well constructed and very rugged.  I have been wearing the men's twill work pants now for months and enjoy them a lot.  So, I decided to try out their jeans.  Very nice indeed.  BUT...where are the other two loops?  The last pairs of jeans I bought were from Lands End and they were great.  Very comfy and 7 loops on them, as they should have.  So, when I went looking for Carhartt jeans, I looked at reviews and photos very carefully before buying, and what I saw was encouraging.  The photos for the jeans I chose all had 7 belt loops so I thought this would be exactly what I was looking for...um...nope.  When they arrived, they only had 5, more like cheaper brands that don't have as much "attention to detail" as the better ones.  I was so used to the 7 loops on my previous jeans, that 5 just doesn't "feel" right?  Does that make sense?  I decided to keep them, and to be honest, they are comfy and durable and very nice to wear, they look good too!  But, I wish I had the 7 vs. 5 loops.  It may be a "small" thing in the grand scheme of things, but it bothers me that their product description doesn't mention number of belt loops, but the photos all show 7 loops, but that isn't what you get.  But, again, I am happy with them and will continue to wear them.  And the price point was great.  Half of what I spent on the Lands End jeans.  So, if you can live with 5 belt loops, their GREAT!  Go for it.
