Please, HUE, never change these tights ever. They fit perfectly, they look great, and, most spectacularly of all, they last forever! I purchased two pairs, wore one a few times and then took it with me on a month-long backpacking trip. I wore them probably 15-20 days out of the month, machine-washed them several times, hanging them to dry willy nilly. I wore them under a skirt, shorts, and a dress. I wore them with socks and without socks in my Doc Martens. They climbed countless flights of stairs, sat on trains for hours, ran all over large cities...And they still look great. There's a bit of wear around the ankles, but other than that they still look fantastic. I need to order about 6 pairs in every color.
