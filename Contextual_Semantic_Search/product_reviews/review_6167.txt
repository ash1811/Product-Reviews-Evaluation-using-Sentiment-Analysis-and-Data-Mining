In my 20's I had a very serious fall on black ice.  Since then, anytime I knew there was going to be icy weather, or anytime there was melted snow that would freeze overnight, I was fearful of going out for anything.  I've already used my Yaktrax this year, and I'm no longer afraid.  I feel safe and secure and look forward to stepping out.  THEY'RE GREAT!!!  Thank you!
