This is a wonderful bra IF you can wear it.  I can't.  I like everything about it and wish I could wear use it, but because of the shape of the cup, it cuts into me under my arm and it's actually painful to wear for longer than a few minutes.  I noticed that another reviewer mentioned this particular problem, so I don't think it's unusual. Forewarned is foreARMed.
