I wear these more for back support than as a 'corset', but have tried various other brands--none works like Fleexes (including the more expensive label you're probably all familiar with.)  I'm more comfortable wearing a size larger than 'needed', but suspect that's a personal preference.  If you want either a 'corset' or something to help with back issues, this may be pricey, but it's a good buy.
