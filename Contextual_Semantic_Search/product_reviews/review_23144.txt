These Jeans are well made..They are of a lighter weight Denim then other Wrangler Mens Jeans.Yet the cut is good.And the stitching is strong..They wear well.And for a guy like myself whom has diabeties.My weight bounches up and down like a yo yo. These jeans still make you feel comfortable.And are a good looking pair of jeans.They are tapered cut at the cuff..So they will fit over boots.They do not sag.Nor do they make you appear as though your carrying your laundry in the back of your pants. No saggingno dragging.No bagging.They are a good pair of Mens Jeans.  At a good price. As is all of Wranglers pants.I prefer them over the Other Brand.Because after months of continued washing?they dont frey around the cuffs or the pockets tops. They are a five pocket Jean as well.Bought here ,on Amazon.com where the Whole World Shops for Value....
