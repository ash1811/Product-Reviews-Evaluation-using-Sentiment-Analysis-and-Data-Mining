First off we needed a backpack that can take the pounding. There was a video review posted that showed it could hold 10 books. When it arrived, I had my doubts. However it has proved itself. How do I know? No complaints from my son. High School here in Wolcott  has become career oriented from the word go. I remember in my senior year  in Newtown High School we had the &#34;core&#34; subjects and maybe business. Not too many books. Mu daughter has a scholarship to a private school. She is bring home heavy books. I can barely lift the book bag. Good investment. I highly recommend this product.
