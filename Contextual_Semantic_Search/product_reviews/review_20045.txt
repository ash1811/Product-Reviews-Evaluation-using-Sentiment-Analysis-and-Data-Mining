The first couple weeks are pure hell because the sides are so stiff.  Thick socks, and even wrapping bandannas around the leg where the top rubs is necessary.  Then, all of a sudden, they are broken in and feel as natural as any shoe can feel.  My bad back loves these soles, my weak ankles are so thankful for the support, and they polish up nice. Too bad they stopped making half sizes.
