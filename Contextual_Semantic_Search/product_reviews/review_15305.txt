35 years ago, when I started gardening professionally, my boss introduced me to Tingley Boot Rubbers.We worked on an estate and had to go from the greenhouse to the gardens constantly throughout the day.Back then, there was no Goretex, so boots, even 'waterproof' boots got wet from the constant moisture.These days, I wear the new lightweight Goretex boots, but my employees still wear leather, so I keep a couple of pair of these in the van for them. They love 'em.As for sizing, I know I need to buy the X-Large size. I wear a size 42 (Europe) or size 9.5-10 (US). You need to upsize a little to compensate for the bulk of the boot.
