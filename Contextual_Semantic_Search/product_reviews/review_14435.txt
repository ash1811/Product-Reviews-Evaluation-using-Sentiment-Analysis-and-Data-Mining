I had recently purchased a brown pair of the Ecco SeaWalker while in California.  I liked them so much I decided to get a black pair, found them on Amazon.com and ordered them.  They are very comfortable and can be worn from casual to dress up casual.  I have worn Ecco's for years so know the quality is excellent.
