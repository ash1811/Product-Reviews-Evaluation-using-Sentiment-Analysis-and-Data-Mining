These are great boots. They fit well right out of the box.  The soles are really grippy and wear a long time.I primarily use mine for taking my dog for walks in the woods in winter.  I used spray to waterproof them.  My feet stay nice and warm and dry.They fit true to size and run slightly wide. I'm very picky about footwear yet give these boots the highest recommendation.
