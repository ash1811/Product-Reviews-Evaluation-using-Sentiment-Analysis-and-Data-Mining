These slippers are deliciously comfortable.  Unlike the air-filled slippers that after a short time deflate, these have a thick rubber sole that makes them both comfortable and sturdy.  You can wear them for a quick run outside to get the paper or to throw out the garbage.  The only downside is that the back portion of the slipper is not high enough to offer any support, but is high enough to be uncomfortable if the slipper did not fit properly.  Go a half-size up if you are unsure of sizing.
