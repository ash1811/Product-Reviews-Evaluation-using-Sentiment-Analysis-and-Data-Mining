These are the best shoes for my mother. They are stylish and functional for her. She lives in a dementia assisted living place and she loves these shoes. They are easy to get into and out of and provides a rugged, substantial sole and rugged sole that assists in falls prevention. I am certain you never thought this would be something the people at Sketchers thought of when designing this shoe but it is a really good one for her.Thanks
