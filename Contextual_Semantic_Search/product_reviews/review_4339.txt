These sandals have been everywhere with me ---to Indonesia, to India, to Jamaica and Bahamas and all over the Mid-Atlantic States.  I really like the durable sole and the webbing construction around the foot, keeps the sandal firmly on but breathable. My one complaint is that some of the back stitching has come away, but I guess that is to be expected if I wear these things so damn much.  I plan on getting a new pair this spring.
