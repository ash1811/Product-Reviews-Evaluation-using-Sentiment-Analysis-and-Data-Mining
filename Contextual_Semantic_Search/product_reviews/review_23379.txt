I shopped for a backpack/bag that I could use while site seeing in DC this spring.  I thought a shoulder tote would be too heavy and one-sided to serve my purpose but I wanted something that didn't look like I was trekking through the mountains. I needed it to be big enough to hold sweaters, water, snacks, cameras and purse contents since we would be gone for the entire day.It held a good amount of stuff I will say that.  And I loved the turquoise color but it wasn't as comfortable as I had hoped (it kinda smashed my boob) forcing me to constantly adjust it.  The phone holder on the strap is a total waste (I'd never put my phone in there and couldn't think of what would fit in the little space--gum?) it actually gets in the way.  By day 3 it was coming apart at the strap so I bought an $8.99 Washington DC zippered tote at a souvenir shop and left the backpack behind for someone desperate or a homeless person to use.
