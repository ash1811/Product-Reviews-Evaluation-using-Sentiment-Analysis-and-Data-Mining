This is an excellent bra. I am around a 34D/34DD (I am just in the middle of these two sizes, or so I've been told by Victoria's Secret). I bought the &#34;34/36 D/DD&#34; and it fits wonderfully. It's very supportive and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this bra to someone who is larger-chested. It's reasonably priced on sale, and is much more supportive than some of the lower-priced sports bras. It's great to find a bra that actually keeps everything in place while working out!
