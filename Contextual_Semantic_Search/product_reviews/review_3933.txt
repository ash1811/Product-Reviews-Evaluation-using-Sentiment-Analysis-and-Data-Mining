I found this bra on sale for $7 at TJMaxx a while back and I didn't think I'd like it, but it was such a good deal I thought I'd give it a shot. I ended up loving it! I got it in the black and beige striped print and it's gorgeous! I have gotten so many compliments on it from friends, women at the gym, and my boyfriend (I don't think I've ever gotten complimented on a regular, everyday bra before, only the special occasion stuff). It seems very true to size and is comfy. Unlike some demi bras, the cups are cut low enough that it doesn't show out of the top of scoopneck shirts or tank tops. Another think I love about it is that the strap adjustment ring is in the front, not in the back, so it's easy to adjust perfectly, with out having to call in a friend for help lol. Definitely recommended.
