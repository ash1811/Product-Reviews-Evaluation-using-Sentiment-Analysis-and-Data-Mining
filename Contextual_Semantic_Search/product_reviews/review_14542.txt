Just found out my arch is falling in my right foot so I have been shopping around for sandals and shoes with better support for my foot.  After a lot of research, reading and recommendation from other flat footed people, I saw Birkenstock recommended over and over so I grabbed these since they were a well priced pair.  I have been wearing them for about a week or two now and just like everyone says, you have to break them in.  At first the soles felt quite hard and a little uncomfortable but slowly, they are starting to soften up and are feeling more comfortable with each wear.  The strap by my toes on my right foot does seem to be rubbing one of my toes a bit but hoping that will break in with some time too.  They're great for wearing indoors but are kinda clunky; this style of Birkenstock's seems a little more like something a guy would wear so I won't be wearing these out and about.  I do have one more pair on the way that appeared to be more feminine, I'm hoping they actually look like that in person so I can wear those ones out.  Nice room for a wide foot.  I ordered a size 38 and they fit my foot just right; I normally wear an 8 but was told these fit bigger so that's why I went with a 38.
