Like 1/2 of the reviewers, I bought these for my SO for xmas. He is a fairly honest person and said these slippers are pretty good as far as slippers go, but he still like his old pair better. They are a little stiff and although I bought his normal size, they fit him tightly at first but they have stretched a little with daily use over the last month. He doesn't like the stiffness of the sole either. A little more flexibility so they are more like a slipper than a shoe would have made them better. He did keep them though and he does wear them.
