While looking around for something to replace my 10-year- old topsiders, I decided to give these a try. What a pair of great shoes. They look good enough to wear with a suit, and are casual enough to wear with shorts. I love these shoes. If you travel, no need to pack more than one pair of shoes; just wear these.The leather appears to be a good quality, and the soles seem very sturdy. More cushioned than regular topsiders.
