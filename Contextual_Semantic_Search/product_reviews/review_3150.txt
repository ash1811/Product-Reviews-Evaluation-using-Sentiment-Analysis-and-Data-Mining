This bra is not only incredibly comfortable but it's also an excellent value. The bra washes well and even though I accidentally threw it in the dryer on the cotton setting it didn't shrink in the least bit. I was wary about buying a bra that was a C-Dd cup but I had no cause to be concerned. The bra fits perfectly. I would highly recommend this bra for women needing something light to wear around the house or to sleep.
