This is a wonderful product! I got it for my wedding as my dress is VERY unforgiving. I am thin/average anyway but it really sucked in the parts that needed to be sucked in. high quality fabric. Very comfortable. The snaps seem very secure. It's that nice bra fabric, not cheap or flimsy. The boning is supporting but doesn't show through my dress.I heard the trick is to turn it around!! The back (aka the front) dips down so if you have a low back dress. it will fit better! I highly recommend this!!
