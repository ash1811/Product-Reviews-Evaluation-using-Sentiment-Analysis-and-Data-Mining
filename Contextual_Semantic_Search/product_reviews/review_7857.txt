These are poor quality vests, but I'm giving them an extra star because the $12 price is right. The construction is more like a T-shirt than an athletic garment. There is no elastic at the waist or arms to keep your heat in. The cut is very loose and baggy. I weigh 160 pounds and even size small is loose on me. The fleece is pretty thin and not wind resistant, so is useful in only the mildest conditions or as a mid-layer under a weather resistant jacket.
