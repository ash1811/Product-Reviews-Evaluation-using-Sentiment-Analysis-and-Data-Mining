I am Asian with a bit of a tan. I highly recommend "Suntan" unless you are very pale."Caramel" is extremely light and will wash you out but is great if you are layering it under a white "Fence net" for the snow bunny go go outfits.Those are the only two colors I've used and wish I could return the Caramel for Suntan.The best feature of this fishnet is it's strength. It's like wearing steel. It just sucks you in and reduces the appearance of any cellulite or loose skin (as a mom I appreciate this a lot).I used to go go dance and currently bartend. I wear these whenever I have to wear shorts at work to hide my mommy skin. I usually remove the regular mesh on the foot and the elastic at the top to make it more comfortable. (I only remove the elastic at the top if I'm planning to wear low cut pants).The only way to make this better is to make it footless since the only time I wear this is with sneakers or boots. (I understand that they are fully footed so that girls can wear them with heels.) I do hope that one day I find this exact fishnet in a footless style.Can't wait to buy a few more pairs when I can afford it. (Seeing as these last quite a while I usually buy these once a year right before summer)Love it!! :D
