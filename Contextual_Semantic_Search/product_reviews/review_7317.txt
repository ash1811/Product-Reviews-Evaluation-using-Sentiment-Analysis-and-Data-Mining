I got this for my 5 year old and she only wore them for a few weeks before they fell apart.  They fit her great and the leather really molded to her foot but, I was sad that she wasn't able to wear them longer.  The price, however, was great and the color was perfect.  I would recommend maybe buying 2 pairs.  I don't think it was the production of the shoe that was the problem but the NATURE of the shoe.
