I am happy with the double pack so far. Just hoping they hold up well since my other brands I normally ordered decided to shave some pennies off and therefore produced a sub-standard shirt that fell apart much faster than they should have. Hopeing Dickies doesnt do the same. If these things wear out faster than they should, I'll update my review.
