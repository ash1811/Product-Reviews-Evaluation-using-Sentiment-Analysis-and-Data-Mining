I wear size 15 so a lot of times I have to pay a lot of shoes my size. I am pretty happy with the quality of these shoes, especially considering the price. One person mentioned that they though the sizes were under-indicated. I didn't feel like that was the case with the ones I received. If you wear a large size shoe and are looking for something comfortable and affordable, you could definitely do worse.
