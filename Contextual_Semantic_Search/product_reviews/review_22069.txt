I love these shoes, however, Easy Spirit needs to do something about the sizing. I have tried on many of these shoes in stores. Every color had a different feel in the SAME Size. I bought the black ones a few years back because they felt good, and I sized down to a 9. They were a little roomy so I put an insert from a sneaker I wasn't using inside the shoe and it was like walking on air.Now I bought a pair from Amazon, also a 9 in black. These fit more snugly and I definitely cannot add another insert to them.  They are comfortable, but not &#34;cloud 9.&#34;  I do not know why Easy Spirit cannot have uniform sizing.Amazon's price is great, as is their service. I will keep these.  Just wanted to tell others to watch their sizing.
