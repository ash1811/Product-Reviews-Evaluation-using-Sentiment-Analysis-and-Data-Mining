I'm so happy I found this dark blue paste polish on Amazon.  I've looked &#34;forever&#34; in stores but never saw a blue polish...an impossible feat.  Low and behold, here it is on Amazon and I'm thrilled.  Finally my search is done.  This polish goes on smooth, covers nicks and shines beautifully.
