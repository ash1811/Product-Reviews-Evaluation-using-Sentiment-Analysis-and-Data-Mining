Having already owned the burgandy version of this same shoe, I knew I was getting a well made shoe at a good price.  The thick sturdy sole offers good traction, and the padded collar is easy on the ankles.  If I were to offer any complain, it would be that the thicker sole takes away a little bit from the sophisticated, leather-soled look that you might get in a traditionally made dress shoe.  The sole is by no means 'clunky'... simply thicker than a leather sole.  They look great when worn with dress pants, and that was all I needed them to be!
