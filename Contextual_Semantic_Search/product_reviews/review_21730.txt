Working outside in the South Florida sun in the summer really does a number on your skin.  If you have allergies to all the dust and pollen, sweat dribbling into your eyes can cause some pretty bad reactions and sometimes even an infection. Having sunscreen and insect repellent washed into your eyes by sweat can also cause bad problems.  It took me two weeks to cure the last eye infection I had.I bought four of these bandanas in the jumbo size(27"x27") to tie around my head under my wide brimmed hat.  The larger size makes them easier to work with and results in more absorbent area.  There is a tag on each one saying "Made in China" so I was a bit apprehensive about the quality of the product.So far, so good.  The cloth used is very absorbent and comfortable.  They have survived being washed a few times so far with no apparent change. The colors have stayed vibrant and consistent and have not run down my face.The problem with this type of product is that vendors often change manufacturers depending on cost and quality.  Unfortunately lower cost can mean poor quality that only becomes evident with time and usage. The vendor can be fooled and not aware of any problems until later in the delivery cycle. So I got a good batch, but you may not.  If you get a bad batch--send them back for a refund! The vendor needs to know.
