I purchased this slip to wear underneath a sheer, long-sleeved dress I purchased. I find that this slip does everything it needs to, but just not quite as well as I wish it would. The dress I purchased this for is polyester chiffon, and it seems to generate a good deal of static on contact with the dress. The dress sticks a bit to the slip, sometimes in weird looking ways.The slip is opaque enough that underwear isn't really visible, but I still find that I need to wear light colored undies to avoid anything showing through. The slip is also fairly long; I am 5ft4 and I find it to be past midthigh. It works out fine for the dress I specifically bought this for, but for other dresses, it tends to be a tad long. This is also generally just larger than I thought it would be; I had hoped it would be a bit more tailored, I suppose.Overall, it's decent. It does everything I need it to, just perhaps not as well as I want it to.
