I wear a size 34 waist and based on the manufacturer's recommendations I ordered a size medium. They fit a little on the tight side around the waist, but I don't expect to be gaining any weight (hopefully). The manufacture of the pants looks to be very nice and I have not doubt they will serve their purpose very well. Although I have no complains with these pants, the next size I purchase will be a large - I prefer them to be a little loose as appose to a little tight.
