VERY CHEAPLY MADE- inside lining peeling back & losing glue brand-new...fit is poor & not true to size...shoes are synthetic except for upper part & smell funny right out of the box. Cheap manmade linings cause sweat & discomfort. Capezio goes further & further downhill every year. Not worth the discount- will definitely spring for real Grishkos next time.
