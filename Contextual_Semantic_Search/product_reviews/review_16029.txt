This Timex watch was made for a young girl, yet it is also wonderful for a woman. And since I am both a tech and girly girl, this is the perfect watch for me as I have very small wrists.Pros:1) Easy to read face with FULL NUMBERS.2) Second hand.3) Thick and dark hand keys so it easy to read this watch looking at it directly or on the side.4) A Faux leather band that is DURABLE and waterproof.5) Water-resistant up to 50 meters (meaning, I can easily wash dishes or my hands with this watch on). I would not recommend deep sea diving with it on however...6) This watch will be beautiful on a child or anyone with a small writs as the band has seven holes in it for easy adjustment.7) Built in light. Just press the stem and the light comes on for a couple of seconds.8) Very attractive, yet simple--this watch does not look childish, it has a clean and classic design. (If you took off the strap and replaced it with a black strap, a younger boy could also wear this watch).This watch will fit a small child or an adult with smaller wrists. As I have very small wrists, the band is more than large enough to fit me and then some.Cons: NONEHighly recommend this for yourself if you have smaller wrists and are a girly girly type, who like me, likes pink.Hope that this review has been of help to you and thank you for reading it.
