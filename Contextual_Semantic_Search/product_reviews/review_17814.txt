Only had this G-Shock for less than a week but so far, I'm pretty happy with it but there are a few things I would improve if I could.Good size, while not being too big.  Yes, it is a little bit of a pain adjusting the time but that doesn't need to be done too often at all so i can deal with it.  Looks good but I'd like it better if instead of the bold red lettering on the front, they used something more subtle.  It can be difficult to read the digital display but if the hands are over the display, all that's needed is to tilt the watch a little to see the numbers underneath.  Lastly, it would be nice if the backlight also lit the analog face but I can deal with just it lighting the digital display.Overall, a good watch especially for the price.
