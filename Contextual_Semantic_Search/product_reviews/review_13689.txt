this bra is not sturdy. if you're a stripper or using it as a costume for some other purpose it'll be fine. if you expect it to support you and be wearable as a sexy undergarment... it wont be very comfortable for one, clothes dont lie smoothly over ANY of my clothes (which are not tight, or clingy or thin fabrics, for the most part) i got it in a 36D and even without the removable pads i was spilling out of it.i didn't like it, i wouldn't recommend it, and i won't buy anything else made by this company.
