pants are excellent quality, suited to extreme use in rain forest are cool, comfortable, and dry very fast. are highly resistant to mud slide down slopes. have double fabric knees and crotch, protects and makes it more resistant. I use them for hunting and fishing in the jungle of Costa Rica in hot and humid climate. very good camouflage side pockets are big and strong.
