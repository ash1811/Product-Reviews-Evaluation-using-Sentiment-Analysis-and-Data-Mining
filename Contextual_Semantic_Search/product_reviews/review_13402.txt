Wanted so badly to have a pair of Ray Ban Aviator sun glasses, but it's not meant to be.  They are way too big for my small face.  I returned them the same day I received them and within a day, Amazon contacted me and said a credit was being processed to my account.  Credit was received before the week was even over.  I LOVE AMAZON!!!  I am going to order another pair of Ray Ban's....just agonizing over which ones.  I'm thinking I will switch gears and go with plastic, wrap frames/glass lenses.  Seems like those styles might be more suitable for smaller faces.  Not sure, but not giving up....especially with Amazon's awesome return policy and great customer service!
