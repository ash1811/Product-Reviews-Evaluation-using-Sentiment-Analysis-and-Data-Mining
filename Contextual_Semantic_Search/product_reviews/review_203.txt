We bought this for our 15-mo old granddaughter. She liked carrying it around.  She played with the "Phone" and the "keys" that came with it and "used" the lipstick.  I liked that the handle was soft and the purse was a good size for toddlers.  I'm sure she will continue to enjoy it over the next few years.
