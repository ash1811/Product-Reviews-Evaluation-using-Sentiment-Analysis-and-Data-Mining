Oh I am well pleased.  Being a large woman standard bulk pack brief panties are cut for the cut to be a 'V&#34; from the crotch.  These Lollipop Panties are cut so the leg opening stays even with the crotch and for me they don't ride up and stay comfortably in place.  I am pleased I spent more money for a very good product.
