These legwarmers have been with me for more than 3 years and finally I have wore big holes through them so i need to get them replaced.  I agree with the previous reviews that they can be tight on the upper thigh in the beginning but eventually the elastic will loosen up a bit.  They fit nicely over tights/leggings.  I really like how they feel and look.  With short shorts they elongate the leg lines all the way to the foot.  Great for wearing with ballroom shoes as the stirrups allow for secure fitting over the heels.  I am 5'5 and weigh 122lbs so there is some extra leggings that bunch up by the ankle area but it makes the feet/arch look better.  I also have the 36" ones but think that the 48" look nicer in general.
