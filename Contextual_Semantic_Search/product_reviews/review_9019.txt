They look great on my husband giving him a little extra room in the leg area and making the butt area look great. My only complaint is drying them in the dryer is difficult. I have to air-dry them flat first, then put them in the dryer to complete the job. They twist or something and they don't dry correctly. Anyway, other than that, I love these jeans on the husband.
