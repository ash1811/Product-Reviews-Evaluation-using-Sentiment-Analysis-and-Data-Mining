My foot measures between a size 7 and 7.5 which is on the small side of the &#34;one size&#34; size range.  The gold toe crew socks wash and dry well and do not have much exra fabric at the end of my foot.  Extra fabric wrinkles and is very uncomfortable whether at the end of the shoe or under the foot.  These might not be as good for someone wearing a size 9 or larger shoe however.  The band at the top is not constricting but the sock still stays up well.
