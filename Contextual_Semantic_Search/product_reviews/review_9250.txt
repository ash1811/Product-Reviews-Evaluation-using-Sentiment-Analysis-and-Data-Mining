I ordered a large even though my size is a medium, it's best to order a size up, they tend to run small.  I wear them all the time and these have non skid bottoms good for wood floors (so they don't slip).  They wash well - I wash them in a laundry bag and have no problems with them falling apart.  They are very comfy and easy to wear, I've worn them so long the bottoms are starting to wear down, but they aren't separating or coming loose.  The bows on top still look brand new!
