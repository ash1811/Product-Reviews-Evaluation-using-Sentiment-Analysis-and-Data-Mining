These shoes are just perfect for around the house but especially when you need to wear something that wont get ruined when it's raining and you need to take the trash out and especially when washing the dogs.  They stay on because of the way they hug the middle of the foot without being too tight.  The material warms up after a few minutes of wear to conform to your foot.
