i wore these support pantyhose to give my hanes sheer shaping pantyhose some stiff competition, these pantyhose have a nice nylon pantyhose feel and still made my nylon legs feel wonderful after a long, hard day in my high heels. i got home and took my heels off and left my sheer pantyhose on, thats how nice these pantyhose are. these pantyhose hold up very well all day. i still love my hanes silky sheer top pantyhose, and my leggs sheer energy pantyhose, but these no run sheer support nylon pantyhose are another pair of pantyhose to go with my no nonsense pantyhose and my other nylons. going to need another pantyhose and nylon stockings organizer.
