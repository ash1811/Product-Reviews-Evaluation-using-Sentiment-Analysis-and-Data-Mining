I really like this shirt but it's too long from neck to hips. I realize that it's an XL size, but just because someone is stocky or of larger stature, doesn't mean they are 6ft + tall. Will not buy this again just because of that fact. Other than that it's a great shirt. Wears good, fits nicely in the chest area, and look presentable. If you are 6ft + and range from 180 to 220lbs, this shirt should fit you OK.
