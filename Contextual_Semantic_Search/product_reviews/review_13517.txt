I love these Isotoner slippers.  They have a very comfy sole and the sizing was true to size.  Most slippers I found were either too flat or the sole was so thick and spongy I felt like I would topple over!  Not these...they are perfectly comfortable and the sizing was right on.  I liked that they came in several colors.
