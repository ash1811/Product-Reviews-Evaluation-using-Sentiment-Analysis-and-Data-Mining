These shoes are the most comfortable water/hiking shoes I have ever worn.  I ordered my usual size and they fit beautifully.  I plan to use them for white-water rafting and canyon hiking.  They arrived on time and were everything the ad said they would be.  I highly recommend them to anyone wanting this type of shoe.
