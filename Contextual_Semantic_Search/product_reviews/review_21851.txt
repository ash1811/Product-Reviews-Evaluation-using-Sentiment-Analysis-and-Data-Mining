I've learned that companies make varying degrees of quality. And UnderMoments must get the lowest quality! After washing twice these are still the most bumpy, itchy, horrible feeling tshirts I have ever felt!Walmart gets poor quality too...matter of fact I learned while working there that even their lawn mowers are made more cheaply with a few less coats of paint!Anyways...I was HOPING that ordering them on Amazon I would get a higher quality Hanes shirt. Nope. Same cruddy quality that walmart carries.Returning and going to Macys or Dillards for higher quality Hanes.
