I got this one a couple of weeks ago as it was on my b-day wishlist... It seems to be nicely built and of resistant material, however I gave it 3 stars because it is significantly smaller than I expected, it has no zippper to close it in the inside, and because it does not have those convenient inside pockets to hold stuff in... I am uploading some pictures as well for reference...
