This is a true mini pack, good for day use.  I got it for my sister and she uses it as a diaper bag.  It can expand to be roomy, but the material is not great.  String is constantly coming out and the cloth is not durable.  They do not make Jansports like they used to.  I wish it had a side pocket though.
