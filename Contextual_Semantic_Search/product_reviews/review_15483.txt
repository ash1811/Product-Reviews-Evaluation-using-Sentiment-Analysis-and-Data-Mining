I've been buying this size since the 6 mos size, and we are now into the 18 mos.  They are softer and thicker than the other brands, we are very, very pleased.  We like having lots of white, to layer under tee shirts, to use with those monthly number stickers to commemorate 1-12 month growth, etc.  Good quiality, thank you!
