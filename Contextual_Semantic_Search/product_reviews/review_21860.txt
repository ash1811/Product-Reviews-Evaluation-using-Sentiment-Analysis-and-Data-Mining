I needed new undershirts and I obviously went with the v-neck because I don't work in IT. Michael Jordan has been suggesting Hanes shirts are soft through moderate-to-poorly acted one-liners in commercials for years, so I gave these a shot. To be fair, the most recent commercial compares the shirts to a shirt made of kittens, which actually does not sound very comfortable.I was not terribly impressed by the softness of these shirts. They soften up a bit with a couple of washes, but at this price point you can buy CK undershirts at Marshall's that look identical but are much softer. That said, these shirts are completely fine. They are not uncomfortable in any way, you just don't feel like they are luxuriously soft like Michael Jordan would lead you to believe.
