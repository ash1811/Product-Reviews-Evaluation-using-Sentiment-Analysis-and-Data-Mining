WITH AMAZON, MY MOM CAN SHOP FOR ME JUST AS IF SHE WERE AT A STORE BUT SHE CAN'T GO TO A STORE SO THIS ALLOWS HER TO BUY GIFTS FOR ME AND OTHERS THAT SHE WOULDN'T OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO BUY. THIS WAS ANOTHER SUCCESS STORY. IT LOOKS GOOD RIGHT OUT OF THE DRYER AND IS SOFT AND COMFORTABLE TO WEAR. WE LIVE IN A HIGH DESERT AREA AND THIS MATERIAL IS TO BE COMFORTABLE YEAR ROUND. I'VE HAD IT FOR A WHILE NOW AND IT 'S BEEN WASHED MANY TIMES BUT IT HAS NEVER PILLED UP WHICH NOT ONLY LOOKS BAD BUT IS REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE AS WELL. THANKS AMAZON FOR MAKING IT EASY FOR MY MOM TO SHOP FOR ME AND THIS WAY SHE CAN LEAVE AN ITEM IN MY CART AND IF I DON'T REMOVE IT, SHE KNOWS I LIKE IT. IT'S A FOOLPROOF WAY OF GIVING. THERE'S NOT AN ELEMENT OF SURPRISE BUT ALSO NO ELEMENT OF SHOCK - THE GIFT NEVER TURNS OUT BADLY THIS WAY AND THERE ARE USUALLY EVIEWS FROM OTHER CUSTOMERS THAT ONE CAN LOOK THROUGH TO AID IN MAKING A FINAL DECISION. AMAZON IS DEFINITELY THE BEST WAY TO SHOP FOR OUR FAMILY AND THIS SHIRT WAS A GOOD GIFT THAT HASN'T FADED, STILL HAS THE SAME COLOR AS WHEN I FIRST GOT IT AND AS AN ASIDE, THE COLLAR ON THIS SHIRT DOESN'T ROLL LIKE SOME OF THE BRANDS OF POLO SHIRTS I'VE OWNED IN THE PAST.
