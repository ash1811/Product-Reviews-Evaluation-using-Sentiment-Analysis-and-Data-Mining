I like pretty much everything about this watch except that it will take some strength and fingernails with &#34;Hard As Nails&#34; on them to open the catch mechanism.  It comes with an extra large band which will require the removal of some links for anyone except those with huge wrists.  I like mine to hang loose a bit but I still needed a link removed.  The bezel moves with a smooth click to the left to time setting or count downs.
