I bought these earrings last year for a friend on the East Coast, so I haven't seen them yet. The colorful blue topaz stones first caught my eye, and I think the Celtic knot pattern and "dangly" style of the setting enhances their attractiveness.My friend is of Irish heritage, so I felt this pattern would make them more special to her. I became curious about that knot so Googled it to learn more. In case you don't know, Celtic knots are an Irish symbol you'll find everywhere in Ireland from designer jewelery to tattoos worn by rock n' rollers to, of course, the original Book of Kells back in old Dublin. It's not clear that Celtic knot drawings were ever meant to symbolize anything, but lots of modern people think they contain spiritual concepts. The knots are incredibly popular with followers of new age religions, magic societies and all sorts of other groups who want to draw an association with the oldest traditions of Ireland,That said, my friend's husband told me he likes them because they look so good on her and make her blue eyes look even bluer. Isn't that sweet? But most important, my friend loves them...and that's good enough for me!Highly recommended...and the price is right too.Reviewed by Betty Dravis, August 4, 2010Author of "Dream Reachers" (with Chase Von) and other books
