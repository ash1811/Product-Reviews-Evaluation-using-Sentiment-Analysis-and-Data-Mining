If you watch the U-Tube tutorial by Jewelrysupply.com, she covers the use and correct application of "most" of the tools in this kit.I actually went in and did a cost analysis of these same tools at different web sites, and this little toolkit is worth the investment.  I am an avid watch collector -- from expensive to "cheap" and fun watches.  Icould spend a small fortune to keep my little watch wardrobe keeping good time -- thus, the purchase ofthis kit.  The only thing the kit does not have is a piece of LEATHER!!!  Another post here gives excellentadvice on keeping it SAFE.  These tools will damage your thumb on the opposite hand that is holding the watchback; if you slip off and gouge the tool into that finger (thumb) holding the watch case.  BE vigilant!Wear a leather glove on the hand holding the watch back OR, as in the video on U-Tube, use a piece of leatherto hold the watch back and protect that hand holding the watch back -- all it takes is a slip, and you're runningto the emergency room for a wound that you could have avoided.This kit is worth the price.
