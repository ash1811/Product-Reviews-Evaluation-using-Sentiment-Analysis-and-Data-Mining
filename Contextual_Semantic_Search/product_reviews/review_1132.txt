I just ordered more! I bought some at Kohls and loved them. I am tired of lacey underwear falling apart. When I found these on amazon, I ordered more and was just as pleased. They have full coverage and a little bit of style.  If you are wondering about sizing, they are slightly more generous than Victoria secret's sizing.  I wouldn't say 1 whole size larger, but maybe 1/2 a size larger.
