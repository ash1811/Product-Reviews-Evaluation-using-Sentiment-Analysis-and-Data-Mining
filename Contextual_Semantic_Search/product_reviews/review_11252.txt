It's a good backpack.  It's big enough which is important (I returned one about a month ago because it was too small).  I like the 2 compartments on the top to separate 'stuff'. It has lots of zipper compartments, so it takes me a while to find smaller things that I'm looking for, but that's no big deal.  The color makes it stand out a little so I don't mix it up with the zillion black backpacks people have.  All around, it's fine.
