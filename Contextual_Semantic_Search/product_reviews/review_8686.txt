Large enough to hold everything - hairbrush, makeup bag, hair products, medicines, etc. - without being too large in my suitcase!  Its like my entire bathroom packed into one bag!  I liked the bright green color.  Its made of the ripstop material, so I'm hoping it will last for many years to come.  This one is for travel - I keep a fully stocked &#34;personal&#34; bag since I travel a lot.  I love it so much that I'm going to buy another one for the gym.
