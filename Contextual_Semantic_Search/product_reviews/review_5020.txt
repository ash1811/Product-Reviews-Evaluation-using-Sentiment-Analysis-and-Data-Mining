They're very light and fold tiny and probably wash pretty easily, but to be durable they're made of a mesh-like material nested in a coating and chafe slightly when wet/sweaty and rubbed against your skin. They run slightly large, but have a good shape for the crotch (the biggest problem I've seen with the nicer boxer briefs) so the boys have room to breathe but not so loose things get caught in the fly flap.
