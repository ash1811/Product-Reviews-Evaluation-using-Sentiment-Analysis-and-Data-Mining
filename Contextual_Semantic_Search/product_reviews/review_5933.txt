I'm 6' 170 lbs. I figured I'd need a size large, but boy was I mistaken. The large was huge. There's no way I could keep these things from falling off, even with a belt. I should have ordered a medium. Other than that they seem like good pants. Look exactly like what we were issued in the Army when I was in.
