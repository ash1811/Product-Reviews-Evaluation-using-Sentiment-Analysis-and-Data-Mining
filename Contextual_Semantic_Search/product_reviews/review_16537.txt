I bought my husband a pair of these jeans over a year ago, and they still look great and show hardly any wear after multiple washings. They're *much* better quality than regular Wrangler jeans, and can stand many washings. They're heavier (and hotter in the summer) than regular jeans, so keep that in mind when ordering. My husband doesn't mind the extra weight. He loves the fit and the quality.
