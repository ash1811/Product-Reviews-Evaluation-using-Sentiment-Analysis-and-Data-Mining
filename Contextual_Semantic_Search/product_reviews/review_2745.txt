I picked up this Timex model about 6 months ago. I love the velcro strap. It is comfortable and solves the problem of finding the "perfect hole" in most bands. For me the perfect hole never does exist. If my watch is too tight I move to the next hole and then it is loose and rolling around on my wrist, which I can not stand.This T48061 fits me perfectly. It is lightweight to the point of not even realizing you have it on. The module itself is great. Keeps great time, and setting it is a breeze with the prompts you receive on the screen of the watch during setting mode...great feature.I have used it during chainsaw operation, fence building, and various other jobs and it never misses a beat. I actually bought 2 of them so I would have a back up! For the money this is a great Timex!
