I recently broke my foot and was unable to exercise for several months. I gained a good bit of weight, and the band of my bras started to dig in and were very painful. I did not want to buy new bras because I intend to lose the weight over the next few months, so I purchased these bra extenders to give me a little more room around the ribcage. They work like a charm, no more feeling like my bra is cutting through my skin, and I didn't waste money on new bras.
