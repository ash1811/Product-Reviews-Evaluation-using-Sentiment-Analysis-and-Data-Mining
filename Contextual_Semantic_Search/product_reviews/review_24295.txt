I bought this watch to replace an older Timex that had the equivalent features.  My previous one had a stainless steel housing and band, and was more formal looking.  But I have true dress watches, and this was for everyday wear.Compared to my older model, this one has a back that is attached with screws, which I expect would make it easier to change the battery.  It is rated water resistant to a lower depth.  And it has a Velcro band.I can't give a lower rating because of the band, since you can buy a version of this watch with other bands if you want.  The advantage of the band is that you don't have to worry about taking out or inserting links to adjust the size, but you get a less formal band. A cloth band can potentially be irritating, but it has not been a general concern for me.You get an analog and digital display, two time zones (the description says 3 but the instructions and my experience say 2), which I find very convenient for travel, and a chronograph/lap timer, which I find generally useful for timing things. You also get an alarm and a count down timer, so it's easy to figure out how much time has gone by or how much is left.The instructions are a bit cryptic, and it's not always intuitive how to set each function.  But for the ones you use regularly, it should not be a problem to learn.The minute or hour hand will sometimes block the window at the bottom, making it impractical to see the current date. But that might be true of all analog/digital displays.
