I'm a very active person with a 34DDD chest.  I am forever on a search for the perfect bra.  For sports, this is it.  I can wear it in my highest impact activities, and everything stays put.  It's not really attractive, and sure doesn't look great with a spaghetti strap work out top, but it does the job.  Getting into it is a little tricky; you start at the bottom hook and work your way up, adjusting your breasts as you go.  It is supposed to feel tight, so you might think you have the wrong size at first.  But after wearing it for a few minutes it feels comfortable.  ZERO bounce or movement.  Incredible!
