My mother has worn her Cuddl Duds tank tops so badly that they are full of holes and falling apart.  I buy her new tops, but she insists on wearing the old Cuddl Duds ones.  The only way I could get her to toss out the ratty Cuddl Duds tank tops was to buy her the exact same Cuddl Duds tank tops, which I did.  She says they are the softest tank tops and that they fit well, without being tight and constricting.  She's had a mastectomy, so fit & comfort are important to her - and nothing will do except Cuddl Duds.  She's not EVER fussy about clothing like this - so Cuddl Duds should consider her loyalty high praise, indeed.
