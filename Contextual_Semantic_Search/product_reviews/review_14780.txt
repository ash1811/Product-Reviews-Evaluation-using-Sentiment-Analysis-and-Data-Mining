I recommend you buy a size that fits snugly as I tried the terry cloth version in a bigger size and kept walking out of them.  This is my 3rd pair of these.  If I was nicer to them, they would last longer but I wear them every day, throw them in the washer once a week and even wear them outside for simple tasks like bringing in the trash can and getting the mail.  They are very comfortable.  When they wear out the fabric separates from the sole so it's like having socks with holes - likely to snag on something.  For the price, it's a good buy even if I have to replace them every 6 months or so.
