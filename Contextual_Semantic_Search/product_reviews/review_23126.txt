Bought these for my husband to supplement his expensive pair of Maui Jim glasses.  He loves them. Says they are very lightweight, no pressure on his head, and shade his eyes in direct sunlight.  The lenses sometimes come up when he cleans them, but they pop right back in.  They are made well and very sturdy.So worth the money, would buy again for sure.
