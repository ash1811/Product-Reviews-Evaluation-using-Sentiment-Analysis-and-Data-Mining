I consider this to be a mid quality cincher.  $40 is not a bad price for what you get...except do not expect the garters to hold up your stockings ...not only does it come undone a thousand times a day from your stockings, but the garter hooks come unhooked from the cincher as well.  Yes, a double wammy.  I will use it as a cincher alone.  Does anyone make proper garters anymore.
