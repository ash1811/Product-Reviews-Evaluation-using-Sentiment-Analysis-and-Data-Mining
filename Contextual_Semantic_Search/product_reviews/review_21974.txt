I am 68, because of some medical procedures I don't bend at the middle real well so putting on shoes can be a task. These are comfortable, I can just slip them off. I wear them to work, when they get old I wear them around the house, do chores unless I'm going to do heavy work and don't want my heel slipping, but other than that I really like them.
