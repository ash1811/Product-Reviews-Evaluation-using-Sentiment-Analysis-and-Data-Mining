I bought these not realizing heavy they were.Extremely well made and for truly harsh snowareas like Vermont, NH or elsewhere. I do notneed such a heavy boot for an entire winter.But they are an excellent choice and priced right.I sent them back because i live in Rhode Island.My area doesn't require such an extensive boot!
