I put this on the day it came and haven't taken it off yet!  I like the look...simple and sparkles just a little due to the twist in the chain.  It was just what I wanted.  It looks good with an additional bracelet if wanted as it fits snug to the ankle but not too tight for me.  I have trouble with sizes and this one "just fits".  I'm not sure how long it will last wearing it non-stop but so far so good!
