Having had my last wallet for over ten years, it was difficult for me to move into a new wallet.  I read the customer reviews of this wallet and was convinced to try this one.  The wallet arrived quickly and is exactly what I was looking for.  Lots of room for everything that I stuff into my wallet.  The leather is nice.  You can't beat the price.  The only drawback..and it is a tiny one, is there is not a plastic check divider to keep your written information from showing on checks below the one you are writing.  But that is easily fixed.  I am very happy with this wallet..
