The Bali bras always fit me nicely.  It fits so comfortably that I can barely tell I have it on.  The ONLY criticism is that there is no padding in the cups, and when you're slightly overweight and over the age of 50, AND you have a T-shirt or smooth knit top on.....just fill in the rest.  I detest that look on anybody, but the bra is lovely and the fit is perfect for me.
