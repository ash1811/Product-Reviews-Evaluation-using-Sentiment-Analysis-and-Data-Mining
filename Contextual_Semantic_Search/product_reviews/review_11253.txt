I bought this a year ago when I decided to go back to college. It is very lightweight, but sturdy. Still looks new. The zippers still work great, and the fabric has held up well. I only use it 2 days a week, and it is packed full of books. The straps are comfortable. I just wish that there were mesh holders on both sides, not just one (perfect for the larger sport water bottles)
