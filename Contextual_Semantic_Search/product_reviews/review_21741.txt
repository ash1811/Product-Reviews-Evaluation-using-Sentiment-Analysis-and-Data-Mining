I think these pants are wonderful. They fit wonderfully. Have the standard complement of pockets that I so want in my pants. I bought khaki verson of this same pants and have been pleased with the two I own. what I like about the Military style products is how long they last. I still wear a set of BDUs that are ten years old. They seem to get more comfortable with age. I finally trashed two other BDU pants that I was wearing during extreme sport of Hang Gliding. And yes I have had some very hairy landings. But they lasted me 12 years before becoming thread worn. Talk about VALUE.
