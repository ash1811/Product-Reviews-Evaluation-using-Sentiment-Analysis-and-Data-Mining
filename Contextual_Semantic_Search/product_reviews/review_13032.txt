I bought this bra primarily because of its beauty, but I was very impressed with its comfort and fit.  Since it doesn't have a satiny/slippery outer shell, it may bind the front of a tee top, under a silky or woven cotton top, that shouldn't be an issue.  This is the perfect undergarment for a bride, or to feel like a bride again!
