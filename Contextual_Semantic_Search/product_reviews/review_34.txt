I really enjoy the Rosetta Stone software; it's easy and fun to use.  The Rosetta Stone "dynamic immersion" method is different than traditional methods where you see a word in English and then see a word in the new language to memorize.  L'&eacute;tude du franais est r&eacute;ellement amusement et facile!
