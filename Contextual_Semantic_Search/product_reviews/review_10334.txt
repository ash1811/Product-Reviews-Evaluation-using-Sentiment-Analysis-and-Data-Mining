This is just a standard cheap shirt.  I paid $5 for it so I wasn't expecting much.  It's about the quality you would expect from a giveaway polo shirt.  It looks nice enough to wear to work but you'd want an undershirt as it's a little scratchy.  Not sure how it will hold up as I've only worn and washed it once, but you can't really go wrong for such a cheap purchase price.
