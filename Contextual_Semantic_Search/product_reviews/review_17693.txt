I have worn princess reeboks in the past but always in white. It has been years since I purchased a pair and I need comfy shoes more than ever. I am having trouble breaking them in because they fit tight across the front. I ordered a wide width but not a good shape overall for my feet. I had already worn them outside could not return. They were not a good fit for me.
