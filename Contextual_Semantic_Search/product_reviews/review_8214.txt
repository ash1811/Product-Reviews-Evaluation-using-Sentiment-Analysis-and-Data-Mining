I ordered this watch a month ago.  The first day I wore it, 3 hours in, it no longer worked.  I had to return it and repurchase another.The new one came in and I love it.  It looks great and is very sturdy.  I will be using this watch as my daily wearer as it feels like it has enough metal and strong crystal to stand up to most anything and looks visibly pleasing.It is an easy to set watch and has been accurate.  The cyclops magnifies the date @ about 1.5x (not the 2.5x that I prefer). It is a normal size watch.  I adjusted the band using this http://www.amazon.com/SE-Watchband-Link-Remover-Tool/dp/B000HDJT6Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1329416752&sr;=8-1 and it worked perfectly (a jeweler wanted $20...)Overall I would recommend this to friends.
