I purchased this as a diaper bag to use for my daughter and new son.  The front pockets are ideal for diapers and the side pockets can hold all manner of things you need to carry around for a 3 year old and a newborn.  The inner pocket is huge and perfect for toys and a wallet so you don't have to carry a diaper bag and a purse.  The material is very strong, I look forward to actually being able to use this bag for a long time and even after I don't need it as a diaper bag anymore.  The price is perfect considering I've owned $20 bags that are meant to be diaper bags and they just fall apart on you after a couple of months, I don't see that happening with this one and on another plus side it is unisex so my husband won't feel silly wearing it.  The color is nice also. Very happy with my purchase.
