they made this bra smaller and the cups smaller and the cups also make my boobs look pointy, what happened and why have they changed? and mine is not 95% cotton either so the material has changed too!!! Don't buy these, I think I am returning them for false claims, the cotton content is not the same and the bra is not as comfortable!!It gives that uni-boob look, it is very comfortable and holds the girls in place so they are not bouncing along but I sure wish it was made so it would separate instead of forcing them together.
