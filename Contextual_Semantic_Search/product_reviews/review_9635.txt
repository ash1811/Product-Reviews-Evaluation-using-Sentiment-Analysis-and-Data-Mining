wow these are great! I'm a size 34, and I ordered a size 34, they fit a little tight around the waist, but I think after break in, they will mold just fine to me.  They are strong, thick, and super comfy, real high quality jeans.  They simply don't make jeans like this anymore, and I'm glad I followed all the reviewers and ordered a pair.  Definitely my favorite jeans now.  They are definitely slim, and squeeze all over where it counts, but they are extremely comfortable at the same time.  Highly recommend!
