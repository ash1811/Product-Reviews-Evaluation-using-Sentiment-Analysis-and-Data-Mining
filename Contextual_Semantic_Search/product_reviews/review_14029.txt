The quality of this product is good as one would expect for Lee brand jeans. The color is as pictured. The fit was right-on. Delivery was prompt, and the price was good.  I was especially excited to find the odd 29&#34; length available. My jeans usually ride low so the cuffs drag the ground. With the inch shorter length, these fit perfectly.
