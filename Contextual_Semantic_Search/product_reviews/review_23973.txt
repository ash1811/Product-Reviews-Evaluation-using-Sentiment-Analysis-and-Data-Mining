My husband is an ER nurse, and his ER requires nurses wear navy-colored scrubs.  Dark colors fade so badly. We've tried cheaper scrubs to save money. Unfortunately, they faded horribly and didn't seem to look as good as long as these scrubs do.  He's been an RN 12 years now, and despite trying several of the cheaper brands to save money, we've always come back to these, and think these wear the longest and keep their color the best.
