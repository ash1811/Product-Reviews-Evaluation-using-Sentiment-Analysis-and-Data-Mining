I am rating this product as satisfactory.  These do not seem like original levis.  The material is much thinner than previous pairs however they do fit well.  I like jeans to be a little big.  I ordered an inseam 30 and these were more on the line of 32.  But no problem, a trip to the tailor fixed it.  They are comfortable jeans but be aware they are not the quality one would expect from Levi Strauss.
