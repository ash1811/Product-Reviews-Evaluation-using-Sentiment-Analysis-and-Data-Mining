I must've orderd a half dozen pair of livs over th past few months, and none of them fit the same, none of them made in the same country and none made here in the USA. I find it disappointing and problematic. I love shopping on Amazon, but this type of inconsistant fit makes it very difficult to shop here for levi's. Thank goodness Amazon will refund you gladly, but must caost them a fortune on shipping charges. Im still trying to find that majic fit.
