For such a simple style of shoe.. I am awfully picky about my flip flops.  I don't like them when the straps are &#34;too thin&#34; because they dig into the tops of my feet.  I feel the same way about them if the straps are too stiff or hard like the cheap rubber versions.. or even the expensive embroidery on leather versions!  I don't like the soles that are so thin you feel every pebble under your feet or so thick or wedged that they become unstable when walking.  I also am not a fan of the fabric footbeds since those get dirty so easily.  I live in the country.. so I wear these on dirt and gravel roads. and in the grass.. so shoes that will stand a little dust get a bonus nod from me.So.. when I saw these.. and read the reviews.. I was a little concerned.  Some people found them slippery when they were wet.  I guess they must be wearing them actually &#34;IN&#34; the water because I walked my dog in them this morning in the rainsoaked grass down a steep hill and they didn't get overly slippery for me.I have to say that the first time I slipped these on.. I could hear my feet sigh with relief.  These have such a lovely cushion to them!  The straps seem sturdy and were wide enough to provide support.  I just didn't want to take them off.. but I had to mow the grass.. something I can't do in flip flops.. but as soon as that was done.. these babies were back on my feet.The fit was also good.  I have always been a size 8.. with the occasional 8.5 if a shoe is cut small.. or if I need it for the widgh.  I have wider feet and a high instep.. which is probably why I am picky on the straps.  These shoes fit comfortably.. and my whole foot did fit on the sole.. so they should be stable too.  I really love the way they feel.. and fit.  Definitely worth the price!
