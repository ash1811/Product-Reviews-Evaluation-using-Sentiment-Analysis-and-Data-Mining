Be aware that this watch uses a Silver Oxide (371/370) battery with a lifespan of about 3-years if the battery was &#34;fresh&#34; when you purchased the watch.  Forget about changing the battery and maintaining the water resistance.  I succeeded in changing the battery, but after working about 30 minutes trying to get the o-ring back in the groove and the cover on, I gave up.  The o-ring was stretched a bit with age and you would need a new one too with a replacement battery to complete the full reassembly.The watch is cheap enough to throw it out out when the battery dies.  Besides, after 3 years the watch band becomes brittle and usually cracks.  If you want a more reliable watch with a longer lasting battery, buy a Lithium model.  They cost more, but I have a Casio Lithium model for close to 10 years now and it's still running fine.Bottom line: I was able to reassemble the watch with the new battery, sans o-ring, so it is not water resistant now, but it works.
