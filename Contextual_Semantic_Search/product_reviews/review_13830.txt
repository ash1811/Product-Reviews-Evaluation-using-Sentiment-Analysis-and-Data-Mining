i am really happy with this jacket, i read the reviews and ordered a size smaller than normal and it fits great. its not fitted or snug in any way its a little roomy but i feel if i went down even another size it would be too small. the material is great and its put together very well. this can definitely take a beating and keep going. i even have my friends asking where i got it !!!
