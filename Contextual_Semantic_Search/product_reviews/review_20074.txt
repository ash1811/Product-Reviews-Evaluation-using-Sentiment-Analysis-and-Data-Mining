I was SOOOO excited to get my Docs but when I put them on, this UK 7 was NOT the same as my old UK 7 from over 10 years ago.  They fit more like what I would consider a UK 6.5, even though there is no such thing.  I can only figure that this is because these are made in China and not England like my originals.  I got the pink tartan, and while I do like them they look a bit like wellies (rain boots).  They are really really stiff, whereas my old Docs did not have any break-in period.  I have yet to decide if I am keeping them, because I fear the UK 8 will be too big.  Just for reference, I am a women's 9.5-10 (US men's 8) and a solid 41 Euro size.  I wish these were more like a standard Euro 41 than a bit smaller than that.
