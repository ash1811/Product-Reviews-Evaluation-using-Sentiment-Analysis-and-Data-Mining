I have many pairs of shoe trees, and I like this style the best. They are spring loaded, which keeps pressure against the leather. This allows the sweat moistened leather to form back into shape, and prevents unsightly creases at the toe of the shoe. I use this specific pair on my Allen Edmonds Park Avenues, and they work just fine. I am a size 10.5/11, and the sizing chart was true to size.
