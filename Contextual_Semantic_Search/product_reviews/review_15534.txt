I bought these for my twins, but was disappointed in how they shrink in length, but remain boxy and wide.  The neck is HUGE and my twins seem to sport an 80s Flashdance look when they wear these--one shoulder is always bare.  The fabric is soft or I would have rated it one star.  I wouldn't buy again.
