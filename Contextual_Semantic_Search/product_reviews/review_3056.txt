I lost weight, so ordered these, a size (2 inches) smaller than my last pair. Now I will say that Dickies pants run small. My waist was about 42 when I ordered the 44's. Now my waist is about 39 or 40, and these 42's fit fine. The only reason I'm not giving these pants five stars is that one of my last pair, having only been worn a few times, lost the zipper pull when unzipping them. I mean it came right off in my hand and now I can't find it of course and don't know how to fix it, or if it can even be fixed, or if it's worth what it would cost to have someone fix it. It's the first time this has happened. It did NOT happen with this particular blue pair, yet. Hopefully it will not. I love these pants in general for many reasons, not the least of which is the fact that they are kind of stain proof and even slightly water resistant. I did notice that these seemed too short, however, while the 44/32's I ordered in the past were too long. There is no option in between so next time I will order the 32 length as I can cuff them up, that is fine with me.
