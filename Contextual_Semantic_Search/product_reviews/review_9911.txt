PROS:-Unbeatable value for money-Excellent quality, will not shrink or loose color in the laundry.-Comfortable to wear.CONS:-XXL may have been designed for folks with a large gut, not so much body builder-types. I lift weights, and have large shoulders and pecs, and big arms, but a 34&#34; waist. Above my abdomen, this is a perfect fit. However, pectorals down, it really flows like a maternity dress and does look a bit odd! XL is a perfect fit around my gut, but then the chest and shoulder areas are too tight. Since these won't break the bank, I recommend you try one of each size before placing any sort of bulk order!
