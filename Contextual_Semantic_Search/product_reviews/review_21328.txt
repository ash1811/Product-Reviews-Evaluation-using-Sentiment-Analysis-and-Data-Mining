I bought a pair in brown, as I have a black pair that are great.  The brown color of the pair I received is quite different than the pictures - a lot lighter, except for the center part of the toe which is the darker pictured color.  So, I got a pair of light brown shoes with a big dark stripe down the middle. Ugly.As for this model of Clarks, they're great, sturdy oxfords for work, can go either casual or fairly dressy with them. I've had my black pair for years and they still wear great. Just don't order them in brown.
