The watch does everything I expected it to do.  It has a wide face with a stainless steel bezel over a titanium body.  I've owned many of the best and this watch compares with any of the lot.  The only fault I found was the small watchband which easily can be replaced (which I did).  As far as set up, it's a snap for those who own Blancpain or any other high quality chronometer to set the watch.  You get what you pay for...Addendum  After a year my review is pretty much the same.  BUT, the crystal has pitted and scratched to a point I'll have to have it replaced.  You can bet I won't skimp on price.  I want a sapphire crystal!!
