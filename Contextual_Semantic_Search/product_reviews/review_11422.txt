What can I say about this watch that haven't been said yet?... It's a great watch, nice looking, heavy construction, easy to set up (just need to read the manual for a few minutes), really classy and elegant appearence, beautifull blue dial and details in the face markers. there isn't much to add, just buy it, it's a winner!!!
