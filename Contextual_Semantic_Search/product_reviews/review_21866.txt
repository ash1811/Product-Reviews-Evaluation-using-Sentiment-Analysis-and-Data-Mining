Bought this twice - Once in infant size and then for my one year old toddler. Great swim-diaper that is not bulky at all; white so it suits both sexes; and cheap enough that you make your money back just going a couple of times to the pool - one pack of swim diapers costs about the same, if not more, and they do not sell those all year round in stores near me.... Plus that side opening - golden! If they ever do decide to poop - think quick access without pulling the poop off over their legs (sorry to be so explicit, but hey if you are a parent, you know exactly what I am talking about).
