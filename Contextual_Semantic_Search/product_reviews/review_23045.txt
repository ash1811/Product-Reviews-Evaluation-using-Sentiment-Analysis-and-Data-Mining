I own 23 pairs of Birkenstocks (sandals and clogs).  I always get either leather or suede. The shoes fit true to size.  I get size 11M or 42 for sandals and size 43 in clogs so that I can wear heavy socks with them for winter.  I can also wear the 11m clogs with a reg. pair of socks.  They hold up very well.  My oldest pair is about 30 years old.  I have had them resold once.  Great value.
