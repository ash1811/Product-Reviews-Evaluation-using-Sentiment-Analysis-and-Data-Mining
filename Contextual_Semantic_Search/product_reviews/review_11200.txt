Very solid construction; I am not sure who could actually wear these out! Sorta' nice looking, if you like to have duck feet! Lol, I have a very narrow heel and wide toe box so I do look like I am wearing paddles! Much prettier deeper black than in pic; and very bright yellow stitching; so nice looking...comfort: wore them around the house; now please note that my R foot is an entire size larger than left; need toe fusion on R; so my right foot was hurting but it hurts in everything so not really an issue. The more I wear them; the better that seems to get. I wear an 8.5-9; but did not have to size up. Plenty of room in the toe box. My right foot has been sweating in these; not quite sure why because my feet don't ever sweat! The material inside is hard plastic?!, with grippies on bottom and I find the grippies quite comfy.Overall, I like these shoes and believe I will like them more-the more I wear them; I think they will be great for summer! And...having odd feet; not really caring how they actually look on my feet; I need to find shoes that my AAA ankles won't walk out of; and that have toe box room!  Recommend!
