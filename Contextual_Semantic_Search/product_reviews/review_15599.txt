Very disappointed with this item.  I'm returning it.  The one pro is that yes, it does pact relatively flat.  But it does this by sacrificing space over my current hanging bag which has lasted at least a decade (seems to be generic, I can't find a brand on my old bag unfortunately to recommend it).  This is nowhere near that quality.  The pockets aren't that well designed, not impressed with the zipper, and as other reviewers have noted it has a small hook to hand (but that's typical).  Not recommended.
