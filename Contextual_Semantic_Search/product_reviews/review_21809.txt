This is a good utility bag, but don't leave it in the sun.  I did for a few days, and ended up with a mulit-colored bag, as the green fades very quickly in direct sunlight into a yellowish tone.  Otherwise, with the addition of some silicone spray for waterproofing, I was happy with the bag for its intended purpose.
