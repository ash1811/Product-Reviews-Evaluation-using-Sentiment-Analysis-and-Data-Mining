My son wanted to be a trooper for halloween so I bought him this costume, it is well made and will last a few years. I llike how the feet covers the shoes. I had to cut the plastic on the mask so that he could see better, this was not as easy as it sounds. I had to use tin snips because the plastic was so hard.
