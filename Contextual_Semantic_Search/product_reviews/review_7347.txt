Bought this for my husband for a Valentine's Day dance a few months back.  It fit him beautifully, was a gorgeous color, and held up thru a night of partying.I washed it by hand and hung it on a hanger to dry for the next time.  Whenever something has such a vibrant color, you do a diservice to the fabric by machine washing.  I also try to stay away from dry cleaning and chemicals used, as my own personal health and environmental protection commitment.
