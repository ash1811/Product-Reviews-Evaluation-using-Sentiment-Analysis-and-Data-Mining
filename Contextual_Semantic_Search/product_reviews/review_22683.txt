I can't give it 5 stars, it's not perfect.I have a lot of watch tools, and this is a nice one.  The case is nice, and it works as it should.But, again, it's not perfect.  The pins don't stay in, making it harder to use (you have to use it upside down, and the pins don't lock in).  And there should be instructions for those who don't know exactly how to use it.  The little half-sheet that is included is all but useless.But it's a great deal for the price.  Easily opens the notch-back cases I use it on.
