I am in LOVE with these boots! They fit great and are oh-so comfortable. I bought these to wear because they are so versatile and go with absolutely everything. I have worn them with shorts, jeans and they look great with dresses! Now that I own a pair of Ariat boots, I am hooked!!! The only odd thing about the boots is the way they size them. I normally wear a 9.5, but I had to get these in a 9.5 wide because the fit is so narrow.
