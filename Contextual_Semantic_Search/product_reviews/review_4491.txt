I knew this was a great casual everyday shirt. But for my size (XXL), this shirt is too big. You may want to buy 1-2 sizes down your own size to be sure that it fits perfectly. Also I selected XXL in the order page but what I got was 2XL. I don't know if they are the same size with only different labeling, but I assumed it to be. Will be ordering a new one soon with a smaller size.
