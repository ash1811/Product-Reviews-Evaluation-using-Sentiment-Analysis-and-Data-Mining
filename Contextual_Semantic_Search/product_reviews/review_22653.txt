I love this watch. Has been accurate and working fine since I got it. Be aware though that this is quite a large, heavy watch. I measured and it is almost 3/4 inches thick with a very large face. It took some getting used to. It seemed too heavy on my wrist at first, but I am used to it now and it is quite comfortable. The band cannot be changed without a special adapter. Not a big deal to me. This is an awesome watch and definitely grabs attention. The crystal is protected as the outer ring is higher. This is one great watch for the money. The Eco drive is awesome. I love this watch. It is a tank and seems indestructible.
