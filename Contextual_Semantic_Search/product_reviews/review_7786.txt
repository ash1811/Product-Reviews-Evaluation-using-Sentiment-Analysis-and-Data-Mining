I ordered a years supply of these briefs through Amazon and I was so glad they could actually deliver these to Singapore. The first thing I noticed was the price. I ordered 10 packs of these all in white. These are less than half the price the shops are charging her in Singapore. Two, even with the delivery charge they are sooooo cheap. Three, these are simply the most comfortable briefs I've ever worn. I'm 24 and I was afraid they would make me look like Iwas wearing "old man's underwear". The answer is no. These briefs are great. I'm quite slim and I wear these to work under jeans and I don't know I'm wearing them. They also look great with jeans and no shirt. The waist bad is cool for "saggin" when I skateboard as well. I also wear these to bed and the feel is so hot as well. They are not only great to wear everyday, they are also cool to wear around the house. When I wear these they actually look quite sexy as well. I wash these and then put them through a dryer cycle and they stay nice and white and maintain their shape and appeal. I really like these a lot and I will definitely be purchasing more in the future. Ive had no trouble with the wiastband either. These are not only for older guys. If you are under 30 guys, these are really awesome underwear. The size is perfect as well. I'm a 34 normally. I like my underwear on the larger (roomier) size so I bought size 36. Do yourself a favour and purchase these. These are also better than the CK Low Rise Briefs. I had the CK Low Rise Briefs before and they kind of lost there shape after a while. These CK Basic Briefs do not. Young guys, surfers, skateboarders should purchase these. They're awesome. If my girlfriend likes them - I do as well. Buys these and you won't be disappointed. Finally, don't get these too small. Get them in your normal size or the next size up (if you need more room for jewels!!???). Enjoy these. PS - The white ones are simply awesome.
