I ordered these shoes to take with me to Europe to wear with my black Chico's traveler pants.  Unfortunately the shoes were not substantial enough to wear for the trip.  There is little arch support and the shoe would not tolerate an orthotic insert.  The leather was nice and the shoe is great for a narrow foot.  True to size.
