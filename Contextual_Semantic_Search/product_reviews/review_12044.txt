The shoe is decent.  It lasted 3 months before stitch fraying started to show which I burned off.  I know I should rotate shoes, but this was an emergency purchase and I only got one pair.  While I walk commute morning/evening a few blocks, I'm sitting the rest of the day.  Still, I've had shoes worn daily last much longer, thus the 4 stars.  On one shoe, the heel is starting to pull away from the leather.  No, I don't 'kick' my shoes off.  It could be this one pair.So, while a decent quality shoe... it appears the stitching & gluing could be improved.  This is end of month 3 in the shoe and I'm looking for a replacement.
