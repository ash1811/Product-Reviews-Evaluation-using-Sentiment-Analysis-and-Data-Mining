I like to use these muscle shirts in the place of the more standard undershirts. However one of the chief things I want is for them to be able to tuck into my pants. I'm fairly tall and have a long torso, so these shirts came to just above my belly button. Not long enough to tuck. Other than that I can't badmouth the quality.
