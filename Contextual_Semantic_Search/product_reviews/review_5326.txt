I know there are ratings for this product that are not as favorable, but I truly love this necklace. It isn't as heavy as another rope chain that I have, but it fits the pendant much better. Others have commented on its lightweight, but unless you are planning on wearing it all day and night, around babies, or other occasions which would cause it to be constantly pulled on (and I don't mean a light tug), it is heavy enough for wear.
