This is a nice chain to go with my marcasite pendant.  It deserves a 3.5 for its price and appearance. I got the 16 inch which works perfectly.  However, the chain thickness is a little small.  I would've preferred a 3-4 mm chain and that was my fault.  I was so excited about the reviews that I overlooked its thickness is 2 mm.  Buying the correct length of chain is key.  If your neck size is 17", the absolute shortest length you should buy is a 20" chain.
