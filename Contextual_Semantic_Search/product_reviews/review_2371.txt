I needed an inexpensive watch to wear when in business attire and I normally have terrible issues with watches because my wrists are so small. However, this watch is absolutely wonderful. The band has an adjusting clasp that moves smoothly down the band.  There are little grooves for the clasp to grasp (didn't mean to rhyme) so it doesn't slide if too much pressure is put on it. The actual clasps are intertwined so double the protect. You do not need to worry about catching it on something and the watch falling off without noticing.  In general, the design is simple but elegant. THe black face with the small white cystals make it very sytlish. I'm extremely please with this product.
