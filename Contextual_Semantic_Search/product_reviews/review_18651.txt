Love, love, love this watch!  This is a watch design that I have repeatedly purchased since 1976!  My first watch was a Seiko, one of the first battery-powered versions that cost over $100 - an enormous sum to me at the time - but I was treating myself as the result of a promotion!  That watch lasted until the early 2000's - over 25 years!  A jeweler told me it would cost as much as the original watch to repair.  So, when I saw an identical watch offered for sale by Timex - and with an Indiglow feature, no less! -I immediately purchased it and have been doing so ever since!  I've owned three Timex versions over the past 13 years.  I could not find this exact watch (in silver) the last time I was in the market for a replacement.  Until I saw it on Amazon!  I was so delighted to find the watch in my favorite silver color that I ordered it immediately!  The Timex Indiglow feature is great for seeing the time in a dark place or during the night. I will definitely buy it again!  In fact, I'm thinking about ordering another for &#34;inventory&#34; so that I won't have to be concerned about finding it again!
