This swim diaper is perfect for my 4 month old baby. I love the fact that I can just stick it in the washer and don't have to fuss with disposable swim diapers. Plus, the fit was perfect. I plan to buy a larger size as my baby gets bigger because I can't imagine going back to disposable swim diapers.
