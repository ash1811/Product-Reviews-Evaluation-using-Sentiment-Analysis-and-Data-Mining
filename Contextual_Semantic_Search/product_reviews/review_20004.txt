I bought this vest for camping, hunting and other outdoor activities.  I got a size large so it will fit everyone in the family even if it's a little big on me and the older kids, and so far it's been a great purchase.It zips up the front, and the material is lightweight and breathable but not cheap.  There are so many pockets - 17 of them!  Some of them zip shut, some velcro, and some just have flaps.  There's a little patch of fake sheep's wool to hold fishing flies, but I took that off.  There's also a huge pocket on the back, which I think will be perfect for a folded rain poncho.  This is similar to the vest I've been admiring at Gander Mountain for $40, so I was happy to find it cheaper here on Amazon with free Prime shipping.The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I discovered once I had it that it's made in China.  I try to support American industries when I can, although I do buy foreign when there's nothing else available.  But I like to have the information to choose before I buy.
