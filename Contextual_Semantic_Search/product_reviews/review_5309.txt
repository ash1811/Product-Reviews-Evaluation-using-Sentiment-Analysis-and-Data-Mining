These pants were a bit of a suprise because the sizing chart was correct! (If you've bought clothes on Amazon it always seems to be somewhat of a dice roll). They are a touch long in the legs, but I am a weird size when it come to pants, however the leg cinches allow you to tighten extra material at the ankles or around boots etc.  The waist was spot on.Two storage pockets along your legs will allow you to carry light items/gear which is very handy, and the overall material seems sturdy. I have admittedly only worn them once so far, and will be using these primarily for hunting in the upcoming falls season(s). I am however considering both another pair of these, and ones of other colors. Examining the stitching I can see a few areas that may require reinforcement but overall the stitching does appear sound. They are well worth the money.
