I purchased this bag in black; It looks very nice. The cellphone pocket is used for business cards and glasses. One pocket carries my wallet and keys and the other pocket carries my Ipod and associated cords. There is a side pocket that carries my small cell phone. I wanted a bag that could carry my day to day stuff but not be two big.  The bag is well constructed, with no flaws.
