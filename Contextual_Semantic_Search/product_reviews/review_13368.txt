The price is about 100$. I expect 30$ sunglasses to be less comfortable. That is not the case. I tried to use for driving also. The problem is the glasses protect only the front of your eyes so sunlight on driver's side reaches eyes without obstacles.Probably they're fashionable. But not comfortable.
