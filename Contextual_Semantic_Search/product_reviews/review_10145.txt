This shirt is great!  I can't stand not having a breast pocket, thats why people rarely see me in a plain T-Shirt.  The material is very soft and feels high quality.  When they say tall, they mean it.  I actually ordered a little large expecting some shrinkage after washing and drying.. but it never shrank!  Thats not a bad thing, now I know to order true to size next time.  The color held up well for some reason.  I wash my clothes pretty hard, and somehow the dark blue still looks nice and didn't fade out.  I use this mostly as a gym shirt in the fall and it is always comfortable...  I think I can openly say that this is the most comfortable pocketed T-Shirt i've ever purchased.
