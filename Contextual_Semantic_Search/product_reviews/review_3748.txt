I have worn the same pant size for the last 20 years, give or take.  When I got these jeans, they were very, very oversized.  I would have needed to order two sizes down in both waist and length for them to fit, even after some warm water and dryer time.  Other than the sizing, however, they are comfortable and look nice.  I just have to wear a belt with them.
