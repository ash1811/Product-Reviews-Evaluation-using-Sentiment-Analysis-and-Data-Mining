I'm a pretty big guy (6'5&#34; and about 300lb) and built like a football center.Changing from hanes, fruit of the loom, whatever these things are awesome... I can crawl around in attics, in 100 degree weather, sweating my ... off.. and these still keep me dry and don't chafe one bit. They dont ride up, or anything...These boxers fit great, feel great, and I actually ordered I think 4 more, which is enough to get through the work week... I find myself asking my girlfriend to wash them because I dont wat to wear any of the entire drawer full of other brands I have lol. Bought some for my son because he kept going commando and didnt like how his underwear fit, he loves them.CONS: None, as long as you follow instructions. Dont be like my girlfriend and dry them lol. The first 2 pairs I bought are now very &#34;snug&#34;... the other 2 (line-dry) fit perfectly and dry very quickly on their own. LOL
