Following a new fad to purchase the kind of socks that invariably can keep feet warm I bought the Wigwam Men's Merino/Silk Hiker, Charcoal, X-Large socks. Chose the X-Large for experience tells me that after the first wash, like many articles of clothing specially socks, they tend to shrink somewhat. They did, but having purchased the larger offering I ended with the right size. These socks are very warm and their built is top notch. I guess that is why they cost so much more than most other socks. I can see where they would come in very handy if the elements were at their harshest in the cold department. This is the first of this type that I personally have purchased. The last time I remember using something similar was in the good ole US Army, the very best army in the world as far as I am concerned, and I was able to keep warm there for a while in one of the most difficult areas to keep warm. 4 Stars.
