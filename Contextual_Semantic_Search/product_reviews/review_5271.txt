This watch is close to perfect, I have one for daily wear and the "rubber" band version for exercise.  I prefer analog, and the bonus is the large digital date, easy to read dual alarms and countdown timer.  I use them all regularly, though I normally leave the date display off. The 42 lap timer is also magnificently readable, I just don't need it much.This watch is so much better than those tiny six point type digital displays hidden in the face of a typical analog watch. I NEED to use the date and I can't see those small ones without glasses.My only criticism, and it's minor, is that the watch is notably heavy.
