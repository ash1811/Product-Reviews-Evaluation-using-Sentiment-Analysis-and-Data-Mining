These socks are attractive and well-made with comfortable padding. I was afraid my feet would get too hot while hiking in 85 weather because the socks are pretty thick, but the Coolmax material does its job. My feet were comfy the entire four-hour hike and I had no blisters or soreness. It's worth noting that these are one of the few kinds of hiking socks offered that contain NO wool, not even Smartwool. This is a bonus to me because my socks won't deteriorate with repeated use and washing.
