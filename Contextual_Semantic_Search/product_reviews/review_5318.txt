I only wear Sterling Silver. I am not a fan of gold, I will wear white gold and platinum, but Sterling Silver is reasonable priced and affordable. this ring is beautiful, you can't tell by the picture but the amber actually sparkles. This is the first time I have bough Amber and I love it. I only wish I could afford the ear rings and bracelet.
