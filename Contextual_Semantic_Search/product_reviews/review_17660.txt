This is the only tennis shoe my husband will wear.  I didn't know they were cheaper online rather than the retail stores.  I received free shipping and handling so I didn't pay alot for them.  They will last him for years.  The size was correct, the shoe is the original Reebok that first came out is the reason they call it Classic.
