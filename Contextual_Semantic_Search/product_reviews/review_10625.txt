Based on the other reviews here, I figured this must fit very small, like junior's sizing.  I wear a size 10 women's (or an 8 at a more expensive store), so I bought an XL so it wouldn't be too tight, but it's too baggy.  I should have purchased a large instead.  So, if you're a size 10, choose size L.  Overall a pretty shirt, just too baggy.
