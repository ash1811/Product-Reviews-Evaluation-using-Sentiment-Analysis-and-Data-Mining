These are hands down the most comfortable shoes you will ever wear. Unlike other flip flops your feet do not slide around in them when they are wet. They have a huge amount of cushion to them, and you can walk over anything, gravel, etc...without feeling anything through your shoes. You will want to wear them every day!
