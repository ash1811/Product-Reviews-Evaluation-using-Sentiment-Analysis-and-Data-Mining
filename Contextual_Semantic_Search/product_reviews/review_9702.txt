The 6-12 month size are a little loose on my daughter who's just about 6 months but already wears 9 month size in most brands.  I'm able to fold over the cuff and they still stay on so it's not so bad.  They should fit just right about when she starts walking so the non-skid pads are a nice touch.  Like other baby clothes that try to span 6-12 months, just wish they split it into 6-9 and 9-12.
