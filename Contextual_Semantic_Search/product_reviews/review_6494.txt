The toast color is a bit coppery but I love them anyways:) you look like you have Barbie legs, I would recommend sizing up; according to the chart I would have been on the end of the A but I decided to get C since I would need them for a lot of flexibility and they work great! Quality is very good compared to regular tights, I also got them in black and light toast. This will be the brand I buy for tights from now on.
