I ordered the bra in my regular size (34G) and it's far too tight. The bra really digs in on the sides and was extremely uncomfortable. My breasts also squeezed out of the top a bit creating the dreaded quadra-boob. The style is great if you're looking for a t-shirt bra but that's only true assuming you can guess the right size...
