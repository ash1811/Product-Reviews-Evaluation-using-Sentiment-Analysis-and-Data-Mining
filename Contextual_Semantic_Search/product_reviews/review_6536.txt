I have had several pair of these in the last 25 years or so.  These are so comfy, no break in time required.  I'd like to see more fashion colors, though.  I'd love to have pairs in turquoise, bright yellow, orange, kelly green, hot pink, etc.  I wear these with slacks and tailored skirts, even certain dresses. They are very soft and comfy, durable, and make your foot look very small.  I can't recommend them strongly enough to anyone who needs to be on thier feet a great deal, or who has foot problems, or who simply wants a sturdy-but-stylish walking shoe.
