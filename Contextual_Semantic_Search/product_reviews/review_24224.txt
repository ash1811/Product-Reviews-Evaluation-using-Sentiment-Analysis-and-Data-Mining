I ordered two of these rings in a size seven to wear on my thumbs. They arrived bright and shining and after near daily wear they are still gorgeous. For an inexpensive alternative to white gold or platinum, these are certainly the way to go. My only recommendation would be to check your ring sizing elsewhere (unless you already know it). Amazon's ring sizing guide is off and if you order these (which are true to size for me) based on Amazon's measurements, you will likely be disappointed.
