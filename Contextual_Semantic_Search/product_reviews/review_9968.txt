I work outdoors and like to wear a T-shirt with jeans as my usual outfit.So, when it comes to T-shirts, I can be a bit demanding. For years I was buying my T-shirts from the Gap, but they tended to disintegrate after a short time. One day the Gap was under renovation and I need to buy some more T-shirts. I went to a sporting goods store in the Mall and bought a few Russell Athletic T-shirts.What a difference, the cotton was twice a dense, the cut was nice and full-allowing free movement and the price was half that at the Gap.My shirts seem to last longer and the color doesn't fade like the others.I have bought other Russell products, and find their quality to be superior to their competitors.
