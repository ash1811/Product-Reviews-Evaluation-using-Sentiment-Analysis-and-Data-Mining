If you look on the tag on the back of a pair of Levi's you will see that they started on May 20th 1873. Luck will keep you going for a few years, but Quality and consistency is what keeps you up and running for over 100 years. Levi's have been a staple of my wardrobe for almost 40 years and I don't see that changing any time soon. They fit, feel good, and last for years.
