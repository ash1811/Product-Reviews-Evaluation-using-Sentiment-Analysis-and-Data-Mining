I was pleasantly surprised at the appearance of this shirt when I got it. Many of these cheaper solid colored shirts are really very solid colored and don't look natural. This one has some grays and whites mixed in which makes a good looking casual shirt. I am also happy with the length. I ordered a few other 2XL and 3XL shirts and many of them were much longer than expected. This one is the right length to wear on a 6'1&#34; frame without having to tuck it in.The only negative I have to say about it is that the tag is a little itchy.
