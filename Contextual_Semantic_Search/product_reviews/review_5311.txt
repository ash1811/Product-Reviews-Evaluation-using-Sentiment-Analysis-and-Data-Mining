Overall great quality.  Very comfortable.  Love the pocket structure and depth.  One complaint, as these aren't gender specific, from a female who has served and worn BDUs, extremely high waisted for average to petite female.  Several inches above belly button for the crotch to not hang low and rub.  Overall happy with the purchase though.
