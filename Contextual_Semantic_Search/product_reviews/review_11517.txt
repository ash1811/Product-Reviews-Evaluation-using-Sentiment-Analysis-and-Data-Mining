I ordered this bra because I have one of these already and I love it. It fits well and looks great. So, I ordered another one, but this one doesn't fit at all. I'm not sure why it didn't fit, but when I tried it on, I couldn't possible get the hooks together. It felt like the bra was 2 sizes too small. Realizing that there was no way I would ever get it latched, I packed it up and sent it back. maybe I got one that was improperly marked. It's a shame because I love my other bra, it fits s little snug and keeps the girls in place, plus it looks great.
