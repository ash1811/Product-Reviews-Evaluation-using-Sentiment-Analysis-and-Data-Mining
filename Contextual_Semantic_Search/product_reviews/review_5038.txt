I have the unfortunate problem of having thighs that rub together when I walk. As an avid hiker this problem compounds itself to the point of searing rawness that makes for an unpleasant experience to say the least. Over the years of testing out underwear to resolve this issue I have only found 1 pair that truly protected me from this problem, Under Armor boxer jocks. Unfortunately they have a tendency to stink to high heaven. So I thought I would give ExOfficio a try.First time on I must say I love the fit. Snug in the thigh, so they stay in place where I need them. The upper band stays put on the waist and doesn't bunch or roll. Finally the pouch that holds the goods, is roomy and easy to access. After 3 days of 80 degree hiking over 30 miles, I felt great. To top it off, there wasn't any funk. This is a big deal. If you are sharing a tent, your already filthy and sweaty, the last thing he/she wants is to smell is reeky skeevies.My only concern is that where the cloth makes contact with my thighs it feels like it is pilling already. I bought two pairs for my 3 week JMT hike in July, so I will follow up with how they hold up after that.
