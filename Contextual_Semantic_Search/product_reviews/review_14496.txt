I have never even thought of buying Birks before until my doctor recommended them to use as slippers around the house while recovering from a foot and ankle issue. At first they were a bit hard and uncomfortable. After about 12 hours of wear they started to feel great. My posterior tibial tendon issue does not hurt while wearing these. I would recommend for anyone with flat feet or PTT issues.
