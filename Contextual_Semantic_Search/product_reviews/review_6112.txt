This is the first Dickies product I could remember buying and after searching on Amazon they seemed like the best looking out of all the brands. I mean, after all, why buy designer overalls? So when I got home from work and tried them on I was very pleased that the fit was perfect and the material, clasps, buttons and so on are all really good quality. I can see these lasting me a good many years and as soon as they are done tumble drying I'm going to wear them out to our favorite cajun restaurant tonight for some crawfish and gumbo. They will look great with a long sleeved jersey, then a  long sleeved 3-button thermal Henley over that and of course my white Converse Chuck Taylor Hi-Tops! I love my new Dickies Overalls from Amazon and you will too!
