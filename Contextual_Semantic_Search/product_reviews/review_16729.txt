I mistakenly ordered these in a 32 instead of 30 length letting the cuff in this photo affect my thinking and I was wrong. They run true to size and although I would have kept them had they fit, my climate in Houston does not warrant these jeans. They are VERY WARM and although they would be great out in the cold weather once, inside I don't think I'd be able to stand the warmth. For the utility cost conscious out there, these jeans, some warm socks and a sweatshirt would allow you to keep the thermostat way down low! Anyway, great product but I doubt they would have gotten much use. But who knows? It's only November so we'll see how this winter goes and they may find their way back home... in the right size.
