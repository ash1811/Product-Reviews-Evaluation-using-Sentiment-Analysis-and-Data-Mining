I got it since winter is coming but it seems far too thin also  the stitching wasn't finished around nose area it unraveled so I had to sew it back together. I it got here really fast in two days but I doubt its gonna hold upto the winter time and it was delivered defective so.p.s. its falling apart everywhere. really crummy stitching. possibly because its made for a child not an adult.
