This bag is a beautiful, bright, sunny yellow. Great construction. Love the back pack style straps. We also ordered the lime and black in this style. I was disappointed to realize the yellow is slightly more expensive and yet is missing the side pocket feature for carrying small items that both of the other bags we ordered have.Most unfortunately, his bag is too short for scuba fins so my scuba fins have to stick out the top. It is fine for snorkel fins, which are shorter in length than scuba.
