Lee jeans have always fit me well, so I search them out when in the market for my next pair.  They sit at the waist and are a slimmer fit than many others, especially the &#34;relaxed&#34; style.  Be advised these jeans are NOT made with heavy denim.  I am dissapointed in this, and wonder how they will hold up, especially since I wear my jeans all the time and am rough on them.  Time will tell.
