For a size 15 these are fairly narrow and the wide wasn't even an option when I bought these.  I had an OOOOOOLLLLLDDDDD pair of sketchers that I was kind of replacing with these.  The bumps take a bit to get used.  I will say this, it may take a while to get used to the bumps but after a short time in them you don't feel it anymore but after you take them off??? OMG you realize how good they felt.
