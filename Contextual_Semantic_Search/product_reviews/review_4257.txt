This bra is very comfortable.  I would recommend it for light exercising, only.  I have bought two but you must take note that in some cases the top of the bra will stick out.  It does not bother me because I am very adept at sewing.  Some people would prefer to where the item right out of the box.  In those cases I would not recommend this bra.
