Sadly, these were returned the day they arrived.  I wear a 12EEE (new balance), and I ordered these in 12EE (no EEE available choices), but sadly could not even get my foot into the slipper!  So this is a caution for those with wide feet.  I do not believe this slipper is a true "EE" - on the box it was labeled as 'wide'.The slippers do look nice, but with no chance to wear them, I cannot comment on comfort or how long they will last.  It's back to my LB Evans Klondike that fits.
