First off its Not attractive looking. and it feels stiff and bulky and FLAT. Arch support really? I don't feel it at all.It hurt my foot after I wore it a little in the house (didn't even walk around whole much). Very uncomfortable. Can't believe the price!!! If this is what Reef offers for all other sandals and it's considered one of the best ones they have, I say REEF SUCKS.
