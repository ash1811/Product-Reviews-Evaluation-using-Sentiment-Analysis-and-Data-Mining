I had given up on finding the underwear my mother asked me to find for her.  Finally, I found these and held my breath for her opinion.  Previously, she had found fault with every brand I had bought her.  Hooray - she loves these and has nothing but praise for the fit, the cut, and the soft fabric.  These are cut for women, not girls, and are very nice for those who are looking for complete coverage.
