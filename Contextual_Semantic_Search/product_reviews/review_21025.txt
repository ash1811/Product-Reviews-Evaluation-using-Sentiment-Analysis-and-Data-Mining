These are soft and comfortable. I have a rather wide foot and they are very accomodating. I bought some for my niece, who has a normal size foot and I understand they are also comfortable on her. The bottom is a bit too thick for my comfort, so I knocked my review down to a 4 star. They are still very comfortable, however.
