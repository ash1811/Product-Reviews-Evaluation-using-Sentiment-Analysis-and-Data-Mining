Ok some people complained about setting instructions on this thing.. must say they are a pain to find the correct ones. With that said here you go:The Movement caliber # is E820[ ... ]With the above info you can setup this watch in under 5 mins.Now that settings are covered about the watch.  The watch is great, lightweight, with the right size of face. At night you can see the dial good with the luminescence.Bottom line is with this watch after setting it up correctly, you'll never need a new battery OR have to change the date again in your lifetime!!!!!!
