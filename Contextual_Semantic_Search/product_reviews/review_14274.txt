This is a very nice professional looking shoe. They are comfortable but are a little tight in the toes. I have wider feet so I opted for the wide width size. Even with that these shoes are still a little snug. They fit fine everywhere else, giving me plenty of room. My toes are a bit squished but I can tell that after a few wears they are starting to stretch a little. If you have wider feet I would highly suggest getting the wide width but still, it may not be enough. It's a shame because they are very comfortable other than that. Plenty of support in the heel and arch of the foot. They also look exactly as pictured and don't look like they are made of cheap materials. I would suggest wearing thinner socks with these, as they will give you a tad bit more room.
