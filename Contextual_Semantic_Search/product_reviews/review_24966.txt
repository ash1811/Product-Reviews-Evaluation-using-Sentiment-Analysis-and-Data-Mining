I bought this for my husband for Father's Day and he absolutely loves it!  It was very quick to setup, looks great and is very feature rich.  Granted the thermometer is not the best feature since you do have to take it off and wait for 20 minutes or so, but the compass is so cool!  He's big into hiking so the altimeter is fantastic.  My guy won't wear anything but Casio and this is now is day-to-day Go-To watch.  For the price, you can't beat it!
