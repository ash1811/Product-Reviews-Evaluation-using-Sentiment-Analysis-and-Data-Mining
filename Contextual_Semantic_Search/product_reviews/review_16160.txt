I just purchased these very well made jeans for my son after his latest pair of Levi's tore...again.  He is very picky about his jeans so I was quite worried when ordering but since I ordered from Amazon I figured returns were so easy that it was worth the try.  Well, needless to say, they aren't going to be returned.  He loves them and I just ordered more!  Great product.
