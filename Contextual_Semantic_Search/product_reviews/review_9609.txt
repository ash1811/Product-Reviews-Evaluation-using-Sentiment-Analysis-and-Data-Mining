These are not the same quality they were years ago. The denim is getting thinner.It is a nice flattering look, and the fit means throwing a leg over a saddle is not impaired.The pockets are higher and tighter than 'traditional' jeans.Stitching was good, and color was consistent. The thinner denim was disappointing.
