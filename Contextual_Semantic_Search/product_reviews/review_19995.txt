I have a sunhat that I wear over my head, but on days I care what my hair looks like when I take it off it's not the best.  This visor sunhat gives great protection to the face, is easy to put on and take off, is sturdy and attractive, has a absorbent and comfortable cloth covering for the area that comes in contact with your forehead, and doesn't mess your hair up.  However, the ends of the hat slide over the top of your ears and into the hair, but not a big deal to arrange your hair during or after use.  I really like this sun hat, and if I'm inside it is easy to carry in my hand or a large enough purse or tote, as it does not fold.
