I love the look and feel of the Black Monster.  It really looks like an expensive watch. My only negative comment is that you can't wind the watch with the stem, which means that you have to wear it most of the day, or pick it up and sling it around to keep it wound (or buy one of those watch winder machines). Not keeping it well wound results in it losing a minute or so a day.Nevertheless, if I wanted a deadly accurate watch, I would have stayed with my $20 Casio, which keeps great time but looks like a $20 watch. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but after years of wearing cheap electronic watches, I decided to indulge myself and wear an impressive looking watch, and the Black Monster certainly is impressive.Because of the stem winding issue, I would downgrade my rating to 4.5.
