I've worn this a few times, out of desperation. I'd rather go braless than wear it again, however. I washed it, along with the passing inside, making the padding no longer no longer useful. The top digs in to my chest giving a strange deep indent if wearing a tank top of strapless dress. I ordered an X-Large hoping to avoid the indent from the band, but going up a size didn't help.
