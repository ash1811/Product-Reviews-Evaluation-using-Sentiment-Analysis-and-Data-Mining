I'm not sure I will EVER again wear any bra but this strapless bra - hugs me well, provides the perfect support, NO STRAPS peaking from anything I wear. NO other bra compares. Have it in white and tan, and wear it as my first choice. Needed black as I wear a lot of black tops. Maybe I should have/will purchase(d) an additional one. I've tried a number of others, and this is definitely the best you will find.
