My only real qualm is the big white Russel &#34;R&#34; on the sleeve; it sort of sticks out like a sore thumb.But other than that this is a comfortable, solid hoodie.The zipper isn't bad, but doesn't feel quite as sturdy or smooth as a YKK zipper. But for this price, the hoodie's an excellent value.
