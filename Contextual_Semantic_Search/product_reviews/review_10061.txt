This bracelet looked so delicate and elegant on the website, but when it arrived it looked tacky, tacky, tacky.  I haven't worn the bracelet yet, and when I took it out to wear it a few days ago, it had already tarnished! Unfortunately, I'm already past the window of time in which I can get a full refund.  I'm not pleased with the quality or look of this bracelet.  Very disappointed.
