Just got these today & I'm so happy with them! I'm 5'8" and they're the perfect length for me (not too long without heels, which is good because I never wear heels). They fit true to size. They're obviously very well-made, quality khakis, definitely a good value for your money!I bought two pairs with the intention of wearing them to work, but they are so comfortable & figure-flattering that I'll be wearing them out, too :)I ordered 2 pairs, one brown and one green (the colors have fancier-sounding names than that, but you know what I'm saying), and they're great!
