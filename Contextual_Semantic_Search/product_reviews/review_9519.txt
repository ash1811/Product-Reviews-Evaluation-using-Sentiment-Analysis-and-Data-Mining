I have had softer, less bulky cotton briefs that I found much more comfortable than these. These are what I would call &#34;industrial grade.&#34;Overall fit: Bulky, over-the-navel, but not too bad. They are not slimming and can not be worn under my form-fitting pants or jeans - Just too much bulk. So, I wear them with sweats or baggy pants. As long as I am standing and not moving, they are fine. But as soon as I change positions, I can feel the leg bands pinching and pulling, actually cutting off my circulation - Not kidding. Don't try to sit down and relax wearing these. It is simply not possible!That said, if you don't mind any of those problems then buy them, because they wear like steel and will likely last forever even if you do not!Suggestion to manufacturer: Put some &#34;give&#34; in the leg bands.
