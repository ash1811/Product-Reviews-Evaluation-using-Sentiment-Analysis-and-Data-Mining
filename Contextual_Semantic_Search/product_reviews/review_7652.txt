After having great luck with the ExOfficio briefs, I had high hopes for these t-shirts.  Unfortunately that isn't the case...Normally I wear a medium Hanes-type t-shirt under my dress shirts or a large t-shirt if its to be worn alone for sports activities or bumming around.  I frequently travel  to hot, muggy parts of Asia and hoped these would be a great alternative to bulky cotton t-shirts to wear under my suits.  Unfortunately in a medium size they are too loose - the neck looks rumpled (even after light ironing) and they just don't have a good enough appearance peeking up through the open neck of a dress shirt.  At $30 each I hoped to then repurpose them as stand-alone t-shirts for working out or wearing as a casual throw-on during off-times.  To my disappointment, they fail this purpose as well (at least in the white color) as they are so thin you can see your &#34;nipples&#34; and chest hair through the sheer material of the shirt.  Yeck.So now I have $60 worth of useless t-shirts.  Back to the drawing board.
