I bought these in the white leather at a local store and I LOVE them! The driving moc sole is grippy on slick tile floors, but silent as you walk. There is a real arch support inside the shoes which means after hours on your feet you won't be limping. I actually bought these a half size smaller than similar style shoes in other brands, so keep that in mind. My Mother got a pair in the black leather and ended up buying a half size smaller than normal as well. I have wide feet and the tie on top of the toe box does loosen a bit giving just a tiny bit more room where the sides of your toes sit inside the shoe so they don't rub. They are very pretty on the foot and the white is a true, bright, crisp summer white - no cream or beige undertones to the color. I will probably get another pair in the rose suede at some point.
