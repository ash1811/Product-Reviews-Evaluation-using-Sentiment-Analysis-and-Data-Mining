This is a very classy, gorgeous watch. I adjusted the band on my own, and that's all I needed to do before wearing it. To get the watch started, I just placed the watch under a mini lamp. I get a lot of compliments on the watch. It's not too big and not too small. Just right. It's a beauty! Plus, I know the battery will never die because I always wear it in sunlight. Best watch ever made and owned!
