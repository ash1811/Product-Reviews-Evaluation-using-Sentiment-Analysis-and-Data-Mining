They aren't exciting, but they're comfortable and practical. The cotton is soft and a bit heavier than the cheap underwear you get at Target or similar store. The whites ones are just a teeny smidge smaller than the pastels of the same size. I don't know why that would be, but it is. They feel supportive (even though there's no spandex) and minimize jiggles. Good quality underwear for a decent price.
