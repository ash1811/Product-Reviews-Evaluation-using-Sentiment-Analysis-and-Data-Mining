I have not worn these yet,, but I tried them on when I got them. They are true to size and appear to be made fairly well, time will tell. I actually bought these to sleep in because they said they were light weight, however They are not very light, but still if you are just looking for sweat pants, these are fine.Jan 23 update :I'll still go along with everything I said, the 1 thing I missed is it they have no pockets? And I really do miss them.
