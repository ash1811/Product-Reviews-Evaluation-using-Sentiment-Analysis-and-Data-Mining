I adore knee high stocking anyway, but I especially loved these--they easily glide on, and are not too tight over the calf, or up near the top of the stocking, so they don't leave deep, uncomfortable welt mark/impressions on my legs, as some knee highs can if their elastic is way too strong--and, not only are they nice and warm during the colder days, they are also wearing very well--the elastic is still going strong after wearing them for quite a few Fall and Winter seasons--and, the argyle pattern, [this one is done in light beige, steel-shade of blue, and dark brown], is such an all-time favorite of mine, that, to me, these knee highs are next to perfection.
