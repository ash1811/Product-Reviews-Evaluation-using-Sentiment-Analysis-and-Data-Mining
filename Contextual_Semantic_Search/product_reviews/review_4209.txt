I bought this bra a couple weeks after I started breastfeeding, once I could get a good read on my post-engorgement size.  The sizing was pretty confusing, but through another person's review, I was able to correctly id the size I needed.  The bra fits well--it's snug enough to provide some support, but not too tight.  It has stretched out some, so don't order up a size!  It is not SUPER supportive, so I really only wear it when I'm around the house or just lounging.  It wears like a sports bra, without much lift and separation, so it doesn't look great under "nice" clothes, but again, I only wear it around the house and with lounging clothes.  The breastfeeding hooks are nice and tight--I don't worry that they'll come unhooked.  Overall, it's a good product.  I have a couple other Bravado nursing bras, because they are the only brand that really has my size, and I have not been disappointed by any of their products.
