I really like Jockey underwear, and I can count on the size being what I need. Jockey underwear's quality has somewhat declined since the time I first bought them decades ago, but the quality is still better than ALOT of other brands. They are all cotton, very comfortable, and last a fair amount of time-not as long as they did originally, but again, better than other brands.
