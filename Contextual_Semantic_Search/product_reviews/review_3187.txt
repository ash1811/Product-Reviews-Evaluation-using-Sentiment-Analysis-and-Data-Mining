Although the cup size is right, the length of the shoulder straps causes binding in the armpit area.  There are no strap adjustments, so for heavy breasts (DD cup and up) the back tends to pull up.  Wonderful breathable fabric.  Otherwise comfortable.Update:  The hooks at the center, lowest one rubs the skin, not enough fabric backing.
