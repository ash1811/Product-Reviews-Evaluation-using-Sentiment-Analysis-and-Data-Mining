Buying shoes by mail is always a bit of a risk... but it's a bit less of a risk when the shoe is made of suede and not so fitted in style.  At any rate, this purchase worked for me!  They fit just fine and were very comfortable.  Not much arch support in any sort of moccasin, but that doesn't bother me.  I'm quite satisfied.
