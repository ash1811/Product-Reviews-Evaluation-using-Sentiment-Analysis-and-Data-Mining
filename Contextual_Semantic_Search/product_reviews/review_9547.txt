Oh dear, this was my worst buy of the year. No big deal as its only 10 dollars but even so please don't waist your money. New already I could see they where not fitter around the angle but straight up and down from the heal which I thought was weird but I needed to use them so I did. They do not stay up but crunch up in every place possible in you boots, even the heal moves and yes they where the right size for me. Then I thought never mind I will use them as indoor ware to be around the house. Well that did not work either 1 weeks down the line they where so out off shape and stretched they did not even stay on my feet, you couldn't tell even where the heal was anymore and I couldn't walk in them. I could maybe ware them in bed if I don't mind my foot being half way up the sock but even then they are not comfortable. What is more they look like they are years old already, I have washed them in cold and line dried but they have gone all bobbly and horrible too they look like a pair of old ill treated Grandad socks. I think my next step will be to put them in the garbage. I am surprised they get away with selling this type of bad quality!!!
