The duffle is well made except for a few things. 1 you can't put a paddle lock on it to secure the contents. 2 it's a little too narrow. However it works great as a bat bag for baseball and its great for storage poles and the like. A sleeping bag will not fit ( if its rolled up ). Other then then that it's ok.
