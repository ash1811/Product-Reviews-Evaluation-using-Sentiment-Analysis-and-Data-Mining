I ordered this watch few days back from Jomashop and received today. I was eagerly waiting for it and believe me this is so very pretty than the pics advertised on the website. I ordered BL8000-03a instead of 54L because I personally don't like much of blue dial and also SS strap sometimes pinches my wrist hair. In all other reviews mostly all the functionality is covered so i will not repeat the same thing. Just want to mention leather strap with this watch is not normal leather strap but with a folding clasp (you can check its video on Youtube).Also it is very comfortable on wrist and perfectly weighted.I just have one doubt about the water resistant feature of this or any leather strap watch - How can any leather strap watch be worn while swimming.. I mean wouldnt it damage the leather strap fast....
