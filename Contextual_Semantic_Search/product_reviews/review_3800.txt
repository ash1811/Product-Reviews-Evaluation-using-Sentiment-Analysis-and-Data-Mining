I have worn this style for years. So comfortable and no unnecessary padding!! SO hard to find now. I could get overstocks on Amazon but now I see they are limited to very large sizes. We've cleaned them out. So, Vanity Fair..look at these reviews and please consider making this style once again. Thank you!
