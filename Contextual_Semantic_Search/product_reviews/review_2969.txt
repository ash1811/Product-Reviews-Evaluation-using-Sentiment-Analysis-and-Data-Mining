These jackets are legit. period. I have had a carhartt since i was a kid and i cant say i have ever rip torn or damaged one since then. they are tough, pretty warm, and comfy. perfect work jacket that is ok when you get it dirty. like a good pair of boots, they need a little dirt on them! they run a little large but that is ok, because you need some wiggle room and space for layers for colder days.
