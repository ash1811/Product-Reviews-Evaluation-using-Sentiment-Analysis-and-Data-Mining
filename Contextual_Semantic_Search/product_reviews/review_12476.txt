I love keds but I am kind of disappointed because I had almost identical tennis shoes from Forever 21 and wanted to but a pair from keds because I love the brand. The keds were with discount so I bought them for $20 the same price from Forever 21 which was great until I wore them...they were uncomfortable from the back, it made me a stitch on both feet and made me bleed, perhaps if you put a band aid before putting the shoe on will help, I will try doing that the next time.
