I wouldn't say the shoes are too small, but Amazon gave me limited choices for how the product fits.  Length and width were as expected. However......  I wanted to love these, but the part of the shoe that sits against my arch immediately rubbed as soon as I slipped the shoes on (standing still). After taking a few steps and seeing this was not going to work, I took them off and looked for a seam, because the straps meet at this location, too. There is no bulkiness in the shoe.  Sadly, the shape of my foot (medium width, mild pronator, and lowish arch - but not flat-footed) did not work with these very cute shoes.  Had to return them.  I have other Skechers that are as comfortable as my favorite running shoes; I will continue to seek out new styles!
