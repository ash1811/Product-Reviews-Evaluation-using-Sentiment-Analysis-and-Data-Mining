These panties are nylon/spandex--not cotton. They're as sheer as pantyhose! They're entirely see through. They're horrible. Save your money. You might as well wear a pair of stockings without panties, because you'll be covered just as well, which is to say not at all. I am shocked at how horrible these panties are. Shocked! Do no waste your money on these.
