Pluses:iPad mini in its case fits nicely with more space for my iPhone, iPod touch, wallet  and external battery rechargerFits comfortably over my right shoulderWhile sitting on my shoulder, all pockets and zippers face upward rather than sideways like many mono sling bagsCuteMinuses:Material feels flimsy (hence the rating...not sure if it will hold up)No firm baseI searched high and low for the perfect sized mono sling.  Fitting the mini, as well as a few minor objects as I mentioned  was a major consideration.  Most bags were either too small, flimsy or too large for my needs.  This fits the bill except for the material, so, I am just hoping and praying that this is it.  Trying to lighten my load...am not the sort of woman who crowds my bag with nonsense.  Essentials are all that I need.  I don't feel like searching anymore, so, I hope to change my rating.
