I originally bought this bag for my boyfriend to use as a plane carry on.  He ended up using his gym bag and I used the messenger bag and discovered that I loved it more than my purse.  I now find myself using this bag for every day.  Since I have a very casual working environment and I dress casual this bag is perfect.  I can easily see into it and see items that may be at the bottom.  The smaller compartments are also perfect for just about anything that I may have a need to have fast access to or just so I know where they are and can find them easily.  It is also light so I can pack things like books, my iPad, phone, lunch without the bag adding additional weight.  I am not concerned with spillage as liquid dries very quick and has not left any marks.  The strap is durable and comfortable over my shoulder regardless of the weight I'm packing in the bag.  Of course it is not a pretty bag by any means and I would not use this with a business suit  well I might lol).  And it easily switches out for the weekends and as an overnighter.  I dare my boyfriend to ask me for it now.
