Got this for me and my gf to put our soccer stuff in and now when we get to games the entire team puts their keys, wallets, phones, etc in my bag and they joke that it is the team bag. Its big and has a lot of space inside. Holds four cleats in cleat pocket comfortably on the other end you can put icy hot, player cards, etc. and then inside shin guards, uniforms and anything else you may or may not need for the game. GREAT PURCHASE especially for the price!
