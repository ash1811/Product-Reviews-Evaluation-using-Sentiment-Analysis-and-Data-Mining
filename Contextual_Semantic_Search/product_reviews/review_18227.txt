These are best when you have no socks on because the lining is so fuzzy - so my husband can't wear them around the house as knock-arounds - with socks. Maybe if I had gotten a size larger it would have worked, but then - as the lining gets squished down, they might have been to big. So he's happy with them as bedroom slippers and bare feet.
