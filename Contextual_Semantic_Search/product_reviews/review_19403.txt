my wife has a few pairs of Uggs she wears but this &#34;short boot&#34; is her slipper.She's worn the same pair of these for 7 years - each and every day - finally her toes pushed thru the ends of her first pair and I bought her these as a replacement, even if she said not to when I asked her.  She loves them.Being a bit cold natured she wears them even in the summers around the house in the mornings...they are beside her bed every night and she slips into them in the AM.  She actually tried UGG slippers awhile back...but she is spoiled with the coverage/warmth of the short boots for her ankles.
