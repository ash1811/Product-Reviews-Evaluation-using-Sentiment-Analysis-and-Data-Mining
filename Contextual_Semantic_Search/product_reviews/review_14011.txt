What can I say that won't make me sound like I work for the Lee Denim Jean Company.They look great, the fit well, they are affordable and they are durable.Outside of a pair of cotton, baggy sweatpants...These Lee jeans are the MOST comfortable pants I own.I will definitely buy more...in a few years, when these wear out.Seriously... Highly recommend Lee Jeans.
