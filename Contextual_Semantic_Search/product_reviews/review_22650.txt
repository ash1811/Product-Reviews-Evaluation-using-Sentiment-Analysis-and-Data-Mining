As noted by others this is a large and thick watch.  Unfortunately IMO the version with the stainless steel bracelet is no longer available that I can find.  This version of the watch uses a unique strap attachment arrangement so that only the rubber strap can be used as received.  Fortunately there is a source for adapters that allow use of normal 24mm wide watch straps and bands.  The adapters are called "Suppa" adapters and if you want a set then Google for their web site.For the customer who complained of the calendar arrangement, his complaint is true of probably 95%+ of current watches which use a date wheel and window.  Most however use a three position stem which when pulled out to the first not fully seated position allows resetting the calendar without disturbing the time setting.  There are date window watches with a so called perpetual calendar, usually good to 2100, but that feature is going to limit your selection severely and up the price paid.  Unless "Perpetual Calendar" is specifically noted as a feature of a given watch then the arrangement used by this Citizen watch is almost certain to be used.The popular web name for this watch is the "Ecozilla", short for Eco-Drive Godzilla.  I presume this is in reference to it being big enough for Godzilla to wear!  It is a large and heavy watch but with current watch style trends it is not the largest or heaviest.  Not for the skinny wristed however.
