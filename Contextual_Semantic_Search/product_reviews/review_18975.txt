So my husband bought this watch in a real store and payed almost twice as much for it. Its flaw is after a year or two the band breaks. The this web-like design did not hold up well. That being said...we bought another. He never takes it off, so it seemed fair that being in all conditions, wet/dry, hot/cold all the time, it would give out.As for functions....I have no clue, he used it to track (running) lap times.
