I wore these with some old black loafers I hadn't worn in years. Along with some black, crushed velvet leggings and these boot toppers looked like the real thing. People at every party were coming up to me all night saying they LOVED my boots. I only told a few people they were fake so I really had fun feeling even more like a pirate when people thought I had real boots. With the right outfit I could probably even get away with wearing them out to eat.
