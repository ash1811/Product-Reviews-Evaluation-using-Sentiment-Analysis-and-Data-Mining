Bought 2 of these in the Forest Green for a St. Patty's Day party.  these are a medium weight sweat, solidly built, good cuffs on sleeves and waist.  Not tight.  the sweat itself fits a bit large, but for me it is very comfortable.  If you want it to fit tight on the body, you might want to size down.  I dno't want it tight, so I ordered my regular size and the fits is just right.  Color on screen is about right - this is a very dark green.
