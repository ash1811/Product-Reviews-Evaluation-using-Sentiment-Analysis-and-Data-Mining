I do not know what is special about these briefs. I have tried both of them, and here are my comparisons. You can  get a Hanes Men's Classics 7 Pack Full-Cut Brief for the same price as these 3-pair Calvin Klein briefs. These Calvin Kleins are more thick and feel a little more "heavy" compared to the Hanes, which are thin and feel a litter lighter compared to CK. Secondly, Hanes are tagless. These Calvin Kleins are NOT tagless. You would expect a big and someone what "expensive" brand like CK to make the switch to tagless, but so far they haven't. Lastly, all waistebands are white. They do not match the color of the briefs. I do not know if that is a plus or minus for you, but for me, I would like them to match.
