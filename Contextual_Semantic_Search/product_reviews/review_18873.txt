This was a birthday gift for my daughter.  I ordered size 12 as Medium was the only width available and she normally wears 11 1/2 Wide.  She is wearing them with socks as they were a bit loose, but loves the shoes.  She called from work to tell me how comfy the shoes were; she had got accustomed to her feet hurting by 2 pm every day and said her feet didn't hurt at all that day.  I thought the browns were pretty, but ordered the black so they would go with everything, and they are a nice looking shoe.  It is way too early to say how they will hold up, but initial reaction is good.
