Normally I wear a size 8 but I decided to buy these in an 8.5 because the toe box looks short and it is short. I have long toes and they were pressed up against that toe bumper so these sandals would not work for me and I sent them back. To order up to a 9 would probably just make the whole sandal too roomy. This is too bad because the foot bed was very comfortable. If you have short toes this could be a great choice for you.
