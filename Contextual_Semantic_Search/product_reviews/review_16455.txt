I was on the search for something small to wear in my ears everyday. My mom had ordered these and I thought they were very simple and nice and small. I ordered them, they arrived quickly, and they are perfect! I wear them day and night! The rod is not too long so it isn't bothersome when sleeping and they stay clean and shiny. They are very simple and small studs that are great for wearing all the time!
