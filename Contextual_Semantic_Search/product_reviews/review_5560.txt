I purchased size medium in black/silver colored GoldGear Legging Bottom. Turned out, what a disappointment this particular item was. And here's why:* Under Product Features, inseam length was left out - it is (approximately) 27.25-inches long.* The company logo is not embroidered, but fused (to minimize the labor costs). Expect the company logo to be peeled off in the future.* Under Product Description, it reads, "Dual-layer EVO ColdGear fabric..." But it is NOT men's UA EVO ColdGear Legging. It is men's ColdGear Action Legging, instead. What is the difference? UA EVO ColdGear Legging comes with working fly.* The fabric does not provide 360 Reflectivity, and will NOT keep your legs warm in cold temperature.* The fitting is "compression" - ultra-tight, second-skin fit feel (imagine you are wearing women's pantyhose).* Unless you want to see some dark color stains on your skin, wash it in cold water/no bleach before wearing.* By the way, this garment is made in Southeast Asia.
