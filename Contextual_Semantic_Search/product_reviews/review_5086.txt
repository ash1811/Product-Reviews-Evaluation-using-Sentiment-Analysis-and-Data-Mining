Seriously, a review on underwear? But these really are worth it. I took three pair of these with me on an 800-mile walk of California's El Camino Real this Spring. While I did not attempt wearing them for multiple days without washing, they were extremely comfortable and the snug-but-not-tight legs seemed to prevent any chafing. Being nylon, they could be hand washed at night, rolled tightly in a towel and then left flat to dry overnight. These are now my standard choice instead of cotton boxers, which get damp and clammy in hot weather. These feel much better.
