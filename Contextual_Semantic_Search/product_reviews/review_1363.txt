I always look at construction,fit,appearance and price when I buy athletic shoes.I am not of the new school when it comes to this type of shoe.The persons name on it makes zero difference to me,plus it only adds to the cost in order to pay the endorsee.This shoe is the best in my view.I currently own 2 pair.They are comfortable and well constructed.I will keep buying them as long as K-Swiss keeps making them
