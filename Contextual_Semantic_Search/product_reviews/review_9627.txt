I always have problems finding pants/jeans that have a shorter rise from crotch to beltline...on most pants in my waistline size (34), if I pulled them up, I'd look like Clem Caddiddlehopper, if any of you remember him! The same happens with jeans but I have found that the &#34;Slim Fit&#34; Jean has a lower rise and looks decent...I forgot that &#34;Cowboy Cut&#34; means it flares at the bottom so you can get your boots on and off...I might not choose that next time but it still looks good. These jeans get more comfortable with each wearing.
