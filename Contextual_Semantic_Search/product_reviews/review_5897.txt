I'm 5'11&#34; with a normal-sized head.  These men's glasses were not big enough for me.  The ear rests (is that what you call them?) did not make it around my ears to fit comfortably.  Still, for the price, I'm not that disappointed.  I use them for driving, but they get uncomfortable after a while.
