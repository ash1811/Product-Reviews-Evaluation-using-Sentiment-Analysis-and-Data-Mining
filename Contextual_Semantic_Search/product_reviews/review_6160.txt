I got these for safe running through the New England winter. First time I took them out I definitely felt a lot more secure, and I feel much safer when its icy. Wearing them in the snow has been more mixed. On my big snow boots these tend to pop off - maybe my fault for trying to get them on such big shoes. Just have to do a check periodically in the snow to make sure they are still there - otherwise a great product.
