I love Birkenstocks.  Been wearing them for many years.  When my 1994 pair finally wore out, I bought these for a killer price.  Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong size.  My bad.  Returned them and was charged the return shipping cost.  Oh well.Got another pair, the RIGHT size this time and they were shipped very quickly.  They are very, very comfortable and last forever.  $78.00 for real leather Birkenstocks is a great price.
