I cannot believe how tight the calf part on these boots is.  I don't have large calves at all, and I could hardly get them on.  I called my local cobbler and he currently has them in the shop to stretch out the shaft (for a very small charge, so this is a good solution since I don't want to return them!)...I will say, however, that the boots are gorgeous to look at and very well made.
