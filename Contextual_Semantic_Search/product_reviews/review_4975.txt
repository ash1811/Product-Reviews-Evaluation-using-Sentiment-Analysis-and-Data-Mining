These underwear fit normally in the waist given the size chart, howerver the butt/legs are looser than most boxer briefs. If you don't mind a baggier fit they're very comfortable and cool, and they wash and dry very quickly.  If you're camping/backpacking, these are the kind to take to reduce packing; quick wash and hang to dry at night and they'll be ready by morning.
