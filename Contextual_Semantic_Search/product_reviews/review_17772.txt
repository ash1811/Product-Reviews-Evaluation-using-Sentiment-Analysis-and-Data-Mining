I traded in some old cd's and had a credit so I got this watch for like 2 dollars.I needed a watch for work (I work outside and wanted a watch I didn't care about).Now, I cant Take this watch off. Its easy to set and looks pretty decent. I know eventually the strap will break, but you know what? I will immediately buy another one. I really like this watch. buy it.
