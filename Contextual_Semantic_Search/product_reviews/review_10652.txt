I bought two of these rings to use as guards for other too large rings.  They exceeded my expectations of quality.  They are highly polished and have a nice weight.  I ordered size 6, and that is what I received.  They would be suitable to be worn as an everyday wedding band, guard rings, stackables or as a single right hand band ring.  They are heavier than two very similar rings that I ordered from another site....and paid the same price.  Yes, they will show scratches (signs of wear).  That is to be expected.......even with much higher priced and quality sterling.  I am pleased with my purchase.
