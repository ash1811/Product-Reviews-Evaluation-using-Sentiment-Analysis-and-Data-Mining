I wear these slides at home, but sometimes I walk outside with them. Personally I don't like the warm slippers and I like my feet to be exposed. I did some research before buying the slides and concluded that these slides are the best ones in the $20.00-$30.00 price range. The quality is nice: solid rubber-gel and size adjustment straps on Velcro pads. These slides will last you a long time if you wash them under warm water once in every 4-to-6 months.
