I was looking for shoes to wear inside but could also be worn outside for brief stints when necessary.These are perfect. I wear mine with socks. These are my second pair, the first one wore a hole in the side but I wore them for a couple years. These are really puffy, but the soles are not and feel secure on the ground. Just enough padding but it doesn't interfere with walking like some slippers. They really are slipper/shoes. Love them. I only have white.
