I love earrings and have lately been tired of big, dangling, elaborate earrings getting caught on my clothing and hair. These are very classy, feminine studs for a great price. The colors (except for the deep red garnet) are not vibrant; rather, they are unusual, subtle and and flattering to most face shapes and skin shades. I love the citrine and peridot in particular. All five are different shapes, which I like a lot. If you have multiple holes, they make nice secondary earrings. I guess I have fleshy lobes as I didn't have any problem with fit. They are packed in individual boxes and I thought I'd give a few away as stocking stuffers, but I'm going to be selfish and keep all of them. Merry Christmas to me.
