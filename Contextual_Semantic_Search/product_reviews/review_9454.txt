For the price, these earrings are very pretty and very versatile.  The provided photo makes the CZs look cloudier than they actually are -- the silver is shiny and stamped .925, and the CZs are clear and bright.  They're small enough that I can wear them to work without feeling too glittery.The hinge isn't particularly strong, but the post has a groove that clicks the back of the earring into place, and that seems solid enough.  I wouldn't cry over the loss of a $15 pair of earrings, though!I only wish the hoops were just a little snugger, but I'm a shrimp and have small ears.  For a normal-sized woman, these would fit perfectly.
