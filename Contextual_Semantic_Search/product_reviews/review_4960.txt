I feel silly reviewing underwear, but there you go... this product deserves the praise.  I used to wear cotton knit boxers all the time, but I got tired of them riding up (and having to pull them out of my crotch all the time, causing embarrassing scenes) and getting hot and muggy down there due to the cotton material.  Enter the Give-N-Go Boxer Briefs!They ride in place, no riding up.  They stretch and conform to shape comfortably.  They do NOT hold moisture or odor.  Yes, the price is a bit steep for underwear, and I initially only bought two pairs.  After wearing them for a few days, I immediately ordered five more.  Now I've got one for each day of the week!  :-)
