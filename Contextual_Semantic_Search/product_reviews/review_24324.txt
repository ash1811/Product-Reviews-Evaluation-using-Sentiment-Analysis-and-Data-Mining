I SO want to give a four or five star review for this little ballerina box. It's gorgeous! The cunning little drawers! The sweet, soft ballerina paintings! It plays Swan Lake! But, oops, it DID play Swan Lake. The wind up mechanism broke after only a few days, and now the ballerina does not twirl and the pretty box is silent. My little girl still likes it, and maybe this is just the way of ballerina boxes, but I wish it were more durable.
