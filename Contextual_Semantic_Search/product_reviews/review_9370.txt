Love,love,love these pants! I was hesitant to purchase them at first b/c I am pretty short was worried about the length (5'2 105lbs). But took the plunge and ordered the XS - so glad I did b/c it fit perfectly! Plus, the quality of the pants are great and they are very comfortable to wear (and look great on!) Very pleased with this purchase.
