My daughter gave me this, and so I'd never tell her (but she does frequently comment that she cannot see the stones).1.  You cannot see the stones inside when you're wearing it ..  ... I guess you just have to enjoy knowing that they're there. ..2.  The clasp is very tiny and cheap.3.  The loop that the chain passes through is ..  in a very odd place . on the BACK side of the pendant, so it's just oddly lumpy and hangs awkwardly .  .  . I don't quite understand why it was designed this way.Not something I enjoy wearing, except that my dear daughter got it for me ..I can fix that clasp problem .and I guess a jewelry could redesign the loop a bit, for me . but . .you still couldnt see the stones .. .a lot of fixing to do here, such a shame.
