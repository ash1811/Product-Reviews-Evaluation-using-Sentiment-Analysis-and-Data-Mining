This is probably Rolex's most popular watch model, their copy (or tribute, or homage, whatever you like to call it) of the classic 60's Rolex Submariner dive watch.They've made a fine copy here. You have to handle it to appreciate how solid and 'quality' it feels on your wrist.Tip:  the bezel here is not the exact Rolex copy; this bezel is scalloped, like an Omega. The Rolex has a coin-edge bezel (like a US dime's edge), and that Invicta model is the "8926OB" model. So if you want a near-perfect Rolex copy, go to that listing instead.Important note: Invicta has an online reputation for QC problems, hit or miss reliability, and lots of exasperated reviewers online complaining about quality problems, broken brand new watches, and poor/nonexistent warranty responses.I've not had any problems myself, but obviously a lot of other people clearly have had problems.There's a lot of threads on Invicta quality and QC issues on the various online watch forums (both pro and con, and a lot of threads on the Invicta 8926 specifically). Also lots of video reviews online at youTube.My best advice is to make sure you order (and pay) in whatever way best guarantees an easy return and refund in case you are unlucky enough to have problems.If you do decide to get the 8926 or the 8926OB coin edge version, consider putting it on a nylon strap of the "original Bond" pattern which is a replica of the one Sean Connery wears with a white tux in the opening scenes of GOLDFINGER. A whole cottage industry has grown up around reproducing that 1964 watch strap, and it looks good.Prices on all watches fluctuate wildly from Amazon vendors. I see these online for $75-$85 shipped. No need to overpay. Comparison shopping can be a happy surprise.Hope this is helpful. Enjoy.
