I'm not sure I would call it tusk but it is neutral so it will go with my clothing.The sizes are always larger or feel larger which I appreciate.  It's roomy without being overwhelming.I love fleece.  This is machine washable, I just wish I knew what the drying instructions were.  But it is soft, light without being too thin and warm yet not too warm or too heavy.  I will buy another.
