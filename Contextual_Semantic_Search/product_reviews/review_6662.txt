I can not say enough good things about these shoes I love them. I have ordered other ball room dance shoes and not been as happy as I am with these. They do run a little small as some of the other reviews have complained. These shoes are sturdy and comfortable I can dance all night in them. I will purchase this brand of ball room shoe again.
