They look very tough on the outside but are very comfortable on the inside. Yes, the outside may give the impression that they are built like work boots but these are among the nicest and most comfortable dress-casual shoes ever made. My only complaint is that they are somewhat bulkier than the now-discontinued Jefferson or Washington (also from Dockers) models.
