I bought these shoes for walking at work thinking I could just slip into them without ties to fuss with. But they have no arch support, the soles are flat and very uncomfortable to walk in. In addition they don't really fit, they flop with every step like flip flops, not secure at all. I don't like the way they look either. They have this quilted fabric that looks like bedroom slippers to me. I don't really see the point of these shoes. They aren't attractive and aren't functional.
