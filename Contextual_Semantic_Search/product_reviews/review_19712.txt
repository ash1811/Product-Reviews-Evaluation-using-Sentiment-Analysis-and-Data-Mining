I wanted a pair of basic houseshoes that were washable and had a hard sole that could be worn outside.  I have cats, so I needed something that didn't attract cat hair.  I was not having any luck at the stores as their shoes were too fancy - focusing more on look than on versatility.  These shoes fit the bill.  What I didn't expect was how comfortable they were. The padding on the inside sole is amazing.  There is just a bit of arch support, but it easily conforms to the shape of your foot.  The top part is also soft and cushy.  The size runs true.  The fabric is T-shirt material-like and is very attractive.  Not fancy looking but a very nice, durable houseshoe.  I purchased the grey ones.
