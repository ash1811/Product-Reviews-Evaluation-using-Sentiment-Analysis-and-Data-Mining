Nothing remarkable.  The white inner cloth does clean a bit better when damp (not wet) and the outer blue one shines things up nicely.  It states not to use it with pearls or 14kt gold or higher as it will scratch.  I don't know if it is just a disclaimer to protect themselves, but I'm not going to take the chance!
