I own two Columbia Sportswear Women's Benton Springs Fleece jackets. I keep one in the car, even in the summer, for going to the movies or those mega-markets where they blast the AC!In cooler weather, it's just perfect when it's not cold enough to wear a winter coat. When it's freezing cold, this is light enough to layer under a coat for another layer of warmth.The fabric is very high quality -- very soft and never pills.It washes like a dream, never losing it's lush softness. The Benton Springs Fleece will be one of your wardrobe staples and you'll wonder how you ever lived without one (or two!)It's also the perfect gift item for family or friends.
