Bought this for my 8 year old  grand daughter because pink is her favourite colour.She loves it. Allows her to tell the time numerically rather than digitally. It was a perfect fit for her small wrist. She claims it rings at every hour so it keeps her abreast of the time.Very suitable for her age and upwards to pre-teens. The band seems sturdy but is not genuine leather.She is very pleased with it because it is not plastic.
