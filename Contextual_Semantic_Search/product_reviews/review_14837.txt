I had never heard of "Carhartt" before.. I ordered "three" Carhartt men's shirts, xx-large, in three different colors.. "All" three are a perfect fit, look great, comfortable.. the fabric is soft.. The shirt(s) have a great fit. Great shirts.. Great choice.. and the price fantastic! I have been an IZOD "fan", but NO more!
