This bag is a good size for my 5-6 year old to use for swim class.  My first complaint would have been that it is too hard for him to tighten the drawstring.  You have to have some muscle to pull it tight.  My second complaint is that the string actually came out so now the bag hangs WIDE OPEN making it absolutely not usable.
