I received two pairs of the Gold Toe Comfort Crew athletic socks for the holidays and they are terrific.  The material is very solid, high-quality ribbed with some stretch.  The tube of the sock is versatile, and can be cuffed, slouched, or pulled up.  They don't fall if worn completely pulled up.  While they're high quality they're not so thick that they affect the fit of your shoes.  They wash well and are perfect for everyday wear.
