Holy torpedo boobs, Batman! I love this bra, the way it supports, the padding in the straps, the strap adjust-ability (though I don't trust the flimsy clasps to last very long) - all great for us top-heavy gals - but yikes! Lift, separate, & point forward at the nearest target! It makes me feel self-conscious. Plus the fit it a bit tight all around, even after a suitable breaking-in period. After wearing it for an hour or so I get headaches & have to remove it. So, the hunt continues for a suitable 34H-sized bra that does for me what any old bra does for a B-cup girl. Sigh. The color is cute, though. It's nice to have color options not normally available to us big girls - we like to be pretty too!
