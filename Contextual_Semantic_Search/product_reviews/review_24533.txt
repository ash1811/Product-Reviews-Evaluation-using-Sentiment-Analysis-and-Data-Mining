I bought these for my 2&1/2 year old son and he loves them and wants to wear them everywhere...even around the house.I had bought a pair of the same sandals when he was littler but he could not appreciate them as much then.  I like the ruggedness of the sandal which is perfect for a child who is outdoors a lot.They seem to be quite comfortable and do not rub on his achilles tendon like some sandals can.I think they are well designed for toddlers and the consequent wear and tear.I would definitely buy these again when he outgrows the current pair.They seem to fit true to size and don't appear to be too heavy for him.
