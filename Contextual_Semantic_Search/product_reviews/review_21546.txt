Really nice, roomy, and thoughtful design in this purse/carry-on. The two outer pockets have a secure magnetic catch and come equipped with 2 internal zipper pockets each (4 total), and mesh water bottle holders (2 total). Although these seem to only fit the smallest water bottles around (only about 2.5 inches wide in diameter). The center compartment has another 2 zipper pouches (this makes 6 total for the bag), a zippered coin/change pouch, and other little organizational pockets, sleeves for pens, eyeglass cases, etc. The zipper pulls throughout this bag are comfortable, decent quality, and ergonomic to use. I do agree with other reviews that the structure of this bag is very floppy and will not sit upright on its own accord. But when filled to any degree, it will "perk up". But if you are looking for a lightweight bag that will hold a LOT of stuff, and organize it, this is perfect.I have been using this bag for a daily purse for about a month now. I was used to much smaller purses, so this was quite an "upgrade" in size, and seems cavernous to me. But it is proving its salt for all those catch-all items I would normally carry by hand (gloves, travel umbrella, travel mug, etc. I can even put my little laptop in there too! I purchased the Espresso color bag which is lovely since it is not black and neutral enough to go with virtually any outfit. The only reason I gave this bag 4 stars rather than 5 is because it is a bit clunky to maneuver when trying to produce a wallet/change at a store check-out lane, and due to its floppy nature, I do find my self digging through the giant pockets. But this is more of a personal preference thing, I figure.
