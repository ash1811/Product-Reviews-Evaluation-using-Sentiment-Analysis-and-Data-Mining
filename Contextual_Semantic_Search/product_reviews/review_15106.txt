Has two pockets. I love pockets on my sweats. The cinch cord is one-piece which means i don;t have to grab a safety pin and try to coax back one end of a two-piece cinch cord when it pops into the waistband and gets lost. Fabric is nice and soft -- helps keep me warm in cool bedroom on minus wind chill nights. Well, ok, so does the cat.
