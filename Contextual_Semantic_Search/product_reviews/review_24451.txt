Perfect cut, totally true to size. (I wear an 11) very comfortable. I had two other pairs of this brand ( not this style) and they were great, too. I have a wide foot and the straps are a tad tight but after wearing them for a few hours, they seemed to stretch just a bit and with no blisters.  I will wear these every day and all summer.
