The shipping on this product was really fast which greatly pleased me because I needed it for a formal event that I was attending.  The quality of the shawl was equally impressive.  Since it was cold enough for an overcoat, I wore the shawl tied around my neck under the coat and later took it off and wore it as a shawl over my dress.  One shawl - 2 functions.
