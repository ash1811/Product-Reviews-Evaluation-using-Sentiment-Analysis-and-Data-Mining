The price is low, the watch works well and it looks fine. I especially like the 24-hr. numbers alongside the usual twelve. Yes, a date window would be nice, but you can pay another $3 if you want that. If you have small wrists, this is great for you. If you are large-boned with big forearms and wrists, the face size of this watch makes it too small for you.
