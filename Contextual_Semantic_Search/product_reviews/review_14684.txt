I have never owned anything UGG before this purchase, but found that lately my feet were always freezing. A friend recommended UGGS, so I decided to give them a try.I opted for the Women's Coquette in Chocolate, becaue I wanted something with a sole that could be worn from inside the house out to the store or to get gas. From the first day I wore them, I became a huge fan. My feet have never been so comfy warm.  In addition, the sole is very sturdy, and the support is way better than what you would get from ANY slipper, in fact it molds to my foot like a comft, pair of flat clogs. I LOVE THESE....HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
