Very Nice IRONMAN,The Screen is much bigger, and the Digits are easier read, straight on or at an angel.  Also the Start/Split center/bottom button is easier to press on the fly...er..I mean run..hahaThe amount of memory you get along with splits is more than the previous generation.Also, you get more options with ALARMS.  DAILY, WEEKEND ONLY, WEEK only, or just individual days, NICE!  But, I find myself only changing the time on the DAILY select....like every other watch does.
