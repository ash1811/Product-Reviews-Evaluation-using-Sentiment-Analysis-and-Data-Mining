I bought these hoping for a longer lasting jean.  So far I see nothing that suggests these will last longer than others. Fit is good and finish is only disturbed by some brass rivets that serve only to make the jeans appear more industrial.  For me, jeans fail at the knee and back pocket, not where the rivets are and if the cloth fails in those locations, rivets are not going to help a thing.One infuriating problem is that the pockets are too small.  Granted I have a large phone, but other jeans allowed me to carry the phone in my pocket, these barely let me get my hands in.I prefer function over form and was suspicious that I wouldn't like these because they say Cowboy Cut.  Now I don't intend to inveigh about cowboys here but I need my jeans to survive and if they do then I'll care less about the cut, but they look silly to me.
