Wow the sizing was terrible on these. I am 5'3 about 125lbs and the small/medium size was like squeezing my body into a sausage casing. I have not ordered the next size up so I cant say how that would fit. They do feel nice but I'd def prefer if they fit. They were sent back which is great because you cant even try them on in a dance store.
