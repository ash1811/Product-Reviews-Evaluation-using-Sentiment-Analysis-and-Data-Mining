I purchased 5 pairs of black and 3 pairs of blue. After a few washes, they fade a little bit and the colors end up looking almost alike. I have to put them side by side to determine which are black and which are blue. Then after a few more washes, they are harder to differentiate. Out on a bright day, you can definitely tell the difference.The socks are nice and they hold up all day. Nice color and fit.
