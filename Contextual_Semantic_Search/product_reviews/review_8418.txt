Yes, for $13.00 (8 plus shipping) what can one expect, but still. The chain is quite flimsy and the pendant itself is plastic (no metal) that is painting in silver coloured paint. There is no metal on the pendant. It kind of looks like a nice prize from a gumball machine, if you get my drift. What really is the difference between this one and the less expensive ones on this site? I don't see any. For a child or someone simply looking to play Arwen for Halloween it may be a very nice necklace. It looks very pretty at a distance. However, if one wishes to wear it as a piece of jewellery year round then he/she will be disappointed. There are absolutely lovely, precious metal Arwen necklaces that one can find on other sites that would be better for that. They cost alot more (around $99 from what I've seen), but they are made from real gold and silver, come with gorgeous chains, and are truly works of art. Bottomline: you get what you pay for.
