I got this ring for Christmas and I love it--and it seems to match almost everything!  It's even lovelier in person and I've gotten tons of complements on it.  The only issue with the ring is that the band is very thick and makes it slightly uncomfortable on my hand.  However, I'm hoping to adjust to the ring soon because it is so pretty.
