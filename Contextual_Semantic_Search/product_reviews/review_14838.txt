This is a nice heavy henley shirt, an excellent value for the price.  They hold up well in washing -- no frayed seams, no lost buttons.  As someone else mentioned, they run a *little* large, but I prefer a loose fit anyway.  (Yeah, I'm a female, but I like to wear these as nightshirts ... )  You can find tee shirts cheaper than this, but they'll be made of much thinner material.
