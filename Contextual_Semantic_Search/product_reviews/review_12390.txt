This day dress is what I ordered for my 90yr old mother.  She has days when she just needs to be comfortable and not get dressed up.  This dress is a heavy cotton and cute enough to wear in public.  She liked it and she has always made a good immpression with her outfits.  Recommend it for style and comfort.  It is machine  washable.PS. medium IS  about a size  medium.(10)
