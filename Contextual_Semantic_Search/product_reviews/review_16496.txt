Nice to have a heavy-weight cotton shirt but this is a little bit too long to wear untucked.  I'm normally a large t-shirt wearing guy.  This shirt, if left untucked, is covering pants pockets.  I've washed it and it hasn't shrunk much.  I'm afraid to try a medium.I've tried Carhartt shirts before too.  Some fit fine in a large and some are made for the very, very tall.  I like the heavy feel of the cotton.  I just wish it was shorter.
