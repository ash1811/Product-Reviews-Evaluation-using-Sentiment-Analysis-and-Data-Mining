I purchased this for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it. She's worn it every day for the past 6+ months and it's kept the wonderful shine it came with. Would highly recommend this necklace, it's a bargain!After about 5 months of wearing this (every single day) the chain broke and I got a new, sturdier one for her -- not a big deal at all, still looks great. A replacement chain was easy to find and I still stand behind this necklace.
