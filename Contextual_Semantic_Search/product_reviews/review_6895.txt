These socks can be worn comfortably during all seasons except summer. They tend to keep the feet and ankles warm -- a good thing during the cooler months. They do tend to squeeze the ankles and lower legs a bit too tightly. This can prove irritating to anyone with even mild circulation concerns. Good cushioning and wicking, but should not be worn all day in athletic shoes as they tend to "heat up."
