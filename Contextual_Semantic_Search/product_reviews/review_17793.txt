My husband has always had a Casio calculator watch, but when he needed to replace it, he got some other kind - I was so used to seeing him with the Casio that I wanted to get him a new one for Father's Day. I was concerned because there isn't the data bank like there used to be, but he said he uses his phone for that now. So completely happy! Great price for a great watch.
