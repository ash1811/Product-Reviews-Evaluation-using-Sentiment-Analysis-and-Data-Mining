These earrings are cute, and appropriate for the price the seller is charging.  I agree with someone who posted earlier that the flat back of the earrings sometimes shows (particularly true if you have short hair).  The good news is that the backs of the earrings aren't ugly or anything.  Just flat and not pretty.  I, too, wish the earrings had been designed more solidly (and more three-dimensional), but for this price, what can you expect?  They are pretty, and they are a nice length.  They are a little delicate, but not really fragile.
