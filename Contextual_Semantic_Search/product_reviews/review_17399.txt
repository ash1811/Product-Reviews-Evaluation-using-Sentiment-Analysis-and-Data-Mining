I'd been wanting these boots for months, stalking the best price until I grabbed them here. I am a true 9.5 and the 9 fit perfectly. No issues getting them on - I pointed my toe as I put it into the boot, as with cowboy boots. The leather is stiff and I recommend wearing them for short periods of time before committing to a full day. I've worn mine maybe four times and the back of one heel is still rubbing as the leather molds to my leg. However, it's very minor and will go away soon. The heel is fabulous and back-friendly. Not only are these easy to walk in, I stood at a concert for three hours and had no back or knee issues. The boots look great with everything from jeans to dresses. Finally, they are kind of heavy and clompy, which I personally love (I spent the 90s in Doc Martens) so take that into account when you buy. They are tough and awesome, yet sleek and flattering.
