The Leather used in the main part of the shoe were thin and so after about 6 months wearing they cracked and split on the outside of the right foot down from the little toe. Check the consistency and quality of the leather when you get them. Other than that these are outstanding shoes. I have worn this style by Bostonian for many years.
