I was pretty skeptical about this bra, especially since I am a C cup.  It stayed put all night and looked great under my dress that had a little opening in the back that prevented me from wearing a traditional bra.  I was afraid it would hurt to remove, but it wasn't bad at all.  I suggest you try it out prior to the day you plan on wearing it, because it took a few tries to get the position right.  I even managed to have a little lift.  Pretty impressive for a bra that doesn't have straps or a band!
