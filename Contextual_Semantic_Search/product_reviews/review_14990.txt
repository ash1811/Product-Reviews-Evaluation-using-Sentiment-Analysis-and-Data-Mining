i bought 4 of them, i usually wear large but i decided to buy xl just in case they shrink. They got here today and they are soft and look comfortable. I am hoping they will shrink a little.. I may come back for more. My only concern was the packaging they in was brown box with no protection and one of them arrived really dirty other than that no PROBLEM.can't beat the priceThank you
