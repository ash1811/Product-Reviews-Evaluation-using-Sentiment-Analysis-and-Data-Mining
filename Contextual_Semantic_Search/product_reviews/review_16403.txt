These were replacement shoes. My first pair I now use for running around doing errands because after four years of zumba they split on the mesh sides. I am forced to always wear black socks with them. These new ones fit just like the old. They are light, flexible and stable on a wooden dance floor. I can glide, jump and stomp in them. Love my ZUMBA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
