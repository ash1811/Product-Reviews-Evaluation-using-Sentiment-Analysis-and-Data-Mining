I have been carrying an Ameribag for about 10 years now and own several of them in all types of fabrications. While I favor the leather ones, for lightness as well as wearability microfiber is the way to go.I am 5'3&#34; and usually carry a small or medium Ameribag because I carry a lot of stuff. Water bottle, cell phone, long wallet, several pens, two check books, a Kindle, and sometimes an iPad Mini or an iPod can be found in my bag. My Ameribag holds a lot as it has a lot of pockets, and includes a latch for keys. I love these bags because there is a place for everything and if you are consistent everything will be in its place.Above and beyond Ameribag's superior construction is its justifiable reputation as an ergonomically designed bag that is easy on your back. Despite all I carry, it is unbelievably comfortable. My back and shoulders don't hurt. Ameribag's design seems to distribute weight more evenly.I just bought this bag in a size small in black microfiber. It is stylish, easy to keep clean, and easy to wear as either a shoulder or cross body bag.
