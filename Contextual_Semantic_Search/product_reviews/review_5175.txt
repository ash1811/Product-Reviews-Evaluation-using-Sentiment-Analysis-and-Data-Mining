I ordered this watch as an everyday timepiece, already owning several more expensive ones that I didn't want to bang around daily.  The case is very solid, yet not too thick, which was a complaint I had with many of the inexpensive digital and diving type watches.  The face is very easy to read in all light conditions, including dark with the glowing hands and illuminator when needed.  As written in previous reviews, you can hear the watch tick,, but only in extremely silent conditions, or when you hold it close to your ear.  I actually find this feature to be pretty cool, reminds me of sitting in a silent room in school with the clock on the wall ticking during a test.  The strap is comfortable, and not bulky, but may be the weak point--- I'd expect the watch to far outlast the strap, which could be replaced.  Overall a great value for a good looking watch that features a simple classic design.  Much closer to a fine 1000$ watch than the 35$ price-tag would indicate.
