I love the Shadowline nightgowns because they're comfortable & the fabric is usually thicker than similar nightgowns by other manufacturers -- the only complaint I have about this one is that the fabric is lighter weight in this rich purple color -- the lighter colors use the thicker fabric and they should've used the same fabric for the purple -- the lighter the nylon fabric is, the more static-prone they are -- not so terrible, but an issue nonetheless.
