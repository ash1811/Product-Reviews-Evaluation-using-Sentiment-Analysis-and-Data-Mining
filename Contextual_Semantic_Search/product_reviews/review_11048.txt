I bought six earrings for myself and my sisters over xmas. all crystals in different colors from this seller. i bought 4 tear drop crystals in blue, pink, green and clear, this earring, and another one similar one to this - sensational clear. this earring is by far the best buy. it catches the light charmingly and is long enough to be seen past the hair.i would say don't buy the other colored crystals, buy this one or the other earring which is similar in design and clear... they really are pretty and seem to dance in the light. my sisters loves them.
