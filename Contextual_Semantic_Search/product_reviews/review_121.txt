I bought two of these, and we have used them both multiple times.  They are made well and the clip is heavy duty.  Make sure to use it with a strong handle on your suitcase, as the design is such that it pulls significantly on the handle when carrying the second suitcase.  This item is also useful to attach other items, such as on small carryons or your travel pillow.  Two of these belts were VITAL to my international travel alone with a toddler and tons of suitcases/stroller/carryons/car seat, etc.  They helped to strap items together for easy transport, and I was able to get through the airports with everything in tow.  I highly recommend them!UPDATE FEB 2012:  I have used these straps on multiple trips and they have held up well.  At one point I used the strap on three suitcases at once, including a large rolling duffel bag, a large suitcase, and a medium suitcase.  It kept everything together and I was able to navigate through international airports with multiple suitcases strapped together, car seat, diaper bag, backpack, and toddler (in an Ergo baby carrier).  Without this strap, I don't know what I would have done!  Such a little product, and so important!!!
