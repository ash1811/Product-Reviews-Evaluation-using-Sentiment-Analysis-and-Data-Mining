Bought this bag for my daughter and she LOVES it.  big and roomy enough to carry her stuff but not too bulky.  It has several pockets which makes it really easy to organise all her school gear and not have to spend lots of time searching through her bag.  Looking forward to it lasting a few years, but will definitely recommend and buy again.
