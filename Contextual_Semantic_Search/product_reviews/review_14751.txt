For me, the Isotoner Classic slippers are the perfect slippers to wear around the house. Although I don&#8217;t wear them outside very often, they have an indoor/outdoor sole. They are comfortable and keep my feet warm.One of the best things is that they are machine washable if they get dirty. I have several pairs so I always have a clean pair available. I have Isotoner slippers in terry and satin, but the satin is my favorite.When they are on sale, the value is even better.Note: they run slightly small so if your shoe size is on the border, it is best to get the next larger size.
