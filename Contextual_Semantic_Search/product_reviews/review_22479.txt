I would not recommend this shoe, I purchased Jambu Dune sandals in size 9 and they fit very comfortably. I purchased these in size 9.5 medium because I had previously tried Jambu shoes in a 9 and they were too small. At a 9.5 these shoes are too big in the heel and stubbing me in the toe. Jambu sizing is SO inconsistent that I really can not recommend buying their shoes online. You need to try them on  in a shoe store.In addition, the lower portion of these shoes scuff very, very easily . I am talking about the plastic and leather lower part. For a week I only wore these shoes in my own home in order to brake them in . I have worn them outside only twice. In those two times outside the gold painted trim line around the plastic heel has begun to scuff off and there are all kinds of scuff marks on the plastic heel itself.  For less than a week's worth a wear on regular sidewalks and inside a house, this is unacceptable.
