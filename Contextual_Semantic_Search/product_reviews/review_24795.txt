I go through sunglasses like no tomorrow - I have a very on the go family and my sunglasses end up tossed into the glove box, my purse, wherever.  I usually buy a few pairs and keep them for a year or two.  I wanted a pair that looked cute but were affordable and you can't beat these sunglasses.  They're nice and large for lots of protection from the sun and give that fashionable Jackie O look that matches with every outfit.  My husband thought I looked adorable in them so that's always a bonus.
