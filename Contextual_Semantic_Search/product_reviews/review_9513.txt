I live in one of the hottest places in the world: Mohave Valley AZ, and we go around in shorts for a good part of the year. These are the best quarter length socks I have ever worn; good for work or play. The quarter length cover up my bony ankles and keep out debris when working in tennis shoes, which is normal. I have not been able to destroy a pair yet, while yanking them on (I am usually very successful at this). For full length socks, I recommend gold toe, although when old, they do not pass the yank test.
