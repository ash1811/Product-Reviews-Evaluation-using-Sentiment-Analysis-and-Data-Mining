I am almost 70 years old and my "girls" have gone south.  Finally, I have found a bra that is comfortable and put the "girls" back where the are suppose to be.  I gave up on underwire bras years ago because they either dug into my ribs or the wires came out.  I only wish they came in 34 DD for my daughter who is now wearing underwire bras.  I think she would love 18 Hour Bra.  I do wish it came in black.  I just came back to Amazon and ordered myself two more.  I was surprise the Nude color was a few dollars more than the white, so I just ordered white.....watching my pennies.
