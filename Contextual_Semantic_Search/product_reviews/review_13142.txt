I wanted to try this bra given that it apparently holds up the girls like a wire bra does. I was impressed to find that it does indeed have the support of a wired bra. I am a 44DD and this bra holds me up well. The only thing is that it rolls up under my breasts a bit. It does not lay flat like the picture. Your breasts will be supported but you will have a roll of fabric under your breasts. It is a comfortable bra.
