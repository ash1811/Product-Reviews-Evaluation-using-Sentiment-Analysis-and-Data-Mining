Well, yes I am.You shouldn't have to think about socks much. But the wrong socks can make you uncomfortable, or annoyed. You're constantly pulling them up, or tweaking them, or you're just aware of your uncomfortable feet. Instead of not thinking about your feet at all.These are my perfect socks for winter wear and for walking shoes. In black, they're fine with work and casual trousers. It's hard to find knee high socks in a heavier weight with nice padding in the foot. I can't stand crew socks. I hate how they creep around between calf and ankle. My socks are either low-cuts or knee highs.I'm a tallish woman with about average sized feet, and these socks fit. I've about worn out 6 pair of whatever the prior edition of these socks were, and was glad to find these here at Amazon to replenish my sock drawer. The first 6 pairs lasted for at least 3 years of constant use. Gold Toe is a quality brand.Note: the socks are just a bit large/roomy on my feet, but not enough to be a problem. With some shoes, I have to be careful not to let fabric get bunched up when slipping the shoe on. But mostly I just put the socks on, and then my shoes, with no fuss.
