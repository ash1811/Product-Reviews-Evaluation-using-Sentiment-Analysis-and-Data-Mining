I really love this boot. It is a bit heavy, but it's comfortable and once you get the sizing right, it fits well. I normally wear a 6.5 to a 7.0 in regular shoes. In Ugg classic boots I wear a 6. I originally ordered these in a 7 as I read that they ran a little small... but found that both the 7 and the 7.5 were too small and I ended up getting them in an 8 which fit perfectly with a little bit of extra room at the toe if I want to wear thick socks. I would recommend going a full size up from your normal size in this boot.
