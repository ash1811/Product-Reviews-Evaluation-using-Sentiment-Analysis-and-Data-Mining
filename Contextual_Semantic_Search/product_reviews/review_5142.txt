I bought this set for a pair of shoes that I bought online and were somewhat tight as I use orthotics.  I put shoe stretcher spray inside the shoes and put the stretchers in.  I kept the stretchers in for a week and they did the job as I can get the orthotics in and they widened the toe box as well.  I recommend them.
