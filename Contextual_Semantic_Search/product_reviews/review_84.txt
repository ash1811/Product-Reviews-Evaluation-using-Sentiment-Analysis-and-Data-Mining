This pouch is lightweight and comfortable to wear, and I liked the very adjustable strap.  However, I would like for the pouch to be a couple of inches longer to accommodate the length of a standard boarding pass.  I was surprised that it was too short as it seems to me that travel documents would the the most likely thing to store here, but it could not be closed unless I bent the passes which then made them difficult to remove.  A minor gripe, overall I'm satisfied.
