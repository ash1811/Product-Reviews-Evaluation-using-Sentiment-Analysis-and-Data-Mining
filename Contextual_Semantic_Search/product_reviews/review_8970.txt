I bought this in black and it is such an amazing invention!  I bought a dress for a family wedding that was too low-cut and was showing too much cleavage.  I loved the dress, so I tried this cami bra under it to cover up my cleavage.  It worked perfectly and the black color went perfectly with the black lace pattern of my dress.  The quality and material of this bra is excellent, and the fit was perfect for me.  Thanks to this cami bra, I didn't have to return the dress or get expensive alterations.  I'm sure I will use it again for a similar situation.  Love this bra!
