I live in the Northern Midwest, where this winter has been really fracking cold. Below 0 as a high cold. And I've been wearing long underwear almost every day for the past two months. Since I love my Merino Wool socks, and have a couple midweight tops from this same comapany, I figured I would try these, too. And it's been a good choice. These things are warm and comfortable. The fit is good, although maybe just a tad bit large. Which is a good thing, since it allows me to wear briefs under these. Between the briefs and the natural properties of wool, I can usually wear these for several days in a row without any smell.
