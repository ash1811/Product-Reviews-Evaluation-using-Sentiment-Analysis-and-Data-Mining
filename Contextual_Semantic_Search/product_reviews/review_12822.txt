This bra is the best type for me because unfortunately it's not always easy finding a bra in just my size.  It supports well and is comfortable.  It washes and maintains well.  The pricing is also reasonable too.  In all, this is a product that I can honestly say I am satisfied with and I also thank Playtex for producing a great bra for  women like me.
