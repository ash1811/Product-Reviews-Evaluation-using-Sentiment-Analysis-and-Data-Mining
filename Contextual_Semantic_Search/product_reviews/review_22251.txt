Bought this as a gift for my dad, he loves the shoes as expected. However, when I purchased them I ordered a size too small and needed to return them for another size up. Although I needed to pay for the shipping to return them the company was speedy with the return, I also called them to ensure the shoes were received and a new pair was sent out, they were very friendly and helpful.
