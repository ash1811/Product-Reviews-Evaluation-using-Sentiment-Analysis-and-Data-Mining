I love the look of this bra when it stays in place, which isn't for long.  The front strap around the midsection keeps riding up underneath the girls and then makes them look funny...like they are hanging down.  If they had a stiffer material so that you don't have to keep pulling down the front, it would be perfect.  The look and feel of the bra is wonderful as long as you keep tugging at the front to pull it back in place :(
