The tag-less feature is a thick plastic iron on label, that at first seems very flexible, but as the t shirt wears and the cotton shrinks......the label that is permanently glued to the inside of the neck doesn't shrink, so the t shirt starts to get distorted in that area, actually making the tag-less feature even more bothersome on the neck than a normal tag that I could just cut off.Until they change the design of the tag-less label to something different, I will not be auditioning these shirts for my everyday go to t shirt. I'm looking to buy 20 shirts.......all same brand and size of course.This shirt wont be it.
