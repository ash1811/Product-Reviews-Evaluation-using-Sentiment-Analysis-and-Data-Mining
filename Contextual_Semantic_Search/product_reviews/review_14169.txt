I bought a new pair of these shoes to 'supplement' the pair I've been wearing for five years.  The old ones are still in great shape, still look good, but I didn't want to chance a problem.  Bought the 9-1/2 regular width.  Slipped them on...a little snug, wondered if I'd make it through the work day, considered bringing my broken-in pair just in case.  Well, by the middle of the first day, the new ones had broken in and fit perfectly.  These are really well-made shoes, they last forever, they're always in style, and what more can I say?
