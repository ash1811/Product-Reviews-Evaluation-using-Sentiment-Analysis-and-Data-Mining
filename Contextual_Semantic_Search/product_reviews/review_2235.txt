I ordered these in Tidal Blue and they are great. The awesome 501 fit and a nice rich blue color that won't fade too quickly.**update**Washed, these shrunk up a little shorter than the light denim 501's my husband has. I will probably order him another pair in a longer length, but with the same waist size. (ie. I ordered a 32x30 and for this item he will need a 32x32).
