Where can i begin..I guess right to the point is best. Listen..If you are under 200 lbs. and have a wrist smaller than 7.5 inch circumference..STAY AWAY from this beast.  This thing is huge and not just huge..its is THICK and it is H E A V Y.....and note..it is NOT the biggest and heaviest Invicta makes.. I have this one and the same one in black..I bought the black cause at that time this silver black face was priced too high..When it dropped I picked it up.. It is a beautiful watch..I mean it is what a watch should look like..except it is big. I wish they made a version that would be maybe, 5 percent smaller...It has kept very good time.. it is solid..I wear very seldom cause its just to heavy..I dont mind the size..but the weight is ridiculous. If I was 6'4 and 230lbs. I guess it would be fine..Enjoy ....
