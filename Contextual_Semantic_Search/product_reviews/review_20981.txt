Really love this bra. It supports well and creates an uplifted shape....not at all a matronly shape. I wear the same size in this bra as I do in most other bras so I would say it is true to fit. It lasts well, also, even though I cheat and wash mine on the delicate cycle in my washing machine. I do line dry. I have three bras like this one and wouldn't buy any other kind.
