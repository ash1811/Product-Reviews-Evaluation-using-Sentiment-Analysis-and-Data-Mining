I have a hard time finding shoes which fit my feet correctly and are comfortable. I tried these on and my feet felt like they were in a fur heaven. They felt great.These shoes are not an outdoor all-weather shoe. There are for walking about indoors or in a dry weather environment. These are a slip-on style which I plan on wearing these around home or on my sailboat.My only concern with these moccasins is about how long they will last. I like wearing soft shoes and tennis shoes. But they usually don't last long on my feet. I suspect that these moccasins will have the same longevity.
