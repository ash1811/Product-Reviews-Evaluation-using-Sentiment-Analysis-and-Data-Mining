I bought this mock turtleneck to wear under sweaters.  I run cold and need the layering in the winter months.  I wanted black.  After reading the reviews, I decided to order a small and I normally wear a medium.  The shirt does say Unisex also.  I am so glad I ordered the small, it is still roomy and seems to fit more like a medium but I would say this is more for a guy and not a female.  I am going to have to keep looking for a decent weight and good looking mock turtleneck for women.  Nice price and arrived timely. Since it will be under a sweater most of the time, I am able to wear it but not by itself since it looks manly.I wanted to make sure I updated my review on this mock turtleneck.  I have worn it a few times now always under a sweater and I find that it fits comfortable and keeps me warm.  It is not thin or cheap! I like the mock turtleneck since a regular turtleneck can be to tight.  I do recommend this shirt for men or women.  I am not looking now for a mock turtleneck, I enjoy this one.  I also do not feel this looks as manly as I first thought, I would wear it under a vest.  It is rare that I would wear a turtleneck my itself, but you could with this shirt.
