I use this as an extra large book bag. Sounds silly, I know. Why not just carry a backpack. But I dislike backpacks. This thing serves its purpose. Its sturdy, I'm not afraid the strap is going to break. Its really large, the java color is lovely, and the price/shipping just can't be beat. Good buy.
