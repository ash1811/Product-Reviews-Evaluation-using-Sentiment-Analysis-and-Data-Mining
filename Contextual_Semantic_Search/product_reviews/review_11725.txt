I was excited to try out these cute moccasins, as I loved the other styles of Minnetonka's I have owned.  However, after just 3 days of light wear, the lining of the soles are coming apart.  The glue has become gummy and lost its adhesiveness, so I am unable to put the liners back in place.  I am very disappointed in this product and I will think twice about buying another pair of Minnetonka's.
