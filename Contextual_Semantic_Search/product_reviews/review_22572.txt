BF loves it. No batteries, Eco-Drive runs correctly with no slowdown, no need to re-adjust, easy to set, larger read-out day AND date than other watches, easy to read, sturdy and attractive. Changed strap to a metal expandable, he didn't like fussing with the rather stiff canvas strap that came with it. Excellent watch for the price. He looks at it often. Best Christmas gift ever.
