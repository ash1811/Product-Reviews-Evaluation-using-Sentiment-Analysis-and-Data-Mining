Great, high quality jeans and very reasonably priced.  After years of wearing Levi's I hate to give them up but their quality is just atrocious and fit is pretty lousy, and quite variable as well.Thankfully Wrangler is still making an excellent product at a fair price, and that's really what jeans should be.One tip: wranglers seem to wrinkle easily in the dryer so I turn them inside out before washing.
