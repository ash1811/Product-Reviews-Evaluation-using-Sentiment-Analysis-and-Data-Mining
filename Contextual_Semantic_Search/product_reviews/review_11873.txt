My husband has difficulty finding shoes in the stores because they just don't carry size 15.  While these shoes look nice, and are comfortable, they're a little too roomy in the heel.  He decided to keep them and wear them with thicker socks, but he thinks they're roughly a half-size too big, but shoe factories don't make 14.5 and he knows a straight 14 will hurt his feet.
