I find work shirts to provide comfort and durability for a wide range of activities and over the years have bought many from places like LL Bean, Lands End, and Penny's. For overall fit and quality of construction nothing beats these Wrangler shirts. Quality material, quality buttons, and quality stitching are on par with any other work shirt I have bought over the years and far better than most.The shirts have a great cut that makes it easy to work overhead without pulling at the shirt. A nice detail is the hidden loop in the pocket.Over the years the quality of the shirts from Lands end in particular has deteriorated and the material wears out faster and buttons break more often (and this is without the stress of dry cleaners and their aptly named mangle presses).My only criticism is the very limited color choices available.
