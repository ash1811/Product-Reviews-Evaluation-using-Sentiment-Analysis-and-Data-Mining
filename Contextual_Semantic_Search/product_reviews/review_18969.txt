The bad: This was a perfect watch until the band broke. It first broke through one segment at about a year but managed to hang together going through another segment and then finally snapping in half at about a year and half. The price while at first seemed great for the features is high considering it. Is a throw away when the band goesThe good: loved the band (before it broke) super comfortable and because of the open design didn't get all sweaty underneath. The interval timer was awesome for doing interval sprint training. Three alarms, with separate settings for weekends and weekdays. Night function to keep light on longer. Easy to use buttons.Overall if you don't mind purchasing this watch every year then definitely buy it. If however spending this much on a watch every year seems unappealing then don't buy it.
