I have Carhartt fleece lined blue jeans and these flannel lined carpenter's pants, and love them both. When I wear long johns in cold weather I always get hot and clammy working in a heated space, but the lined pants feel just as warm outside and yet inside are as comfortable as wearing unlined pants. The fleece lined are much warmer and block more wind than the flannel lined, and if Carhartt made fleece lined work pants I would buy them instead. I usually wear my flannel lined pants when it's really cold outside (below 20) but I'm doing most of my work inside, or when the outside temps are 30-40 degrees.
