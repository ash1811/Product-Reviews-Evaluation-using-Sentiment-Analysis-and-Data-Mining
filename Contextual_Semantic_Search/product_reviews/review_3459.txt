I am a Bali bra fan from way back.  Always wear underwire though.  I tried this bra on a whim and find that it's not bad.  It offers support if you tighten the straps more than you normally would with underwire.  Otherwise the girls tend to adhere to gravity.  The price is right and I would recommend as a one time try.
