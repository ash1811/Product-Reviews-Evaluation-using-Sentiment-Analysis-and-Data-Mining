I usually wear underwire bras but decided to try this one.  I found it comfortable and it keeps the girls up where they belong.the fit is as I expected.  Like most women, one breast is bigger than the other so 1 cup fits nicely and the other is a little large.  It would be great if the cups could mold to each breast but if they are too stretchy then they don't hold the girls up as well!This bra will do just fine while I continue my quest for perfect bra for me!
