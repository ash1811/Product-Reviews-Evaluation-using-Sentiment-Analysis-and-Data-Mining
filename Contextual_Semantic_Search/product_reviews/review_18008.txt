These look great on. They are comfortable and airy all over the foot. The one thing that I did not like was that at the ankle the cut comes up and rubs on the ankle sometimes. I use thick socks these cooler days so it isn't a real problem, and the sneakers may be &#34;broken in&#34; by the time I lose the socks in the heat. What I like especially is how they look on my feet, not obviously pull on.
