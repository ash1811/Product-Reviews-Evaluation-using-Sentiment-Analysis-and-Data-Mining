These pants feel comfortable, but the pockets are very short.  How short?  My keys tend to sit right at the bend in  my upper legs when I sit and my legs go numb.  The pockets are about 3/4 the size of other jean pockets.  This is a show stopper for me, because I always have to carry two sets of keys with me.  Other than that, the pants are comfortable.
