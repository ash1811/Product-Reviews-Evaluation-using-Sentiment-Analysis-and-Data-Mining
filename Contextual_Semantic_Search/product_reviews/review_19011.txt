This may be the lowest price Timex and reminds me of my first watch 50+ years ago. So it's a retro look. I may be an old timer so this watch works for me. I always have a smart phone with the time yet I like to wear a watch, analog only. I have many watches, all more expensive, most days this is the one I wear.I like the white face, time, day and date are indeed 'Easy Reader'. Says it has a 10 year battery life. It's actually well made and quite accurate...set it to my phone and they both display the same time - my more expensive watches don't. This Timex is as accurate as my Seiko or Bulova.I don't need to impress anyone with a pricey watch; if that is important to you this is probably not the watch for you. Some reviews mention the loud ticking, yeah it is but I actually like it - and it's not too loud.For the $23+ I paid I'm impressed Timex can make it to "Take a licking and keep on ticking'  Makes a great first watch as a gift or buy one for yourself, it doesn't cost a latte money and you won't regret it even if you pay list price.Watches do make a statement about the wearer, this one says "I'm comfortable in my own skin, I spend my money wisely, I'm a dependable on time person."
