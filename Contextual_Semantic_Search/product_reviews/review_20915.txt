These merino/silk socks are absolutely amazing.  Very soft, comfortable, decent wear-life (though not as good as darn-tough).  Can't beat the feel.  If you value comfort, these will serve you well.  If durability is your number one deciding factor, you may want to look at darn tough socks instead.  They are a step down in overall comfort, but last easily twice as long as these socks). Compared to cotton socks, these will last longer, but I buy them purely for the comfort factor.
