I can't rave enough about these flip-flops.  I have them in the pink as well and they both are my go-to flip-flop.  Unlike Rainbow's the leather doesn't get all slick and gross.  It has just enough of a soft texture to it that your foot doesn't slide all over the place.  They fit just tight enough around the foot that you don't feel like you are going to lose them if you walk fast.  I wear these a lot when walking my dog... and I never feel like I am going to walk out of them.These are definitely a more casual Reef sandal.  But they do offer options... for something a little dressier see the Stargazer style.You can't go wrong with Reef.  Some flip-flops rub my foot...but was not the case with these or any of my Reef's!I recommend this sandal over Rainbows.  Definitely a better price!
