I do know Ariat footwear runs a little large but would rather have that than too small, I just order a 1/2 size smaller. I wear a size 10 normally and I ordered a 9 1/2 wide in these Heritage boots, (the wide because of high arches) fat baby short boots 9 1/2 and Ariat clogs 9 1/2 all from Amazon and I love all of them. These Heritage boots I wear for mowing and to church. They are comfortable and look great. I read where some one commented that the stitching was to white but that didn't bother me and didn't last very long just wearing the boots day to day.  I love the distressed look and the softness of these boots. I would and will purchase more Ariat brand footwear in the future. tb 7/2/14
