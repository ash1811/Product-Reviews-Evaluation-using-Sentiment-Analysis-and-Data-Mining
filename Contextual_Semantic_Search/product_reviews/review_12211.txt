I really wanted to like these. I'm wondering if there was a design change, because they were strangely narrow. I have wide-ish feet, but these were much narrower than standard shoes. They were strange looking, ultra lightweight, and uncomfortable, and didn't seem to have the arch support that Rainbows are known for.
