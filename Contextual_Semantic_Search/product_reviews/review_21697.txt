I was always a Kiwi brand loyalist, for my entire adult life. I saw this and thought, &#34;What the heck, why not?&#34; It's good stuff, but don't count on it to replace your deglazer and leather dye. Any shoe polish is just part of the equation in coming up with a nice shine on your leather.  First, I use a deglazer to take all the old polish off the leather -- this step is so important, and I never knew it until just a year or two ago -- then I use a leather dye to fill in any scuffs. Finally, after that dries, I use the polish to put a nice shine on top. But the color of the leather is going to come more from dyes than from polishes.That being said, the shine of this stuff is superior to that of Kiwi -- I don't know why, but it seems to shine deeper and in a more lustrous way. Very nice looking.  I would recommend, but do consider adding deglazer and dye to your process.
