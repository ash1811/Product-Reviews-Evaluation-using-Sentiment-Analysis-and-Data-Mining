I like to buy sweats a size too big so they are comfortable but that was a mistake with these. The XXXL are crazy wide and CRAZY long. The width is ok, and they are unbelievably comfortable. However, the length is way too long and get caught under my shoes. As a result i can not wear them out of the house. I will likely buy another pair some day, probably size XL.
