I bought these so I don&#8217;t ruin new carpets in open houses I host for my clients. They work very well and make my clients feel that much more satisfied with my professionalism!Pros:These slip easily over my large (size 13 shoes)!The create an easy and effective barrier between shoes and carpet.Great for dirty shoes!Cons:They dont protect from mud and water. (well dont seam like they would)Just so you know:I am a Realtor in the Boise Idaho market we do not get much rain.A great product for the use I have at a great price. Thank you A++
