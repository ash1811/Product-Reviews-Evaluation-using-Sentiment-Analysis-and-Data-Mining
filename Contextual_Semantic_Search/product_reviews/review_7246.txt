I bought this for my wife as an anniversary present for our 11th anniversary (Traditionally-steel).  It has a sleek and elegant design butthe picture doesn't do it justice, the stainless steel is highly polished and the mother of pearl face gives off beautiful colors in changing lighting.The band is comfortable, easily adjusted and the clasp is very sturdy, I own a few Skagen's (3) and besides a couple of batteries they have never given me a problemWatch has a light thin design and the face is about the size of a nickel.
