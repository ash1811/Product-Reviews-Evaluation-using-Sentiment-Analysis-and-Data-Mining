I've been using this product for years.  This is a replacement pair.  I have a neuroma in my foot, and these are the only sandals that I can comfortably wear.  I also purchased a pair as a Christmas gift for a good friend.  She loves them and wears them daily.  I wash mine in the delicate cycle in the washer and drip dry them.
