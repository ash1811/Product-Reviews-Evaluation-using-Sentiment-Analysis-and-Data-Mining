Nice for the beach or around the pool.  For the price, I thought they would be a little better for walking.  I used them on a long walk down the boardwalk and regretted wearing them on the way back, and even went barefoot for the last few blocks.  Would be better if that back strap was adjustable to tighten things up if needed.  Even my cheap old OP sandals have that.
