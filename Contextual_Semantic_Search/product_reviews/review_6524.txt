These gloves are simply a sensational buy - even at twice the price they would be a great value. Deer skin is second in softness only to Lamb skin and both wear like iron and only get better with age. The hide here is superb, I ordered them in black and was immediatley impresssed by the quality touches.These are not made of scrap leather, hence no pressed grain, stitching on the seams only - which by the way is baseball stitch the strongest stitching for leather there is. Usually when you order custom leather furniture it's an upgrade and an expensive one at that. The air holes, wrist strap and elastic are excellent touches that keep the fir of the gloves perfect regardless of driving conditions.These aren't just for driving - their sleek sexy look is perfect for a night out in the cold air. These aren't thermal, lined or insulated but quality leather this close to your skin will add a bit of warmth an tons of comfort as they continue to break in. Perfect for walking, running the dogs or a night on the town you won't find gloves of this quality at twice the price - they're a steal.You can spend hundreds for a pair of Deer skin driving gloves but why would you - when these can be yours for under forty bucks. You can't buy pair of faux or bonded leather gloves for thirty eight bucks - let alone gloves of this quality.
