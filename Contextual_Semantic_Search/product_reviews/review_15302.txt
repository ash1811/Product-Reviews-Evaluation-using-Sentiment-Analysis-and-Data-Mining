I ordered a paid of X-Large overshoes for my size 10.5 and 11 dress shoes.  The overshoes ended up being really loose once on, but I'm worried that the size Large will be difficult to slide on.  These X-Large overshoes are just too loose though.UPDATE: Ordered a pair in size L and they work great.  Nice construction.
