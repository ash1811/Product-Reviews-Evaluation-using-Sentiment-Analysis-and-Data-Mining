This particular fabric content on the compression under armour coldgear is great for very cold motorcycle trips  - under your jeans, much warmer than silk thermals.  Fabric also breathes well, so if you go into a heated building while taking a break, you don't feel like you are going to smother (although I will admit they don't breathe as well as the silk).  I also wore them outdoors & in museums while sightseeing during the worst snow storm in London in the past 20 years.I went a size smaller so they were tight and my regular jeans still fit.  I HIGHLY recommend them, I prefer them to the mid-weight silk, they can handle colder temperatures.  The matching mock turtle shirt is also great.
