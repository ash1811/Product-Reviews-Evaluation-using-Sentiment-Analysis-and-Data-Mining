This is the first time I bought a pair of dress shoes that had a cheap blue tingge color to them.  They look cheap, but wear well and are reasonably well constructed and comfortable.  These should last me 2 years before I will replace the heels.  Items arrived in a sturdy box in good condition and on time.
