The earrings are nice & a great value at $30. However, the posts are too thick for my liking and make my ears sore. The posts are not the typical size one might find in US stores. The posts are more typical of earrings that I have purchased in Central & Southern America; in fact, this is where the earrings were made. I returned them.
