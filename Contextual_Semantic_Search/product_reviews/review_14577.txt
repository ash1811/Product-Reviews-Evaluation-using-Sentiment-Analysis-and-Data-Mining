Birkenstocks last so long that I haven't bought a pair in a lot of years and it was difficult (even on their own web site) to figure out exactly what a soft foot-bed was and what the different "arch" designations mean.  They should be more clear.  The shoe stilltakes a little breaking in time, but that's not a problem.  What is a problem is that the top part of the shoe collapses when not being worn-not always, but often.  This means you can't just slide your foot into it, you have to maybe find a place to sit so you can put it on if you don't have the balance to stand on one foot.  Some of the pictures actually show this collapse and my old ones didn't do this so it's a bit of a disappointment.
