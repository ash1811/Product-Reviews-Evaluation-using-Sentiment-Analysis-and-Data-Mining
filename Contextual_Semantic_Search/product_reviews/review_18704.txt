This is my dress watch: sturdy, accurate, & good-looking. I like the larger mens' watch faces as they're easier to read. The only complaint I have is that the crown pushes in too easily, setting off the &#34;Indiglow&#34; function, so my wrist looks like it's sending code messages. There's also a trick to setting the calendar: you often have to reset the hands 24 hours, instead of 12, back or forward to make sure the date will change when it should.
