I bought a size or two smaller than I should have. I've recently lost 50 lbs and didn't know my correct size. I love the lack of wires which always hurt me because of a condition I have. I usually don't wear bras but with the weight gain I needed SOMETHING. The adhesive takes a bit getting used to. Otherwise, I highly recommend them.
