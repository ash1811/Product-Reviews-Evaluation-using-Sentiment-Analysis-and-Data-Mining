I love these boots! They are comfortable, attractive, warm, and the price is right! They fit very well, no heal slippage like some cheaper boots seem to have. These are my second pair of bearpaw abigails and I like them so much I may get another.The only thing a bit strange worth mentioning is that I ordered these in a size 8, and they fit very much like the same style with a knitted upper in size 7's that I have. That other pair were a tad snug in the 7's, but they stretched out after a few wears and are good now.  I opted to get these in an 8 as I didn't think the sheepskin upper would be as apt to stretch.  Well, oddly enough these fit just a smidge roomier than the knitted abigails i have but they feel very much the same. They do not feel a full size bigger. It worked out fine for me but I wonder if this pair are mis-marked or if the sizing difference has to do with the style of the boot.... because I recently returned a pair of emma tall boots by bearpaw in a size 8 (I didn't like the look of them as much) and those also fit me in 8's but were considerably more roomy than these. That pair would have been good for wearing big thick socks whereas these are too tight on the upper to wear thick socks.
