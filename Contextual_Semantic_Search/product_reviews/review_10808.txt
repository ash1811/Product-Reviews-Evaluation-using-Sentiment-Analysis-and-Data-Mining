I have never had a pair of Reefs that has fallen apart so quickly.  First the leather lining comes undone on both sandals, then a few months later the nylon part is broken.  My past reefs have lasted at least 2 years if not 3.  This pair broke in less than a year.  I wonder if the manufacturing process has been compromised.  My sons Reefs bought at Costco had to be returned after about 2 months because the leather was delaminating from the sole.  What is up with Reef?
