I had a different vision in mind for decorations, this Christmas. The theme I had in mind was "Touched by an Angel" - and I needed a pair of Cheap Wings to put up on the Door (instead of the usual Wreaths)...So, I picked up one, right from here on Amazon and I was happy that I got it in just a couple of days.The end result was that I had an Amazing-looking Door, while the Wings are still in good shape for me to use them again later...
