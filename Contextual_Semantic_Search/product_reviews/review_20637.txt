These are not thick shoes so I wouldn't take my son out in these in really cold weather, but otherwise, we love them.  They are soft and flexible in all directions, so you can twist and turn to get them onto wiggly feet.  As long as we tighten the tab thing, he can't pull them off but we don't have any trouble.  I'm here ordering the next size up b/c he's going to outgrow them soon.
