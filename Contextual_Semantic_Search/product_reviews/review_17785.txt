This is not a bad watch at all, like any Casio watch. It has some pros and cons some of which are stated some arent in the description.pros:-The band is made from very comfortable resin material that you can easily clean if your hand was sweaty-many holes in the band to fit any wrist size. I have thin wrists and this fits me well.-4 selectable beeps for "top of the hour" beep, plus alarm clock-the digital screen is positioned well without blocking too much of analog area-settings are very easy to change using 2 buttons, you could lose the manual and figure out how it works easycons:-no ticking hand to show seconds movement-the color is a MUCH darker blue than in the picture, its almost black blue-no illumination for night time-the surface is plastic that will scratch if you accidentally put it in a pocket with keys or something sharp
