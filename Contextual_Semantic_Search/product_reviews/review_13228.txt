This bra looks nice on, and the straps are super comfy.  But it runs small and there's nothing worse than a day in an underwire that is torturing your ribs!The lacy design is nice, but on a tight tee shirt the raised lace shows through...a plain bra is better for that.  I thought the price was great though.
