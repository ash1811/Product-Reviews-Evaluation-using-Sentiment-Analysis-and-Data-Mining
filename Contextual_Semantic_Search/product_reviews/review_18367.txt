I bought these for my father as a christmas gift. He's one of those dads who doesn't like getting gifts and is impossible to shop for. Well he LOVED these slippers and every single time I've been to his house since Christmas he has had these on. He loves them beyond words, so if you need a great dad gift this is it.
