We bought this as a box for a pair of silver earrings that were purchased as a gift.  The earrings arrived being much smaller than I anticipated, and they didn't seem like a substantial enough gift.  So I found this, instead of a cardboard box, and it's lovely.  I personally own many Willow Tree figures and ornaments.  This was the perfect touch for a teenage girl to keep some mementos.
