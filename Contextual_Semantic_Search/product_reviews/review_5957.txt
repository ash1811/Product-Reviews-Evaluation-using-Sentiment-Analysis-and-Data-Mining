I have arthritis in my feet, my toes can really hurt in the morning especially. These Muk Luks are a treasure to anyone who has problem feet. They keep the feet warm and are perfect for those lazy days around the house. The bottoms are soft leather and the wool is absolutely non-itch inducing. I've had problems with wool against my skin but not with these. As soon as Amazon gets my size back in stock I will order another pair. One word of warning, I wear a men's size 9 1/2 shoe and I followed the advice of several prior reviewers and ordered a size up, Large (10-11), and they are snug which is perfect for warmth and comfort. So I also would recommend getting one size larger.
