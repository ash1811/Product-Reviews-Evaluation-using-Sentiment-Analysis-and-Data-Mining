After years of listening to other people talk glowingly about what I had considered to be their overpriced Reefs, I am now a complete Reef convert.I suffer from plantar faciitis and kept seeing Reefs being recommended as the flip flop to use. I wish I hadn't spent so long trying to justify the cost of the flipflops against the $1.99 version - the difference between them is not comparable. I LOVE these sandals!! For the first time in a year I can actually walk around relatively pain-free! These sandals are true to size. They fit snugly/securely, but not tight. Arch support is good, heel support is wonderful. I wouldn't say the sole is soft enough that totally moulds itself to your foot but it does conform to you;  it has a certain amount of give and it is not stiff and inflexible. I wear these indoors, outdoors, to the beach, on pavement, to the mall. I even had to buy a dressier pair of Reefs to be able to wear in less casual occasions!Since buying these Sandies, I have since bought 2 more pairs of Reefs. The Stargazer (4 stars) and the Mallory Scrunch (2 stars).
