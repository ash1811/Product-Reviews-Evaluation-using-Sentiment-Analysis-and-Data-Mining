My husband loves these pants. He says that unlike other jeans, including even other Levi's he has purchased before, these pants fit is perfect. He has always liked the fit of Levi's jeans better than any other brand. In my particular opinion, Levi's jeans always look very nice on him, and better than any other brand of jeans do.
