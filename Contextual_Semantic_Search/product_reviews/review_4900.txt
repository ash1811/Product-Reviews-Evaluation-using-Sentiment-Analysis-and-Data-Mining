I have used give-n-go boxers and briefs for a few years.  Backpacking, all day fishing, hiking, business trips - these do live up to their billing.  They wick sweat and clean/dry easily.  They will dry overnight in a hotel bathroom if needed. Clean and hang from your pack and they will dry while hiking.  Buying the grey color also has the added bonus of looking like you are wearing spaceman underwear.  The TSA inspectors will appreciate your choice.
