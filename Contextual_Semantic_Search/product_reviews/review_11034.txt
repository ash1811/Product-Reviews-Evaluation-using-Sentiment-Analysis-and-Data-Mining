I love this bra. I tried it on as soon as it was delivered. I was worried that it wouldn't fit right because I has a large chest, born with it, and I'm not so small around so I usually get a larger size around  the chest on other bras. I ordered 38D. It fits purfect. It stays up and has great support. It also came with clear straps. That was a bonus. If your looking for a strapless bra that is low cut and won't fall down, this would be the bra for you!
