As with some other reviewers, the belt and cape were separate. Maybe different styles of the same costume and the one you get depends on which year's model Amazon grabs out of the bin? Either way - grandson loves it! I bought a small and was surprised to find it fits both the 3.5 and the 5.5 year olds - one loose and one tight!Seems to be good quality - especially for a kids halloween costume.
