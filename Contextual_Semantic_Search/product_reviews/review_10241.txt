This Speedo deluxe mesh bag was what I recently used when I traveled to the USVI.It held my mini travel fins, snorkel, mask, Kindle & my camera.Comfortable shoulder straps, with a drawstring closure make this a 5 star product.The lime green version has a built in zipped pocket, near the top  I stored my comb, mini sunblock, lip balm,sunglasses, etc.Love my new snorkel bag. It easily contains all the necessities for the beach.
