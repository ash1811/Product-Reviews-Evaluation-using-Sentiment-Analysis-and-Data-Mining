I spent HOURS reading reviews, balancing what I needed - what I'd be using them for, and the cost.I ultimately picked a different pair of boots because the cost of these were too much; and then an hour after those shipped, these went on a sale I couldn't pass up. I wear 8 mens, 10 womens. I have wide/thick feet that are practically impossible to shop in store for, so I was very worried about if they would fit. They fit PERFECTLY.There is something about the foam in these that has the perfect amount of give. They fit with thin socks, no problem or wiggle room. They fit with wool socks without any extra effort or squishing. Other shoes, you have to compromise if you want to change thickness of socks.But the best part is, it snowed two days after I got them and they kept my feet TOASTY. Co-Workers made fun of me because they're big (and I normally dress pretty girly at work), but I couldn't care. They couldn't feel their toes and I was warm and happy. I made a great choice, and will stick with Sorel from here on out.
