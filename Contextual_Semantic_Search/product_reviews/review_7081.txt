Yes, I have big feet, and I've found the XL socks in other brands to be uncomfortably small.  These Gold Toes are far better.  They are plenty big enough for my big feet and, just as importantly, they're super comfy.  Very soft and thick, giving them a cushioned feel.  I imagine the same socks would also be great in smaller sizes for those with smaller feet, and I can highly recommend them.  Price is also reasonable.
