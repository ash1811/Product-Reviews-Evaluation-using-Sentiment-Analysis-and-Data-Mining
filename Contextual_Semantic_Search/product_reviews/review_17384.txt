The shelf bra has become my new best friend. I love these, Another reviewer did say that they ran small so I took that advice and ordered a larger size. They fit perfectly and are so comfortable. With the hot summer they are perfect to wear under a light jacket or sweater for work and you still look dressed. I have purchased several. I wash them on gentle and hand to dry.
