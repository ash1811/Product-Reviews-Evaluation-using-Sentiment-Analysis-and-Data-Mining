Looked great in the pictures, looked great when I opened the box...Sizes do run somewhat larger, was going to wear without socks while driving...Needed socks for a &#34;firmer&#34; feel...Good to drive in, not so good to wear around as if it was a &#34;top-sider&#34;...After driving with them on for 9 hours my feet felt fine, I did notice the next time I put them on (the next morning...) they still felt very stiff...A very nice looking shoe, made pretty much for &#34;driving&#34;...
