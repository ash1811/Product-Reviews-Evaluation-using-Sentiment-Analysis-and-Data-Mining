Every time I buy one of these Hanes Beefy-T's I am happy with it. Often they are T-shirts with something printed on them. I simply buy one I like that looks like a slightly oversize fit, and because the thicker material drapes well, it looks very fetching on me. As far as these heavier knits being too hot in summer weather, I don't think so - first of all, they aren't THAT heavy plus I'd rather wear these because this fabric stands away from the body whereas the thinner stuff clings and not only holds in heat but gives a poor, cheesy impression.I'll take this kind whether bought new or in a thrift shop. They wash well, hold up well and look great!
