The cups are very comfortable, and I did not have a problem with them giving me cone breasts. However, the back of the bra has scratched a sore spot on my back, and the front of the bra, between my breasts, sticks out away from my chest. That said, I would still wear the bra even with the front doing that because I like the way it supports me (medium support, low impact), and the material of the cups. The scratchy part on the back I really do not like. I don't know how to fix that. The material is not covering the hard plastic of the back. Shoddy workmanship. Such a shame because as an everyday bra, I would have bought more but for the back part.
