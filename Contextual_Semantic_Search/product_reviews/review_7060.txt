Amazon notes that these socks are "only made from the finest yarns." They mean it, too! These socks keep your feet warm; and they are very well made and last forever. I especially like the way that they are reinforced at the heel and toe for lots and lots of wear. These athletic crew socks can be worn for athletic activities but of course they could be worn for everyday routine use as well. In addition, they are mostly made of cotton but Gold Toe adds stretch nylon and a little bit of spandex. Oh sure, these socks may cost a bit more--but you get so much use out of them that these socks inevitably pay for themselves.These crew length socks also fit any shoe size between 7 and 12; therefore it is--almost--one size fits all. These socks also come in a "king size" which fits shoe sizes 12 to 16 for the big and tall customer.  Excellent! The sock itself comes in white or black; but the toe area is literally made from gold colored fibers.I would not dry these socks at high temperatures. This could result in the sock becoming too loose on your foot. Eventually they will "bunch up" when you wear them and that's very uncomfortable. Dry these fine socks at a lower temperature. Then they will remain just as comfortable as ever. I know mine do!Overall, you can't go wrong buying these socks. They keep your feet extra warm during colder weather. Moreover, there is a king size for the big and tall customer as well; that size is harder to find these days. They are manufactured so well that you definitely get your money's worth. A good deal!SMILE
