I own several styles of Kangol's and wish there were more reviews on them. It's tough to know how they're going to fit ahead of time since you usually can't go to the mall and try all the styles on. I own several of the Ventair 504's in size Large. I'm normally a 7 3/8 in New Era 5950 baseball caps for sizing reference.The Ventair 504 is pretty much the flagship hat of the Kangol brand. If you're looking to buy one and only one Kangol, or need a place to start, this is the one to buy. It's a timeless classic. It can be worn by anyone from hip-hoppers to old-timers on the golf course.The Ventair 504 is very comfortable, lightweight, and very breath-able. The vent-air holes go around the entire side of the hat so it never gets too stuffy. The hat is made of polyester, so it folds very flat for easy storage if you're taking it on vacation.I find the hat quite roomy in terms of fit. You can pull it all the down to your eyebrows pretty easily without it looking funny/ stretching badly. Or you can wear it backwards. Or tilted to the side. They all look fine. Plus, they come in a variety of colors so you can always find a color to go with any outfit.Overall it's the classic Kangol model for good reason.
