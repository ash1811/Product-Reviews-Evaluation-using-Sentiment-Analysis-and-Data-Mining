Watch came deffective. Chronograph functions are not working. In addition big seconds' swipping hand in not functionig. Horrible, horible quality. Came deffective right out of the box. What a shame! Because watch looks and feels great on the wrist. I knew I was taking a chance with Invicta , but two out of two watches deffective! Anfortunately it's probably true for most of their watches.
