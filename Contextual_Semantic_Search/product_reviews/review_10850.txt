I wear size 11 and these fit perfect right out of the box.  No break-in period needed, although the heel chafed for the first few wearings. The design is very simple, but the materials are high quality and should last for years. There is no tread on the soles, so they are not the best hiking boots. They are not water resistant, but waterproofing or mink oil works well.
