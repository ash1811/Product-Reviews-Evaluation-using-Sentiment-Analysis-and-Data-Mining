Best boot that you can  buy for the money.  I have boots that I paid twice as much that are not as good. This is my second pair. My older pair was beginning to show their age. Only thing negative - I can't wear until my sore toe heals up. They are pretty stiff in toe area. I cleaned up my old broke-in pair and will have to wear the new ones  at a later date. I might try taking a block of wood and soften up the toe.
