I own a few of these in different colors.  They are very light but durable.  They stand up to multiple washing an drought use better than any shirt I own.  The prices of these fluctuate all over the place so put the ones you want in your shopping cart and WAIT.  The price drop to the $20 range frequently.  A helluva lot cheaper than the local store &#34;sale&#34; price of $40.  ;-)
