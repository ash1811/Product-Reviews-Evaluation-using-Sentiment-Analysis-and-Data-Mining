I had to return this shoe.  If you ever have a problem with feeling that the top front of a clog shoe with this profile is tight, you may have a problem with this shoe.  I have another pair of Easy Spirits that I really like so I was disappointed.  I think with this style, the lower the back of the heel is, the longer and tighter the shoe is in the front to help keep it from slipping.  If you have this problem like me, I think the styles of clogs with a slightly higher back could be your answer.  The shoe was as pictured.
