Very thin and small on a large wrist . Super easy to read even with the date and time window looking like a hand in the dark.It lights up well with a push on the wind stem . The watch face numbered ring it self is about the size of 2  quarter coins stacked . I think they measured to the widest edges at the band pins . Great value and function for the price , I would recommend it to a thin wristed man or anyone knowing its small .
