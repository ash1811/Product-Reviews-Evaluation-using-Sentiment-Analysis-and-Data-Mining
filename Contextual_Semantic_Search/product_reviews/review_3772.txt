I got a 38 by 29 for my husband in &#34;Fume&#34; color and oh boy does he look HOT! I'm in love with this color, plus the fit was awesome and way beyond my expectations.Hubby doesnt have a body like a model, he's got a bit of belly (at 5'9&#34; and 215 pounds), so I was apprehensive about how this straight fit was gonna work out..because it's actually more like a slim fit, but it looks great.I was tired of him wearing &#34;relaxed fit&#34;...too baggy for my taste..too much like &#34;pop jeans&#34;...no offense for guys who like the style.I wanted something...how can I put it?!....something younger, fit and svelte, to make his legs look longer...and I'm very pleased with these 505.I will definitely buy him more, in other colors.
