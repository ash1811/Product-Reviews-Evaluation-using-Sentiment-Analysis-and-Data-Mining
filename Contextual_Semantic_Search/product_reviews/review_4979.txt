He loved them. Says they feel amazing, breathe shockingly well, and he wants a hundred more pairs. He is outside in extremely hot weather, and these have not chafed or been uncomfortable in the 108 we see almost daily during spring/summer. Highly suggest. I can't say anything about humid climates, or excursion needing hand washing in a river, but they have been wonderful thus far.
