Just like the headline reads, silk feels great, the strap is strong and secure, has 2 zip pockets for passport, credit cards, cash, and documents (don't think it is water proof though so you might want to make sure to wear a good poncho if you're out and about in the weather). I was debating over a neck wallet or an underpants wallet, and with all things considered, the neck wallet is definitely the way to go, great buy!
