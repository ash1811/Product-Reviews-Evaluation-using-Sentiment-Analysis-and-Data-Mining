I ordered these Ball Studs because I wanted some inexpensive, every day earrings to wear.  These fit the bill.  The only defect I see is the weakness (translate thinness) of the little backings.  They are too thin.  One bent almost immediately and I had to twist it back into place so it would stay on the post.
