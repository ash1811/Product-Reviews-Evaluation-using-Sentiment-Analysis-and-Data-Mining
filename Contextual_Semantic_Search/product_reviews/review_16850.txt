I had to return this, as it ended up being the wrong size. I tend to like just a little more lining or padding; the lining in this bra is minimal, so if you worry about visible nipples, move along. Seemed well made and as though it would be comfortable. I have not ruled out buying one a cup size down for casual wear (under sweatshirts, thick sweaters, non-tight clothing, etc.).
