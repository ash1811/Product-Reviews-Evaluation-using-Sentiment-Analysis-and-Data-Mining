The photos are great, but the product left me wishing for more.  The straps have no adjustments and are too short and I am only 5'3" tall.  Consequently the back rides up and the band doubles over.  I feel Larger breasted women need adjustable straps and they cut corners in the wrong place.Bought 42C and the cups are more D sized.  My best guess for sizing is to buy 1 size smaller than you normally do.The bra is very soft and comfortable.  I do not use bras except with white or lightweight tops and this will do the job. I won't buy a second one.
