It's a great looking watch.  Clean design with an easy to read dial.  I love that part.  Plus, the indiglo really works well.  However...while it's a great looking watch, sadly, this watch has been given away due to its LUDICROUS ticking.  It may seem minor, but it drove me and anyone around me absolutely nuts.  I work in a quiet environment and it's absurd the amount of noise the movement makes.  I have other inexpensive watches that are near silent, so it isn't an intrinsic value held by inexpensive watches.  I left this watch on my kitchen counter and could hear it through the living room, down the hall and into my bedroom.  This doesn't exactly instill any notion of "quality" or give me any faith in the Timex brand.  I cannot recommend this item.
