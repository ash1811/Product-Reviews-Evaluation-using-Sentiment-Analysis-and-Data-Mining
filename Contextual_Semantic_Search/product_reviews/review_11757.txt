I've been buying Florsheims since I started work out of college almost 20 years ago. I have definitely noticed their quality declining: leather seems to be becoming lower quality, heel construction looks to include some sort of plastic material, and the soles don't last as long. But, for $100 they look and feel just fine. Really good shoes are really expensive, so you have two choices: spend a ton of money on good shoes, take really good care of them, and hope they last a decade... or, spend a little money on less expensive shoes and replace them every few years. I prefer the latter.Again, for the money, these are just fine. Two items I would point out though, is that first, the soles are convex. Meaning when the shoe sits on the ground it does not sit flat, it rocks considerably from front to back. I can't really tell yet if I do or do not like this.  They do feel different to walk in, though, that takes a little getting used to. Also, I bought the Burgundy color hoping it would be more of a cordovan/reddish color, but they are quite dark, almost maroon/purple. I would have preferred them to be lighter, but they're not bad.
