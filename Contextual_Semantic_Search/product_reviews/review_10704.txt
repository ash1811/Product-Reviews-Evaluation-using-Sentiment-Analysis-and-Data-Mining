Everything everyone has said in the reviews is true. I find this bra unbelievably comfortable. I had decided to give myself the gift of paying just a bit more for this bra, and it is worth every penny. Also glad a saleswoman told me that the cups of the Halo style ran a bit small, and though I'm usually a C cup, to try a D. Perfect. I'll be buying more. One other reviewer said to wash and let air dry to prolong life. I intend to begin doing that, and I also have found a lingerie washing bag helpful.
