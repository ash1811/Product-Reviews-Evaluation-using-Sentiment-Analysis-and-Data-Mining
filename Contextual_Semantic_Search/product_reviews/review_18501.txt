A lot of reviews complain that these earrings are small.  For me they are the perfect size, that said, I'm glad I had read they were small because I do think they look different on the order page.  I'm using them to wear for work (with toddlers, who tend to want to pull on anything much longer) or for playing tennis (where I get distracted by large earrings) and they work great for that.  They don't really seem too formal for these situations since they are a bit smaller.
