The wool shoe part is lovely and warm and stretches. The same is true with the wool ankle part. But someone FAILED TERRIBLY in the design because where the two parts are joined, the heavy stitching does not stretch and is so tight  it feels like a tourniqet and after ten minutes there is a deep compression mark left on your instep. This is where the blood flow to your feet has been restricted. Wearing them for any length of  time leads to foot pain. I tried without success to stretch this stitching to no avail. What a shame. And yes, these are my correct size in every other way. A good idea but worthless because the construction wasn't thought through enough. Go back to the drawing board Muk Luks Company,I would really like these if you got it right.
