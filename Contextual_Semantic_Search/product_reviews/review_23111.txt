Got these for my 81 year old Dad (for Father's Day) to use when he goes fishing.  He claims he can never have enough sunglasses for fishing.  They fit him perfectly and he is a fairly big man (230 lbs) but I had my husband try on as well and he is a medium size man (185 lbs) and they fit him as well.  So what I'm saying is they are not too small as I've read in other reviews about some sunglasses purchased on line (to customers dismay).  They are good looking glasses and I'd say a good buy for the money.  These are not your high end glasses obviously, but for someone who doesn't want to make a big investment because they might just end up in a fishes stomach, they are perfect.
