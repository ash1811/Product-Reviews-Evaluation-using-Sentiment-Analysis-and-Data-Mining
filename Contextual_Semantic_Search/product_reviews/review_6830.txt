The socks do not fit over my calf! I'm not sure if there is not enough elastic or what the problem is but it is too tight to fit over my calf. I do not consider myself to have oversized calfs but these socks suffocate my calfs to the point of pain where I cannot wear the socks. Shocked to discover this issue...
