I look at my infant's legs and can't stop laughing. He is wearing boxers! His cute, little crooked legs have personality. The fabric of shorts is great! easy washable, does NOT shrink, Does not fade, it stays just the same...while my son's legs get longer. Great item to have for a good few months!!!
