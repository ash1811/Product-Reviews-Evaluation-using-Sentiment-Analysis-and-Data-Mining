Long story short, they look fine in front, but the back is not attractive. There are winkles in the fabric, as if there is extra material and my butt isn't filling it out. But that's not what's happening. It's just got a strange stretch to the fabric, making it, in areas where it should be touching skin and lying flat, wrinkle instead. This may just be a defective pair on my end (no pun intended). Who knows.It's not attractive, but I didn't buy them for that.The pro is that they are super comfy and don't ride up or pinch anywhere.
