My husband has a wide foot so I ordered him a wide in this shoe but the regulars must run a little wide because the wide was a little too wide.  He cinched them up tight with the laces and they work fine.  They're very comfortable, match with anything and look really nice.  He wears them everywhere and they still look brand new.  Will definitely be buying another pair when these wear out.
