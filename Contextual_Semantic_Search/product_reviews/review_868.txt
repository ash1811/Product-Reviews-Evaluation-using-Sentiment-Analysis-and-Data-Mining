I bought this and the matching robe in pink as a gift.Recipient (my mom) said it's too sheer for her and is essentially see-through.  That might be ok (frankly, it wouldn't bother me - sounds nice and comfortable), but it's not for her.If you are questioning among the reviews whether it really is too sheer, I can say that at least in the pink and at least for my mom, it is.
