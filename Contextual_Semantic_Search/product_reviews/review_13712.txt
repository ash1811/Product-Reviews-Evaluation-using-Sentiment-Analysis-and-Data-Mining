I've been ordering a lot of sweatpants lately -- I'm deployed to Afghanistan and we're heading into winter. At quite a high altitude, it gets VERY cold! Unfortunately the Army didn't have my size in a lot of the winter gear back in June ("don't worry ma'am, it's not cold there yet," haha), so I've been fending for myself via Amazon. I am only 59" tall, so most sweats are way, way too long on me. These are no exception, but they are still great! I probably should have ordered the smalls, but I went with mediums because I've found Adidas stuff to run small. In any case, they are just a little baggy (I weight 125-127 on a good day), but I'm very pleased with the quality!
