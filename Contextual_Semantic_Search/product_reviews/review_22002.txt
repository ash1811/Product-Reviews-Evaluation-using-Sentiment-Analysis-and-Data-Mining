These are nice shorts- they are cheaper in price so do expect them to be made a  bit more cheaply you get what you pay for. That being said they are what I expected nice, comfy casual shorts.  Great for either around the house, outdoors stuff, working out and things like that which is what I needed.  A tad larger than expect but not to the point I cant wear them and more than likely will be fine after some washed.  Overall I do like them and would order more of different colors
