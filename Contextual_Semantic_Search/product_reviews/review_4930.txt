I came from regular various cotton boxer briefs, silk, sport, CK. The second I put these on I felt quite a relieving "chill" of comfort that I was surprised by. I was skeptical to buy them, given they are very expensive for a single pair of briefs - however they are by far worth it. I've been buying about one pair every month or so and replacing everything else I own with them. I have recommended them to three different people - and convinced them to use them exclusively as well. They do not hold odor in, so if you wear them for a couple days, work out in them, or whatever - they will not stink.I wear them as my dailies, but they've replaced my other special purpose briefs. Like working out - I like them a lot better then my other compression boxer briefs. While they don't "compress" as much obviously - they seem to wick moisture a lot better then any other boxer briefs I've had, and generally feel more comfortable when working out. I also wear them backpacking when I'm out in the wilderness for a week or so at a time and don't lug around extra change of clothes on my back. They wash up well in a little bit of water, and dry within a few hours. I'd definitely recommend anyone looking for a luxury pair of boxers, and has never felt comfort in their shorts before, to try these.
