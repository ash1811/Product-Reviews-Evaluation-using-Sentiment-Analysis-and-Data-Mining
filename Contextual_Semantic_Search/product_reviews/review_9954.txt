My wife bought this for me to wear when I'm cycling.  Russell clothing has always been a favorite of mine.  The tee is roomy, well made, the color is great, and as I am over 6 feet, I appreciate the great length of this shirt.  The wife says it launders well, and if it is like others I have bought in the past, it keeps its color after many washings and much wear.  Can't think of a better sportswear manufacturer or tee shirt.
