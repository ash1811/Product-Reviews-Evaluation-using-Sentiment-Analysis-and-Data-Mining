I actually purchased these in March 2004 and to give some perspective, they are so well made that today they are as good when I first purchased them.  I did beat the current price, but at $19, they are still worth it.  They are on the smaller side, as other reviews have noted, but they are still perfect for young granddaughters and those of us who prefer smaller hoops.September 1, 2009 update:  I was amazed to see that the price has increased by over 10 times since I purchased these earrings in 2004.  Allowing for the fact that gold has increased, all the same, if you buy these at the current price of around $140, you will be disappointed, notwithstanding the supposed, and inflated, retail price.  Why?  While they are pretty, these are very lightweight and fragile.  They have held up over five years, but I am very careful with them and don't wear them that often.  The hoops are about dime sized, so they are small.  My guess is that a teenager would probably break these fairly quickly, again because they are lightweight and thin at the wire closure.  My opinion is that these should sell for at least 50 percent off what Amazon is offering them for at present, and if possible, I would change my rating to two stars.
