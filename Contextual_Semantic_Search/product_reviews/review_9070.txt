I am used to Lucky Jeans 101 (Super Slim) which is their match to the Levi 511. In those I wear a 30x30 but they are pricey and have limited colors that often are discontinued or sell out fast. In these I have to try on 3 different sizes with each new wash as the cut sizes and patterns are never the same. Sometimes a 32x30 works, sometimes 30x32 and in some washes they are so messed up I can't get a size remotely close. How hard is it to put out jeans in the same size and cut when they are all labeled 511?Edit: I finally landed on 30x32 and they shrunk to fit nicely after a few cycles (wear for a week then wash/dry cold/low) so I ordered 2 more pairs, from this exact same page, exact same size, color and cut and they came fitting the way the washed pair did - Just right. I fear what will happen upon first wash so I may end up avoiding washing them for some time and hang dry. Between quality, inconsistency in size and cut and unexpected results after washing you are probably better of going into the $100 range.
