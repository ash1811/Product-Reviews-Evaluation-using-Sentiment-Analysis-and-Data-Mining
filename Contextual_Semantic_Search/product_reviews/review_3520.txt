I almost didn't buy this pair because of the reviewers that claim to have received blisters from these particular thigh-highs: If you're allergic to silicone, don't wear these! I'm so glad I didn't listen to the reviews, because these are absolutely perfect.PRE-NOTE: I am 5'0, 98lbs, with medium/average-sized thighs.1. The fit for A/B is JUST RIGHT (bottom of lace hits just above the mid line of my thigh)- if you're much taller than me or have large thighs, I would get the next size up.2. The lace and sheerness of the thigh-highs are just like in the picture, extremely flattering!3. My boyfriend hasn't closed his mouth yet... I think that says something.4. As far as durability, they seem to be too fragile for everyday wear (Just get a pair of average pantyhose for that), but they are great for bedroom wear and special date nights.5. NO sausage effect! Woohoo!6. These will eventually fall down if you're doing gymnastics (I did a cartwheel test, and they slipped slightly with each move) but they have an exceptional grip that will stand up to walking around and minor rough-housing.7. I would order these again and recommend them in a heartbeat. They're worth every bit of $15 and I got them for 9!Hopefully this helps! (:
