I like these flip-flops a lot.I like the plain look of them and the soles are very, very comfortable.However the strap is TOO TIGHT around my foot and it cuts in a little.  after wearing them for a bit it will leave a mark.I normally wear 11s or 12s.  I originally bought 11s but returned them because they were too snug.I ordered the 12s and they were not any better.I kept them because I like them and I do not wear flip-flops often enough that it will be a problem.I am also hoping they will break in a bit.
