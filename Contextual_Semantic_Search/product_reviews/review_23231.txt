My husband detests the discomfort of a bulky wallet in his back pocket. This wallet is slim outside but organized inside. It has one protected and one easy access section for storing cards and papers. "Leather" is not indicated anywhere but the texture is not slippery leatherish, more like nubuck. Very pleased with it.
