These have become my favorite 'knock-around' slacks.  They are comfortable, with well designed pockets with flaps that don't stick out and catch on things like some cargo pants I have had.  The stitching is well done.  The material is fairly soft, and is very slightly on the thin side of medium, but not to the point where they feel cheap.  I will say, though, that if you are looking for heavy duty work pants, you will probably need to find pants with thicker material.  The sizing seems to be slightly off.  I usually wear 34 x 34's, but the 34 waist was way too roomy, and I instead went with the 32&#34; waist, which seems ever so slightly tighter than my other 34&#34; waist pants.  I am going to get a couple more pairs, and the price is definitely right on these.
