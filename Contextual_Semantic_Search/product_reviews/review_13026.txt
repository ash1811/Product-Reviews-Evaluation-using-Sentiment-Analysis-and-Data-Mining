I am definitely full-busted and it's hard to find a bra that is both comfortable and supportive, without underwires.  This bra is definitely comfortable, with a nice wide band around the back instead of a thin one.  It also has slightly wider, cushioned shoulder straps and they seem to stay up fairly well.  As far as support, I think this is probably about the best you can do without having an underwire.
