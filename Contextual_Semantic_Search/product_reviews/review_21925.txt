I calf's are always cold so i bought leg warmers for the part of my legs that my pants and socks  dont cover. I have long legs so unless I buy long pants my lower leg always shows and it gets cold. They do not have &#34;long&#34; pajamas at least i haven't fo9und them so leg warmers are great for that purpose.
