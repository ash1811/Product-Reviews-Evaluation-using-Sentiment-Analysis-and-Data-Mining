Used this as an undershirt on a business trip to India. Normally I only like cotton fabric but since traveling in hot weather, looking for something that would stay breathable and keep me dry as possible. This did the trick. There is a bit of a waffle pattern, but it feels cool as can be expected. The shirt can be washed in hotel room and dried overnight. The sizing seems slightly small to me, but not overly so.
