Have owned many tennis shoes, Nike, Asics, Reebok, Skeechers, etc. Always come back to this particular model when I want comfort, od fit and arch support!It's one of the very few shoes I have ever owned that do not need a breakin period but feel like an old pair of sneakers from the first moment.Shipping was fast, received the shoes in less than four days and the box and the shoes arrived in perfect condition. I would happily recommend this product!
