I picked these sandals up last summer to wear in the house. I have plantar fascitis in one foot and am supposed to wear shoes at all times. These sandals fit my long narrow feet just perfectly and offer great support too. They are also comfortable on top and the toe thong does not cut at all. I am typically a 9.5 in most shoes and ordered up in this sandal based on other reviews.I like this sandal so much that I ordered another pair to wear outside and also ordered a pair for my mother-in-law who also has narrow feet and needed something comfortable but also not too floppy to wear around the house. She could not believe how great these sandals are, especially for the current price! (Under $20.)Highly Recommended.
