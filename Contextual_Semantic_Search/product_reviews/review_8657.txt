I needed a slip for dresses that aren't lined, this did the job; however it's long on me though. I got a small, fits me just fine (waist-wise), but I'm about 5'2" and unless I have it hiked all the way up to like my rib cage, or roll the waist band like 5x, it showed underneath my dresses. The material is cheap, would have liked for it to be cotton or satin. But I don't really care, it didn't cost much.
