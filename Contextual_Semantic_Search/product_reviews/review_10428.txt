When your pants measurements are 48" waist with a 28" inseam, it gets a little hard to find cloths that fit. A whole lot of specialty "Big & Tall" pants for us big guys are "custom fit" for 48 X 28 start life with a 38" inseam and are then chopped by ten inches so that you feel like you're back in the 70's wearing some bell bottom pants again. Wrangler Jeans does not use this method with their product. They fit well both in the waist and are not too long or big in the legs. This is a great pair of Jeans and I'll be wearing them for a long time to come. I highly recommend this product.
