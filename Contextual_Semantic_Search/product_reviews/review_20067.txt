I haven't worn my new moccasins yet because there is so much snow. However, I have had a tan/lighter pair for years that are the most comfortable shoes in my entire large wardrobe of shoes. I love these shoes. They should make these in low hi heels and I would buy them. I would probably wear only Minnetonka Moccasins if they made them in lower hi heels.  (Marketing Tip for them.)  I've wanted the chocolate or dark brown for a long time.  They are a little pricey but worth the money.  They are great for the airport to slip off quickly and for travel comfort.
