I ordered these to wear in the spring/summer.  I'm always skeptical about buying shoes online as some styles run bigger or smaller than others.  I am usually a size 6, ordered a size 6 and they fit me perfectly so they do run true to size.  These are comfortable and they do have cushion.  I would have returned them if they didn't because me heels need it.  I ordered them in white and they arrived in perfect condition.  I can't wait to wear these with shorts, skinny jeans, capris and casual dresses.
