I used to wear American Apparel, worked for a while but noticed they ran a little hot and shrunk over time. These boxers are free of both issues, dry quick, don't ride up/bunch/wedge and are super light. These are perfect day to day, don't let the travel marketing deter you.I've replaced 80% of my underwear line up with these over time and don't regret it one bit. If you can get them directly on Amazon with free shipping its cheaper by $5+ than anywhere else online/retail.
