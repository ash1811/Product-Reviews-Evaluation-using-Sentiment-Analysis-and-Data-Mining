I bought these in size 40x34 for my hubby for work jeans. He LOVES them.They are durable and nice looking even for everyday wear. The price CANNOT be beat. We ordered 3 more pairs. He wanted more for work and also a pair for everyday use. They look great with a fresh pair of wheat Timberlands :)Highly recommend these jeans for anyone who needs work jeans for construction type trades or for casual use! They seem like they will hold up well and the color is great.
