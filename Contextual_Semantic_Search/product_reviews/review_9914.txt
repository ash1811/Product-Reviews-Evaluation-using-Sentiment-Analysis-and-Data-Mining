I bought the light grey and a darker grey for my husband. The light gray is a little softer to the touch than the darker gray. My husband wears an extra-large and the fit is fine. He likes them because the arm holes don't hang down so low like a lot of the tank tops on the market. I liked the low price because he will be wearing them out to his shop to work on his cars.
