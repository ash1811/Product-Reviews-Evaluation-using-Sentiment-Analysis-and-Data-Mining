so comfortable!  These fit at the waist, the fabric is a bit thinner with plenty of give for bending, stretching--without bagging.  Length is just right for me (5'5&#34;) and plenty of pockets.  The dark rinse is a very deep blue, almost black, but I imagine will fade a bit over time. I will be wearing these all the time!
