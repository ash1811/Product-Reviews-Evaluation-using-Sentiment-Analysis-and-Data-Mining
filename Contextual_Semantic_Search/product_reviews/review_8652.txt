I bought this slip in a nude color, and it spun to the side so much that you could see it hanging out in the armpit.  I thought maybe it was the way it fit under the dress I had on so I tried it with another dress and the same thing happened.I thought maybe it was just the slip I had so I got a black one.  Same results.
