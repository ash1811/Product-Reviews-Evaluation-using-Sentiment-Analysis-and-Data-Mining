These boots are less expensive than similar style and function boots from other manufacturers.  They fit better than most other footwear that I have ever bought right out of the box.  I treated them with Neatsfoot oil as others had suggested which helped shorten the breaking period.  I especially like the ankle support that these boots provide.  They are a very well made, sturdy, rugged work boot.  Exactly what I was looking for.
