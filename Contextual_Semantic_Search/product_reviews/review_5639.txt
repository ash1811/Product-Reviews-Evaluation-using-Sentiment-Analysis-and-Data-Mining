Wear this faithfully with my other ear cuffs as a complement to any outfit. Dress it up or down. Recently dropped it down the bath sink drain, and when i retrieved the cuff it was a bit tarnished as any silver would be so i wiped it gently with toothpaste to remove the tarnish, rinsed and gently dried it, looked new again. Would recommend as a must-have addition to any ear cuff or ear piercings wardrobe.
