I bought this to wear with my halter style wedding dress this past July. I'm normally a 42DD so that's what I ordered. It fit wonderful! Kept my babies up and in while staying in place all night. It is a high quality bra and is also comfortable. This will last a long, long time. I definitely recommend to us larger ladies!
