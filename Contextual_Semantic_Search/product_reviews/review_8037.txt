I use the traditional checks with a separate register, not the 'duplicate' kind, so did not have to deal with the problems that some have mentioned. Overall, the leather is a little stiff when new, it softens up quickly and fits my own check and register perfectly. It is nothing fancy, just a dependable, durable checkbook at an excellent price. I ordered two, in case one eventually wears out and i can't find the same model again. One warning: Puppies LOVE these things!!  I have gone through three similar ones before, after leaving them within reach of jumping / climbing canines.
