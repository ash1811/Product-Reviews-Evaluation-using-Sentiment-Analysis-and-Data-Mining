I usually have an issue with tote bags because there isn't enough room for my law school books.  Other times my issue is that the bags that actually have enough space are often heavy by themselves.  This bag has really strong straps and it has enough space for my stuff (and pockets) but its so thin/lightweight that it doesn't add additional weight to my load, so I basically love it.
