I am around 6' , 205 lbs with a few large UA shirts.I already have way too many loose fit Nike Golf shirts. I wanted a more modern slimmer profile so ordered medium on this one and it fits beautifully.The model in the website is 6'3" and wearing a large, but the shirt kinda hangs way over his shoulders. too loose for me.
