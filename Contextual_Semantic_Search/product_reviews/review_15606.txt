Excellent design, fits well in whatever bag you're packing. Material is good, insides are equipped with extra plastic to avoid liquids on your clothes if handled heavily. All fine, except when you hang it somewhere the stitching could have done with an extra run. Only one line of thread is a bit cheap when all the weight is on there. Recommended if you use it lightly.
