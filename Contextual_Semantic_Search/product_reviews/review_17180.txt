I LOVE these slippers and would buy them in every color but would have to have a robe to match; which I have not found possible, yet. They fit perfectly and I love the feeling of my foot sinking into them every night. I wear a 71/2 shoe but in any thong type shoes or slippers I always have to down size. Had the one larger size but it was really too long and gave 2 pairs to me sister who wears an  8. Fit her perfectly! Cannot say enough about these slippers.
