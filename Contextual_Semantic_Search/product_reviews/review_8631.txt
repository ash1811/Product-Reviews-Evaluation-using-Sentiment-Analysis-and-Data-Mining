I have to be honest, I received these panties and they were not what I expected. The picture on Amazon showed a different color and style for the tangelo option when I ordered, BUT, I did like the look enough to give them a shot and I sure am glad I did! They are super comfy and I love the material as it is very soft against the skin. I can see why these are the best selling panties on Amazon. You will not be dissapointed!
