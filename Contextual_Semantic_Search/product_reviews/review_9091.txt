I did not think that jeans would wrinkle.  How wrong I was.These jeans are made of some very flimsy-feeling material.  They wrinkle practically on sight.  I tried them on for fit and took them off immediately.  They were covered in very noticeable wrinkles.  The jeans were not tight in any way, so it wasn't that.
