We bought this to put on a cross for my son.  At first he didn't like it--too &#34;girly.&#34;  However, it is actually quite a hefty chain  at 1MM.  It hooks fine and looks good with the cross.  He has decided not to change it out, and will use it.  He's 16, if that helps anyone out there decide whether to use it with a religious pendant or not.
