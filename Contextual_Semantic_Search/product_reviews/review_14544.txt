These are the typical Birkenstock fit ... immediately comfortable with the suede version (Five ***** on the suede.)However, the redish colored hard leather ones I bought at the same time have a terrible SQUEAK that doesn't go away. I've had hard leather Birkenstocks before that didn't have this problem.  I should contact customer serivce, but that's just one more hassle (even if it isn't a hassle) to deal with.
