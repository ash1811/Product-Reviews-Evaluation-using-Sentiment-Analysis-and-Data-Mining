I had all but stopped purchasing Levi's products until I saw these quite by surprise.  They fit well, they seem to be very well made (for the last few years, Levi's 501's have seemingly been made out of tissue paper), they don't shrink excessively.  Washed twice in cold water, line dried prior to wearing, they fit very well.  Comfortable without being tight in the thigh (I have a college wrestlers legs).  They seem to be made out of the old school, stout denim that Levi is known for.  I am looking forward to the next colored pair.
