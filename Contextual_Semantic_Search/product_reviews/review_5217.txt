I love Under Armour sweatpants. The look is pretty stylish, especially considering sweatpants are typically not considered as such. The outside is somewhat  shiny/smooth, not like your everyday sweats. There is no elastic band on the bottoms, so they hang loose and dug hug your ankles. The inside is fleece, so I personally wouldn't use these to workout in, as I feel it'd be too hot. But that's just my preference. I generally wear them when it's too cold for shorts and I'm too lazy to wear jeans.One word of advice: Don't be a dope and run them through the dryer! Clearly not paying attention, I threw two pairs of these into the dryer after washing them. Result: Two pairs of medium men's sweatpants now fit for a small child. Looks like I'll be buying a few new pair come fall...
