I bought this very same desert hat at a local Old Navy store this past summer.  Before I came across this one, I had never considered buying, or remember ever even seeing a "flap hat" before. (Except on the National Geographic Channel). It just so happens that on the particular day that I spotted it, it was one of those god awful hot days where the sun was open for business and relentless. I actually decided to buy it for protection from the sun while fishing in the summer here in New England.  I have several places along the rocky coast that I enjoy salt water fishing.  Unfortunately just about all of them are in places where you have no protection from the broiling sun simmering down on you.  Large floppy fishing hats are ok, but they provide no real protection on your neck, which is where I seem to take the most beating.  This desert hat seemed just the right solution.  I will admit that I felt a little weird the first few times I wore it. Nobody else around seemed to have one. I even felt funny just trying it on in the store.  But after the first couple of trips to the coast here, I neither cared nor even gave a second thought to how I looked.  The flap not only does the job of keeping the sun off your neck, but also keeps you feeling cooler overall. I found it an extremely comfortable fit, and of a good quality that will last for years.  I believe that it will keep anyone cooler that has either a job or a leisure activity that requires them to be under a direct sun for any length of time.  Like the other reviewer here, I got lots of comments about it from other fisherman and passersby.  I gave them all the same recommendation I am giving you.  Don't wait till you move to the desert to buy this hat if you spend a lot of time in a hot sun.  Buy it now and start feeling better and cooler right away.  Recommended...
