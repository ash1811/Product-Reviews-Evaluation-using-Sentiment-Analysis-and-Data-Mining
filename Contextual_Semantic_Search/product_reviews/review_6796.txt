These socks are heavier than most but not has heavy as a hiking sock or a wool sock. I wear them at least once a week and they last quite well. I have been wearing this style for a couple of years and have not found any crew sock I like nearly as well. They fit well, don't turn on your foot and don't bind at the top.
