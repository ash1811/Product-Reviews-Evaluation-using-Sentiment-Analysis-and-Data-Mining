Right out of the package there was a few pulls in the material. But they are quite opaque, so it was really not noticeable unless you look very closely. They photo is quite accurate as far as opaqueness. (they are not jet black like tights or socks, but are not see through)I am 5'6&#34;, and they were plenty long enough.
