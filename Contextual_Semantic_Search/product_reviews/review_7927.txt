I was very disappointed when I opened the package from GemAvenue.  Here's why:1.  The ear muffs are of a very LOW Quality.  Hardly worth the $14.99 GemAvenue (e4hats) charged me for it.$0.99 would have been a fair deal.2.  The ear muffs were advertised as being new but it had a definite "second hand" feel to it.  It reminded meof opened merchandise from the Salvation Army Store!!!  No Joke.  In fact there were no tags on it at all toinform me of where it was made, what it was made of, washing instructions, etc.  it did not even have thename of the manufacturer!!!!3.  The plastic band felt very fragile like it would break with the slightest pressure.  Adjusting the width wasnerve-racking because I had to be very careful not to break it!4.  The "wool"(?) had a very SYNTHETIC feel to it.  Furthermore it was sparse and flat.... NOT warm and fuzzy.  Idoubt very much it is sheepskin as claimed by GemAvenue.  Besides, there was no tag to indicate thatit wasnt in fact some sort of CHEAP polyester.5.  I tried it on and it did NOT cover my ears completely, so you can be sure its NOT going to keep my earswarm at all.IN CONCLUSION,  this product is NOT NEW, NOT SOFT, NOT WARM, NOT GENUINE SHEEPSKIN!!!What more can I say?  I am just disgusted at Gem Avenue (e4hats) for selling me this rip off useless piece of JUNK!!!  I will NEVER buy anything from Gem Avenue (e4hats) EVER again!!!Adding some comments to my previous review:  It seems that people are still purchasing this product despite all the warnings from mine and other reviews.  And some even gave 4 and 5 stars to this PoS product...unbelievable.
