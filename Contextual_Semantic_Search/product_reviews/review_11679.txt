I love these! After reading other reviews regarding the &#34;stretchiness&#34; of these shoes, I ordered a half size smaller than I normally wear. It was a tad bit tight on one of my feet but after 20-30 minutes of wearing it without socks it conformed to my foot perfectly. However, I need to be in socks while wearing these so I have started wearing a thin sock in them and like before after 20 minutes or so it stretched just enough to allow my feet with socks on to walk comfortably.These are by far the most comfortable shoes I own. Im so impressed I might grab a second pair in black!
