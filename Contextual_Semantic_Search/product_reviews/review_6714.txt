Not sure I would buy any other brand after using Hue tights exclusively this winter. They fit great, are attractive, and stand up to multiple washes. I generally throw these into a nylon mesh bag in the washing machine and then hang to dry. Can get dozens of uses from each pair. Crazy, right? Awesome.
