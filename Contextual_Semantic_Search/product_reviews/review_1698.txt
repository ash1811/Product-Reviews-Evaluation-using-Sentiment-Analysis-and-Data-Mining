Can't go wrong with Carhartt's! My husband works outside and these keep him warm. he goes through a pair every two years. We tried them on in a store to make sure we knew what size to get to go over his regular work clothes. We do not wash them daily. They last longer that way. Pay attention to the little things, there are 2 styles in these. The pockets are different!
