I bought these for my 13 yr old son.  They cost about the same price at the mall but it's always a plus when you can avoid going to the mall.  Chuck's run larger so you have to get a size smaller than what you would normally wear.  I found that out when I had to do a return and reorder.  Other than that, he seems to like his Chuck's.  I've bought a few more in different colors because he likes them so much.
