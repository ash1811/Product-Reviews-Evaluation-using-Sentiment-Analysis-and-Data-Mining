Purchased these pants for my retired farmer father. He always wore dickies for his daily attire and of course being from old school habits he doesn't like change. The original/traditional dickies are hard to find. But of course if you look long enough, you can find almost anything on Amazon. He is totally satisfied & loves the pants. They are great, good quality and all.
