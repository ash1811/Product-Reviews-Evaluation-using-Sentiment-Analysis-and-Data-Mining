I had high hopes for these sweats as I have several sweatshirts by Jerzees that I really like. These are a poor imitation. I've worn them bicycling twice and washed once and already a side seam and pocket stitching have unravelled!! I hardly consider that wear-and-tear, that is just way too soon for any garment to start falling apart. On closer inspection I see that all the stitching is cheaply done, you'd expect more quality for .09 cents per/hr from a Honduran sweatshop.Hey Jerzee: bring the work back to the good ol' USA!! The extra $1.50 in labor costs to the garment is worth it to have the quality back
