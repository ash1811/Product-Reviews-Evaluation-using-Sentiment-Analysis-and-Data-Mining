My teen son bought these for me at Christmas because of the affordable price. I returned them mainly due to them seeming to be at least 2 sizes smaller than labeled, but there were also a couple other issues. First, the bottom was extremely slippery (pun intended). Maybe this would improve with wear (like outside on concrete), but I nearly killed myself a couple of times on our tile floor. Second, the tag for the slippers sits squarely in the middle of where your foot sits inside the shoe. I could feel it clearly, even with socks on. I would have needed to cut this tag out if I had not returned them due to the size problem.
