I ordered a U.S. size 11. I've been wearing size 11 for over 30 years. I liked the shoes, but when I put them on they were obviously not a correct size 11. My toes felt like they were pushing through the front. I would have exchanged them for a larger size, but since I don't know this brand, I was afraid the next size would actually be accurate to the proper size, which would have been too large. I didn't want to risk walking around with shoes like Goofy...Too bad. Back to square one. No more online shoe purchases.
