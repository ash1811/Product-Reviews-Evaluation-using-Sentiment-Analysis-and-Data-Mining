I am tough on shoes and I have to wear comfortable ones because of an injury that I experienced years ago.  I have to wear inserts in both of my shoes so they have to fit well to be large enough hold the inserts and my high arched feet. I purchased two pairs of this shoe over 12 months ago and after 12 months I just put on the second pair. The first pair held up well and they were comfortable.The only reason that I started wearing the new pair is that I almost ripped off the piece of rubber that comes over the front toe of the shoe. The old pair is now my yard working shoes and the new ones are for daily wear.These are good looking shoes and they look great with khakis or with blue jeans. I like them a lot.
