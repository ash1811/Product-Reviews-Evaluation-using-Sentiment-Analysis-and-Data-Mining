I've always had a pretty full bust. I remember walking at the track with a friend and trying to jog a bit during the straight stretches...only to have her comment that I really needed to wear a sportsbra to minimize all the bounce. She was shocked when I told her that I actually had two on. Since a pretty dramatic weight gain, the bounce has gotten worse. When I found out my job was sponsoring free zumba classes, I couldn't wait to enroll but felt self-conscious...plus jumping around without good support is very uncomfortable. So when I saw the Enell bra featured on a plus sized fashion blog (with rave reviews), I went ahead and splurged. I have to say that I'm very pleased. The bra compresses but it also provides a lot of lift from below. I feel supported AND lifted instead of just getting squash-chest like the other bras out there. And for the first time since I hit puberty I was able to go for a light jog without feeling like I was pulling a pectoral muscle. Also, because of the unique satin-like material (versus the traditional all-cotton sportsbras), my shirts don't ride up or get stuck on my chest like velcro.Still, I couldn't quite give it a perfect 5-star rating. For one thing, I'm still getting a little bit of a uni-boob. The band fits perfect but the cup size seems a tad small, but I don't want to go up a size and risk not getting a good fit around...speaking of which, it is a bit of an non-traditional fit. The shoulder straps are pretty short and sort of has the bra hiked up in the back...really high. Also, the price makes this a luxury item. I don't know if I will ever own more than one at a time, especially if my weight loss is successful and I go down a size or so. I just hope this bra holds up well with frequent washing.
