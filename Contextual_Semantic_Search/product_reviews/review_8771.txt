I tried this bra on as soon as I got it in the mail, and not only did the size feel like it was already too snug even before I finished fastening the hooks, but as I was in the process of fastening the many hooks in the front (TOO many, which makes it more inconvenient to put on!) , I noticed that the bottom hook was ALREADY BROKEN before I could even get it attached!  I opted to return it immediately and get my money back rather than exchange it for another one, since if that was an indication of the quality of the bra's construction, then I'm not willing to be foolish enough to give them another chance to unload their shoddy, ill-made merchandise on me!  I will try another brand of support bra instead!
