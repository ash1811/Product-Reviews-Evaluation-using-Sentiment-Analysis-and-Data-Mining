After reading all the reviews, I ordered a size based on the size chart provided on the listing.  Glad I did because it fit as expected.  Unlike most &#34;t shirts&#34; this one is stretchy with a rib knit so no matter what size you are, it likely will be form-fitting but not strangling tight with a regular material tee.  It's really comfy and I'd buy more.
