I bought this backpack for my 6 year old, but as soon as I got it, I thought, &#34;this is NOT going to last!  This backpack is poorly made, with cheap materials.  It feels weak, like it's going to rip soon.  Of course, you can get back to me in 6 months, and I am happy to report to you then, if I was wrong.  Oh, another disappointment I seemed to have missed when I purchased this backpack, is there aren't ANY external netted, water bottle holders :(
