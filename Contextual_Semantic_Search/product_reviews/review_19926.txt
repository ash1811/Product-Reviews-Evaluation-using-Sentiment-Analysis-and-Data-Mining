I don't understand how other reviewers are saying that these run large.  I am a size 9 and my toes went right up to the edge of the suede material.  Not horribly uncomfortable but I saw that as a potential &#34;wear out&#34; spot.  I returned these for the XL (actually went with the Black Bear Moc style) so that I could also put my custom orthotics in there to make these even more dreamy.  Love the fact that these are washable.  Both my husband and I needed new slippers so I'm very happy with the Acorn brand for both of us.  He was in the middle of the sizing so he didn't have a problem with length like I did.  Hope that this helps you decide!
