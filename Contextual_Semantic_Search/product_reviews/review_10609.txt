My wife wears 8 1/2 w shoes and we ordered the 8 1/2 e, and she says they are a little loose. This has never come up with any other pairs of shoes she has purchased so I could say take that into consideration when ordering. They seem to be made well. The only negative thing was the seller lost our order for over a week. Beware
