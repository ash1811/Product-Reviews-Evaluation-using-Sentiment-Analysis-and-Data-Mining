I first found Henschel hats in Solvang, CA. A wonderful Danish tourist trap. Don't need to tell you what the costs were there. Found out later Henschel is made in St. Louis, MO. I haven't found a better all-around hat than this. Especially for golf. The wider brim is much better at keeping the sun off neck and face than a baseball type lid. The chin strap is ideal for windy days on the golf course, and I improved it with a spring-loaded slider. Of course the khaki will show perspiration (& salt) stains if sweating is a problem for you as it is for me. I sometimes use a bandanna under the sweat band as the larger sized Henschel's will accommodate them quite nicely for me. Keeps the hat a lot cleaner.
