These stockings are very well made and comfy. The material is soft and not scratch, and the bows are securly attached. My wife goes through thigh highs like crazy because, let's face it, most are crap quality and uncomfortable. She loves these ones because they stay up easily without garters, are soft, and she has no problem wearing them all day or night!
