This is the only bra that I have gotten through Amazon that did not fit. This is the second time i have been disappointed with a Playtex bra not fitting well. I have ordered several bras from different manufacturers through Amazon and all of them have fit very well and I was able to give them excellent reviews. The interesting thing is the Playtex bra is the same size as the other bras I have ordered.
