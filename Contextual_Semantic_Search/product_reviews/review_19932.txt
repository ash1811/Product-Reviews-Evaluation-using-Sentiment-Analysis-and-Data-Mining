I love the style and fit of Acorn slippers. I purchased these slippers, as a gift, for my 86 year old mom. She owns two pairs already, so she was happy to have another pair in a different color. She wears a 9.5 shoe and the size XL (which is 9.5 to 10.5) fits perfect. I also have two pairs of these comfy slippers. I wear a size 9 shoe so the size L ( which is size 8 to 9) fits me perfectly. I definitely recommend these hard soled, extremely comfy slipper to anyone looking for a stylish slipper that comes in several colors and patterns.
