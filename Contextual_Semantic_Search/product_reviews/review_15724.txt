i love the shoe, its beautiful, well made, very nice leather, not cheap looking at all. however, after wearing them for a party, my feet were hurting like crazy. i went to the store and bough some dr. scholls padding to see if that helped, but it didn't. make sure to buy a size bigger, which i did. however, after putting the shoe soles i bought, it was obvious that either i needed to go another size bigger or its just not meant for use with soles. overall 4 stars for being such a beautiful shoe, take 1 star off for killing my feeet.
