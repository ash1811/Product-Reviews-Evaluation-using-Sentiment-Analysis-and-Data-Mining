When it starts to sprinkle and I pull out this automatic umbrella I feel so bad ass. It's like magic. It's the acme of technology and If all of my purchases had epic opening/closing buttons I'd really feel like I was doing well in life.  I wish it rained more so I could use this more.  I want to look cool and that is exactly what happens when I whip this out.
