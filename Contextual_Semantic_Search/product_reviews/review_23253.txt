The basic Luminox watch is a superb day watch. Although I am on my second one in eight years, this may be a record, as I am not gentle with watchs. The first one's crystal cracked, but the second one is driving on like a champ.Pro's-The luminous stuff on the hands and face (tritium vials) is bright. I mean really, REALLY bright. None of this hold it under a light" silliness, but wake up at three thirty in the morning and have no trouble reading it.The twelve o'clock tritium vial is orange not green, acting as an index point even in complete darkness. See remark about 0330 hrs.The bezel can be turned reasonably easily, but won't turn by itself when you are not looking.Accuracy is good.Shock resistance, overall durability is very good (damage to my first watch was purely my fault and exceeded any reasonable expectation of survival).Con'sThe Navy SEAL propaganda can be mildly annoying.The bezel is synthetic (plastic), and after two or three years of use starts to go smooth and the numbers start to wear off.The luminous stuff on the hands and face (tritium vials) is bright. I mean really, REALLY bright. This con is a special case. If a service member wants to wear this watch in the field, one of those watchbands with the flap to cover the face is a REALLY good idea.The synthetic strap isn't so good. I replace the watch band with a nylon/velcro one on the first day.The little compass that comes with it is a wasted effort, get a Suunto watchband compass. Same size, superior in every way.On the whole, a tremendous value for money, and when I abuse my current one beyond usefulness, I will certainly get another one.
