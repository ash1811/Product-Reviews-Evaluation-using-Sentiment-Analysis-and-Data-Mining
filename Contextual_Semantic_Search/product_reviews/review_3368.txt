I've tried other panties and brands of panties and must stick with what works.  I'm VERY pleased with the black pair of the Vanity Fair Women's Perfectly Yours Ravissant Tailored Nylon Brief in black, in fact, so much so that I ordered three pairs in blushing pink (I think they will look just fine under white slacks in summer).  However, my first order was canceled after more than 11 days when they had not yet shipped from a department store in Florida!  I canceled and went back to check and they were then available directly from Amazon and came in two business days.
