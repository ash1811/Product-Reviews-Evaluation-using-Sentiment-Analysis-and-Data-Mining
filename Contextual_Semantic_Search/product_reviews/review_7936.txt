Watch out.  These robes run big.  It's not a show-stopper or anything but this sucker is huge.  I'm not a tiny person but I still have to roll the sleeves way up to prevent from getting eggs and coffee on them.  This robe swaddles you--nay, it ENVELOPS.  Wear this robe and you'll feel the way those street vendor bean and rice burritos feel when there's three layers of aluminum foil and paper around them.  You'll be like, "Whoa."And another thing...being made of very thick microfleece, it's warm.  Very warm.  Almost too warm.  If you have a truly cold house in the morning, then it's great, but if it is merely cool then the sweat may very well start to flow.  If your house is 70 degrees (F) in the morning, this is probably not your robe.  That's not a knock against it really, but merely a warning to those who think this robe is comparable to your garden-variety cotton robe.  No way, it's in another class.  Yes, I really think very highly of this robe.
