This has been my favorite brand and style of bra for years. It offers great support, shapes my boobies well, and most importantly, comes in my size.My only complaint about this bra is that the newer style has a flexible plastic stick located behind the under-wire under the armpit and after a long day of wear that  piece starts to stab at you.
