I finally found it....No more long online or instore searches for a truly confortable bra that lives up to its advertisement.  I have avoided Playtex (didn't your mother or grandmother wear one?) because of the older woman association.  Well, guess what....I'm looking dead on at 50 in a few weeks and it just doesn't matter anymore.  This is the most comfortable bra I own.  I will be back for more soon, and even sooner if they release one in black.
