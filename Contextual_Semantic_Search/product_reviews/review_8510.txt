I love buying these Vanity Fair Panties because the lace inset is on the front of the panties and that helps me get into them properly.  I like "granny panties" because they come up to my waist which is ABOVE my navel and they cover the cheeks of my behind.  I should probably get a size 6 or 7 which would fit properly but I like my panties a little bloomery.  I don't like the feel of bikini panties, and you can see the lines at the hips if you're wearing knit slacks.  I don't care for the thong, why bother at all?  I like real panties and when I wear them I like these particular panties!
