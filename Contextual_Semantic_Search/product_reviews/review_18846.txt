I just received my Bass Margie sandals today, They are nicely made and comfortable to wear. I am glad I read all the reviews. First of all, I wear an 8 1/2 M. I really never wear a wide shoe. After reading almost all the reviews, I decided to purchase an 8 1/2 Wide. That made all the difference. I was able to wear them right away. This sandal is priced much lower than most of the stores and computer sites. They are "leather" and they are nice. I now see why it is necessary to read the reviews ! Thanks, Bass Margies customers.
