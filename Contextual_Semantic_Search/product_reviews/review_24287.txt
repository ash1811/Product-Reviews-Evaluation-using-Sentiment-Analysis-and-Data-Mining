I've worn Timex Ironman watches for the past 13 years. They are very decent watches for a relatively inexpensive price.  I prefer the resin strap watches because they don't retain odors like the cloth straps do.I can take or leave the Flix technology, it activated itself sometimes when I didn't want to, and wouldn't work when I did.  I just relied on using the normal Indiglo button.These watches typically last me about a year and a half, and it is always the same piece that gives out.  The small retaining band for the strap breaks inexplicably in the middle of the night, and I end up with the excess end of the strap flapping and catching on my clothes and falling off.  The new watch straps are about half the price of what a brand new watch costs, and I find I prefer just to pick out a new watch because after the year the paint on the face has started to chip and it looks ragged.  It's also a refreshing change of pace to get a new color.
