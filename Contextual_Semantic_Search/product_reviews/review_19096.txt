I got these for ballroom dancing competitions instead of doing spray tanning. They looked nice and matched my skin fairly well, but tore at the toes when I put them on the third time. Maybe I should have filed my nails better, but they also got a few runs in the calf area.As far as dancing goes, they are very comfortable and do not obstruct the movement.
