These sun glasses are the best fitting and sun reduction glasses I have ever worn.  The neutral tint provides good color rendition and the opaqueness is high enough to allow looking directly at the sun without hurting one's eyes.  Going from outside on a bright sunny day to indoors requires almost no lag time in your eyes adjusting to the difference in light.
