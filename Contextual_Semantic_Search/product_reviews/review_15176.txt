firstly, i only buy plain white t-shirts to use as undershirts. secondly, i do buy them on another site (cheapestees) where they have sales every few months. i have tried numerous shirts (gildan, jerzees, anvil, etc) but the hanes beefy T is far and away the best t-shirt i've tried. i've been totally satisfied with them. like i said, they've been the best i've tried and it's not even close.
