I was looking for driving mocs that were easy to slip in and out of.  These shoes are extremely comfortable.  I got a half size up than normal, and they fit great, but my normal size would have been just fine too I think.  Not in style, but certainly not a Member's Only jacket either.  They make a pitter-patter on the floor like you're a little elf, but what the heck.  Functional, comfortable, and high quality.  I love Cole Haan!
