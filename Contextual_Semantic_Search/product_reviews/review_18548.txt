I actually ended up buying the Expedition model after looking at both watches in person.  If easy reading is your main concern, the Easy Reader will do you well.  Myself, I want a dial that is easy to read but I'm not legally blind.  The Easy Reader dial is really stark white.  I prefer something a little less noticeable to others.  The Expedition face is off-white while still being very readable.
