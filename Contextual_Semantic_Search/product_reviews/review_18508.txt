I ordered two--one in black and one in ivory--and I'm pleased with them. There are shoulder-pads, which are ridiculous, given that the pads fall far past my actual shoulders (and my shoulders are narrow, but not *that* narrow), but taking those out won't destroy the robes. The belt-loops are definitely high, so that throws off the shape a little, and if you're naturally very low-waisted I wouldn't recommend them, but the robes themselves are nicely-made, soft, and pretty. If you're looking for a good robe for a good price, this is a very attractive option. (ETA: When I bought these, they were $15 apiece. For 30, I might still buy them, but I'd have a look around first.)
