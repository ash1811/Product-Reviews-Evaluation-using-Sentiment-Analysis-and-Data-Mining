This was so well-priced that I went ahead and bought it for our cruise.  We have our own snorkel gear, wetsuits, etc and I wanted a backpack tote for going to the beach.  I was able to stuff towels, flippers, snorkels, bottles of water, and even two kickboards into the big mesh bag.  Very useful.  Will use it for camping and going to the lake.Highly recommended.
