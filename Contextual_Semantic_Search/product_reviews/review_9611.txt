I have been buying Wrangler Mens Jeans for about 20 years.As I have aged? I have gained weight.I was buying the Wrngler o04Mens Jeans. And until I started gaining weight. I could not find another pair of jeans that I did not have a fight with getting them buttoned. I purchased these jeans. To replace mu other Wrangles. And I am very satisfied with them.  They have 5 pockets. And the stress poiunts are riveted together. They are nicely cut and fit well over noots or loafers. Strong Denim. And Good sized belt loops to take my 1.5 inch wide Belt. They are very confortable to wear. And do not start to bind in places when your sitting down. They are a smart looking jean with the Wrangler Leather Patch sewn over the back pocket. Zipper Fly Front With Button hole closure.A really nice pair of jeans.  And as my Other Wranglers hace lasted. I expect these too will go as far. If not further.Wrangler jeans I find. Are not subject to fraying round the pockets and cuffs as some other jeans are known to do.Bought here on Amazon.comWhere the Whole World.Shops for value.
