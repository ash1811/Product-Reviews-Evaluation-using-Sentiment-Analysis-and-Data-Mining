Let me start by saying that I hate panties! Why? Over five decades and all I have found just creep, crawl, and pinch - who needs that?  Well, these don't do any of that and I'm hooked.Legs don't bind or pinch. Waistband stays flat and makes for smooth lines.  Sexy, comfortable, and totally stylish.Perfect.
