I bought these for my husband as a birthday gift to replace a pair that he had worn out.  He loves these moccasins and was very happy to receive another pair. They are a little pricey, but they wear well and last a long time.  So they are worth the investment, other moccasins from LL Bean were higher priced and were not as sturdy.
