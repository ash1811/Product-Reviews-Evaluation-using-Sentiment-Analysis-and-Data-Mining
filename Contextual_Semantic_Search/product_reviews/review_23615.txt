I purchased this bra because a few others I had purchased recently didn't fit very well. Even though they were &#34;my size&#34; there was something not right.So, this was taking another chance; but since Carnival is a well-known name in women's lingerie, I decided to try.Well, it is VERY COMFORTABLE.  Fits perfectly and doesn't tug or bind.Perhaps cups could have a little more padding but otherwise it is a very pretty bra.
