I bought these socks for normal, around the house wear and absolutely love them.  They're not too thick and bulky yet they're not paper thin either.  Just right.  They feel comfortable - almost like they were custom made for my foot.  I'm now a Thorlo convert.  There's just no reason to buy anything else!.
