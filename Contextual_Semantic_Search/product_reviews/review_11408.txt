This backpack is very soft cloth. Not what you'd think of a back pack as being, but I find it works a lot better.  Its more like a sack.  Because of the material its made of, it conforms easier to larger items, such as books and lunch boxes and purses.  I'll buy another just like it when school starts again, just so she'll have a choice.
