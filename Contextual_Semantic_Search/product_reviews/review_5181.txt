This is a nice watch and I decided to keep it, even though it is a different color than what is stated in the description.  I expected a black strap, but it is actually a very dark brown.  I could understand how someone might mistake it for black, someone who may not pay that close attention to colors.  But those of us who do will immediately recognize it as a dark brown.  It's still an attractive and useful watch, so I decided to keep it anyway.
