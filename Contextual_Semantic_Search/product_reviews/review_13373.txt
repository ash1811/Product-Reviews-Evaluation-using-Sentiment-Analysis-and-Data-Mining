These sunglasses are great. I got the green mirrored lenses and I love them. These are most definitely authentic Ray-Bans. There are certain things to look for on real ones that are not on the fake ones. If you purchased these and are unsure, just look up how to spot the real ones, or take them with you to a store that carries these and compare. These are the smallest size they offer (55mm). Ray-Ban also sells a medium and large size as we'll if these ones are too small. You will not be disappointed!
