These socks were a lot thicker than I thought. From the description of "light" hiking socks I expected them to be thinner. I'd say they're slightly thicker then a regular white sports sock.However, thickness aside, they are very soft and comfortable. They kept my feet dry and warm without getting too hot. They fit well without any bunching in my shoes (I have fairly wide feet).UPDATE: I wore these on a 4-hour hike in hot weather, and along with my Keen's hiking shoes my feet stayed dry and comfortable. NO BLISTERS!
