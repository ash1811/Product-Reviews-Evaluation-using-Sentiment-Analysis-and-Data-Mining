These have been in my cartilage for a couple of years now...I love that they're so tiny because it isn't overly obvious that I'm wearing a skull in my ear. I can wear these comfortably in a professional setting, and not feel that they are inappropriate. Every once is while I'll get someone squinting at my ear followed by an &#34;is that a skull????&#34;...and it makes me giggle.
