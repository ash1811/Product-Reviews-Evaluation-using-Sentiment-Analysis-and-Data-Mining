These leggings are the best on the market.  They fit great, they wash/dry beautifully, they never "pill" (insides of thighs, like some cheaper leggings do).  I wear them as general casual wear, with tunic tops and longer shirts.  They are slimming (black) and very comfortable...never binding in the waist or elsewhere.  Excellent product.  Will definitely buy again.
