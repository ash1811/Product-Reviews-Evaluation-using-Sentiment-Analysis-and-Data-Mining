I got this to use on a very long walking trip across Spain.  The idea was to use it for a laundry bag, which it worked perfectly for.  I also used it at times I didn't want to carry my big backpack after bunking for the night.  It's a great size.  I frequently use it for my or my children's daily outings.  Worth the money.
