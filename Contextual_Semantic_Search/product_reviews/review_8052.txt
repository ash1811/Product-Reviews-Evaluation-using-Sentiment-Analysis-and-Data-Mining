I tried this on in store and ordered off Amazon as the price was more reasonable.I was so happy to find a nursing bra that was comfortable and provided good support (hard to find in the 36D size).  Unfortunately after a few washes, it's really stretched out and now doesn't provide much support.Which is dissapointing given the price.Wouldn't reccomend.
