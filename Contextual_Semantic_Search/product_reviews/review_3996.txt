This is terrible! I am upset and disappointed!I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi's patch, however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal. This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating, especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience.
