I thought these would be a good go-to option for comfortable black sandals...and they are. My issue is that I caught a glimpse of myself with them on in a clothing store and I realized that they're a little too comfortable looking. Not even my 71 y.o. mom would want to wear them (she thinks she's pretty chic). I am donating mine.
