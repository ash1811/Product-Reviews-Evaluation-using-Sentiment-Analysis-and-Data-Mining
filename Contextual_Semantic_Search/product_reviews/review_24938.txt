Its hard for me to find outfits like this to fit my body the way it should..usually one are is off just a bit.  This one, fit everything perfectly, and it drove my husband wild! The material is very soft and you know sometimes when you buy an outfit and it just doesnt seem like good material, like its cheap.  This is not like that at all.  Its very worth it!
