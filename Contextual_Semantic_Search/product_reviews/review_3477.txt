Great support! I have very small shoulders, and a lot of times I have to adjust my straps multiple times an hour because they slip down, but not these. I adjust them in the morning as I put it on and they stay up for most of the day. They tend to stretch as the day goes on, but that is to be expected. I will be ordering more as my other bras die. Size 38D.
