Pros:Nice to have multiple pockets; some don't.The large pocket is high (deep) enough to hold an international drivers' license and of course, the passport.Very important, for those of larger girth, the belt is longer than others.The material (hopefully it's silk) is soft to the skin.Con:$30 is a lot for what you get.
