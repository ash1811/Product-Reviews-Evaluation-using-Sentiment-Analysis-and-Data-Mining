purchased these four months ago and wear them a couple times a week, casual wear only.The front toe of one of the shoes is coming apart showing the material underneath.very disappointed in the life of these under relatively light wear.I Need a wide width and ordered wide but my feet swim in these shoes.. im tossing them and wont buy Skechers again;After reading other reviews, both good and bad, Im thinking that some of these that fail quickly are probably knockoffs disguised as real...I wont buy these online again ...
