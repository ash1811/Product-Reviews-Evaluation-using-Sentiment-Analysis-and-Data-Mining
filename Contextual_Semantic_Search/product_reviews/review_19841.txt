RETURNING WITH GREAT JOY ABOUT GETTING MY MONEY BACK!Note my reviews: I do not normally pan a product and try to look for the good, but...Ordered with high hopes -- in "D" cup size. If this is a "D", I would hate to see the smaller sizes. These barely covered a portion of a breast; ladies, you'll be better off with petals just to take care of "headlights". There is no lift whatsoever and no way to make any "lift" for your twins. Removing them is PAINFUL (yes, I know how to follow directions).To be fair: if you need cleavage, and are VERY small, these would likely work quite well if you could get them positioned correctly prior to snapping the two separate cups together.SUMMARY: pointless for larger than a "B" cup. Actually, they're horrible and a waste of time/money.
