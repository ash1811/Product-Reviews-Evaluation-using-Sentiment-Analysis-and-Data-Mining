These are the best sandals and are definatley worth the price. I finally splurged and bought another pair of these after owning my first pair for 3 years and counting! They are amazingly comfortable and once you get them wet and wear them around they fit even better to your feet. I have very narrow feet and these are the only sandals I can wear that my feet don't swim around in. The only problem I had is their sizing. I normally wear a size 9 in womans but when I ordered them in size 8.5-9.5 I couldn't believe how big they were. I returned them for a 7.5 and they fit perfectly.
