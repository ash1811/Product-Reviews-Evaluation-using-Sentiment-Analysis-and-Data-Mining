I bought these for my mother who is a little unsteady on her feet in the colder elements. Our first concern was that she would trip on them since she can shuffle her feet a bit, but these were not a problem. She was concerned about slipping on them but also not a concern since when she steps down, they &#34;smush&#34; into the shoe. She was very surprised how comfortable on her shoes they were, how she barely noticed them when walking and how easy it was to use them in/out of the car and working the pedals.
