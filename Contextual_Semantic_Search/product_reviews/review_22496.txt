I&#8217;ve had this watch a couple years and it&#8217;s still working great.  It does need recharging every 6 months.  All this means is that you need to place the watch in bright sunlight or artificial light for 24-48 hours to recharge the solar batteries.  I&#8217;ve gotten rid of all my other battery driven watches, saving money and hassle in the long run.
