These jeans are perfect for guys who hate the disgusting look of sagging baggy pants. I myself being a small slim guy (28 waist), have a difficult time finding mens pants that really fit. These Wrangler's are the best fitting pant I have found in a long time. They are excellent quality jeans with a 1 year replacement guarantee from the manufacturer. I highly recommend them for slim guy's who want a good fit.
