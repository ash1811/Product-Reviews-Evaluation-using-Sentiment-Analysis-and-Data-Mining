I bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves them!  Unfortunately, I also love to wear them.  Haha.  The waistband is awesome.  Really well-made.One recommendation, though.  This is the second pair of these pants that we've purchased.  He put the other pair through the dryer and they are not nearly as soft anymore.  We hung this pair to dry and washed them in cold; they're in great shape!  I'd recommend cold wash and hang dry.
