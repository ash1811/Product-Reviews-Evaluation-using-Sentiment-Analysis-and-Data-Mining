I've had these sandals for about a year. My brother swears by them and is on his second pair. First, they are very comfortable, and you forget you have them on. I like the closed toe design, which helps keep stones and sticks from getting in under your feet. That said, I will never buy another pair of these. Why? They smell more than any other sandal I've worn. I'm 60+ and have had my share of sandals. These are the worst regarding smell. On a recent road trip w/ my wife and brother, if one of us took our Keens off in the car, the windows went down and complaints went up! We laughed about it, but it was irritating nonetheless. Sure, washing them helps, for awhile. Depending on how often you wear them, you may need to wash them weekly. The 'anti-microbial' treatment of the sole is a laugh. I've had Merrell's that have never had this problem. And my leather-insoled sandals never smell. I've read so many other complaints about the smell of these sandals, that I know it is a problem. And I don't think we need to hear about washing/powdering our feet as a solution. The solution for me is to look for a different brand of sandals.
