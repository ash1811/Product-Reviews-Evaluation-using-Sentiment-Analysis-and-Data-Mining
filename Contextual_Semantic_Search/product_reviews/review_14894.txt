Love the long arms - wish the shirt was 2 inches longer at the hem. I've washed it many times - color is still good - I hang it to dry to avoid shrinking. It's soft and warm and holding up well. I'm 5'7&#34; and athletic. I like long sleeves so that I have the option of the cuff covering my hands when I first get outside and am cold. The cuffs are not tight but they have enough elastic that they stay pushed up on my arm if I want them there. I would prefer the hem to fall below my hip but this is pretty good.
