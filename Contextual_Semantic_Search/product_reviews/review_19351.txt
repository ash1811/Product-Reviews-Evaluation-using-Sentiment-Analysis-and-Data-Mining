Nothing else compares to authentic Uggs!  The size 7 is a perfect fit which will be fine when they stretch with use.  Not tight but not loose right now.  Perfect.  They fill so great on the bare feet.  I've been wearing Fuggs the past few years (faux Uggs) and although they work they don't have that wonderful fit and feel.
