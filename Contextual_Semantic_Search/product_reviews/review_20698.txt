The shoe is great.  Well made.  Stylish.  BUT.  Like other reviewers noted, the shoe is much too narrow and is not true to size.  Plus, Amazon charged $4.98 to return it rather than their usual free return-shipping.  The product was actually defective in that the size is not true; so the return-shipping should have been free.  But one cannot keep shoes that don't fit.  So, I'm returning them.
