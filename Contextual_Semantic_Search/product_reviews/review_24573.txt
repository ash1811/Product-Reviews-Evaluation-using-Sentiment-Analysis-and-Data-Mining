I originally got it to clean up a bronze torc that I have and wear regularly, which slowly tarnishes (and darkens) the finish.  I wasn't even sure it would work, but from all that I read, I was fairly sure that it at least wouldn't damage it or scratch it up.  Well, it not only worked, it worked fast and very well!  It only took me about three minutes to have the torc shining like new again; very impressed!  I went on to shine up a few pairs of silver earrings and rings that were in need, and again, quick, easy and beautiful!The best part is that there is no mess like there is with the liquid cleaners, and the cleaning cloth is stitched to the polishing cloth so you always have them together.
