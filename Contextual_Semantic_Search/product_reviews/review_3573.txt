My husband suffers from lymphedema. He had been wearing the dress socks for some years, but found that the band was digging at the top of his leg, as his condition exacerbated. Some months ago, he tried a pair of the athletic socks. He says that they are much more comfortable,  and easier to put on than the other socks. In the same size as the other socks, he finds that these do not bind at the top. He just ordered another half dozen pair.
