These are simply great Jeans.  The material is the right weight to be worn for many occasions.  I personally like the lighter weight material, but it also lends itself better to occasions when you are trying to dress the jeans up with a sport jacket or nice sweater.  These are well made, fit really well and are extremely comfortable.  I went ahead and purchased a couple more pair and would reccomend them to anyone wanting a fashionable jean but not wanting to pay tons of money for it.
