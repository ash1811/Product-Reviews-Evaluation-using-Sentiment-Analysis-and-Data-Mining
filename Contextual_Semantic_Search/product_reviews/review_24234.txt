It's very beautiful and arrived very quick, the packaging was very nice. But, I don't know if it's a one time defect or if it's the workmanship. On the front right side of the heart, it has an opening all the way through. It doesn't look like it's broken, just seems like it wasn't welded together as it should've been. It doesn't affect how it works (open or closing), just irritates me. Gives a perfect heart a flaw. Forgot to mention, I bought it as a gift to give my mother.I gave it two stars because it's still pretty nonetheless, but it's not worth that price. The most I believe it's worth is $25.
