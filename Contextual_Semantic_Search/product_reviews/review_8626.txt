The look is fantastic and sexy and the fit just GREAT no creeping up your butt even on full round butts also true to size if not slightly generous and all those colors, yes, I have them all. That said, they are Hot Hot Hot in the summer. The crotch is cotton but the rest is not so you do feel sweaty after a short time if you work outside in hot climates. Too bad they can't make them in all cotton, they fit similar to the all cotton "Delicates" brand that Penny's discontinued, I'm still crying over that! These are still the best I've found for comfortable fit and you can find them on sale for 6 or 7 dollars a pair. I love them but I'm still looking for the cotton version of these, hope Vanity Fair is listening! Oh and you'll love this................BEST PART:Here is the best thing about these, The fit is so great you can wear it as a bikini swim suit bottom, REALLY! I can't find a descent fitting bikini bottom anywhere so I wear these in Black or a color and just buy inexpensive 5 or 6 dollar triangle bikini tops on ebay to match, PERFECT! What a great bikini swimsuit alternative and a cheap one at that. No more bad fitting bikini crisis! Nobody will know you are walking around in public in your underwear, kind of fun too! Why can't anyone make a swimsuit that fits like this? Then again they would charge you 90.00 for the same thing while these work just fine, try it!
