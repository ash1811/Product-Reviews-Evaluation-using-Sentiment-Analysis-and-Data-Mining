Got this for my husband's grandmother for Christmas in Turquoise. The color was exactly as pictured, the shawl was very soft and fairly warm without being heavy, and decent quality. I'm pretty picky about the quality of gifts- if the material had been too thin or flimsy, I would have found something else to give her. I was very pleased with this, and would and will buy these again as gifts for others. More importantly my husband's grandmother was delighted with the shawl and declared it 'very pretty', so if she's happy, I'm happy!
