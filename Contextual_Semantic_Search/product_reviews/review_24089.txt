My boys were batman and robin for this Halloween. My oldest wore this costume (3.5 years old). It fit him perfectly and was ALMOST too small. The construction was very poor of this costume. Loose strings and threads. I love that the mask and cape were one piece but the closure was really itchy on my son and he kept saying it "hurt" he also wore this once without a shirt on and his skin was very red like after he did. Almost chemical burn like? it healed up in a few days. It was very odd.It looked adorable but was not at all well made and I'm still concerned about my sons skin turning red.
