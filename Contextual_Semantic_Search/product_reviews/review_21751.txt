I expected this to be waterproof and a lot warmer, so I have been very disappointed in it. I got soaked through every layer wearing it in rain, and it isn't as warm as I need for riding a motorcycle on a 40 degree day. I can't imagine riding a snowmobile is dryer than riding a motorcycle, and snowmobiling would be in even colder temperatures! It's not adequate at all for my needs.Very disappointing.
