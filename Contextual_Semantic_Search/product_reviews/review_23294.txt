Works great in ourNew Trent CD-3800 Digital Ultrasonic for Jewelry, Eyeglass, and Dentures Cleaner.  I used it to clean a 3yr old Casio Gshock watch that has never been cleaned and was filthy and it worked great.  I also have used it to clean my fiances diamond ring and sunglasses and it works great for those too.
