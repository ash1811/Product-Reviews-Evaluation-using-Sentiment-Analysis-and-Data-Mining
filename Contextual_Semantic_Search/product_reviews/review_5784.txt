This shirt wasn't especially heavy, but it's thicker than what you would get in a typical pack of white undershirts, for example. It's pretty much the weight you would expect for a T-Shirt meant to be worn as a stand alone outer shirt, nothing more. And comfortable soft cotton, the stitching seems good quality, no flaws or loose threads, looks good. And the color hasn't bled at all, no blotches or spots now, still looks very good after owning it for 8 months.So really, just right for me.  If you want something extra heavy for warmth, this might not do.  But for me, it's exactly what I want, something to wear outdoors on a warm day, that's heavy enough and with enough quality that it's durable, looks good, and doesn't look cheap.
