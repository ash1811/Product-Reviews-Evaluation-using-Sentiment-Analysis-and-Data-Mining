I already used this boot at my first station. When I got a position at my second station I bought the exact same pair. They fit true to size and are really comfortable. I bought them on amazon for half the listed price for the big box store (that rhymes with Rears) and got them really quick. Definitely will buy these again when I get another uniform stipend.
