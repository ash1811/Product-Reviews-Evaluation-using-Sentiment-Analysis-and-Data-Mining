This shirt looks and feels like it's a quality product. It repels water, it doesn't wrinkle, and it doesn't stain easily. These are designed for work but they can also be used to help conceal objects (e.g. weapons). These shirts are not stylish or fashionable in my opinion so I wouldn't wear this at a club, party, or any social gathering. In the end, I can easily recommend this shirt for certain occasions.
