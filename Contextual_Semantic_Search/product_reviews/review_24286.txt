I've been wearing Timex Ironman watches for over 10 years. It's true that the fabric or velcro bands get stinky (usually permanent old-sponge odor), and I'm not even a sweaty or stinky person. So, I get the resin (soft plastic), which is stink-resistant and washable. True, the resin band does have a tiny resin ring through which the remaining band is threaded - and this breaks off in maybe a year or two; but you can just cut off the remainder of the band off (the part with the spaced holes), and still wear it just fine if you're not easily embarrassed or very finicky (no one notices, as fas as I know). That's what I've been doing with my current two pairs for the past three years (one is mine, one was salvaged from a male friend). (fyi: I just saw a $12 replacement band for Ironman sold on Amazon.) The batteries have lasted over four years. What I love most is the Indigo Light to see what time it is in the dark, especially before the crack of dawn. Ironman is VERY durable and dependable, too; scratches have never been an issue.  I own many Movado's and Skagens, a Seiko and a Swatch . . . but the Ironman is far and away my go-to no-worry watch. I feel lost and get upset when I can't find mine . . . good thing I own two!! I'm 5'3" with a 5-7/8" wrist (small) wrist, and this fits perfectly - at the perfect wrist location - using the smallest band setting. This watch looks fine on average-size males I've seen, but - if you're a BIG-type guy - you probably want a BIG-ger watch. This measures about 1-3/8" at it's largest diameter. OK, I love this watch . . . thought I should give it my endorsement. Hope that doesn't make the price go up and the inventory go kaput :/
