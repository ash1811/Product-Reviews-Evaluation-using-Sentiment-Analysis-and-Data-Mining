After five or so years I finally converted my husband over to Skecher's. These are now the only shoes he will wear.  He is able to wear jeans to work so he literally wears these all day long. The shoe is very sturdy and comfortable.  The color works well as it masks the dust from the dirt parking lot at the workplace.
