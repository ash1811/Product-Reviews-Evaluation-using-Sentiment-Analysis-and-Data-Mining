Picky husband accepted these. He is very tall, and particular about clothing. Lots of specifications to the way they have to fit him besides just a simple waist and leg measurement (38w 34inseam). He talks about "rise" and whether or not the thigh area is generous enough. I just keep trying, and return them if they are rejected. He was pleased with the fit of these, and I was happy because they are wrinkle resistant.
