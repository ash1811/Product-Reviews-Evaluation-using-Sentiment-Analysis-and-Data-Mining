I am 6 foot 5 inches 320 pounds. I ordered a 3xl and I have to say this is the first sweatshirt I ever purchased that is a perfect fit. I am a former plant manager of a competitor factory of this company. I can honestly say they know what they are doing. this is good quality fits well and for the first time somebody knows how to design for a true tall large person
