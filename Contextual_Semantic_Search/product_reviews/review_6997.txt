I bought the white and they are typical gold-toe quality socks.  Not premium, but not bad.  I got the large 13-15 (Shoe: 12-16) size even though I wear a size 10 1/2-11 shoe.  I am tired of the one size fits all (6-12 shoe size) which are too tight on my legs and cut off circulation.  I was not sure if these would be too big, but actually, they fit great and are much more comfortable.  I plan to order more.2012-02-17 Update: Very happy with these and did order more.  If you, like me, are looking for socks that are not so tight and binding; here are some of the low cut gold-toe that are also very good:Gold Toe Men's Cotton Liner Athletic Sock, 6-PackThey fit nicely and are not tight.  Love 'em.
