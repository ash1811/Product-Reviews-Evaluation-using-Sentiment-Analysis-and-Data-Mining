This held all my husband's basic toiletries, and saved a ton of packing space in his roll aboard. All the zippered compartments made organizing his stuff a lot easier, and it even expands on one end to make it bigger. My only issue is that I ordered it in titanium to match his ebags packing cubes set, and Amazon sent me a blue one by mistake. Too close to trip to exchange it, and husband was okay with it not matching.
