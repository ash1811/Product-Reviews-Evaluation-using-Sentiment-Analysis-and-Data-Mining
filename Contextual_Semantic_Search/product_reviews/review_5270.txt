I saw this watch and loved it. It looks great and feels even better. It a good match - perfect for the Boardroom and you can lift in it after work. However, the thing is a battery killer! I could rarely keep the analog part (which uses more energy) from running. It would stop, while the digital part would keep working. That kind of annoyed me. So, I sold it and got a pure digital Ironman with a metal band. It's better is all respects other than looks - it just doesn't look as good as this watch does.
