I have been looking for a while for a place to put a lot of jewelry. Was always nervous putting it all in one place, but tired of little boxes everywhere or small boxes with jewelry piled up on top of each other. This one is nice. Lots of drawers, sections, hanging for necklaces so they don't get all tangled up. The box is not super fancy, bit nice. Not heavy duty but made well enough that it is not falling apart. I like that everything closes up, that it's easy to move yet very stable. I read all the reviews, was afraid it might not be well made, but it is good enough. I am very happy with this purchase and am glad I finally got it!
