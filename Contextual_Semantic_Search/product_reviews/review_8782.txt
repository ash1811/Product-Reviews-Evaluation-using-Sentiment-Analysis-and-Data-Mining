This bra is pretty comfortable, and gratefully all cotton.  My chiropractor is helping me work on my posture, and this definitely helps.  I have a large bosom, and the extra support is welcome.  The only con is sometimes I struggle with the hook and eye closures.  It was a smidgeon too big, but once it went through the dryer, it fit great.
