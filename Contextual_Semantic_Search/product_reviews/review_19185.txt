Do not recall if I bought this for myself or for my daughter.  Imagine my daughter as it is advertised as nickel free.  I can wear cheap jewelry without problem, but my daughter is allergic to many silvers or white golds due to the nickel.  Regardless, I'm happy with the ones I bought myself and my daughter has not complained the necklace I gave her has broken her out (& have seen it on her), so like whichever one it is.
