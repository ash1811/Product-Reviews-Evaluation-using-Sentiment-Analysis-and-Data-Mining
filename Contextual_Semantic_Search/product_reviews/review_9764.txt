Our preschool music teacher is retiring and moving away at the end of this school year.  The school gave this watch to her as her retirement gift.  She LOVES it.  The watch is a really great size - larger than I thought it would be, which is good.  The colors are pretty and vibrant.  I want one for myself now!
