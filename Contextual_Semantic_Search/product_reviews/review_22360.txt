I've been wearing Reef flip flops for over 10 years and have always worn a women's size 9. I recently ordered two pair of this flip flop in size 9 and they are too small. When compared to my old Reefs, the new size 9 is about half an inch shorter. I had to send both pair back. Will try again with a size 10, but fear they will be too big. I'm really disappointed that Reef has changed their sizing. Boo.
