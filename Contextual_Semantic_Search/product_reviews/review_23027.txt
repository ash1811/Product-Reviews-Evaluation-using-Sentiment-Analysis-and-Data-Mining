I work in an office and thus need to wear a basic black shoe from Monday through Thursday every week.  Being a frugal guy I try to never spend more than about $50 on a pair of shoes for work.  However I was also looking for something comfortable and durable, which will bend and flex with my foot rather than just being stiff.  These shoes fit the bill perfectly at a price I could handle.  I tried them on in a store first to see how they'd fit and then ordered from amazon where they were about $25 cheaper (hitting my $50 limit).  I have a 9.5 very average (D-width) foot and I took a size 9 D in these.  I've been wearing them a little over a month and they are very comfortable and aren't scuffing up too quickly.  Time will tell how durable these are but for $50 if I get a couple years out of them I think they're still a good value. Recommended.
