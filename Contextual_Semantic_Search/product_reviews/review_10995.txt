As everyone else has stated these earrings are very sparkly.  I got compliments on them the first day I wore them.  They are not too heavy and the length is correct in the description.  I thought they would be a bit fuller but each earring has 6 crystals that all have beautiful color and shine.  They are definitely adorable and I could not stop twirling to get them to dangle.  Overall, a fantastic bargain.
