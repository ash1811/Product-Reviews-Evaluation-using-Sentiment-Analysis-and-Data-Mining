This doesn't shrink. I ordered a size smaller and it was still very generous, like another half person could fit in it, heh heh.  As far as style, there isn't much of it. It is like a big bag. It is definitely an old lady's comfy home dress. The material is thin.  If you answer the front door wearing this you may want to make sure you are wearing a bra and slip under it because it will be noticeable.
