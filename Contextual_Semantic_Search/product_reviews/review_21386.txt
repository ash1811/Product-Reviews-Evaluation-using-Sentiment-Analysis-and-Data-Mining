These shoes fit comfortably and are kind of cute with the little edge of camouflage around the edge of the soles. It's funny - when I  was getting out my summer shoes from storage, I discovered that I bought the exact same shoe last year in navy with white soles. The green pair, for some reason, fits better (not as loose). So I'm happy.
