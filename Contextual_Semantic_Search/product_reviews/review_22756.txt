Ok.  I used to love Rothco BDU's.  But they seem to have no quality control, as 3 out of the 4 I ordered in the last month are DEFECTIVE.  Direct Premium Buys and Army Universe are no help either.  DPB promised not to charge me a re-stock fee, then did anyway (after sending me more defective pants, which I again had to pay to ship back to them).  These companies keep charging me money, and I still don't have my darn pants!  I will be ordering my BDU's through LAPG from now on.
