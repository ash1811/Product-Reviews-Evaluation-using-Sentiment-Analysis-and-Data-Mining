While this shoe is very comfy, I consider it one of my heaviest shoes. It's quite soft from the inside and hard from the outside but it's really bulky (at least for me) It's more of a boot. I wouldn't say it looks really elegant cause the rubber is too shiny and honestly I've been wearing classier shoes. While I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is looking for a light elegant slip on, I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't really care about the previous 2 points but really cares about comfort and rigidity.
