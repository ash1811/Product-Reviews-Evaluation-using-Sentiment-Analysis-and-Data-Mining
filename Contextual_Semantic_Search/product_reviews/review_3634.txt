Thinner material, 5 loops, yeah the customers wanted that...riiight!  These 505 are cheap and are not the Real 505 of just 2 years ago.  The waist line is cut lower.Thank you Levi, you just lost a 45 years life long Brand name consumer, including the Docker Brand.  Glad you saved a whole nickel on the removal of 2 belt loops.
