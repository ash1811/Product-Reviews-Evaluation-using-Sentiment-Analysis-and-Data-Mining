I've purchased these in several colors (classic pink, light blue, navy (denim), yellow (banana), and athletic heather). I find they are not cut roomy enough. I'm a woman who wears men's T-shirts in order to get more room in the shoulders and a longer length. I usually don't have a problem with fit, until I bought these in colors.The athletic heather fit fine and washed and held up well but the colors fit differently - cut slimmer. The colors also shrink much more than athletic heather. Colors also lost pigment in blotchy patches. Not sure why since I never use bleach in any part of my laundry.The reason athletic heather acts differently (does not loose color, fits differently, does not shrink) is the ahtletic heather is made of less cotton content.I do not recommend the colored tees.I DO recommend athletic heather.If I could I'd give the colors all a 2 star rating and the athletic heather a 5 star rating.PS) I would consider these to be summer weight. They are not very heavy or thick. Athletic heather seems a little thinner than colors due to less cotton content.
