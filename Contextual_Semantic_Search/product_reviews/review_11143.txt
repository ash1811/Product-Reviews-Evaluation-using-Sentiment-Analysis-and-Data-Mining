Though I do not play soccer (indoor or out), I've always wanted a pair of these hot sneakers. As I sit here writing this review, (I am currently wearing them and remembering how they feel on my feet) - very good. I've always had a difficult and time-consuming time to locate the correct and truthful pair of sneakers without being too expensive. Samba Classic fits that profile and quite reasonably priced. Even though they take some time breaking in, even for a narrow-footed person as myself, they fit wonderfully. I would highly recommend these sneakers to not just the indoor turf player, but to anybody who wants a cool pair of sturdy, stylish, sexy, and vintage sneakers for everyday wear. Very Happy Customer!!!!
