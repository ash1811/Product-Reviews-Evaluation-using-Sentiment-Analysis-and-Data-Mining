Trying to buy these online is tricky due to the weird sizing. The first pair (40M) came and it was huge, this pair fit her perfectly and I have to say she LOVES these shoes. They slip on and off, they are super comfortable and they are holding up very well. My daughter tells me quite often how much she loves her birkenstocks!
