Love the design and simplicity of Skagen watches, and this size fits me perfectly. It's extremely lightweight, and wears almost like a bracelet. Love it! Wish watch makers would make smaller sizes like this one for people like me. I love the design of most of the bigger watches, but can't wear them since they look ginormous on me.
