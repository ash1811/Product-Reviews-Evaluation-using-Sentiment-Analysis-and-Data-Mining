I recently purchased this watch. It looked nice but I was settling for it because I did not want to spend 3 times as much on the one I wanted.  With the reviews, I thought I might get a good one and be happy.  The odds were against me.Pros:1) Solid build2) Looks neat from the back3) Clasp has a safety on it4) Bezel is painted with good stuffCons:1) Poor quality control.  The automatic wind would not retain more than a minute.  The manual wind achieved 4 minutes.2) The date lens is raised quite a bit and is not strong enough to justify having it.  If it scratches, bad, it will be useless.Because of its height, it probably will scratch quickly.3) The clasp did not have a push button release so it will wear out more quickly than better clasps.4) The warranty service is poor and costs more than it is worth.  Instead of getting it fixed right, I just returned it and willnot buy another Invicta again.
