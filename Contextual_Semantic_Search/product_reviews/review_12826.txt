I suppose at age 52 I should have learned by now what makes a bra give you that 60s Fembot pointed bullet breasted look and which bras do not, evidently I have not learned, but have now.It is the seams across the breasts that make you pointy, where a seamless one will give you a much more rounded t-shirt look, which is what I like.  Pointy breasts in my humble opinion are not natural looking and I hate how they look sticking out of my shirts.  Regrettably I ordered 5 of these, so 2014 will be a very long year as I have nobody to give them to and can not be bothered shipping them back, I only paid 9 bucks each, so will just suck it up and learn from this experience.
