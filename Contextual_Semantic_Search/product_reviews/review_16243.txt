Bought the 42 x 37&#34; for my 6'7&#34; 170 to 180 lb husband.  They are very durable and comfortable.  He is not used to having jeans that are long enough for him, and these are actually a bit too long (go just to the floor).  I go for carpenter jeans because he is not a skinny guy, but not overweight either, though he has very thick/muscular thighs.  I would definitely recommend these, and would buy them again (though I'd go for 36&#34; next time).
