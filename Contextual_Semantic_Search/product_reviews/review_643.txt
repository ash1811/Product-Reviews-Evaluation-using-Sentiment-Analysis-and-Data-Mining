The slip arrived on time and was just as I expected.  It fits true to size.  I wanted to wear it under a dress that exposes the top part of the slip, but it just looks too much like a slip.  I will definitely use it as a slip, but I want to try and get something else for under this totally sheer dress.  I tried wearing a camisole, but it didn't work at all with this dress,
