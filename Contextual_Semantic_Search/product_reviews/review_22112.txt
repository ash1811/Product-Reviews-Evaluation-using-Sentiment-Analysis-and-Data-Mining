Looking for a pair of backless shoes to help alleviate achilles tendon pain, I found these slip ons.  This shoe went from the box and on my feet.  Love them!!!  There is no break in; so comfortable.  Glad I always read the reviews and paid attention to how others felt about the sizing.  I ordered an 8.5, but usually on sneakers, I bump up to 9.  My foot is somewhat wide across the toes but the 8.5 M fits beautifully.  In fact, I'm hoping Amazon will get more colors in in this size so I can buy more.Update: 5/8/14  I still like wearing this shoe.  However, today it rained and I got the soles wet while on the patio.  They are extremely slippery on wood floors even after I wiped them on the carpet.  The tread looks good, but be careful when wet.  I had to go from 5 stars to 4.
