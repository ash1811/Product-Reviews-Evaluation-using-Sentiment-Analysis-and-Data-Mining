The leather on these sandals looks so flimsy and cheap. These sandals run so small it is ridiculous. When I tried them, they were tight, hard and uncomfortable. I think I will go back to my fitflops, They are better quality, more affordable, and way more comfortable than these. For such a high price it is just a shame.I am sending them back tomorrow.
