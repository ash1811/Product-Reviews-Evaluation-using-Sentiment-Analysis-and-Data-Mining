I read these reviews before purchasing. So happy I choose to buy these! My feet have never, ever been so warm. When they came out of the box, I swore I felt like I was walking on little puffs of clouds.I love this so much, I've got to get another one. lolCON: Not good in puddles of course! Oh, and my suggestion would be to avoid wearing them if it is raining too much or too hard.Other than that, they are fantastic!
