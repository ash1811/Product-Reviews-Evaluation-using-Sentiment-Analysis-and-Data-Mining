Got this backpack for my 5th grade daughter. If you had a Jansport backpack in the 80s or 90s you will notice the material feels flimsier (I took off a star for that). She has only used it for 2 weeks so I can't comment on how well it holds up but it is big, many pockets and she loves it. The straps are cushioned. Nice product.
