Nice shirt. Fairly good price. Soft, long enough. Seems sturdy. I hate having the brand on the pocket but these have a nice color selection so I can handle that.Update. I wore this one time and only for "good". After washing I have a tiny hole in the front of it.  Not so good. It should hold up much better.
