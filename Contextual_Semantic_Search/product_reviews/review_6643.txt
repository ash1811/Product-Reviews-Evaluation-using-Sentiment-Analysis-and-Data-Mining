I bought these tights because my daughter was playing outside after ballet and absolutely ruining her pink tights. Capezio makes durable, quality ballet tights and these are no exception. And they're black.My daughters ballet teacher may hate me for sending her to ballet in black tights, but I get three times the mileage out of black tights as I do out of pink tights. So I will definitely buy these again.
