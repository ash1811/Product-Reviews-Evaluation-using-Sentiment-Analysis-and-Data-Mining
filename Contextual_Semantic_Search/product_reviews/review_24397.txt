I love Reef sandals.  I bought a pair for myself last summer and I liked them so much I convinced my wife to let me buy her a pair.  This is the style she selected.  She's always saying she wants to buy two more pairs in different colors because these are so much more comfortable than the $5 flipflops from Old Navy she's been abusing her feet with.
