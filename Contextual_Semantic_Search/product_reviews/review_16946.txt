I am 6'4&#34;, but am a bit short waisted with a small backside (if you know what I mean).  These are the best fitting jeans I have ever found.  They fall on my waistline perfect, without excess fabric in the crotch.  They are a bit thinner than what you may think of as &#34;jeans&#34; if you grew up in the 60's or 70's but are a great pair of pants.  If you are short waisted and have hatted wearing your jeans at your waist line only to have excess fabric in the crotch area then this is for you!
