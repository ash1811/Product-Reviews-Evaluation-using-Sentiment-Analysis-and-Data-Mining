I don't dance, but wear these for work in place of pantyhose.  Tired of buying expensive pantyhose that get runners after just one use... These tights are durable and not too thick.  They keep me confortably warm and look dressy with work attire.  Great for the cooler months.  Perhaps not ideal for summer, but serve my purpose better than I expected.  Will buy again!
