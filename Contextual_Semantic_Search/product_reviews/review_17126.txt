These suckers looks like crumped up paper when they come out of the drier even after using fabric softener.I usually buy mine at Wally world but caught these on sale here.The kind i got from Wallmart looks just like these but has a much softer fabric and doesnt need to be ironed.These kind is so stiff and wrinkly.....Definitely not a wash and wear material unless you dont mind going to work looking like you slept in it.Another thing is the fit and size comparison...i got the same size i usually get and its somewhat tight around my thighs and buttocks.Its suppose to be relaxed fit and it says so on the tags.BE AWARE OF BUTTERED UP REVIEWS!!!I noticed that there were tons of 5 star reviews on these pants. When I posted mine there were no more than 15,now most of them got 5 star rating from somebody who just post for this product. I rely on honest reviews from people who owns the product NOT shills who claims its good but in reality is garbage.Check for yourself and click on the profile of the people that posted 5 stars recently and you decide if its true. As for you AMAZON...WE WANT HONEST REVIEWS AND CLEAN UP THIS SHIT.
