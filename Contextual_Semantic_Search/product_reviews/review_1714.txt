These arrived quickly.  I ordered them bigger as some of the reviews suggested. My husband said they were too big, had to exchange. The exchange was done very quickly. The smaller pair fit good. I first ordered a 40 x 34, had to exchange for a 38 x 32. Husband says they will keep him dry and warm in the Minneasota winter while working.
