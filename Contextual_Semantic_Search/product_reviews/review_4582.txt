I'm a pretty small guy as an adult and can't find my size at the stores.  American waists are way to large for them to stock these sizes.  So after a looking for pants just went to Amazon and blam, there it was perfect size and free shipping to boot.  The icing on the cake is that the pants look and feel so good.  Only downside is they may last me too long to buy another real soon.  Maybe I'll get some different colors.
