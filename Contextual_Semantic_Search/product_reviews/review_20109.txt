I literally JUST received this in the mail. I picked it up, brought it in, opened the box and tried it on. I got the Black one is Plus size for Valentines day tomorrow. I had to get plus size because I am 35 weeks pregnant and 28 pounds over my pre-pregnancy weight. When I looked at the box, it says Plus size is for anyone 150 pounds to 200 pounds. It fit me perfectly. Of course the thong was a lot smaller (it still fit somewhat) I don't plan on wearing it. I think the chemise is adorable and I'm pretty sure my husband will love it when I wear it tomorrow. The plus size fits a 35 week pregnant woman and my belly is HUGE. I am thankful I found an inexpensive lingerie outfit I can wear while being as big as I am. Thank you!
