This is the perfect bra for sleeping.  I only use it at night and I don't have the problem of &#34;falling out&#34; like I did with the bras that have the criss cross front.  It is also the most comfortable nursing bra I own.  It is a sports bra style and I wouldn't use it for anything but sleep because that's just not the style I prefer for day wear.  I ordered the L++ and would say that I wear a 38 DDD.
