This pair of Keds fits my feet just perfectly and they are so comfortable on my feet. You see I was concerned because I have very flat feet and when I stand or walk around in regular (non sneaker types of shoes), then I find that my feet ache.However, when I wear these Keds, even all day, my feet feel great. And I have tried many different support type of shoes and none worked for me. Strangely, the Keds work for me.So let me tell you this: These are 100% recommended by me and by my happy feet!
