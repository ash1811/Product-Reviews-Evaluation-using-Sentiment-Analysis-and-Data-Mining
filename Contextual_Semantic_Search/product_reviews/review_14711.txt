I am so happy with my purchase of " Isotoner Women's Classic Ballerina Slippers." I ordered the large but I probably could have gone with the medium. I wear a size eight shoe, but I did not want them tight either. I think after I wash them once they will be perfect. They are made extremely well, and just what I was looking for. They are very light weight, with fabulous cushioning on the inside sole. Great for wearing on hard tile floor's; that was my main reason for the purchase. I would highly recommend these slipper's.
