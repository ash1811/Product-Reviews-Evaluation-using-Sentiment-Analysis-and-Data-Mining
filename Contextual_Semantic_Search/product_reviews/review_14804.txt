I've worn these Isotoners for decades. I try other slippers from time to time, but I keep coming back to these Isotoners. Why? They fit my long, thin feet well. They pad the ball of the foot. They're flexible. When they get dirty, I can toss them in the washer and dryer. They're comfortable and familiar. I wear them for many hours, every day.The only downside is, the little bow eventually comes untied. Once it does, it won't stay tied.
