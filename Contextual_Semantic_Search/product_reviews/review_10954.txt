When I got out of the navy in 1966 I really wanted a different style of Clark's shoes.  Unfortunately, they way the sole was made, they didn't fit my feet.  I didn't even consider the Wallabee at the time; too funky.  Now much older, I wanted a comfortable pair of shoes.  Fashion be damned, these feel great on my feet and when they wear out I'll order another pair!  I'd rather they weren't made in China; but that's a much better choice than India or Viet Nam as other manufacturers have chosen.  These are well made and should last a long time.
