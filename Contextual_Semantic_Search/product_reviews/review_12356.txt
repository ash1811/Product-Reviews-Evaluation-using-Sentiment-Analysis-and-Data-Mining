I'm as flat-footed as it gets, and was looking for summer flip-flops that had more support in them for my feet. I did some research, and noticed Rainbows had great reviews, and were like $15 cheaper here than at the mall, so I decided to give it a try. And I'm so happy that I did! They're not all that comfortable at first, they kind of hurt your feet (they hurt between my first and second toes) for a week or so the first week you have them, but after that they start to form to your foot and are SUPER comfortable! I can wear them all day walking aroung the zoo, park, work, anywhere! Very happy I got these, and they're made out of super durable material too, I can see myself having them a few years from now as well.
