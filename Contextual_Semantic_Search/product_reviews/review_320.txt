It's a Chuck Taylor through and through. Not much support but I don't care. These were for my son and he wears a custom orthotic anyway. So we just dropped it in and he was good to go. He wore these with his tux for the prom. He was stylin' and comfortable. I do recommend going up 1/2 size if you have narrow feet and a full size if you have a medium width because they run a bit short.
