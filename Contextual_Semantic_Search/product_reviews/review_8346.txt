I wore this for one day and immediately ordered another one. Good support without smashing. I have a small thorax and elastic always wears out fast and then the back rides up, but this one is cotton and stays put. It does run very slightly small. It has under wires, but they are on top of the bra, not next to your skin. It keeps them separated without digging into your ribs and controls side boobs. Gives a very perky look. I was worried about the non-adjustable straps, but they are perfect and don't slip and loosen like the adjustable ones.
