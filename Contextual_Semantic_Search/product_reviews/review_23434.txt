I've been noodling all over the Internet, trying to find the perfect travel purse and this hits all the marks. It has a comfortable and adjustable shoulder strap that can also be worn cross-body. It can hold my 750ml Camelbak water bottle in the mesh pouch. The largest section can hold a lightweight fleece jacket--or iPad, wallet, and other misc. items. Sections--There's a cool little "secret" zippered compartment in the shoulder strap, a large flat zippered pocket that lies against my body that I use for my wallet (most secure), a large center zippered pocket (previously mentioned as "the largest section"), and two front flat zippered sections, one with interior pocket and card slots.  I'm happy.UPDATE: I tweaked the water bottle pouch by cutting through the elastic, down toward the bottom of the pouch, creating an open "v". Sewed an extra piece of elastic across the opening and reinforced the bottom of the cut. Now my bottle's entries and exits aren't such a struggle. A smaller bottle would also work (!), but I like to carry 750ml.
