This is my second pair of Caterpillar boots. Between the two pairs that I've owned, I had a pair of Wolverine boots. My first pair of Cat boots lasted me about five years, and they only suffered from cosmetic damage. The boot itself was still pretty reliant when I trashed them. The Wolverines I had only lasted a little over a year before the sole was crumblind away and I was gettin water seaping through the sole and into my sock. I've had these for abotu a week now and I love them. The soles are harder but they still feel comfortable while walking. They fit pretty true to size but may be a bit big. I'd suggest that anyone buying these order their size or a half a size smaller. DO NOT ORDER BIGGER. These are great, durable, long-lifed work boots. I'd put them beside Georgia and Justin boots any day.
