I've been looking at these for a while and finally had the money to buy them.  I really like how the tongue is fully attached to the rest of the boot so there's no chance of it sagging down.  I have to be really picky what jeans I wear with this boot because it does get really tight towards the foot.  At first they were really stiff but I wore them around the house for a day or so and the leather stretched out a bit and it was a lot more comfortable.  I get a lot of comments from people about how "retro" it is and how it reminds them of the 70s.  They are great with pants, shorts, skirts, anything!!!  The only problem is that I do have to loosen them a lot to slip them off.  I also like how I can leave them loose to produce a slouchy effect or tie them up tight if I want.  I actually do walk around the fields and rivers of Nebraska in these. I am in love!
