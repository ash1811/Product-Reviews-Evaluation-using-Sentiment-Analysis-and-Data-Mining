Well I haven't had the luxury of traveling with this yet but I use my toiletry bad daily because I travel so much no point in repacking every time. I went from a much larger case and this fits the bill for me because of the size. It's pretty small and compact and fits in my briefcase very nicely. This is a must for me because I want to breeze thru security. It's holds all my essentials like mini shaving cream deodorant tooth paste tooth brush facial cleaning wipes, shoe shine cloth and medicine ect.I think it's great and well constructed and I plan to use it for years to come.This wouldn't work for my wife as it is too small for her cosmetics. For your traveling businessman I would say get one it's a travel must
