It's true - these jeans are the perfect fit for me.  I'm used to buying jeans that are just a little too long, or a little too &#34;relaxed&#34;, or a little too snug in the crotch. On a whim, I bought a pair of these at a local Sear's store, and joy of joys, they fit PERFECTLY!  So much so that I went back the next day and bought two more pairs.  Which leads me to the next positive thing about them - the color selection.  I can buy these in colors that make them acceptable to wear as &#34;business casual&#34; attire at work, which means every day is jeans day!  Anything that you can match khaki's with, you can find a color in these jeans to do the same thing.  I'm hooked!
