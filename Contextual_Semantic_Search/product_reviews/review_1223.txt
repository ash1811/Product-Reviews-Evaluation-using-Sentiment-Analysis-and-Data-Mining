I bought these shoes for my mom, and she is the pickiest shoe shopper ever! She absolutely loves the comfort of these shoes and hadnt been able to find them for years! Good thing there is amazon! She hasn't been able to find shoes as comfortable! She says size are true to size, and she wants me to buy another two pairs! Good to know I've made my mom happy!
