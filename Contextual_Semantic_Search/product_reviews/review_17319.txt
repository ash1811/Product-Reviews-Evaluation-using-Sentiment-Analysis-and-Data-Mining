I wear flip flops as much of the year as I can, and even when I can't wear them outside, I wear them in the house. I am very happy to have discovered Reef sandals. They are the most comfortable sandals and a reasonable price.The Seaside sandal has a nice thick sole that provides some arch support and the top is a soft suede. For flip flops, these are stylish and comfortable and the size is true to my shoe size. (If there is any question, go to the next higher size.)I have a black pair just like this, and that is my dressier pair, while the brown I consider more casual :)
