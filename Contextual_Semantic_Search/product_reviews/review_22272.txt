There are very comfortable sandals. I ordered a half size up as recommended and the fit is very good.  The quality is not up to what I' ve come to expect from Sperry.  There are many misaligned seams and gaps between materials. So far, they are wearing ok but long term there may be issues resulting from the poor mfg quality.
