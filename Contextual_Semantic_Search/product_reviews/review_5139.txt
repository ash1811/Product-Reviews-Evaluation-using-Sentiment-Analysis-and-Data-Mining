First impression out of the package - a really awful smell.  Maybe that's the cedar part, I don't know.  At any rate, it does what it's supposed to - maintain the shape of the shoe, though the springs seem fairly weak.  I'll try and say more about it after some time goes by.I've had it a while yet; now I can say that the straps are too small and too scrawny, and hard to use to remove or insert the shoe trees.  I'd greatly prefer a real handle.
