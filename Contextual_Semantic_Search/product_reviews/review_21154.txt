These are definitely more comfortable than the Beer Cozy Double Jute flip flops, which I also own, although I have to say the Double Jute are a little better looking (in my opinion). These are taller than your average flip flop, but the yoga mat is thick and feels like you're walking around on one of those super plush kitchen mats. I can't get enough. Great for lounging around or long periods of standing. If you like thin flip flops or want to play some ultimate frisbee in flip flops, then these are not the pair for you. Since I own over a dozen pairs of various flip flops, these serve a valuable place in the lineup. Also, they look pretty good.
