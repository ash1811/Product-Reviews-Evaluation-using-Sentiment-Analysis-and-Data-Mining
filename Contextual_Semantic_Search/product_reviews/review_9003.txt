Too small despite me ordering his normal size.  I had Christmas ordering issues, so ended up with 2 pair for the price of one since they didn't arrive in time for Christmas.  Both pair too small.  Returned both pair, and got credit for only one.  I'll shop at the store for these jeans from now on.....
