We looked all over trying to find jeans that did not have thin fabric, nice thick ones like we used to get years ago and Wrangler has come close to those.  I bought these as a Christmas present for my hubby, however, had him try them on so if they did not fit, I had time before the holiday to exchange them, but he liked the fit and said they would be fine.  I can tell you more after he wears them and they have been laundered several times.  P Pratt
