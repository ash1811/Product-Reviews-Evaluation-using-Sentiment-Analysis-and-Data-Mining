I bought these in a size 6 1/2 when my daughter was wearing size 6. I find that Reebok, Nike, & K-Swiss run a half size smaller or tend to be a little narrower than other tennis shoes. If a 6W was available, I would've ordered those instead. Also, they are nice shoes but the shoes strings are to get out and clean.
