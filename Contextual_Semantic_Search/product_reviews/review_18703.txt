The Timex easy reader watch is a perfect beginners watch for everyday use for those who don't want anything fancy. The watch is very comfortable to wear and is very lightweight. It includes the indiglo nightlight for use in dark areas, a simple feature that many watches don't have. The only problem I have with the watch is the leather band is a little on the long side and it is very thin not as the picture shows. I plan on replacing the band soon. Overall I recommend this watch for basic everyday use it is probably the best one on the market.
