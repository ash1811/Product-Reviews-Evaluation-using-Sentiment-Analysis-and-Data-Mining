Top quality all the way, leather inside and out, totally on trend and sizing always consistent.  They fit and feel like slippers and can be worn with everything and anything.  Trust me, they are some of the best shoes I have ever owned (still own) and I have six pairs in my shoe wardrobe.  Actually my shoe wardrobe consists only of Crocs Cleo II's, Sam Edelman gladiator sandals and Enzo Liberty loafers.  I do not wear sneakers, not my style, never was.  Recently I have sustained multiple spine fractures and any of these shoes are my go to everyday and typically I am on my feet all day.  Nothing says foot love like leather shoes and these are worth every penny....doubly so if you get them on sale!
