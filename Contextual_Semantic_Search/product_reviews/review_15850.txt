Hands down, Thorlos are the only sock I have ever purchased that will hold up.  I have the first pair of Thorlos I ever purchased and that was over 20 years ago.  This is a thick sock and you might find it can be a bit much for a sneaker, but they will protect your feet and keep them dry.  I wear them around the house as slippers sometimes and my feet never hurt.  These socks are much higher in price, but it's a matter of getting what you pay for.  I highly recommend these socks.
