I wear a size 11, ordered size 10 and they fit great. The arch support is way better than the original Sorel boots. I wore these in northern Afghanistan during the winter and I had absolutely no problem with them. My feet sweat a bit in them so be sure to remove the inner lining at night and hang them up to dry, it prevents moisture buildup and funky smells.
