My brother-in-law turned me on to this line of jeans. Since I know he wears and likes Dockers I suspected these would fit me the way I want as well. Part of my issue with fit is that I carry a lot of stuff in my pockets for work. With other jeans I'd have to hike them up and cinch them tightly so they wouldn't slide with the pocket load. These stay right where they belong. It also helps that my wife thinks they are very attractive on me.
