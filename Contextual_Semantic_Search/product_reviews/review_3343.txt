I started buying this bra a few years ago, and I'm so pleased that it hasn't been discontinued. It is the most comfortable, best fitting bra I've ever had. It has ribbon-like straps that stay put, and the stretch lace cups couldn't be more comfortable, true to size. Beware that it is an underwire bra; perhaps uncomfortable for some women.
