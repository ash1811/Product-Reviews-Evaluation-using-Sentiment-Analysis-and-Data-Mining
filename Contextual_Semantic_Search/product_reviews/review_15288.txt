Finding overshoes for big foot is pretty dang rough. Luckily enough these fit the bill. These fit over my size 15 2E dress shoes although I can't imagine they'd fit anything larger. The ankle portion is a bit odd and floppy and the molded in button doesn't feel the most secure but they've worked well so far.
