This is suppose to be a liner for the Camouflage Military GI Type Enhanced Waterproof Nylon Rip-Stop Rain Poncho.First of all, it does not have a hole for your head.  It is more of a blanket with straps.  You are suppose to wrap this around your body and use the straps to tie it down.  Then pull the poncho over.The reason that it does not have a hole for your head, is because you can use this for improvising a sleeping bag, and to make shelter.  Use your imagination.  A couple of ponchos tied together, with these liners for insulation, and you can have one heck of a pup tent.But back to that hole for your head.  Just make one.  Find the middle of the poncho liner, cut a hole big enough, and hem in the edges.  Now you can tie the laces to the grommet holes of your poncho, and wear this as a liner.  I would also get someRothco Type III Commercial Paracordor aSolid Rank Karate/Martial Arts Beltsto tie the whole thing down around your waist.
