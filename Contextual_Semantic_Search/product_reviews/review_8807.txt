I'm 5'0 and have a bust size of 42 D. This was a bit roomy and I could have went smaller. But I kept it. It's comfortable and feels wonderful when wearing. It does the job of hiding any see through skirts and dresses. It is tea length on me, due to being on the petite side. It would be shorter length for a taller person, obviously. Overall, a nice slip!
