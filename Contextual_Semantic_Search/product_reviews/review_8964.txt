This is the prettiest cami bra I've ever owned and the fit is exactly right and extremely comfortable.  I have received many compliments wearing this with a lower cut sweater or low cut, long sleeved tee top.  My only wish is to purchase it in pink and sliver, but alas it is not to be found anywhere in the USA.  All stock out because it's popular.  Please tell the company besides white and black, which I have and is easily available in just about every size, the other colors are needed as well.  Would be fantastic under a suit coat for the office.  Transitions from day wear to evening out.
