First off, these were not expensive pearls. Immediately when I opened the box I was able to see that one pearl was much more yellow than the other. However, when you have them in each ear, you really can't tell. They work for the price point. If you want truly flawless pearls, you should be paying alot more than this. Good button shape, good size, good packaging.
