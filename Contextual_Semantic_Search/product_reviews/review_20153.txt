I did not think this would work but I was mistaken...yes as an option form gorilla glue which bubbles and expands...this has works on my vinyl Italian sandal, rain boots heel and my wedge sandals...oh my no wasted money.I am super happy with this...I wish it came with an applicator to make it easier but I used a wooden cuticle stick....it does sets but u can quickly adjust it before it starts to really dry...I wish it was a better tube but this is flammable which is why it works well and has that smell to it...I would tell everyone to order this to fix anything...though I would not mend a bypass with it...just shoes, bags, etc...earrings depending in what kind.
