The watch is a classic.  No issues with the watch.  Buy it and be happy with the best under $200 diver made today.I'm not sure that the watch wasn't a return from someone, as not all of the protective plastic was in place.My issue is with the seller (Dexclusive).  They placed an adhesive band around the bracelet, which stated that if you took the band off you can't return the watch.  How do you evaluate a watch to make sure it works and functions if you can't but it on your wrist?  The only way to test the bracelet is to break the band.This was a draconian tactic.  I understand that the seller doesn't want returns for no reason, but I've never seen something this restrictive.  It was offensive, and tells me that service from this seller probably matches their attitude about returns if a problem does arise.  Buy the watch; beware this seller.  I am still giving the watch 5 stars.  The product shouldn't suffer due to my opinion about the seller.
