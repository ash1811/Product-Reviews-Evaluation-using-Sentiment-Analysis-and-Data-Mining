Purchased this necklace from the supplier and was pretty disappointed. The distinctive texture of the photo isn't apparent when one actually wears it. Looks like hardware store chain for miniatures or crafts. Kinda boring. Definitely too flimsy to embellish with additional charms. Would likely break easily. Not recommended.
