These Ray-Ban RB3025 Aviator Large Metal Sunglasses 62 mm, Polarized, Gold Frame/Green Polarized Lens are fantastic. And I am glad I could get them in my size 62mm. I have a BIG head. I usually ended up buying 55s and my big heard stretches out the glasses. RauBans are great sunglasses, they offer the best protection from the the suns rays and are super clear. The Polarized lens allows you to keep them in in different conditions.
