I got these shoes after I saw them on the children of a friend.  We all went to a water park and my 2 year old was wearing traditional flip flops with back straps, and hers had these.  They were able to run up and down the hills and turn direction quickly, while my daughter would slip out of her shoes if she tried to keep up.  We ordered 2 pair from Amazon when we got home, and I followed the advice of other reviewers and got a size smaller than I otherwise would have.  My daughter wears a 7 1/2 in street shoes (with socks), but in this we got a medium and it fits perfectly.  It is snug but not uncomfortably tight.  I expect them to last the full summer and fall.  They are great for trips to water parks where you don't want to bring separate shoes (these are fine dry and wet -- you do not need to change them when you leave the water area).  We also use them at home around the pool.  They have great traction.  My daughter has had far fewer spills on the pool tile wearing them (although she still falls if she runs, against my instruction).  One tip:  dump them out before you come inside.  They hold a surprising amount of water in the heel.  These really are a fabulous buy.  I liked them so much I got the adult equivalent (Speedo Women's Surfwalker Pro Water Shoe) and they are great, too. The first time I wore them I was surprised at how heavy they feel (so I suspect the kid's shoe feels the same to them), but I very quickly got used to it (within several minutes) and then did not notice it anymore.
