I ordered these because I walk a lot and I constantly felt like I had a rock under my big toe. I finally figured it was my socks causing the problem. I couldn't see a seam in that area but the sensation was there nonetheless. These socks are so soft that I no longer have that sensation. They are a little warm for summer wear but they are so soft and cushiony that they are great if you walk a lot.
