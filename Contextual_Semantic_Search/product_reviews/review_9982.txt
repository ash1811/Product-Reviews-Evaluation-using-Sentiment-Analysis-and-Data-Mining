Like everyone else we have been buying a lot of the new moisture wicking synthetics for exercise clothing ... But like many others we've also noticed such fabrics are also great at retaining odor (which is horrible).. So  it's nice to go back to good old cotton. These shirts are wonderful. They don't hold smell like the synthetics.  They are much less expensive. They look great. Nuff said.
