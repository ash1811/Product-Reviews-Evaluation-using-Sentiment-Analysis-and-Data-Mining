I love the Wacoal &#34;Retro Chic&#34; bra, so thought I'd try another style.  Being a 40D, I thought a &#34;full figure&#34; bra would be a good addition to my bra selections, but I was wrong.  This bra was too tight around and very high cut under the arms.  It wasn't at all flattering.  I returned it..
