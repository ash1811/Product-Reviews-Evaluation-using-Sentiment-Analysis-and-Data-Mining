This is the first disappointment in a Carhartt item in tall. This sweatshirt is not nearly as heavy or well-made as one I bought last year from amazon, and it was more expensive. It is very short in the back and in sleeves, but front is marginally OK in length. It is tight around the waist in a LT. It simply does not cut it at this price. Perhaps at $25 I could forgive the problems,but not at this price.
