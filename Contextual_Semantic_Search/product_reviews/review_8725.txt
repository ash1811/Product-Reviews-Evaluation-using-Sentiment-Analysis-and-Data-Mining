I should have read on the net about the strap in the first place :-(I had ordered the one with the resin/silicone strap last year, and this year ordered the SS strap piece for my brother. The SS strap beats the rubber strap hands down... but I guess, each has its uses... someone on the net had recommended that you buy the watch with the SS strap, with the rubber one as an extra... thats honestly the way to go, as in India, I cannot find the SS Strap...Enough.Good watch. Rugged. Solid. Buy it.
