I wanted a ring to match a necklace and earrings, and this was the perfect choice.  I generally wear a size 6 on my ring finger and it fits well.  I like that it's adjustable to wear on another finger too.  The style is pretty and the multi-colored amber makes an attractive design.  I'm very happy with it.
