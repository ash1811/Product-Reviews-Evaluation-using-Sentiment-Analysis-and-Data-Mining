The size of this shirt definitely runs on the large side (loose fit). I usually wear a large and based on other reviews I ordered a medium; I am glad I did because the medium is a PERFECT fit for me. The shirt is very light weight, but very durable. It makes packing for a long trip a breeze, because you can pack more shirts and still not have a heavy suitcase. The pockets on the front are deep and perfect for people that have a lot of things to carry with them. I highly recommend this shirt.
