I have worn gold toe white socks for decades.  I work in health care and these are the best, most comfortable, longest lasting socks I have ever worn.  The original pairs that I bought years and years ago are finally wearing out.  Decided to treat myself to new ones.  Very happy to find them on Amazon at a reasonable price.  Even happier to see that they are still made as well and are just as comfortable as my old pairs.
