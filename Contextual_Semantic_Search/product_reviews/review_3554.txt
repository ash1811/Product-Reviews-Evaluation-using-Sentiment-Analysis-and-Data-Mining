I'm very small and very pale, so it has been difficult for me to find hosiery at an affordable price.  This is a true A/B so it fits without a bunch of sagging or gathering, and the color is a perfect match for my skin tone.  I wear hosiery most days of the week and I am a bit hard on them, but they typically hold up pretty well.  With handwashing and drip drying, a single pair can last 3-4 weeks.
