I have been wearing Gold Toe socks since I was a kid, and I still love them.  They last and last, which is remarkabe for a thin sock.  But the toe and heel are reinforced.  They also fit extremely well.  I have a size 6 foot, which is a sock size 9.  Yet the 9-11 size fits perfectly, without any bunching and without having to pull them up beyond where the heel should be.  If these ever wear out, I'll be back to buy more.  Highly recommend!!
