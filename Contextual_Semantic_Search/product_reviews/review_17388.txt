It said black and it was black but it also had this one inch logo on the front... did not expect that. I guess I thought wrong, thought &#34;shelf bra&#34; meant there will be padding. There were no padding, only another layer of cloth at the breast. Not what I wanted so returned this product. Fabric feels nice, though.
