I am very particular about my flip flops.  Not only do they need to be super comfortable on my footbed, but the part that goes between my toes has to be barely felt.  I don't own a lot of flip flops because I find very few that meet this criteria.  I want shoes that are comfortable and that I forget I am wearing.  These definitely fit both!  I had everyone in my family trying them on to see how comfortable they are.  Now my husband and son each have a pair of the mens versions on their way.  I am SO tempted to order one pair in every color.  Definitely buy these.
