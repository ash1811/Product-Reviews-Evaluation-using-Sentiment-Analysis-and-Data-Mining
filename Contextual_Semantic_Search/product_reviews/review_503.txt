I own multiples in this style Kipling.  While I think it is plain for me for everyday, it makes a fabulous travel or day trip bag, especially if you have children.  The bag is lightweight with tons of organization.  The strap is comfortable and doesn't rub and burn your skin.  it's a durable but soft, unlike some other nylon strap bags I own (and need to get rid of because they don't compare!)
