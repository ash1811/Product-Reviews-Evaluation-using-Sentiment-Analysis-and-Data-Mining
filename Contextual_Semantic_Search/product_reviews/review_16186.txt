FYI for Carhartt sweatshirts: if you like your shirts to go a little ways past your waist, then order the tall size. I am only 5'10" and the regular sizes are too short for me. They come exactly to your waist and will bunch up when you sit down or stand up.This is a perfect sweatshirt. These are super thick. They are thicker than the Nike and Adidas hoodies that I have. They are extremely warm and durable. I imagine that these will last for years and years to come. Very high quality.I totally recommend these especially for big and tall men. These are worth every penny. I have no complaints.
