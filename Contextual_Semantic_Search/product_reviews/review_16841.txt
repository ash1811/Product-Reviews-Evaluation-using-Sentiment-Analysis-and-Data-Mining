I purchased this ankle bracelet as a gift for my daughter-in-law. Buying crystal jewelry can be tricky since one never can tell from pics how brilliant the crystals are. This bracelet did not disappoint me!! The crystals are clear and beautifully faceted! The colors are pretty and the bracelet itself is absolutely gorgeous! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a feminine piece with sparkly flair!
