I purchased this robe for my husband and he liked it. The microfleece cloth makes the robe feel super comfortable and it keeps you nice and warm on those very cold days and nights. The only problem is that the microfleece attracts tons of lint. Also, I did notice that the size runs big. I ordered the medium/large but it seems like an extra large!
