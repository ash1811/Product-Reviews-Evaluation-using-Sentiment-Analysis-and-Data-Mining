I'm usually 8.5.  Have slightly wide fee.I had to return the 8.5.  Was too tight it width in the toe box.  Decided to buy a 9 instead.  9 is a little big, but at least fit in width. Heel slips a little, but I guess that's normal?These boots are beautiful.  Stunning to look at.I can't wait until winter hits and I can wear again.
