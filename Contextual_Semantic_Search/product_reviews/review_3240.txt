I really, really wanted to love this bra. It shipped quickly and when I opened it up the product seemed to be of the usual high quality that comes with a Wacoal bra. But when I went to try it on it was far too small for me. I usually wear a 38DD and that is what I ordered. I have many other Wacoal bras and I always wear a 38DD no exceptions. But this fit like a 34DD. The cup size was fine but the band was far too small. I sadly went out of town and missed the opportunity to return it so I'll hope that I lose a bit of weight and it will one day fit because it seems like a really good bra, just make sure you order up a size or two.
