I have had similar items in the past. These are actually a little thicker & feel very comfortable. Like a couple of other people, I would have prefered a little more sheer/shinnyness. So far no runs. I have snagged them a couple of times when I cross my legs & the heel of my shoe has been caught up on the sharp corner. I looked & was expecting a hole or a run. Much to my surprise, there wasn't. As with like regular hose, I am always cautious.I am 5'8" with a 32 out side leg measurement, 135lbs (slim). I ordered a B. They fit comfortably & are not to tight in the waist (perfect fit for me). They were a little hard getting them on up around the waist. The legs however feel a little loose/baggy but all the same, I am happy with this product. At the price, I would buy more...much cheaper in the long run that buying regular hose. If you are looking for something to make your legs a little more appealing, I would say you will not find that in these.Yes, I would recommend.
