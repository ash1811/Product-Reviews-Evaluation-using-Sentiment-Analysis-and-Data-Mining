My Justins are a 9 and broke in a bit loose on me. I ordered these because I wanted a black pair and didnt like any of the black Justins. I love the way the look but I have to fight forever to get them on. I have a wide foot and a fairly high instep and just cant get my foot in easily. Sent back and ordered another pair of Justins. Like the old saying.....If it aint broke, dont fix it.
