I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing. It's comfortable, soft, and keeps me warm. I also like the blue color. Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies. I'm 6'1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there's a lot of extra fabric in the middle.
