Bought these in Balck Smoke for my mom who has sensitive eyes. She's been wearing a different brown pair for sometime now and I thought a black pair would be nice. I'm thinking the quality isn't as great as others because she hasn't worn them yet! They're cheap but the plastic isn't peeling. They're just as cute in the image as in person. I kind of want them back (haha). Contemplating just buying another pair for myself. Hmm..
