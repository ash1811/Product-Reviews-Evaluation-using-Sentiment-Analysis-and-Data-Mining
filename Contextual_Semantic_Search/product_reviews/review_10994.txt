My then-boyfriend (now husband) gave this to me for an anniversary about 2 years ago. I have a thing for crystals--and the color family of purple/lavender--so naturally, I loved it.  Its length is just right, so that it dangles prettily from the ears but doesn't get in the way.  The silver has since tarnished from use, but that's easily remedied.  I think it's a bit expensive, though, and I don't know if I would have bought it for myself at this price.
