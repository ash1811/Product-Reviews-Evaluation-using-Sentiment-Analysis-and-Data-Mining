I just wanted a fun pair of argyle knee high sock and i ordered these in the ivory color that comes with pink and they are so cute! i was skeptical of the one size because of course sometimes the one size does not fit all, I wear a size 9 1/2 and Im 5'9 but these fit perfect. they come up right  at my knee and stay there the whole day. love these socks!
