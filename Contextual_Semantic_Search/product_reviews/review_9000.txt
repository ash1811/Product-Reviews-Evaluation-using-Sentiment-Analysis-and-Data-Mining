I have worn Levi's shrink to fit, button fly jeans most of my life.  In my opinion no jeans can match these for fit, looks, or comfort.  No other garment is more appealing.  These jeans flatter a trim figure and are great to wear for all activities including kayaking, hiking, and many others or just for wearing around the house.  You will probably want to give the jeans several washings or baths when the they are new.
