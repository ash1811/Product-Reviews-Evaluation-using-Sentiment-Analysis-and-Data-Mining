I purchased these for a snorkeling trip and haven't taken them off yet. I am still wearing them in colder weather and they look good with socks. These are the most comfortable shoes I've owned. There is plenty of room in the toe area, the protection is great, but it still looks like a sandal (without exposing the toes). The purple matches all my favorite lavender and purple outfits. It keeps my feet dry, even after walking on the beach in the water. I felt safe navigating rocks and sandy inclines since my feet stayed secure in the shoes, they didn't slosh around and slip off like flip-flops and crocs. They can be a little slippery on smooth rocks, but I don't know many shoes that would work better. The drawstring in the center makes adjusting the snugness of the shoe easy. Once you set it to your comfort, you never have to adjust it again. I've gotten these filthy dirty in mud, yet it washes easily with water and looks like new. One poster wrote the size runs a little small, which I have to agree. I normally wear a size 8.5 to 9, but got the 8.5. It was a little snug at my little toe and I had to wear a bandaid for a few days, but the shoes adjusted and fit great now.
