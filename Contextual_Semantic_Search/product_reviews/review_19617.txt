These along with my other Timberland boots are great for outdoor activities, walking on trails and everyday hiking. Additionally, you can walk all day with these on without any pain on your feet since they are so light and comfortable. Furthermore, these boots are water repellent due to Gore-tex technology so no worries on getting your feet wet.
