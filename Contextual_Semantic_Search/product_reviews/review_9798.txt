The Izod American Chino is not worth the cost.  While they are comfortable (the minimum requirement of any pant), they are more comparable to Lee Stain-Resistant pants which sell for about $18 at Kohls and that is what these pants should sell for.  I ordered 3 but returned 2.  I kept the Pumice ones only because I liked the color a lot.  If you want Izod casual Chinos I recommend the Madison series instead.  More comfort, better material, better made.
