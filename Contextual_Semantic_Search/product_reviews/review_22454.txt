I have had two pairs of these and for the price, I love them.  I find them to be very comfortable, good field of vision and polarization is helpful.  I'm hard on sunglasses so paying a lot of money for polarized glasses doesn't make sense for me.  Do they scratch easy, yeah, but for the price, I can buy four pairs of these, have a new pair every three months and still be money ahead compared to buying one of the &#34;high end&#34; name brands.
