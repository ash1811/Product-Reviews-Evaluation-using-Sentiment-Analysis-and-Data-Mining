These tear really easily.  I feel like I shouldn't complain because they ARE really affordable, but....  They probably work well for indoor use.  I just wanted something to keep the mud and animal droppings out of the treads of my shoes, and they do that ok.  But they do tear and leak, so don't count on them for protection from wet.
