These Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Blue Topaz Hook Earrings are light, shiny, beautiful and look much more costly than they are. I was really amazed by the quality, and would proudly give them as a gift to any friend.They look great with jeans, but equally nice for dressier wear. They are quite a bargain, and I'm certain I'll wear them again and again.
