This is a great looking watch, the only problem was the size of the watch band, but I expected that, I have large wrists.  I ordered a long leather watch band from a different web site.  Amazon has the watch band width shown incorrectly, it's 20mm not 21mm.  I really like the Echo Drive no need to worry about batteries.
