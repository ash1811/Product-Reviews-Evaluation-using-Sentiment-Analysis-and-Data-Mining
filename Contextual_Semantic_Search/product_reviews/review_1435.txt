I wear a 7.5-8 womens shoe and loved this while hiking. The heel reinforcements reach up to your ankle so that if you are wearing hiking boots with good ankle support, the sock will be stronger there, too. Great, and actually pretty cute.I shopped around a lot on Amazon and found the other stuff way too expensive. This was the best womens one I could find.
