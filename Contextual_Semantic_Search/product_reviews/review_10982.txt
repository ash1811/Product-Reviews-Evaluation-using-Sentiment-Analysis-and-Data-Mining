I bought this as a accessory for my casual button downs.  You can tell that it is not of the highest quality and should not be worn with formal attire when trying to really impress others.  However, it does add a little style bump to your outfit as a casual accessory.  You may not wear it everyday (and you probably shouldn't), but the price says that that's okay.
