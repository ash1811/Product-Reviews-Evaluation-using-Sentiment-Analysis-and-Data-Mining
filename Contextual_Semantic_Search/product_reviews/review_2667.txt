I've had this watch for almost 2 years and it's been a great and dependable watch.When I first saw it online, the watch looked huge.  I purchased it anyway because I wanted a second Timex watch to wear for work.  This is my other Timex watch (which I also love)Timex Women's Fashion Two-Tone Bracelet #T25771.I was so happy when it arrived!  While it is much larger than most women's watches (it's advertised as a men's watch) it's a beautiful watch.  I love the colors of this watch; blue face with the silver band.The large face makes it so easy for me to see what time it is.  I'm a little sneaky sometimes... If I'm in a meeting or speaking with someone and I need to know what time it is, I can very easily, just *slightly* tilt my hand towards me and without moving my face or eyes too much, I can see what time it is on this watch!  I don't want to be rude to whoever I am talking with, and this watch allows me to see what time it is with out being overly obvious that I am checking the time!  I know, it doesn't sound like a big deal, but I appreciate being able to do that.I get so many compliments on my watch.  I've been asked why I am wearing a men's watch and I tell them it's super comfortable to wear and I love the color and the features of the watch.  Along with the time, the date is easy to read.  Also if I'm in a dark room, the indiglo light works great.  Because the watch face is blue, the indiglo light tends to glow a light blue color.  Once I show them how awesome the watch is, they want one too and they ask me where I got it!One last thing, both the time and the date are so easy to set!  Just takes a few moments to do.I love this watch!  I've been very happy with all my Timex watches and they last and last...
