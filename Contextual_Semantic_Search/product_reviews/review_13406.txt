After reading all the reviews, I honestly wrestled with to buy or not to buy the crystal blue lens Ray Ban aviator sunglasses online.I even did online price checks as well as visiting local stores to compare prices for the same exact sunglasses before I made my final decision. I don't make sunglasses,but I am so HAPPY I made the purchase. I received the sunglasses in perfect condition(no damage to the box,no damage to the sunglasses and all the extras you receive with a Ray Ban purchase{cleaning wipe-manual-case}.I ROCKED my sunglasses this morning and received lots of compliments.This is my 1st pair of Ray Ban sunglasses and I was really inspired to purchase them after seeing the best QB in the NFL(Russell Wilson-Seattle Seahawks) wearing a pair in the September 2013 GQ magazine. The price was AMAZING,FAST SERVICE from the seller and I'm in LOVE with my Ray Ban sunglasses.By the way, for the ladies -- if you have an average size face, the 58mm is a perfect fit and the blue lens are GORGEOUS!!!!
