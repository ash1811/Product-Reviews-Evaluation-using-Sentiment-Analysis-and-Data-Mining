I love Reef sandals, and these are no exception. They are really cute. The materials used are durable and sustainable. The design is attractive, and the sandal is really comfortable. I've been living in these since I got them. I'm usually a 10.5 to 11. I ordered the 11 in these, and they fit perfectly. I'm really happy with my purchase!
