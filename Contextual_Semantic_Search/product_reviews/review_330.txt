First off, I just ordered the shirt late Thursday night & received it at 9am Saturday; talk about fast delivery! I was told delivery wouldn't take place until 12/21 - 12/27, so kudos on going out of their way to FedEx it overnight.The shirt looks & feels great. I can't tell you how well it fits as it's a gift for my son.
