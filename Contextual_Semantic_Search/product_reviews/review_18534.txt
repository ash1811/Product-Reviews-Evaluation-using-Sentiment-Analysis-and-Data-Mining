I purchased it for my 4 and a half year old, size small, the black ties fall of so we only used them on the arms, we used a black winter mask and put the red hoodie on top, It was better that the black triangular fabric it came with to cover the mouth. For the price it was a good buy and my son wore his pajamas under the custom to keep him warm, we live in Chicago  and my son was a Happy Ninja.
