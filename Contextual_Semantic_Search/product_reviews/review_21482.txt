This shoe I must say wasn't well made, It's very tight even i ordered a half size more I usually wear US 7 I ordered 7.5 still very tight because of the thick cushioned leather insole is fixed (glued) to the base and not removable unlike TOD'S and many others. brands..So only way was for me to have stretched it with shoe stretcher with spray, it still a bit tight and off balance the overall construction of the shoe with rubber sole just not that comfortable.when you walked a lot with it you'll feel ankle pain due to some off balance factor in this shoe I found it inexplicable because I'm not a shoe maker professional myself but only feel the effects of a shoe. I love shoes. I bought a lot of shoes in a year. I know what constitutes a good well made casual shoe.
