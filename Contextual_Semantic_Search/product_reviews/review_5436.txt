I bought this umbrella to put in my daughters backpack.  I either did not read the dimensions or they were not listed when I bought it.  This umbrella is not the small compact umbrella I expected. It is still rather long so it would not fit well in my daughters backpack.Other than that the umbrella works very well.  I ended up putting it my my car so now I have two umbrellas in case one breaks.
