Bought these shoes and they were delivered on May 13, but, less than two weeks later, I am noticing slight tears in the leather. The shoes look and feel great, but am concerned that the tears, where they connect to the sole of the shoe on both shoes, will only get worse.For $110, I expected much better. Will update this review to reflect any changes re: tearing in a couple of weeks or so. If it continues, I will return the shoes, as this is unacceptable for this price shoe.
