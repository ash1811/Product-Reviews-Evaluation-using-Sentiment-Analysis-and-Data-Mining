This is a great necklace for a cheap price.  I found that you can wear a variety of earrings with it and it looks great.  I was pleased with my purchase, the packaging it came in, and would recommend it to anyone.  As some other people said...it is a lighter weight piece but it is real silver and you would pay a much higher price for a heavy silver pendant.  Buy it and enjoy!
