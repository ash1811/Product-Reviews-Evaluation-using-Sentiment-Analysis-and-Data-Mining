These lightweight, soft slippers with a foam insole are great around the house. I slip them on as soon as I come in the house, and they feel so soft and comfortable. I'm really happy with them. Walking in them is like walking barefoot with protection and a layer of warmth. They fit just right with a pair of socks on. I ordered a 7.5 (what I usually wear) and they feel great.
