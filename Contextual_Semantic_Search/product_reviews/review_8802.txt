I didn't know what size to order so I ordered up a size and it is a bit too big but I'm OK with that.  I live in Houston so when the summer heat hits I prefer loose clothing for work.  The straps are a little longer than I expected, but I'm only 5'0&#34; so that's fine too.  Very pretty, very comfie, very well made.  Me gusta!
