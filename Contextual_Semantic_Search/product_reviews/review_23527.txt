With the right black shoes, these are nearly indistinguishable from real boots, and much cheaper! Worked just like I wanted, though I had to safety pin them to my pants because the tops are a little loose and the white inside was showing, but that was not problem. Much cheaper and easier than buying boots, and should certainly serve for many costume parties or theater performances.
