I received this very quickly and I'm very pleased.  The quality appears to be good and the pattern is &#34;the bomb&#34;.  The material is pretty stiff when they're new, but I washed them (NO FABRIC SOFTENER) and they have broken in nicely.  I can't wait until spring when I can try them out to see how good the ATACS pattern really is.
