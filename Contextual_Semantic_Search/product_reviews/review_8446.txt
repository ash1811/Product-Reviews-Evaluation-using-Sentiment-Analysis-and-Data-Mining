These Daniel Green slippers are just wonderful! It's lovely to have slippers that fit my narrow feet, and they are also beautiful as well as comfortable. The gold color is not too bright--a nice, soft brushed gold, so they will go with any robe or pajamas. The quality is, as usual for Daniel Green, excellent.
