We bought this costume last year for a Halloween Costume for my then 7 year old son. To date he has worn it and reworn it and we have washed it and rewashed it. The only thing that is wrong at this point, one year later, is that the printing on the shirt; such as the skull, has worn off.  But we have not had any holes appear in the costume itself. It has not frayed. It has held up to a lot of dress up play both inside and outside the house.If you have children like mine that like to play dress up, this is one tough costume.Enjoy.
