For a wallet that contains a checkbook, it is rather tight. No room for it to expand much.  I put 6 cards in the slots in front of the pocket with the snap closure, which does not fill all the slots.  It makes it quite thick and bulky, and does not leave much room for the checkbook.  With it closed and a full pack of checks in it, my checks end up curved slightly.  My current wallet is a checkbook wallet and this does not happen with it, and it also holds the 6 cards in an upright position, and has a snap change pocket.  Unfortunately my old wallet is wearing out after many years.I like the green color, but for me this wallet is not a keeper.
