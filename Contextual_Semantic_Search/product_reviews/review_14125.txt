As Sarah Palin weirdly said of the president recently, I've taken up with wearing "mom jeans."  But...well...I'm a mom so I guess I don't mind. These jeans are a good buy.  They fit well, land higher up on the waist like I prefer and are quite comfortable. I've worn both Lee's and Levi's all my life and although I've seen some reduction in value to both brands at times, these are just great.  Highly recommended.--------------Ah me...after I wore the black jeans for a while I liked them so much I also got the blue. I guess I follow my own recommendations....
