Absolutely love these!  Bought them in black and would buy them again.  I have a wide foot, but they were perfect.  So comfortable.  The bands are all stretchy, so there is no &#34;new-shoe breaking-in&#34; process.  They are pliable, yet sturdy. Dress them up or down.  I wear them everywhere! Love, love, love!
