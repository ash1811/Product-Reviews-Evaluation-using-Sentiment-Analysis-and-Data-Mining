Don't get me wrong, I definitely love these pants. They are very well constructed and fit great, relaxed without being baggy. The only complaint I have about them is that my dog likes rubbing against me in the morning and my pants apparently like to bring her to work with me - her fur anyway. So, for future purchases, I'll have to stick to colors that are similar to the color of her fur. At least that way it won't be quite so evident that I brought my dog to work.
