The perfect quality of Shadowline tricot is tops in the business.  There is no other that compares.  I'm replacing 20 year old Shadowline gowns just because after 20 years they're a bit discolored - that's it - the fabric stays as perfect 20 years later as it was day one.  Excellent product & here an excellent price.
