As soon as I removed these from the box I knew I would love them. They look great and feel even better. I was surprised at how comfortable they were. I wear a size 14 and they seem a little snug, but not painful or uncomfortable. If you have problems with feeling constricted I would suggest going up 1/2 size or full size if possible.
