Steel Blue color was lighter than shown, but not objectionable. Well-planned out pockets. Sturdy lightly crinkled nylon fabric. Double-zipper pulls on main compartment and exterior compartment, thanks for that! Design works well for those who wear sling bags across the right shoulder. Small zip pocket on shoulder strap very tight fit for iPhone, would hinder quick accessibility. Watch the abrasive pin-sharp pseudo-Velcro on the outside pocket flap. Like, yowee ouch!!! Removed easily with seam ripper. Fits iPad with folio cover easily. Minus a star for lack of some padding on the back side or bottom. All in all, useful for everyday and travel.
