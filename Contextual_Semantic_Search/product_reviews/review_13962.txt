It is quite simple.  Lee still offers top quality in terms of construction and materials used.  But beyond that they are consistent.  If you purchase a product that says it's size 40....they are.  If it says Classic fit...it is.  What is more important every pair you order is like that.  It's not like a thousand different people at a sewing machine took a guess at the sizes and made them....that is how a lot of other manufacturers appear to approcach the market these days.
