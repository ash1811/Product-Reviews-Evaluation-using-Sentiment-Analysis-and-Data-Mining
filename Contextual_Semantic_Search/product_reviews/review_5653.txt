This ear cuff certainly looks great, whether worn low as pictured or higher up. And it's very easy to put on. Which means it's very easy to take off... or, rather, come off when you don't want it to (say, for instance when you're sleeping or brushing your hair). I adjusted the tightness with pliers after putting it on, thinking that would get it to stay put; it helped, but didn't solve the problem  entirely. Bottom line, it's a fun and attractive accessory - it just has limits.
