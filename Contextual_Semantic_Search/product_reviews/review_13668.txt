Haven't put these through much use, but they seem like they are made well and fit nicely around my shoes.  I took the advice of other reviewers that they ran small, and ordered larger and they fit great.  I wear a mens 8-8.5, and ordered the Size 8.5-9.5, and it fits perfect, quite snug, I can't see how this would fit on a 9.5, but maybe it will stretch.
