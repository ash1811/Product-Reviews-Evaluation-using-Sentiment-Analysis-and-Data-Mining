We had a similar &#34;ticket tote&#34; for a number of years and generally had it around my neck from the time I arrived at an airport to the time we deplaned at our final destination.  It took many trips with us but finally wore out on our last trip to New York. I immediately ordered this with my Amazon app and two days later (as always excellent Prime 2-day delivery) it arrived. It serves us almost as well but with a slight bit of inconvenience. In use, we keep our passports in one section, our web-purchased print-outs and check-in passes in another and our other reservation information (cars, hotels, etc) in a third. This does not have quite the convenience where the zippered pocket is somewhat smaller in size and less easy to access. Otherwise, this is a good product and seems very well made.
