I have about 5 bras that do not fit me, some are cheap some are expensive but anyway they don't fit.Now this is a bra that won't let my boobs run away and jump around when I walk and it feels soooo comfortable.The price is good and the bra is good quality and IT FITS. I have 36D and always had troubles finding the right size and type of bra.
