I've tried 501 before in Levi's store so I knew my size,33x30 fits me perfectly except the legs are a little too long.However,the pants I bought in AMAZON is really suitable,and the legs' lenghth is right,it's surprise me!I'm 5'6 161lb,and 33x30 is my right size,I wish this will be helpful for you too choose your size:)
