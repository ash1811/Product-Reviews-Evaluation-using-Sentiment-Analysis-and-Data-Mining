These are your basic cowboy cut jeans.  Noting flashy.  They do not, however, fit the same as my last pair of Wranglers.  It seems like sizing is not as consistent anymore (I have also experienced the same issue with Levis and LL Bean). The denim material is differnent than Levis, more a &#34;weave&#34; pattern.
