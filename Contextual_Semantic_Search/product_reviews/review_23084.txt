These are the best, most comfy after-work/gym slippers ever.  They conform to your feet and feel sooooooooooooooo good after a hard day.  I like that they have an open toe for the summer.  I have medium-to-narrow feet and these fit perfectly b/c of the adjustable velcro strap.  They adjust to much bigger, but if you have big/wide/water-retention feet, I imagine these might not fit.  They're really light on your feet - not heavy AT ALL.  I wish I could wear them 24/7!!  They feel THAT good!
