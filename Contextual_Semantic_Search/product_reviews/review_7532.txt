These are all the best of what everyone has already said. We purchased them for our daughter's 11th birthday. They are beautiful. I am keeping the Garnets for myself, they are the darkest of the lot. The colors vary from a pale blue of the topaz to the vibrant green and golden lemony yellow of the citrine and peridot. The stones are very clear with no visible flaws and the setting is a pretty little filagree look. These are an EXCELLENT set. I HIGHLY recommend them.
