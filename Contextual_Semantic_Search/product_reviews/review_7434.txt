The shorts themselves are OK. The elastic waistband, as well as the elastic leg hems are binding and uncomfortable. The seams protrude in the inside of the garment and the rubbing irritates the skin. At first I thought the shorts were all right, but after a half hour working out Idefinitely changed my mins\d about them.
