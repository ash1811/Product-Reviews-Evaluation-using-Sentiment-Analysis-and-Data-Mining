I have owned 5 pair of Mephisto shoes in one variation or another over the past 25 years and can tell you that they are very comfortable, well made and long lasting.  This recent pair of Match shoes was a gift and only the second pair of new Mephistos that I have ever owned.  My other 3 Mephistos have been barely used and purchased for under $50 on auction sites.  For some reason, people sell their Mephistos after having just barely broken them in and they depreciate like crazy so you end up paying very little.  Lucky for me because I can't figure out why anyone would spend $300+ on a pair of Mephisto shoes.  There are many, many shoe brands and that are just as comfortable, long lasting and well made that cost one third of what Mephistos cost.  I can't deny that they are great shoes and the styling is right in the middle of wearing sneakers and oxfords so they do fit a gap in the shoe style area but why are they $350?  If it were not for the overpricing, I would rate them 5 stars but the price is just crazy for what you get.  I recommend them but certainly not at normal retail price.
