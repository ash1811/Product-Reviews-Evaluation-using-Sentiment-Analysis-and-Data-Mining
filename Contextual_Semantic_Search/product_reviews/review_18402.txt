Wow, did not expect such a well made, sturdy wooden toy. The skull latch turns so it is very easy for my 4 yr old granddaughter to open. Flag is a nice weight of fabric, almost like canvas. The coins are large, the bag is well made. The eye patch is a little tight for her, so plan on adding a little bit of Velcro to the ends. The box is a perfect size and she can carry it around with her. Actually bought a second one, because the first one went home with her! Note: bought the toysmith pirate telescope which fits into the pirate chest.
