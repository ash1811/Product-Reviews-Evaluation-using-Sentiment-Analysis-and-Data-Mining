Just received my costume. It's wonderful! Excellent job, nice packaging, beautiful costume.Only one little thing I regret, is that I listened to reviews and ordered one size larger than I am.I wear small, and I ordered medium. It still fits beautiful, but little bit too big on waist. I guess the size S would be as tight as I want. Quality is very nice! Just thank you!
