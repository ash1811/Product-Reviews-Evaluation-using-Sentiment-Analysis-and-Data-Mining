I bought this watch recently because it's listed as a Men's watch.  However, it has the narrowest band I have ever seen for a Men's Ironman.  I think this should be listed as a Unisex.  Or it should clearly state that it has a narrow band.  I prefer the standard Men's Ironman watch band to this one. It just looks too girly on my wrist, and I don't have big wrists.
