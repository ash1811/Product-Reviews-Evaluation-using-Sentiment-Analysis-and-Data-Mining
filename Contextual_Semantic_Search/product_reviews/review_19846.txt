I bought two of these to wear while I needed to leave my back free to heal from something; they adhere quite well to my skin and fit comfortably; I like that the material is thin (as opposed to the thicker silicone version some other strapless/backless use) and is easy to apply. I am usually a 34C, and run a bit smaller in that cup but not small enough for a 34B; I bought the B here, based on reviews, and am glad I did - those fit just about right. Really smooth under clothing and super comfortable to wear.
