Not as soft of leather as I hoped.  Wide is plenty wide, we actually had to pull the cord tighter, and my daughter has really wide feet.UPDATE:  I thought the chemical smell of these shoes would go away after awhile, but it is awful.  I have aired them outside, soaked in vinegar water, sealed in a bag with baking soda for days---Nothing works.  I can't be in the same room with these shoes!
