I bought this to use immediately after giving birth. For the price it is a good value. There are much more expensive bands that do the same or less. The velcro is very strong. One thing that annoyed me is that there was always a ripple when it's closed that is visible through clothing. It wasn't that big a deal though, because I was wearing baggy tops anyway.  I now use a different one by Flexees because my stomach went down a little.
