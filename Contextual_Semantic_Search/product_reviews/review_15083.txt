Too long and too big around the arm holes yet tight in the bust.  It just fits plain weird, especially considering that I bought another Bella ribbed tank in a different color (same size) and it fits differently (but also weird and too long).I usually like Bella clothes, but I won't be buying any more ribbed tank tops.The oober-long length looks funky and I have that particular problem with the other Bella tank as well.
