Capezio remains the best dance brand to date, in my opinion! These tights are very well made, great quality, and are able to survive many dance practices, rehearsals, competitions, & recitals!  Amazon's price is also cheaper than any dance store in my area, and cheaper than many top online dance stores as well!
