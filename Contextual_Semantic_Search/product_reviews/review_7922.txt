I bought my first Wacoal bra 11 years ago when I wanted to spend a little and get a good strapless for my wedding. This is the one I bought and believe it or not it's lasted me to date! However, I wanted a black and my size had changed so I got this one as a replacement - naturally. The lace has already torn - I'm not saying it should have lasted me 11 years but I'm really disappointed cause I love how it fits but not cool to be as expensive as they are and then rip apart in less than a year.
