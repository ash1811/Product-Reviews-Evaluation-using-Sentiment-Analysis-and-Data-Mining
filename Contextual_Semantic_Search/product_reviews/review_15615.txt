I guess baby Yodas have gigantic heads because the 6-12 month size hat fit my nine year old. The rest of the costume is comprised of a cheap fleece robe with a faux vest flap. The fleece is thin and smells strangely. The concept is really cute, just be prepared to alter the hat and air it out before Halloween.
