Every now and again a watch from Invicta comes out and I cannot simply fathom the low prices they command with the looks they have.I realise that the Invicta $MSRP price is really no indication on what the watch actually sells for. I've found most of the models sell for 20-30% of the original $MSRP.This watch may not have Swiss movements but it makes up for it with a beautiful crown, dial and sub-dials. The bezel is beautiful, in fact I cannot fault the watch in any way cosmetically and aesthetically.This watch is almost a Rolex Daytona Replica and I have been stopped and asked if it was a Daytona, although I would absolutely love a Rolex I can't afford the $20,000 that a Daytona commands.Invicta have thus produced a very pleasing time piece, it looks the part and the movement isn't terrible, for the price I would challenge you to find a better watch, it would be difficult, especially in this price range.Invicta has done the "Speedway" range justice and the watch itself is very handsome.
