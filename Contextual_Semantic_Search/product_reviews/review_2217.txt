I am 57 and have been wearing these jeans since high school..I started out a 30/30..I am currently a 33/30..While my size has not changed all that much these jeans have...They were one of the oldest American companies and it is sad to see the denegration of an icon..Hell years ago these pants were used as a sobriety check..If you couldn't handle the buttons  on the rest room call you knew you had drank to much..Zippers were for sissy's! In summation don't expect quality anymore however if you need a sobriety check these will still fit that bill..
