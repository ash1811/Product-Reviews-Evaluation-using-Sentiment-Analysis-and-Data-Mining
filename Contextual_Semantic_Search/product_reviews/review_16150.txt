We bought this for airline travel and it was great.  Too much room for an infant seat and base, but too much room is always better than not enough.  I just stuffed the bag with extras like clothing and such.  We had a graco infant carrier.  I think this is going to fit her large convertible seat pretty well too (maxi cosi convertible seat).It's durable, sturdy fabric, well padded and zipper.  I'm very happy with the purchase.  I had no hesitations about checking my car seat into baggage claim.
