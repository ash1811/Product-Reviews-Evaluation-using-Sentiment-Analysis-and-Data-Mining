I'm a beginner hiker, but I've read up a bit and, knowing the importance of socks that 1) cushion your feet inside your boots and 2) wick away sweat, I decided to try these.  Went on my first hike on the trails of Mammoth Cave Park wearing these in some steel toe hikers.  Spent three hours walking and enjoying the park, sweating like the out-of-shape novice hiker that I am, and loved every minute of it.  Not a single problem with my feet: no red spots from rubbing, no stank from sweat, nothing.  Glad I bought these for my very first hiking socks!
