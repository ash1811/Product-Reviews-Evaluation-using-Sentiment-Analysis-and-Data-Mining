This was the right size for my wrist (medium/regular) and it looks great. It appears to be very durable, with heavy double stitching on good leather. I am very impressed at the value of this watchband. It dresses up my Timex Weekender, and together, they look terrific. I have received several compliments already. It is an &#34;elegant&#34; combination, in the strictest sense of the word. I own much more expensive watch/band combinations, but this is currently my favorite.
