I LOVE this jacket so much I now own two of them.  One I use for ski walking as it has a large, kangaroo pouch front pocket which is perfect to hold my iPod, keys and small wallet, gum and a few other things which I need to take with me plus it has side pockets which I can store my gloves in.  Additionally it has a rain hood as we do get occasional showers here in Portland OR.  I love the material as it doesn't cling when I sweat like nylon jackets do.  The jacket is very easy to wash and it dries quickly.  I bought the second jacket for everyday use and I love the ability to self fold it when I don't need to wear it as I can carry it or attach it to my pants belt instead of tying it around my waist.  This is the PERFECT lightweight jacket to own and it comes at a PERFECT price.  The company delivers it immediately.  Folks, this the the only lightweight jacket you'll ever need. BUY THIS ONE!
