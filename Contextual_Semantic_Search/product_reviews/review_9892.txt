I really like these shirts, especially for the price. I ordered larges & am 6' 165 lbs. They fit nice & look good on me (according to my girlfriend!). These are great for working out or running around on the weekend. I even wore the Blue one out to a casual dinner with some cargo shorts & felt comfortable.
