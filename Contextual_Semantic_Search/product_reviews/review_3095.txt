This sweater is much thinner then I expected. The photo shown to advertise it looks like the sweater is pretty thick or at least medium. When I got it, it was very thin & even looked stretched, the front design was very open. In the picture it looks like the design is stitched tight and therefore well made but the one delivered to me wasn't. Also, the arms are way too long. I ordered size Medium knowing the length of the sweater is kind of long, that's ok but when the sleeves are way too long, then it's not practical. No wonder the women in the picture has one arm held up and the other in her pants pocket.I have ordered before from National & it was all good, but not this time.
