I got this to put my makeup and hair stuff and lotions etc. I got it in the large and let me tell you I was able to fit all my lotions, makeups (cause god knows us girls need to have a bunch of makeup) My brushes, lipsticks, and even my hairspray. It all fit and packed ready to head to California. This is a great product and I highly recommend.
