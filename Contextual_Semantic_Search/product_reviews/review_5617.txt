I often use army duffles to travel and this one was just like the other army duffles I have. I got the biggest size in this and I wasn't able to fill it completely because it was so big and it got a very small hole in it on my first trip using it. I think it's probably because it was so huge and not completely full that it may have got caught in something. I would recommend getting the middle size (the largest size is really HUGE) for regular travel. If you plan on stuffing it with bedding then the huge size would probably be ok. I would definitely recommend this product. Reasonably priced and sturdy army duffle. The challenge is filling it up!
