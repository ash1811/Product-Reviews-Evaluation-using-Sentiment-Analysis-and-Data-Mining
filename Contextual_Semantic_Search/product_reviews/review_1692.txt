This is your basic Men's hooded Carhartt, so if thats what your looking for then this is it.  However, I had originally purchased it for myself, but it's just too big for a lady.  The color sandstone brown, is really just a dark brown. Not much if any &#34;sandstone&#34; or washed out effects on it.
