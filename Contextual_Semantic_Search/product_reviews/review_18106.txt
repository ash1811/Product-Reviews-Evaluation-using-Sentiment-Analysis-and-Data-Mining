Bought these for my partner because she needed new work shoes (office manager job) which were comfortable, but could be worn with slacks or long skirts as well as around the town.  These fit the bill.  Her previous pair of Skechers lasted for a few years with no issues, but finally time took its toll.We've both had good luck with this brand for work shoes as far as durability.  They aren't nice enough to wear with a dress or something more formal, but if you are on your feet a lot at work and want something durable then these are highly recommended!
