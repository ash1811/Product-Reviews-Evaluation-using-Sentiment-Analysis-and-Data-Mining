Great watch, extremely light, nice sinister metal color. I'd rate it as more than acceptable for dress wear.  My friends are green eyed envious and want one.  My only question is why doesn't the secondhand click evenly on the numerals on the watch face?  I can't believe that one reviewer was upset that the watch crystal wasn't as bullet proof as the titanium watch case and band.
