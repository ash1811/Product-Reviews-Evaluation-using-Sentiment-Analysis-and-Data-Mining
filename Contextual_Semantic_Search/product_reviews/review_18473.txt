I have had some Shearling slippers that where great in the past, but recently have had a pretty tough time finding anything I really liked.The minute I put these slippers on they fit like a glove. They are warm and have a great sole. The sole of too many of the slippers I've owned in the past have been lacking, but these feel like they are supporting my feet well, and the tread looks like they would do well in the winter when I have to run out to get the mail. In fact I would feel comfortable wearing these out. They look great and not at all like your generic house slippers.I would recommend these to anyone, and will probably buy another pair when these wear out.
