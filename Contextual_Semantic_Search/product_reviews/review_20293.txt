I bought this for my husband to carry his stuff to work.  It is a good size to hold his lunch, Ipad and newspaper/magazines.  I like that it is not real tall so you don't have to dig down to try to find what you want. If you like a real tall/deep bag this is not for you.  Seems pretty sturdy and was a reasonable price.  He likes it.
