I bought four of these shirts two weeks ago, while I agree with some of the reviews about the way they fit I appreciate that they are not 100% cotton (I am washing them as I speak for the first time so I'll appreciate them even more if they don't shrink because they already fit tight enough) because I sweat like a pig when I work out and the cotton shirts make me feel like I jumped in a pool and went to workout right after. These shirts are a good balance of keeping you cool, not soaking up 100% of the sweat and allowing flexibility.They are most certainly not the Under Armor/Nike Dry Fit/Adidas fit shirts that you'd never know you even sweat during your workouts but at $6 each they sure are a good alternative if a) you're on a budget and b) you don't like to be hugged your clothes like these other tighter fitted tops.
