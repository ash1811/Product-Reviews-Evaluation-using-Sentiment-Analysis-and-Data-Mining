I decided to be an adult and break down/buy a real adult bra for work. I want to marry the designer of this bra. Not only did my DDs feel great, they looked amazing. It's not necessarily the prettiest of bras, but for work it is so practical and comfortable. I may have to get 4 more for every day of the work week.
