38DD.  You MUST use the Enell specific sizing chart--as far as I can tell it's not on the Ammy link, so use the website for your measurements!It's Ugly, it squishes, and the fit feels weird at first and did I mention ugly?It's also long lasting, and does what it's supposed to.  Keeps the girls still so I can go running.  I would not wear it for anything but exercise because after I'm done it would get a little uncomfortable.  However, I've done up to 2.5 hrs of running and done sprint triathlons in this bra.There is only one other bra I find as satisfactory (and only discovered it because Enell would not ship to APO/FPO...and in fact would not even ship to a different address to let someone else mail it to me--my BILLING address was FPO and they refused to service that...so don't try and buy this as a gift if you are going through Enell...obviously that was before I could pay for it on Amazon...but I digress).Despite my unhappiness with Enell, I do love the product and I'm vey happy ordering via Amazon has made purchasing this product a viable option again.  Particularly as I start making plans to do another sprint triathlon, this style works very well under my suit.Extremely Highly Recommended for larger busted people who are doing something high impact like running.JTG
