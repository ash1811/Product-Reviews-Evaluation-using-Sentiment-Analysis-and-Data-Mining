Purchased my first pair of Keens H2 6 (yes that's SIX) years ago. I wear them 3 seasons with all my casual clothing. I wore them all over UK on a tour and didn't get any other shoes out of my suit case! The elastic laces stretched comfortably on the long airplane rides across the pond each way. I walked in them, dined in them, hiked in the downpour type rain in them. Since that time, as I said it's been 3 seasons ... I live in Montana and my husband makes jokes when the snow passes 2 inches! They take me on white water rafting trips and to staff meetings, gentle hikes and shopping trips. Now they just came out of the wash and are all but perfect after 6 years of wear. It was no surprise then that when planning my road trip and wanting a second pair of shoes as back up that it was Keens H2 in 'Slate and Canton' which I would closer describe as brown and aqua. They fit just perfectly and look just a touch more conservative then my deep red ones. I definitely recommend them for a wide variety of activities.Now that I have had the opportunity to wear them a number of times, I have to add that they "feel better" than my six year old version. The probable answer is that the rubber and foam are newer and therefore have more flex and spring in them, so where as I still love the old ones, the new ones put a spring into my step! Thanks to Keens my feet are very happy! :-)
