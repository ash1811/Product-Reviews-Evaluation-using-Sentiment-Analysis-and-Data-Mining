My husband wears size 11.5 4E shoes and XL socks. He rarely mentions the stuff I buy him, so I was surprised to hear how much he really likes these socks.  They look and wear much better than the bagged socks I bought at Sears and WalMart (all they had in men's XL size).  Now he wants them in black, too!
