If you are looking for something and are large on top then this will fit you pretty darn good. I do wish the color was red but the black is good. I like that it is long and does fit good.  I would order more if they had more colors or if this happens to get destroyed in the bedroom. I think the fit is nice and the price was very good. I am short at 5' 2&#34; and is not to long so that is a plus for me.
