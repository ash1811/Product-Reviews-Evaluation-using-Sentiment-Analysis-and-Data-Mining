I bought 2 of these in Theatrical Pink size small. The color was perfect for ballet, a nice bright pink. Unfortunately they were too small for my 4.5 year old daughter. She's on the small size and these did fit. I didn't think they looked to tight, but she took them off almost immediately and said she didn't like them. Most of her other ballet tights are way to baggy so I think she's just not used to something fitting so close. The quality seems amazing and I will definitely be buying more in a size bigger. Much better quality and a bit warmer then the ones you get at Target and the like. She's had 2 classes and has a large whole in one pair of tights from Target and a smaller one in the 2nd. I have a feeling that the Danskin tights will hold up much longer.
