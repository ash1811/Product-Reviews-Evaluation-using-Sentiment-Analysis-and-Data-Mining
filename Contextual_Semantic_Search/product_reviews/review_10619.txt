When I saw it on Amazon I fell in love with it...When it came in the mail, I hated it...When I tried it on, I fell in love all over again...I too thought that there was a satin lining to this shirt and was part of the reason I fell in love with it so I was very quick to add it to my cart. The item arrived quickly and when I pulled it out of the package I was so greatly disapointed that there was no lining and I was positive that I would never wear it and thought about returning it. Finally, I just tried it on and I happen to have a little white/lace trim cami to go with it and I love it! Its very flattering and would look amazing with a skirt, slacks or even just a pair of jeans. Great addition to a wardrobe.
