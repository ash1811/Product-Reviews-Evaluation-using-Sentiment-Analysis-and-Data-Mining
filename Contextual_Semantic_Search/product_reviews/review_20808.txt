Bought an XXL  (usually I am an XL but reviews said runs small, and I buy tank tops to sleep in so I like them to fit loosely).  The XXL was about a Gap size Medium! I was shocked!  Obviously I returned them, and won't be buying new ones.  BEWARE - seller doesn't pay for shipping on the returns either!
