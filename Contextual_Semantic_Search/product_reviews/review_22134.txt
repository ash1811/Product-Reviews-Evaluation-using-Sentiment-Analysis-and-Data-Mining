I love these Easy Spirit Traveltime Mules.  I can wear these all day long without any discomfort, especially shopping.  I have bunions so these mules were so easy on my feet.  The color of black was perfect to wear with the black shorts and slacks I have since not all blacks are equal.  I will buy another pair in a different color.
