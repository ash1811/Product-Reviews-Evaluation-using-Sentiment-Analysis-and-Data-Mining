Fine print on the watch dials, thats about the only headache... Other than that, this piece came in only a week ago... no cuts or bruises on the wrist, and have realised I require reading glasses to read the manual and read what happens inside the watch.Amazon delivered it within the time frame that I got while ordering the watch, intact. The finish is excellent, the strap is sturdy and watch gets noticed. Will finish the manual, figure out the alarm and the dual time business in a bit. More later.
