I love the organization of this jewelry box. It holds almost everything and the cute travel case is awesome. For the money it is a good value, but a few things that you should be aware of. The drawers easily come all the way out which isn't that big of a deal, but you would think they could have put a little stopper in there so they stayed put. Also, the end of the handles weren't finished. If you have the handle pushed all the way down, you can see the jagged edge of the fabric that should have been glued to the bottom for a finished look.
