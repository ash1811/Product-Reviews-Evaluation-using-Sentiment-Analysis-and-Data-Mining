I owned a pair of shoes similar to these before (with laces) and wanted a pair to replace them. I wear black dress shoes almost every day for work and these are very comfortable and durable. Not to mention easy to slip on. I prefer the style without the laces.Highly recommend to anyone looking for a nice durable pair of black dress shoes.
