There is no question that Haggar's flat front denims are my favorite pants.  They are totally comfortable to wear and keep their appearance over time, while expanding and contracting to fluctuations in my size.  If these had been available when I was younger, I would have started wearing jeans/denims a lot earlier in my life.
