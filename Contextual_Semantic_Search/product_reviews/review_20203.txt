My favorite pair of sweats are super old and really starting to wear out, so I was looking to replace them. After failing to find anything I really liked for women (at a price I was willing to pay anyway), I decided to look at men's sweats. I like them to be a little baggy anyway and I never wear them out of the house so I figured a small would be fine. I love these sweats. They're super soft inside, they're the perfect weight, and while they're definitely big on me, the elastic is tight enough that they're not falling of even if I don't tie the drawstring. I've never been a fan of sweats with elastic ankles so I was planning to cut them off. But I ended up deciding to leave them because I'm really short and the elastic keeps the extra fabric from dragging on the floor. I only wish they had pockets.
