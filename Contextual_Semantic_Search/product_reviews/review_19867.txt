Indera has a similar item sold on this site for about the same cost. If you want a thermal top that will only be used on rare occasions (for example, winter trips where you'll be outdoors in the snow a lot) then fine. Save the money, but don't buy this.  Buy the Indera.Essential Items' product, which is after all labeled &#34;Essential Apparel&#34;, not &#34;Occasional Apparel&#34;, does not stand up well to daily use.  My guy lives in them whenever he is not working. I hang my head in shame to have placed this in his stocking (along with Indera's, which merits one more star), when I should have shelled out for Ralph Lauren's, which he deserves--heavier weight (and much warmer), closer threads, tight weave, well finished--than this ridiculous thing, which is nearly ready for the rag bag.I should have known from the price not to have high expectations, but it was well rated on amazon.com, so I bought it.  I left the tag in so I can avoid making the same mistake twice.  Better still: for the man who asks for so very little and uses these so much, I will drive myself to Macy's or go there online, and purchase Ralph Lauren thermals again. The one and only that he owns is in beautiful shape after YEARS of wear, and he gets cold easily.  This was a stupid purchase, which won't be repeated.The seller was very prompt in delivery and should not be blamed.
