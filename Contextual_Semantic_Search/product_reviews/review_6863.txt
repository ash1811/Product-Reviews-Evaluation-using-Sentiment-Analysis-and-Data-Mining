GOLD TOE is a very reliable brand. I have worn Gold Toe crew socks for years with no complaints. I have over a dozen pairs that have lasted over a decade: keep you nails trimmed and stay away from bleach and driers. Treat them right and they will treat you right. My old ones have thinned over the years, but they still stay up.
