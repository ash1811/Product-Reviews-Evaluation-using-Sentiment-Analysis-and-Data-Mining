Recent 3 week trip to the hot and humid Philippines. This shirt is light weight and very comfortable in a climate like that. Also folds flatter and is lighter weight than a regular shirt so easier to pack. I have 6 of these and washed them all by hand in the bathtub with Woolite - low suds rinses out easily - rolled a towel to remove water, then hung up. Dry 8-10 hours later and very few wrinkles. EXCELLENT for travel for those who pack light!
