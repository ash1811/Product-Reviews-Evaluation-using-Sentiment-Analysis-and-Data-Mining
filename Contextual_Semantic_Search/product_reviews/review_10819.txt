Reefs come in third place behind Sole and Olukai flip flops. However these are solid performers at this price point and the Fanning is likely their best although not the most expensive in their line. I would like more forefoot cushioning and a better arch design. They take at least a full day to dry out properly when wet. I have about 4 pairs. I still have and own my first pair of Fanning Reef's. They are showing signs of wear but no breakdown. It is a quality sandal and the value/ price point for this sandal is outstanding. I aways buy a full size to half size up in just about any flip flop design. Can't go wrong with reefs. Very durable shoes and I like the air max tech they have in the heel.
