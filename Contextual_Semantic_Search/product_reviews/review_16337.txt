I bought this as a gift for a friend, who desperately needed a new one.This is just such a nice bag--looks way more expensive than it is.  Is it really not leather?  I could swear that it is.  It even smells like leather.After considering all the Amazon selections for a long time, it seemed that other reasonably priced briefcases didn't expand very far, and this one clearly did--and does.  I don't care if the bag doesn't last forever--it looks great, feels great, has lots of handy pockets and divisions, a zipper on the bottom to expand or not--and, as I said, it looks way more expensive than it is.  I could tell that Jim was truly delighted. Which makes me delighted too.
