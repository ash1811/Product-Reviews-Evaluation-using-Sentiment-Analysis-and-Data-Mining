I'm giving it three stars for the thermal insulation one would expect from the suit. It will protect you very well from the wind factor. However, if you are in a real cold, I mean real real cold with temperature of 15 to 20 below the freezing point.&#8230; Do not expect the suit to keep you warm. It is relatively thin.On the other hand, in windy and somewhat chilly weather it will do the job. It is light and well constructed.
