I wear size 34D and this bra fits me well.  The material is soft and silky.  The straps are adjustable and on the shoulder area there is a soft padding so that the straps don't dig into your skin.  The cups are not padded but there is a lot of support.  Overall this bra is a basic yet comfortable one and for the price, you can't go wrong.
