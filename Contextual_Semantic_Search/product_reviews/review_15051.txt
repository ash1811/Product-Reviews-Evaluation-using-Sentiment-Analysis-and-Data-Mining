I bought several of these for my grandson for school. These shirts have a velvety feel to them and are not cheaply made! I am impressed. They are easy-care and fit with enough room to be comfortable (he has a husky build). The sleeves come down past his wrist just enough to cover them unlike some &#34;long-sleeved&#34; polos. They are, in my opinion, bright white and look very nice on him. I had searched the internet for other long-sleeve, white polos and did some math and these came out as the best buy for volume. I think it was an excellent buy. The packaging was secure, delivery fast, and price was great for budget-minded purchasing.
