I love this skagen watch.  I had one like it previously which became lost in a move I made.  I love Skagen's mesh bracelet design.  It's smooth on the wrist, streamlined and classy looking with a thin watch face that doesn't get in your way.  This watch can be worn with business attire, business-casual attire or even to a workout.
