I bought a pair of these several months ago, and despite regular use, they look the same now as they did when I first bought them. I will warn you, the insole on these boots is generally crap, so I would advise you buy an insert before wearing these boots regularly. Otherwise, they are much more than I expected from a pair of $32 boots. On top of that, I am often complimented on them when I go out wearing them.
