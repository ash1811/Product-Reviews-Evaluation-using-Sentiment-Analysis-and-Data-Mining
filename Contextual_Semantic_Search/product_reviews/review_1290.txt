I am on my second pair of these shoes.  I wore the first pair out after about 3 years of wearing them nearly every day even in the winter.  Even then I kept them for work shoes since they were still functional but looked really beat up.  I'm still wearing my second pair but don't wear them very often once the snow hits.  This pair is on around year 3 also and the soles are completely flat in some spots now.  The elastic is stretched permanently and the adhesive is coming undone around the toes.  Some of the rubber is starting to deteriorate along the sides but he leather has no holes or tears. The built in plastic support around the ankle area has cracked on both shoes.  Nevertheless, they are still functional and extremely comfortable.  They keep my feet warm enough in the winter for casual wear but I would not dare use them for winter hiking or other winter sports for fear of frostbite.  Their dry traction seems to be pretty good and wet traction is decent.  Overall, these are a very good shoe.  My measured shoe size is between 9.5 and 10 (closer to 10) but this shoe in 9.5 fits perfect. If I had to approximate my exact size I'd be probably a 9.9.
