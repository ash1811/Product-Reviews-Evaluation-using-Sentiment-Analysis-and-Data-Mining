Nice looking boots, they appear idfferent in real life, with the open seam extending quite low on the ankle, but they go on and off easy. after we had them a few days, we noticed the stitching unraveling at the top of te boot at the calf,.  We got an RMA to return , but decided to keep them but now shes looking for a taller boot
