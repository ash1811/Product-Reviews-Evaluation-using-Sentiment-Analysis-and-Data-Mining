Very cute costume, the sleeves were so long I had to roll them up several times, and if the robe were any longer he'd be tripping over it (19 month old). The fabric is a little better than felt, and is fine as a wear a couple times costume. It doesn't look like it is going to fall apart at any moment, and I think is probably a good value. Lots of good comments from people who saw him dressed up.
