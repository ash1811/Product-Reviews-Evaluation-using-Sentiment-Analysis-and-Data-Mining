This is easily the lowest rating I've ever given any item on Amazon. I can live with this product having been shipped 4 days later than estimated and it came packaged well except that I ordered them in BLACK and received them in WHITE. I haven't worn white stockings since I was in Catholic school. I also hate having to send things back and now I've got to wait more than HALF OF THE TIME. I ordered these 2 weeks in advance than when I needed them and now with having to send them back because I was sent the wrong color I&#8217;ll never have them for the event I&#8217;m going to, despite planning in advance. So upset with this seller.Plus the white stockings aren't very nice, they're cloudy and look cheap. If you're looking for white stockings in this style then you should pass on these. If you're looking for black, well - good luck getting the right color the first time.
