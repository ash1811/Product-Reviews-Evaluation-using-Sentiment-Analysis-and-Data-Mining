I ordered this bra in 32E, nude. I have firm but a little bit shallow breasts. It made my breasts look conical and it was simultaneously too large and too small in the cups. I own another bra by the same maker in this size, and I don't experience this problem. According to a bra community I am a member of, this bra often doesn't work if you are in the 'smaller' sizes. It seemed sturdy enough, but just really ill suited to my shape.
