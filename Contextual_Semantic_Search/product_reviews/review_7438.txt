My 8 month old has his dad's build, tall and slim, so finding pants that are long enough and still stay up has been a challenge. These pants  fit the bill.  The material is ultra-comfy, and the colors go great with onesies from lots of different companies.  They've also been through the wash numerous times (washed with Dreft), without fading or loosing their durability. A great product for the price.
