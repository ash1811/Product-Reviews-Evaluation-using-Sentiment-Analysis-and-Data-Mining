Ordered this to wear with a medallion so that I can layer it with shorter pieces. The chain is a nice length and the medallion sits right in the middle of my chest. I've had it for over a month and have had no issues with tarnishing- still just as shiny as the day that it arrived and also doesn't tangle or kink up like cheaper chains. I recommend this one.
