I live in shorts year around, with the very few days of cooler weather, okay do not laugh, any day below 60 degrees is just too damned cold for us Arizonans when we are use to 80 plus degrees in the winter and fall and of course our Spring Weather starts at 90 to 100 degrees and Summers are usually 100 plus day above 105 to 118 degrees, Glad I have them as this was one of our colder records in the weather summaries.
