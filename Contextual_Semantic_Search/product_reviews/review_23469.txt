I LOVE this purse. I  have long been on the search for the perfect small purse and this is it! I have 3 now in different colors.  It is sturdy, well made and can be worn so many way.  Carrying a large purse gives me neck and shoulder ache.  This purse holds all my essentials in an organized, easy to find manner with the individuals pockets and it is not too heavy, not too small, not too large.
