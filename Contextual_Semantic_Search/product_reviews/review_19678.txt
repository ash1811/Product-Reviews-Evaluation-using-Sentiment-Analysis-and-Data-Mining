I like wearing the pink/black over my black Rago pull-on garter. It ends up looking like the panty is the garter, I get a little extra shaping, and there are no awkward bathroom moments. This has a classic look so even my husband, who said he doesn't understand the &#34;granny panty&#34; thing, thinks these look nice on me; sexy without being slutty once the whole underwear ensemble is complete. I used the size chart to order by my waist size: I'm a fairly toned 28 with a post-baby pooch and medium fits great without any muffin action above or below.
