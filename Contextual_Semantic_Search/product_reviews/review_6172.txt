I can't give these less than 3 stars. After watching my strong, young husband reduced to a stooped near-invalid by whiplash after he fell on black ice, I'm a believer in ice cleats. They don't look terribly chic, but neither does an arm cast. They lose 2 points, though, because while his stay on his big Timberland boots, mine don't stay on my slightly-more-ladylike waterproof boots. They're the right size and all, but my boots don't have a "ledge" where the sole meets the boot, and the Yaktrax have an annoying habit of popping off in the middle of the sidewalk. Many's the time I've backtracked for a Yaktrax, retracing my steps amidst the snow-narrowed sidewalks of Brooklyn to find the lost cleat. Are you one of the unlucky ones whose shoes won't hold these on? You'll never know until you buy them. And that's why I can't give them more than three stars.
