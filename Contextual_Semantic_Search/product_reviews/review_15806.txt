I love these socks for warm weather....and I just use them for casual everyday use.  A local sporting goods store stopped carrying them so I went to amazon.  Used these before and I don't know if I love them more or my dog does............they  do reasonably hold up from a German Shepherd chewing on them  although that is not their intended use.
