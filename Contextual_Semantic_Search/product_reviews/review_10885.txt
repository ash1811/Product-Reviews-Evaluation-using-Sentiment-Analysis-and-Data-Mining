The shoes were snug when I first put them on, but I had a pair of these years ago and remembered they give quite a bit. So I put put them on without socks and hoped for the best. Glad I did because within 3 days they were perfect. I can now wear them with socks and they are my new favorite shoes even without great arch support. The grey color is good, just not perfect. The lighter grey rather than darker. Definitely, a casual grey.
