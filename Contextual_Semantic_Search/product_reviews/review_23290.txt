I was hesitant to purchase the cleaner concentrate for my Ultrasonic jewelry cleaner so I ran an experiment with some of the jewelery in most need of cleaning. You can definitely use plain old soap and water, and it will do an ok job. What jewelery went in came out noticeably cleaner using plain soap. BUT, I ran a different set of equally dirty jewelery with water and about a capful of the concentrate and it clearly worked better than just regular soap. The silver came out with less tarnish and dirt using the concentrate, and it came out shinier and more polished looking than just using plain soap. Now that being said, if what you need to clean has been REALLY neglected starting with soap and water, rinsing, then running with fresh water and concentrate will make it sparkle.
