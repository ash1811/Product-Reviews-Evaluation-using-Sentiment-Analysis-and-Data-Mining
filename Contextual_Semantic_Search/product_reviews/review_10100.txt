This was ordered as an XL Tall. It wasn't all that long to begin with, but after washing it, it shrunk so much I couldn't wear it anymore. It's way too short for a tall size. I won't order Russell anymore. I have found the Carhart brand doesn't shrink nearly as much and is a better value, even though it's more expensive.
