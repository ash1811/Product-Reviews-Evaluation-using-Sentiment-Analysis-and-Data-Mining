First, let me say I'm brand new to the whole world of horology. But, I have had enough watches to know which brands are like the Ferraris and which are Yugos. Citizen is like a Toyota. You know it's going to last and it's not going to give you a lot of trouble. But my philosophy when it comes to my possesions is that it doesn't matter if it's a $260,000.00 Henry Winston or something that came with an oil change (yes I actually have a Seahawks watch that came free with an oil change)your watch is going to last if you take care of it. So having said all that I will say that this watch is a good buy. It's inexpensive, not cheap, there is a difference. For those of us down here closer to the bottom you learn that there is a difference between the two for your money. No, it's not an Omega, a Tag Heuer, or a Rolex, but a good buy. The Band appears to be nicely made. I love the embossed "crocodile" pattern. It's a light watch compared to most. The accuracy is pretty much right on the money. I was surprised how many reviewers say the wear it all the time. The crystal is only mineral and not sapphire and the band is leather so it's probably not something you want to wear in the shower or while digging around the garden. If you want a watch for a more 'active' lifestyle your $125 would be much better served with a sporty Citizen or Casio G-Shock which are also good watches for the money. So, if you're looking for a watch thats going to last for not a lot of money you can't go wrong.
