I wear this slipper inside and out, go shopping in it and wear it in the car on trips.  I'll buy another pair exactly like these if these ever wear out -- and I'm not someone who particularly likes thong sandals.  But these are soooo comfortable.  I have two pair of Acorn slippers right now in different styles -- both pair are very comfortable, durable and give good support.
