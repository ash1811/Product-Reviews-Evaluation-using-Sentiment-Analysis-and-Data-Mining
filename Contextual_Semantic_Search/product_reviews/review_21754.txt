I'm not the type of girl that would carry a purse, but after miss placing my phone wallet and key every other day. My husband found this bag.I really like it!Some others have stated it is 'Small'. Makes me wonder what the heck they carry in it!Right now I have a water bottle, wallet, phone, keys and  kindle plus some snacks for my kids all stuffed in the inside pocket with space to spare.There is 2 small pockets on the outside I have a travel size bottle of lotion and 3 teabags in one the other has a  med sized pocket knife.It is made to take a beating.  Perfect for me!I am going to order a 2nd one for a garden bag.
