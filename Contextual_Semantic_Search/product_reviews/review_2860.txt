It is well made. The wrist band is elastic and adjustable like the straps of a backpack, so you can create the perfect fit you kid. It has the Indiglo light, which my daughter loves. It lights up like mommy's. It is water resistant, which is a good things since kids are bound to get it wet. It is also very easy to set the time on it as well.
