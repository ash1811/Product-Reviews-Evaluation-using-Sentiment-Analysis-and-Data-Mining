For 5$, these are definitely a good purchase. The shades came quickly, and though they weren't super high quality, they were nice for sure. They mirror nicely so that you can't see behind the shades from the outside, but please keep in mind this makes them a lot darker to see out of than normal sunglasses. The metal has a little bit of give to it so you can bend it a little, but the free pouch is really nice to protect the shades from scratches. Overall good purchase.
