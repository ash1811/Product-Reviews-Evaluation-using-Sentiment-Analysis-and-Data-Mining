I loved the Kenneth Cole watch I received for my birthday in April and the wallet is no different. It has a great style, easy to remove ID (so great for clubs and restaurants) and a removable photograph insert. The pockets have been a little stiff, so I haven't been able to utilize a couple inserts, but that is just a result of the quality leather. I am sure that after a couple months of use it will loosen up. I would buy another wallet from them in the future.
