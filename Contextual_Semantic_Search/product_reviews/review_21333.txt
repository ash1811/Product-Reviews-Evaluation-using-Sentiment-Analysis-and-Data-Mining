The hubby needs dress up shoes for work but his job involved both desk work and physical stuff so he needs shoes that look nice but are sturdy and supportive. These worked great and have fantastic arch support. I originally ordered them in brown and black for him. The black got a big thumbs up but both he and the kiddo declared the brown &#34;butt ugly&#34; and we ended up returning them. for the Clark's Senner Dale Oxfords in brown.
