I've been wearing Gold-toe socks forever it seems. recently (past few years) they have changed the manufacturing and quality has gone down. Normally I can go a full year or two before they need replacement, my recent 2 orders have developed holes in the toe after about 6 months. Being a happy use of Wigwam socks for hiking I was thrilled to find they make work/everyday socks.First, you can see the quality right away. These put my old gold-toes to shame. They are thick, well made and reinforced in the right areas to last a long time. They help with sweating and claim to be odor free (I'll put that to the test).Pros:- High Quality- Comfortable- No black fuzz between the toes!- American Made- Good PriceCons:- Might be a little to thick for some shoes- Not available via Amazon PrimeBottom Line:Only time will tell how well these hold up. I have high hopes that they will, and so far all things point to yes.Note: The shipping was very fast and offered at a fair price. Prime would have been great, but I don't mind fair when Prime is not available.
