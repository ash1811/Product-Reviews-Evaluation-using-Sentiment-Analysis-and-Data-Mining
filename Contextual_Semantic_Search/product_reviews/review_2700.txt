I am pleased with the Expedition watch. It fits very naturally and is easily adjustable. It is lightweight and easy to read day or night. It seems to keep good time, but now days most all watches do.The only complaints I have is that the "crystal" is too soft, and easily scatched, and that the band can be a little difficult to put on if you have to unloop it all the way. The second is not a big deal, but the first is kind of dissapointing. It is supposed to be an active outdoor accessory.Overall though, I am pleased with my purchase and recomend it to anyone wanting a watch for work or play.04/11/2010Still have watch. Still keeps great time. Still on original battery. I had to replace the strap. It was stretched out where the watch attaches. The strap aso get very smelly from sweat over time. A replacement was found at Target for $7.00. I still stand by mt original 4 star. You should buy this watch. (if it is still available)
