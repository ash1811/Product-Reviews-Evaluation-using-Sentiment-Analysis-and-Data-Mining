We found these inexpensive khakis at Amazon.  They were exactly what we were looking for.  The good news, the khakis were great.  The bad news, because they ran a little small, we had to return them for the next larger size.  Amazon penalized us by making us pay the return shipping, even though we reordered the same items in a larger size.  Most on line clothing purchases offer free shipping for a size exchange.
