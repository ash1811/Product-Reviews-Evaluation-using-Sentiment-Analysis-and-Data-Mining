It's becoming harder to find a pair of jeans that last and fit. Dickies doesn't skimp on material. It's not flimsy or thin nor is it trendy or fancy pants.  I just want a plain pair of jeans.  It's great work jeans or for daily wear.  The only thing I don't like is the logo on the back right pocket, I wish it was placed on the belt line as I don't want anyone to notice logos on my ass.
