I love these boots! I already owned them in red, so I decided to get them in black as well. I wear a men's 13, so I got the boot in size 16 (cause they do run about a size smaller) and fit comfortably!!! I was able to wear them out for one whole night without any problems or pain. The one con is that they can get scuffed at the pointed toe very easily and if you're legs/calves aren't big enough they can slouch/fall down off your leg. Other than that, a good boot!!! I'm going to get them in more colors...
