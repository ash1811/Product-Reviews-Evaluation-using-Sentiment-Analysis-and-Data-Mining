I like these shorts for the fit and feel...very light, easy wash easy wear...pockets are excellent...BUT...2 issues...beware they run small..second ..and more importantly 2 out of three pairs are un-stitching below the pocket reinforcement...after only one wash!!!..love Columbia...but not in this case...thank you amazon for the free return and credit...
