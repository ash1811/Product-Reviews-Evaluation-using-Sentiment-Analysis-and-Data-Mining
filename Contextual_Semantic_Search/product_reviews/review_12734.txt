I recently found out that I've been wearing 2 cup sizes too small for years. No wonder I always had &#34;side boobs&#34; and felt like I was falling out. I admit I tried this size on in a store first to make sure, but found it cheaper (and in my size) here on Amazon. Now I no longer feel like &#34;the girls&#34; are headed south!
