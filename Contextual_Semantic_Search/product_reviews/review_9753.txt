I'm a regular swimmer (3 times / week). These look cool but cuts into the thighs. Also, after about 10 months it falls apart, even though I'm very careful about maintenance, like not stretching it too much when pulling it on and off and rinsing it throughly in fresh water after using it in a chlorinated pool.
