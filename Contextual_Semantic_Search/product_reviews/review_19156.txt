I  bought these earrings to match a pendant I recently purchased..925 Sterling Silver Multi Faceted Clear AB Swarovski Crystals PendantThey were all purchased to match a yellow dress for formal night on a cruise. I'm glad I did because these are beautiful just like the pendent. Just like the pendent they were also very affordable, and arrived well packaged and fast. The earrings are a good size (what looks to be a 3rd the size of the pendent), the same design as the pendent, which is fairly large. I haven't worn them yet but they are silver with leverbacks and they appear to be of very good quality. The rings that connect the crystals to the leverbacks go through a hole cut in the crystal, just in case that isn't noticeable in the product picture. The earrings have a type of metalish, colorful, material on the back. Probably to help the crystals capture color. I don't think this would be a problem  because with the design of the earrings it looks as though they will remain facing the intended direction. It might be a problem for someone with very short hair, if people are admiring the earrings from behind. The backs of the earrings are not bad, just not crystalish, they have like a shiny, non see through finish.  The earrings also appear to shine more yellow/goldish then anything else. I haven't worn them yet so I don't know if this will change or not but I read reviews that say the colors change to match the colors reflected by the outfit they are worn with. All in all this is a great deal and I would recommend these earrings and the seller.
