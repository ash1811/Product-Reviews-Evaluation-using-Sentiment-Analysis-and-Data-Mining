These feel comfortable... a nice fit and finish. Some pants have material that I find uncomfortable, plasticky even... I have a couple of Adidas that feel that way... then there is the other extreme, those that feel way to &#34;silky&#34; and flimsy... these  feel like cotton, bt wear like polyester... I like them. Also the fit is very good in this XXL size for big girthy guys like me.
