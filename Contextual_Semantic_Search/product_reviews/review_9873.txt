I bought these shirts for me (a woman) to wear to the gym.  I like my work out clothes to be made of cotton and loose fitting and these shirts fill the bill.  I have washed them several times in hot water and dried them in the dryer and they have maintained their size and shape even tho they are cotton.  The price was right, also.
