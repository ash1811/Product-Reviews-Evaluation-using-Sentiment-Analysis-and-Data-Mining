I haven't taken it out in a major storm, but it's worked fine otherwise.  The handle is pretty small and uncomfortable to hold.  Your palm overlaps with the top of the handle which doesn't have a smooth edge.  This is noticeably annoying if you're using it for a while.  The pinwheel look is attractive.
