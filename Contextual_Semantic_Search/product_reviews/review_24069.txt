I need to be a superhero this year for Halloween to go with the rest of my family who will be Batman and Robin.  I looked at a lot of Wonder Woman costumes and all of the ones for women are "sexy" with a low cut top and frequently a bared midriff.  Well, I just want to be a nice rated-G Wonder Woman so I thought I would try a Child's large size because I am petite (5'1").  The costume surprisingly fits great and is very cute.  My husband likes it because it looks a bit cheerleader-ish (men!).  The costume is a one-piece with a belt to add.  The shirt is a good length for me hitting alittle above mid-thigh but I will wear it with legging or tights.  The headband, shoe covers, and wrist wraps are also cute.
