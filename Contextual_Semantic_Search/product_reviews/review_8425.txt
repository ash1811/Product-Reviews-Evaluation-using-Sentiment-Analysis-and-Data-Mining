I purchased these cigarettes to be used in a play where smoking was called for but we were in a location where we couldn't actually smoke. They worked great for what we needed them for. The only probably we had is that they only lasted for about 3-5 rehearsals before they no longer &#34;smoked&#34;. I wish they would last longer, but they are inexpensive enough that it doesn't cost much to get replacements.
