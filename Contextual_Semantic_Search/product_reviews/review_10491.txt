A great fit and prompt delivery;ordered another pair within days of receiving the first pair.The question is,why not 5  stars? Have always loved the Wrangler product.The thickness of thejean however, is not what it used to be. Have 2 pairs I recently ordered and will order 2 more because alas,they're not as &#34;rugged&#34; as they once were. Not a complaint,simply an observation.
