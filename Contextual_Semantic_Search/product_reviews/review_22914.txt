In case it isn't obvious from the tin (it wasn't to me when I first bought it, I didn't have the slightest clue about shoe polishes), this stuff comes in a solid (but creamy) brick format. Unfortunately, when I got the tin it was dented and the polish brick had cracked which made it particularly messy to use because little pieces would crumble off and fly everywhere. You definitely want to put some newspaper down and maybe WEAR the shoes you're polishing so you have a hand free to contain the mess.That said, this stuff gets the job done. The instructions on the tin are spot on and helped me get my new leather boots up to a nice, high-shine (aka spray some water on shoe after you let the polish layer dry and then buff like crazy).
