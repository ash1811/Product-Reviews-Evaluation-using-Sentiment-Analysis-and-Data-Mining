My wife loves them...her first pair wore out after 5 years of everyday use...mostly they were kind of rank and it was not worth cleaning them as the sole was coming away from the leather.  But that length of longevity is entirely acceptable.  I noted some mentioned that they were noisy and I did not find that to be the case.
