This was a lot better then I expected. I am a big guy, 300+ lbs. beer belly, and have a hard time finding shirts that fit right, Jerzee hit the nail right on the head. I even bought 3 other colors. I even tried to order more and accidently ordered Hanes and was not as happy. the Hanes fabric was a little heavier but did not fit as nice and comfortable as Jerzee. I need to order some more
