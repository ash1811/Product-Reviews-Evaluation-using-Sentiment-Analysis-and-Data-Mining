I've got quite a few miles in with cowboy boots (ropers), hiking boots, and leather boots. These aren't really the kind of socks I'd wear with athletic shoes, but they are comfortable enough that I certainly would.Good support, comfortable fit. These are definitely thick enough for a comfortable all-day wear without being bulky like a winter sock that might cramp your toe box.
