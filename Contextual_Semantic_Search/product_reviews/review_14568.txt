This is the second pair of Birkentock Milano's I've owned. They are made extremely well and conform to the shape of your foot. I got one a year ago and basically walked it into the ground, but was very pleased with the quality. Just picked up another pair from Amazon for about 35% off list price. I can't say enough good things about these. Highly recommended.
