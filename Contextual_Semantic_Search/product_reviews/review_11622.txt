I just bought these, have worn and washed once.  So far so good.  they are a little light weight, but I got them to wear under long tops, sweaters and skirts, so that is fine.  they fit very nice.  I have a problem with things being too short from waist to crotch, these fit.  They are also long enough in the leg.  I am happy with them and hope they hold up for a long time!
