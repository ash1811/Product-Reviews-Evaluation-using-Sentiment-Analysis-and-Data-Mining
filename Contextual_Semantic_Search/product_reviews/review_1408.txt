I've worn Reebok Women's Freestyle Hi Tops for years, when I needed new ones recently, I went to several local stores at the mall only to find they didn't haven any and &#34;hadn't seen them in a while&#34;. So, went to trusty Amazon.com and found them with ease. These are the only shoes I can wear that don't hurt my feet and that have good ankle support. The fit is great, they don't wear out. Good quality workmanship.
