We have a smaller size of these shoes in pink.  We ordered a half size up as suggested for these and they are perfect (my daughter wears a 9 in regular shoes, we got a 9.5 in these). She wanted black this time, and the color is nice, she is happy. If these wear as well as her pink ones did, they will be perfect! Great value.
