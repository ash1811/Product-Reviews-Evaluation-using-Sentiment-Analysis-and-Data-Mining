bought this bra for  "no nipple show through" and lift. I usually wear an underwire 38 DD, the tisha fit in a 38 E, it makes me significantly larger chested (not so good). it works, but it is not comfortable, i will wear it when i need to, especially under white tee shirts, but it will not be my everyday bra.
