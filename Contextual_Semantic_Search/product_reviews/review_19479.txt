These socks are very soft which makes them very comfortable to wear, especially on long days.  They are made of good quality, so you will get more than a couple of wears out of it.  They are somewhat thick, so I do not recommend them for wearing with dress shoes.  Good calf support, so there is little hassle of having to pull your socks all day long.  I recommend buying a pair if you want comfortable feet for a day.  You will notice the difference.
