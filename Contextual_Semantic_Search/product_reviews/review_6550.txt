So after reading all the reviews on the bearpaw abigal boot i was second guessing myself on the size i ordered. .i wear a 10 and ordered a 10,they arrived and first thing i did was tug on the triangular button. They are on solid! the color is rich and beautifull the lambs wool on the inside is cushy and very comfy.i have many pairs of bearpaw and each style has its own fit these fit me perfect snug but not too tight.i used to buy uugs untill i was financially forced to look at bearpaws. What an idiot i had been buying uggs are like throwing money away!! bearpaw has more styles to choose from they are the same qualuty of materials. .i hope anyone who is looking for a quality warm boot buy bearpaws i love this line of boots.since i have three grown daughters with the same size foot i have to buy them boots also to keep them away from mine!!
