I tend to put a lot of wear on my watches - and have gone through a lot of them over the years.  This time I decided to go with something a bit more solid and this is perfect.The band is both more comfortable and feels a lot more solid than the bands on the past few watches I've owned.  It doesn't chafe at all - and that's a good thing because I never take it off.It looks great - a very nice balance of elegance and durability.  I tend to like sporty watches - but I need something that's comfortable at work as well, and this works in both contexts.It's got a nice bumper around the glass - my last watch got scuffed, and this helps protect against that.It's easy to set, the time, the analog hands, the alarm clock (you can set up to five!).  Changing modes is a cinch, and it's got a timer, a stopwatch - everything you'd expect.  Works great - I'm very happy with it.
