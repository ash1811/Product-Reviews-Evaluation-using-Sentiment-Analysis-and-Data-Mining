These are nice slippers, and made better and more true to size than another style of Daniel Greene's that I had bought earlier.Problem is, I probably won't wear them much.I have hammer toes, and the front of the slipper cuts into the part of my toes that are a bit raised, causing irritation.I also would have liked the heel to be a bit higher, as a higher heel is easier on a bad back. Unfortunately, there are very few slippers that have about a 1 1/2 inch heel.So, if you have good feet, and a stable back, I think that you will like these slippers. I like them, and would love to wear them. I will attempt to stretch out the top edge, and see if that improves the fit.
