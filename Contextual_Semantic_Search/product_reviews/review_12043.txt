These are very comfortable shoes.  I had to run to catch a bus in these and they felt pretty good for a dressy shoe.But, they look fake.  Not in a horrible way, but enough for a 2 star rating.I can see situations where this shoe might be perfect.  Say you work in a restaurant and need something that looks dressy but is super comfortable, this would be a great choice.I was hoping for something very basic and versatile but stylish.  This is a comfortable and inexpensive shoe, but the price really shows.  Maybe the cap toe makes that worse.  Don't know.
