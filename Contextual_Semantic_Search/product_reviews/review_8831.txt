When I ordered beige, I was expecting more of a flesh or tan color, but that's not what it is.  It's a yellow-ish white.  To me it's a little bigger than I expected, when I wear it, it slides down to my hips.  For reference, I ordered a medium, and my waist is about 30&#34; and my hips are about 35&#34;
