I wore these shorts when I was a cheerleader and I always loved them. Now that I am older I wanted something that had a similar fit and that were easy to workout in. I was scared that they would be too short or make me look ridiculous, but that wasn't the case. They fit me just as well as they use to, and if you order them in your correct size they look just like any other pair of athletic shorts. What I like most about these is that I can workout and my body and move loosely without the shorts sticking to my leg.
