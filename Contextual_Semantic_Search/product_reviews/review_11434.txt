I don't consider myself to be overweight or anything, but sometimes when you wear really tight form fitting dresses that shows every lump and bump, you want a little extra oomph. Made a huge difference, Looked like I was ten pounds thinner with a 23 inch waist. Only complaint is that it is very uncomfortable, made to wear only short amounts of time. Also own this in white, which I will be wearing under my wedding dress. Might rip it off after pictures are taken..ha ha
