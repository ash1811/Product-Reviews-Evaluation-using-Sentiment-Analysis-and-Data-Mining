i have used these socks for more than 20 years. i wear them with my expensive sneakers,my sandals and now with my canvas slip on's. the padded cushioning is in all the right places and the moisture wicking fibers is excellent. i would wear these all the time,even to bed but i just can't afford it. the price is a bit steep per pair, but its well worth it if you want you feet in pure comfort. five stars for superior cushioning. and moisture wicking. i just wish they would go down in price to perhaps 6 or $7.95 then i would buy 20 pairs and never take them off, even when i lounge about in my jammies and slippers
