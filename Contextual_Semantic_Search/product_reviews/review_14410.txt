This is the fourth Timex Ironman I have owned. It is not as advertised. I asked for a wrist wrap/velcro wrap watch. I received a normal wristband with holes.Also, the Timer feature has no tone at all. I really liked all my previous Timex Ironman watches, but this one has minimal instructions for usage. I am having trouble figuring out whether it works or if it has manufacturing defects.I hope there will be support for how to use this watch (with the wrong wristband)Help please, Amazon.
