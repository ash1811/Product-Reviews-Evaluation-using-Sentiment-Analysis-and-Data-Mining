My favorite thing about this gown is the long silky skirt.  The top lace is a little see-though but it is a nightgown so that doesn't really bother me.  However the lace feels itchy to me even after washing.  Can't return now because I've had it too long and washed it.Update:  I ended up giving it away because the lace kept bothering me and was itchy.  But it is a nice gown otherwise.
