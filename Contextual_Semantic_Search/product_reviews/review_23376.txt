I got this watch some 5 months back. When i received it i was not very happy because the picture looks different from the real . In the picture it looks somewhat of a silver finish and a greyish tone. But when i opened the package it was shining and sparkling and the band and case was steel looking . But in the course of wearing it i just fell in love with the sparkle. And i also like heavy and  big watches which this one sure is..
