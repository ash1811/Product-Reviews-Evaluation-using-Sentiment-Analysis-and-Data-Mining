I like this wallet, but it's still rather bulky if you start putting things in it! I wasn't a fan of the drivers license holder, but have changed my mind recently (it's a flap that holds only your license - which is easily removed when needed). I like all the pockets for credit cards or buisness cards, but if you fill them up, you're gonna have to deal with the bulk!
