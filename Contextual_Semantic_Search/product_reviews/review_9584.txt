Ordered a pair of Wrangler Jeans. The delivery initially failed due to DHL not being able to locate my address despite previously delivering them to me. Subsequently, I informed Amazon of the problem and they were kind enough to waive my shipping fee and they were shipped via DHL express, reaching me within 2 working days.The design is exactly the same as shown in the picture ad, while the sizing is true to size.Thank you Amazon for the wonderful service and product.
