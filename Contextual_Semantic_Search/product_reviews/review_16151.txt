We travel often- 4-5 times per year, and this is a fantastic cover for our Britax Marathon Convertible Car seat.  My husband throws it on his back and away we go through the airport.  We've had ours for a year and travelled with it 5 times.  It still looks brand new and it has kept our car seat in great condition.  It is very thick and durable.  This is a must for anyone travelling with their car seat.  It really does protect it and make travelling much easier.  And for the price??  You can't beat it.
