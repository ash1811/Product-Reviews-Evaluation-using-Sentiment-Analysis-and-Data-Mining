I'm a 230-lb middle aged guy with a big gut, and buying pants of any kind is hell.I bought a pair of these at Costco and loved the fit and price - they are a bit long for a 30&#34; inseam which is perfect, as I will step on a 32&#34;, Despite being loose fit, they don't look all baggy. Being able to buy them at this price on Amazon saves me a lot of pain at the mall. I wear them every day.
