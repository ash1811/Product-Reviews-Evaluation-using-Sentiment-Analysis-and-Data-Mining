This jacket is a different style than some of the other carhartt's such as the camo series that hasn't been around a long time.  The hood on this was a couple inches shorter than the other carhartt I purchased.  It doesn't quit cover the face, so sent it back.  I haven't run in to that style hood since the 90's when carhartt was cut smaller.
