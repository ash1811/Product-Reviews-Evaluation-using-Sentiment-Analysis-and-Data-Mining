This watch looks very nice, the blue face really stands out and the mesh band adds style and class. All functions work well and has kept the time quite precisely.It's a more dressy or formal watch than a sport model and sits on the wrist unobtrusively. I have received good comments from some older acquaintances who find some of my bigger watches a bit over the top.I wear the band at as close to the end as I can and it has stayed secure, but I steer away from wearing this when I might do any vigorous activity.I think it looks a bit small on my big wrist but it still looks good.Delivery was on time and packaging was secure.D
