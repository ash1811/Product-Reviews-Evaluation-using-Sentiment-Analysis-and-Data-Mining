What was I searching for?  I'll tell you: relatively inexpensive, durable, comfortable work-friendly socks that aren't chokingly tight for someone who wears size 12 shoes.  As soon as you set your eyes on these, you will appreciate the quality of their construction.  They won't last a lifetime, but in your normal sock rotation, we're talking about multiple years of use before holeage sets in.  All in all, these are a true bargain.
