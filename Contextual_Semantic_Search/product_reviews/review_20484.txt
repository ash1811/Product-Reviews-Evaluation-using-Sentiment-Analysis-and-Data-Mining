I've tried an assortment of bra extenders over the years so I know what works for me and what doesn't.  This brand is great.  The underside is so soft which means there's no scratching of the skin while in use.  I'd like to see this company offer 3-packs of single colors too in addition to their multicolored offering.  I highly recommend these to anyone who needs to have a better fitting bra band.  By the way, the spacing of the hooks is great.  FYI:  I would avoid those types of bra extenders where there's an extended area of stretchy material as it limits how much you can expand the band width because there are fewer hook options.
