Having originally bought this bra in a store, I figured buying a second identical one online would be more convienient and cheaper.  The store-bought Olga bra was wonderfully comfortable; this one is very tight-fitting, making it very uncomfortable.  Same bra size, same #35040, but... I'm tired of getting burned buying bras online.  Like bathing suits, they definitely need to be tried on first.  I have a hunch these two bras were NOT made in the same factory, which seems to have a big impact on sizing nowadays.
