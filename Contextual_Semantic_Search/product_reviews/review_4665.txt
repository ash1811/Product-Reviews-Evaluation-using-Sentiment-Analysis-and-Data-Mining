Jeans seem to fit fine - comfortable.  The top button is a bit difficult to undo but that should wear in OK in time.  The question is how well do they last.  My last jeans - a different brand - really got ragged at the bottom after awhile, and the billfold pocket started to tear.  We'll see how this pair does over time.  As of now seem to good for the price compared to others I checked.
