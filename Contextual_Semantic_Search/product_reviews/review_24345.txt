Although the hat smells like chemicals, its adorable (and hey, I suppose I know for sure it's new right?) I will certainly order more colors of this hat, but I will look for another seller. My hat was over a week late and when I got the box it looked like megatron and his transformer friends had played football with my package; while I can't fault the seller for what the postal service does I CAN absolutely fault them for their piss poor service. When I kindly and concisely asked for a status on my week late package, the following is the response I received: "Hello. Please contact amazon/fba team. They handled your order and will have information." REALLY? Could you at least pretend to be sorry or care? Got it, it's a straight forward situation and not "your problem" ehats, but your manner of handling customers and the impression it leaves is 110% your problem. I am not impressed.
