When I opened the package, I was initially disappointed.  They looked cheap and clunky.  But no one looks that closely at earrings - put them on and check out the effect...The pretty blue and orchid colors, the shine, the reflective rays- they all add up to make a dazzling little set of sparkly earrings that are fun, especially when paired with an outfit of similar colors.  The sizing is good too- enough to be noticed but not overpowering.  Easy to use leverback clasp makes hookup a breeze and keeps them on.  Great with jeans as well as with pastels.No one is going to mistake these earrings for fine gems, but they will admire the appearance and colors, and appreciate their look!
