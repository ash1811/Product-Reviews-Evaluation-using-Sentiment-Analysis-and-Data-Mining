THE WRANGLER COWBOY CUT JEANS ARE A REALLY A &#34;CUT&#34; ABOVE LEVI'S... THE FABRIC IS HEAVIER, SOFTER AND WITH BETTER STITCHING. THE FIT IN THE SEAT AND CROTCH IS VERY COMFORTABLE WITH NO RIDE UP. PLENTY OF ROOM TO BEND ,SIT AND STRECH. THE BLEACHED FINISHED LOOKS GREAT... VERY RUGGED AS WELL... FAR BETTER THAN LEVI'S. I'M ORDERING TWO MORE PAIR !
