So I've been wearing Keen for a while now and I always wear a size 13. They have always been extremely comfortable out of the box and I was hoping for the same experience with this trail shoe. Unfortunately, it was not meant to be. I tried them on wearing a basic cotton sock when they arrived and they were extremely tight across the top of my foot. I pulled them off and checked the size tag out of disbelief. They were in fact 13s. I ended up returning them and ended up with a pair of Keens in a size 14. Just be aware that these run smaller than normal Keens for some reason. I gave these three stars because they probably would've been great if they were true to size.
