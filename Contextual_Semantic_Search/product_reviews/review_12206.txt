I have never been much of a flip flop wearer.  My last pair I had owned for years.  I finally had enough of them realizing that there must be a better option out there.  A friend recommended these to me over Reefs.  I decided to order a pair of both.  I ordered these in Sand Colored X-Large(11-12).  I am a pretty consistent size 11 across the board and found these to fit me perfectly.  For reference, I also ordered theReef Men's Fanning Flip Flop.  These Rainbow flip flops will satisfy the traditionalist, favoring a simpler design, an ultra-soft surface and great arch support.  The Reef's have a raised heel that really helps keeps them on my feet, a spongy surface, and are also very comfortable.  Out of the box, I have had a slight preference for the Reef's, preferring the way they stay on my feet while I walk.  After wearing the Reef's for a day, the strap started to dig into my right foot, which is slightly smaller than my left, creating a blister.  I have since been wearing the Rainbows a bit more and am starting to feel almost as comfortable wearing them as the Reefs which do stick to my feet better.  These did not cause me any blisters.  Overall, I would say that the Rainbows are a bit more comfortable, but need broken in more than the Reefs which are more effortless to walk in.  If it weren't for the blister, the Reefs would be the clear favorite to me.  I think both pairs of flip flops just need broken in a little more and my foot needs a little bit of a callus built up.  I am very happy with both pairs of flip flops and you could not go wrong with either.
