I read a lot of reviews on the product that its smaller and tighter at the waist. I dont have this problem, It fits me OK. My only concern is on the hook supporting the bib. A bit small and not quite suitable if you have diaorhea (hope correct spelling) and need to urgently removed the overall. Look at how other brands like Levi's are doing in this area. Overall, Im very happy with the product.
