I was looking for good slippers to leave at my parent's home due to their wood floors.  These sounded cushy yet supportive.  They did provide good cushioning and a sturdy bottom which allowed me to step out on the deck or driveway even when wet outside. They were a little smaller than I thought they'd be.  If planning to possibly wear with docks I recommend buying  to q size larger.  I may order some for home and will order a bit larger. Sturdy,  well priced,  and comfy.
