I wear jeans to work every day and the Lee jeans are perfect for my needs. They are very reasonably priced, fit great and wear exceptionally well given the rough environment I work in. Oh, and since I'm short, because they offer a 29 inch inseam, I don't have to spend time and extra money having them taken up!
