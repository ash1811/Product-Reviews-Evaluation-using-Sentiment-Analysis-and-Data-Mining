Here's what I needed: a wounderful pair of sunglasses. I'm been used to wear sunglasses since ... I don't remember when and if I forget them home I come back to take them because I can't stay without.But unlucky I lost my old dear sunglasses, so I though to buy immediately another pair.Why these? The old ones were all black. I looked for something like them, but then I decided to change and now I have a wounderfull pair of sunglasses very confortable, with gold frame and lenses of a stange but more clear color: a mix of brown, pink and silver.When I place my order I was a little worried because I hoped they weren't too pink. Luckly I was wrong: this mix of colours is fantastic.Encluded there's also a little tan box in faux leather perfect to put in them when you don't use'em.Don't loose this item!!!
