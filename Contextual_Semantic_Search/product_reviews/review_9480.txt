I ordered my daughter-size 11 women's-this shoe and the Reef men's Fanning Sandal. I ordered the men's in a size 10. She likes the Fanning sandal better for comfort, but the bottoms have a metal bottle opener attached (see our review-yuk).She thinks the Columbia Tango Thong looks nicer. The Tango also has a bigger profile and is a little heavier sandal.We will update this review if needed.
