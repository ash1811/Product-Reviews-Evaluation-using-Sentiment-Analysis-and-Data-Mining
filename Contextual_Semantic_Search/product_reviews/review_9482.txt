I absolutely love this shirt, I have owned Wrangler Jeans and have always liked them, so having been a fan for nearly all of my 64 years, I decided, after looking at this and other similar ones, that I would purchase this. I have to tell you, I wore it yesterday for Thanksgiving and I am wearing it again this morning. It is one of the best looking and fitting shirts I own. I highly recommend it.
