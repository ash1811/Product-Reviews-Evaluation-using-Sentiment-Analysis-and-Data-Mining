I carry my polycarb macbook in this and one day I decided to carry it laid flat on my bicycle. The corner of the macbook rubbed a hole open at the top right in the nylon material. That is not all though. The nylon also made the rounded corner of my laptop square and made it black and jagged looking like a fingerprint about 7mm across. If you're going to carry a laptop in this use a sleeve. This backpack has a lifetime warranty so Ill see how that works out. Oh also I don't suggest you use this backpack with a tank top. The straps are extremely rough and will rub you red.
