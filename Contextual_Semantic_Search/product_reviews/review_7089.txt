I usually only wear white socks. Like all of the time. But a little while ago my wife busted my chops because I was wearing black pants, shirt, shoes and all, but I was wearing white socks. To make my wife happy, these socks did the job. They are thick like my white socks and in a color my wife likes... And as they say, if she's happy, well you know the rest. :-)
