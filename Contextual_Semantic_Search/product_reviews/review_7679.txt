If you need suspenders, I recommend the belt suspenders, you don't have to worry about the losing their grip and popping off and hitting you in the head.  lol  I would buy these again, in fact, I found a pair of belt suspenders that hook on the sides and not in the back , you put them on like a backpack and just hook them on your belt.  Thank You
