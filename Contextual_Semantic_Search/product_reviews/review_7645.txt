These long John's are long, as my girlfriend mentioned the other night.  They are the classic ones that you father wore deer hunting.  They are no BS quality.  I have had several pairs similar and I have enjoyed them to pieces, or literally holes.  These are my new set for the 2013 winter season.They shipped fast, and they were exactly as described.I wear them biking in Minneapolis, all year round.
