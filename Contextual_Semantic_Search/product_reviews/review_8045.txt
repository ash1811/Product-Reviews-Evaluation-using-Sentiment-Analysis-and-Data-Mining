I read some reviews and was a bit concerned with one that mentioned poor sewing and length of fingers being off...but many others were pleased with theirs and I assume the one reviewer got a bad pair perhaps irregulars?  I ordered with fingers crossed...I carry mail and need thinner gloves that still give some protection from cold but allow me to "feel" the mail and handle it as I walk or drive my route and deliver mail...these are the closest I have come to what I want so far...wish the grip dots on the palm and fingers was a bit more tacky. fit well and can handle the mail pretty well.
