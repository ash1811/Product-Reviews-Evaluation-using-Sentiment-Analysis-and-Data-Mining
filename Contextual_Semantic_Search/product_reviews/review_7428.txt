This sweatshirt, I call a jacket. I got it to replace my old jacket. My first thought was, it seemed rather expensive. But I bought it anyway. I notice right away the thermal lining was rough on the skin. I had read this in and earlier review. In another review a customer wrote to solve this problem run it thru the rinse cycle with some fabric softner. I did that twice and he was right, solved the problem right quick. This was a thick, heavy jacket that in the end turned out to be worth the money. Very happy with it.
