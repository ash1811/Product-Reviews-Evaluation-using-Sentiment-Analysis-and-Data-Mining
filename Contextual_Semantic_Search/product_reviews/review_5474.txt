When you want comfort, good looks,  and good wear Dickies will bring it.  One suggestion - wash them before wearing for the first time - much softer after one wash.  No wrinkles when you get them out of the dryer quick.  As to size - Dickies is not generous in providing extra room in the waist - order your true size (no elastic stretch here).  I wear them to work in a business casual environment - now most people would not do that but I look like some one who would so I can get away with it, if you are looking to rebel a little then you can too.  Dickies are a great replacement for jeans when actually doing physical work our outdoor activities as they will dry faster than jeans if you get caught in the rain.  I also use as a replacement for jeans when on my scoot.  Four stars for wear, quality, fit and value.
