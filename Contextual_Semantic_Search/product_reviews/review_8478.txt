My Slytherin scarf arrived in the mail very fast, within 2 days of purchasing. It came in a simple brown package that was very easy to open, with air bubble packaging on the inside. Overall, I like the scarf, but I thought it looked  different from the picture displayed. The silver stripes are actually a gray color, with the green color being a dark forest green. I wish the colors were more vibrant like in the picture. The Slytherin emblem was not sewn into the scarf as in the picture, but was instead a separate patch sewn onto the scarf. The frills at the bottom of the scarf fall out if you pull at them too much, and I find the scarf a wee bit itchy, since it is made of lamb wool. But overall, I do like the scarf and I think it is perfect for every Slytherin. I am excited to wear it during the fall and winter time! I would recommend it to a friend.
