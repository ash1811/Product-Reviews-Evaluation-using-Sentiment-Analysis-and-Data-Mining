Hi, I'm 48YO man, I have used all styles of Levi's since a was a teenager, and after 15 years I bought again a pair 501 STF rigid blue. It was nice to me to live again the experience of shrinking before wearing it, the fit after is unique. I usually wear W31 L31 so I follow the recommendations and bought W32 L34 and after two shrinking processes in hot water the results are W31 L32, the waist perfect but length is a little longer, it is not a problem at all but I think  next time I will buy W32 L33. It feels stiffy for about an hour after been washed, but this is the normal for 501 STF. I love it!. Strongly recommended!!!
