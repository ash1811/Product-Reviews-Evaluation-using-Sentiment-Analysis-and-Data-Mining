I read that they redesigned this bra and you should order up a size. unfortunately I read this after I purchased it, yup, I had to return the bra to Bare Necessities, they issued me an amazon credit and I repurchased it from amazon in a bigger cup size.  I didn't go up a band as I hate it when bra's stretch out and then all the weight is on your shoulders and not supported by the band like it's supposed to be.  it fits ok, but it just doesn't feel like previous Tisha Dream Bra's I've owned.  The straps are at a strange angle, seems like they are supposed to sit on the edge of your shoulder, when I pull them up a bit, they flex and bend and work their way back to the edge of my shoulder.  I bought some silicon bra strap pads that slide under the strap and strap sits in a groove, and they don't work at all on this bra, the straps are not straight, they are angled or something. The cups also seem to be a different shape than they used to be, they kinda separate my breasts and point them away from each other.  There are sharp edges around the hook and eye closures. it's like there is a piece of plastic between the two pieces of fabric sewn together where the hook and eyes are, and there are rough/sharp edges along the edges of the hook/eye sections.  I've had to trim them away, tried filing them down, today I put bandaids over the seams because I can't wear the bra anymore, the rough edges are driving me crazy.  I'm giving it 4 stars because it's a durable well made bra, but I'm not exactly happy with the recent mods to this model.
