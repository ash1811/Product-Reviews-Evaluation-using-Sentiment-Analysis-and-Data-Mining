This is my second of these - it's the best front-pocket wallet I've run across. It's nice and thin, while still holding 6 or more various types of credit / ID cards. The only negative is that your cash is simply folded and placed into the main pocket of the wallet. When you pull out your bills, be careful - some may end up on the floor. As long as you're careful, though, it's terrific.
