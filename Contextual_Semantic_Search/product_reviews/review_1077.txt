These worked well for their intended purpose; which was wearing after abdominal surgery.  My normal underpants hit in the middle of my long horrible line of staples.  I ordered these a couple of sizes too big and was much more comfortable.  Also (TMI here, sorry!) the blood and serous drainage washed out nicely.  These really did hold up well to laundering.
