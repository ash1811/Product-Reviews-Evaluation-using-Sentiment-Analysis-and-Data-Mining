Was a little large for me though. Maybe I should have ordered 34x32 instead of 34x34...My waist is 34 and it fits around fine there..but around the thigh and legs it looks a little thick...I have a slim body and skinny legs so it feels a little awkward because of that.So, final feedback:Colour: 5/5Size/Fit: 4/5Comfort: 4./5
