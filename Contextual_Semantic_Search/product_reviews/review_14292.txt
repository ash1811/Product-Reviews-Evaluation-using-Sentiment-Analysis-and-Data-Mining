This jeans have good sizing, fit well. The fabric is a little stiff, for most of us who are used to modern jeans fabric, but the quality is great, just wash it before you use it so it soften a little. Anyway, this are heavy duty jeans, they are designed for work so the fabric is thick and they are made for endure. The jeans are exactly as the picture, good fit, great color and great looking for wear them even out of work.
