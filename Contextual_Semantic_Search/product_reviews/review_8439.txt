Saw and bought this watch immediatly!  Wasn't sure about the blue face at first but soon as I put it on I loved it.  It's now my favorite out of all 10 Invictas I own!  Everyone says its huge but honestly it doesn't bother me at all.  For me, anything smaller feels and looks funny.  If I could give it 10 stars I would.  Highly recommended!!!
