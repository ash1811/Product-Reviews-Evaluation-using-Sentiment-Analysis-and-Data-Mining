I ALWAYS buy extra large for myself because I love the extra room when I sit and move around.  The generous pocket spaces provide room for stuff I need to get through the day.  I also need to wear a back brace and these shorts allow me to wear the brace and still have comfort space around my waist.  These shorts are highly recommended by me.
