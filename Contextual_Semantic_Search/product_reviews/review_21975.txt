I've been wearing something similar for years and thought I'd get this for my husband for Christmas. Unfortunately, it seems to be running small and had to be returned for a bigger size. He's a 9.5 and the 10 was tight, needs at least another half size to be comfy. Return was easy. I'd definitely buy from this seller again.
