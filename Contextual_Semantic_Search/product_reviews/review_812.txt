Sports bras for DD+ are a big load of nonsense. This does everything a sports bra is supposed to do (separation and compression) but does it better. I also wear the Flower Bali to the gym and tend to prefer that: my breasts have more depth than width and the way minimizers work is to compress the tissue along the width of you chest instead of holding it out. I think minimizers create a terrible silhouette, but this is an excellent choice for exercise.
