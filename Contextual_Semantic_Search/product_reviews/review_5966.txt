Well this is my first pair of danners. I use this as a dress boot actually because they look really nice. Had them about 3 months so far looks like ill be wearing them a long time.I do want to add here that I wear a EEE chipewah Hightop and this EE Danner is actually to big for me. I put in some dr scholls insoles and they fit about right now. Just a word of warning there.....Good product!
