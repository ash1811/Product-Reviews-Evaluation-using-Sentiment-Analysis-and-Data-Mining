I searched all over to try to determine what the manufacturer was claiming in a description of a &#34;warm, wooly lining.&#34; I was fairly sure they weren't selling sheepskin, though sheepskin is available for around the same price. In one of the product photos taken looking down from overhead, the tag is clearly visible and the &#34;warm wooly lining&#34; is 100% acrylic. It's not surprising that some customers find it flying out of the slipper in clumps after brief use.
