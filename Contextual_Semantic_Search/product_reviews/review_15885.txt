Made for combat boots indeed. These socks are thoughtfully constructed. The seam for the toe is not on or under the toes but above it. There is 3x thickness padding on the heels and 2xs thickness padding right at the instep. These are two places that chaffe badly when you are breaking in boots really of any kind whether it be construction, combat, hiking. Combat boot leather can be very stiff. These Thorlo socks increase your comfort during the break-in period because of the generous padding in all the right places. They wick moisture very efficiently. Super comfortable for all day wear. And when the temperature gets down, you'll be glad you have these on.
