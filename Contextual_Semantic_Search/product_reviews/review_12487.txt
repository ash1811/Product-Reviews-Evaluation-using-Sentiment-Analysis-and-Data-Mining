Very versatile, extremely comfortable, well padded, breathable shoes! They are also good for decorating to make your own unique shoes! I'll be buying them in black, navy  and stone  this year. I've had KEDS last for more than 5 years per pair with frequent use as my go to  casual shoe for use with jeans, casual skirts, shorts and capris. They are fabulous to say the least!
