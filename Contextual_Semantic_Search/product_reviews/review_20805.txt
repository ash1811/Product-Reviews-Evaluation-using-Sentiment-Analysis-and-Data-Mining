OK, so I usually wear a medium and bought in XL because thanks to all you alert writers who warned me the sizes come smaller than expected.  And the XL fits great, looks terrific, is super-comfortable, and perfect for year-round wear.  I usually wear it all by itself with no other topping in summer, and layer it in winter--works wonderfully, and is modest enough to wear alone.  So if you want to buy, get a couple of sizes up and you will be happy!
