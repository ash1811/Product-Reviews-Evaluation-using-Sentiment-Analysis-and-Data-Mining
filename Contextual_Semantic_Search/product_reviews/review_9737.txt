In this particular catagory (square leg suits) the legs will normally be tight, so buy the correct size, don't be overly optimistic like you may with lycra. Nothing yet will ever not fade with chorine but on the other hand these fit better after being "washed out"Nylon doesn't usually make a good drag suit, go with vented polyester, but they will be baggy instead of the snug fit you get with these.  By the way, competition (racer) speedos are always the best, don't go for mis-applied modesty, you're at the pool, go for it!
