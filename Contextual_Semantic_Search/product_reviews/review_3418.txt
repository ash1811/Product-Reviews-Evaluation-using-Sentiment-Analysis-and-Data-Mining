In my experience, it is rare to find a sports bra that doesn't create a breast shelf on larger cup-size women. This bra actually creates separation while providing appropriate lift (doesn't create cone breasts for me). It's very comfortable as well. As for support, I'd rate it as an 8 on a 10-point scale which is fine because, for me,  a bra that rates a 10 out of 10 for larger busted women has to be so tight and constrictive that it just isn't comfortable. One reason that this bra does provide very good support is that it is high cut enough to keep the breasts in place while moving around. Regarding fit, I initially ordered one cup size larger than my usual size since my past experience with sports bras was that they ran a bit small. I found this not true for this style bra, so I returned it and ordered my usual size which is just right.
