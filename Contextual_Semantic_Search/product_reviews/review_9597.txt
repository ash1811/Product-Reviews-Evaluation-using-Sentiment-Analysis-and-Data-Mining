These are good jeans. I do a lot of horse riding and I have found Wrangler jeans to be my overall personal favorite for that activity. They are comfortable and just stretchy enough for mounting large horses. I am a slim built man so I wasn't sure about which 'fit' of jeans to order. Being me, I ordered both the slim fit AND the original fit. As a skinny guy, I kind of expected the original fit to be a little baggy and the slim fit to be closer to my actual size. I was wrong.The original fit actually is closer to my skinny size and fit me just right. The slim fit are almost skin tight. Although I am not knocking the slim fit because the stretch factor makes them wearable and they are not entirely uncomfortable. I guess I just prefer the little extra 'breathing' room afforded in the original fit. So be sure you are either skinnier than I am (I'm 150 lbs) or you like the tight feel before you purchase these.Wrangler is still a good buy either way.
