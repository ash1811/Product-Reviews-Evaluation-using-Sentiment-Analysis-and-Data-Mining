I bought this to wear under a Halloween costume that was very tight and very short. I got the 2x/3x and I am about 5'8 and about 175lbs. I usually wear a 14 but most of my weight is concentrated around my tummy (gotta love being an Apple body type) and I wanted something that would pull that in and give me more of an hourglass silhouette. I have tried a few other pieces of shape wear in the past but this was the first I tried that had a hook and eye closure and boning as opposed to the stretchy pull-on styles which seemed to roll a lot. I loved that this really targeted the problem areas for me and that it was long enough to pull down all the way over my tummy. However, I am short-waisted and long-legged so I think this could potentially not be long enough for someone with a really long torso who is trying to cover up that lower belly fat. I loved that it came up just high enough not to interfere with my bra and seemed to be made of quality material. It was more comfortable than I thought it was going to be and I wore it to three different events.  Definitely glad I did the research and decided on this waist cincher because of the reviews.
