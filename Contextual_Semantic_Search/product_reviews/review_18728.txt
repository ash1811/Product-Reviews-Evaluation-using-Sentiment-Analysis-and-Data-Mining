This bra may work for those of us with bullet or more pointy-shaped breats, but if your rounded, like me, this bra is ENTIRELY UNSUITABLE. Even ordering a cup size down, I would have had to stuff something in the nipple area just to fill out the pointed front of the cup. Weirdness! And even if it had fit, the front seams are so obvious and unsightly that tee shirts are out of the question! Let the Madonna jokes fly. This one went promptly back.
