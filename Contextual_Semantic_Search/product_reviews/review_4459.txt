I wear these shirts for my job (they are given to us, and must be tucked in when worn) and I would love to meet the person who decided these were long enough to be tucked in and that the enormous fit around the stomach area was appropriate. They come untucked way too easily and the bunched up look in the waist when tucked in is unavoidable unless you're very fat... it looks sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer fit or athletic fit and with a longer tail I would buy a lot of them.
