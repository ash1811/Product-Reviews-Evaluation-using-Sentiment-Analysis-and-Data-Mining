Romy is perfect for the 10-15 miles I walk every week.  The roomy toe box allows my toes to move as they should when doing fast paced walking.  If the toe box lacks height, my toes rub on the inside top of the shoe causing soreness and sometimes blisters.  That doesn't happen with these.  I used to wear Punter but these are much better for my problem.  Do I love them?  Sure do.  This is my third pair!.
