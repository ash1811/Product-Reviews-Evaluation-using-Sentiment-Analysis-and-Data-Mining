I was told about these from my podiatrist and they are good for a wear everyday shoe. I wear these in my shoes everyday and for the most part they are good. They are not like my custom made orthotics but they are decent for everyday wear if you are on your feet all day. I am not sure how they would work in running or work out shoes since your foot is suppose to mold to them. The best method would probably be to put them in the oven like the directions state. I didn't and I just wore them until they stopped hurting and that let me know they molded to my foot, but I don't recommend this method. Use the heated method since it is faster.
