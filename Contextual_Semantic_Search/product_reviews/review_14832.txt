Love Carhartt gear.  These shirts are very nice.  High quality stitch.  You can feel the quality of the shirt the fist time you put it on.  The shirt is cut very well to fit.  The only down side is that it has a bit too much shrink after the first wash.  I would recommend going one size larger to account for the shrink.  I will buy again.
