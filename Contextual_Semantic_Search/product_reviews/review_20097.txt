I got these for my son as a gift and they are awsome! They are nice and thick and  softer than alot of rubbery type boots. They are good and flexible. Good steel toes for protection. My son is soooooo picky about his shoes so now when he is doing something that would mess up his good shoes he can just take them off and slip these on and then hose them off when hes done! What a great thing to have!
