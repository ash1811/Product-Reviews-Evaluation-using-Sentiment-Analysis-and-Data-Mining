We bought these for our son (4 1/2) on the recommendation of a friend, and they are a good fit! They are a little long on him but he will definitely grow into them. The adjustable tie is great! He does complain that the inside where the elastic strap is sewn in itches his foot, which is the only reason I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5. They are holding up quite well!
