I ordered the 58mm all black and they are amazing. I love them more than the black lenses with the gold frames. Definitely will not go out of style. I get plenty of compliments on them and the price was really reasonable. If they broke I will definitely order these again. They are Ray Ban so the likely-hood of them breaking is unlikely.
