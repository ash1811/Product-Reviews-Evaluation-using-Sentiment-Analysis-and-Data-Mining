Arrived in no time at all! My son loves these and had to wear them around the house for the rest of the evening. Bought them for a trip to the Oregon Coast - haven't tested in that environment just yet but its a rubber boot (not a reinvented wheel). The rubber is soft enough that Im not worried about them getting uncomfortable for him.
