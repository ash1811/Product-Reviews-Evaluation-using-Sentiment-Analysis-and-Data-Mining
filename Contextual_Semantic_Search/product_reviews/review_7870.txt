My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size. The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece. The vest itself let me wanting a little more. The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest. It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer. I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight, but for the price I paid I'd have to say it matches the quality. I guess I expected a little more from Columbia, as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations. Guess I'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase. The style and color are nice, but I also got the "bunching" effect during active use, maybe better as a low activity use item, walking around town and such. It really comes down to what you'll be using it for, activity level and quality of other layering items.
