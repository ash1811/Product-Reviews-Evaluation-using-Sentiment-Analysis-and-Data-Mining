I'm 5'4" tall 130 pounds (mostly muscle think athletic) and a 34C+ a little bit.  I've been crying ever since my breast augmentation (I didn't even go that big just from a B to a C cup) but since that 2 months ago I'm like "HOW AM I GOING TO RUN WITH THESE ON MY CHEST???!!!".  I love running... SO, got on the WEB and Enell came  up right away for BIG chested gals or women like me who just FEEL BIG chested (suddenly).  YES!!!! I'll have to chime in now with all the people here who say IT'S TRUE!  This is about as minimal bounce as you can get... even I (34C) had to lie down to do the hooks, but once they're done - it's done!  No adjusting or tugging or pulling (you can't it's a total body HUG).  And I love that.  Suggestions... PLEASE replace those (swearing) hooks with an industrial strength zipper!  You know, the kind that comes on your Ski Jacket???  The really can't ruin kind of zipper... with maybe ONE hook at the top just to make sure it stays zipped.  Also... Yes, I've read the Enell website - WHY the "LOOK LOOK I HAVE BOOBS!" screaming seem is there... (for stability and separation) but PLEASE - WE HATE THE SEAM!!!Colors... I'll wear black.. white? NO way, looks goofy, Pink?  Doesn't fly with me too girly whirly (but that's just me)... beige?  What?  That's the color of my underpants I don't want anyone to see no way.  So it's the black... MAKE MORE COLORS THINK THE RAINBOW AND EARTH TONES AND SOLIDS --- WHAT ABOUT SOME PATTERNS TO DISTRACT FROM THAT HORRIBLE SEAM?  Okay... on the whole, I like the bra alot - it works with minimal bounce... I have the Maia bra coming (Moving Comfort) let's see which works best.  Hmmmm.  I bought size 0 &lt; my best guess for 34C+ a little bit and it's great.  I even think this bra improved my posture while running, no more 'hunching' and tensing my shoulders trying to keep the OTHER bras on, in place or secure...  Okay.  Over and out.  Buy ONE, Try ONE.  One is really all you need, unless you run every day - then you'll want two - one to wear and wash and dry (I wash mine in the shower and roll in a towel and hang to dry) and one to wear the next day while the first one dries &lt; it's just easy not necessary though / I'm sure they do fine in the washer - but I wouldn't risk it due to the hooks.  (Do the bigger sizes have many more hooks???  I'm wondering.  Okay... that's it.  Buy and try and decide for yourself, I can only speak for me.
