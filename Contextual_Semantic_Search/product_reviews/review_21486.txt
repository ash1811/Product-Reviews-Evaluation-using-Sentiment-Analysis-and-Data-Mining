I bought these for my 2 year old (26 month old).  He can easily put them on and take them off himself which is nice for me and fun for him.  They are great quality and look just like fireman boots. I bought these a couple sizes bigger than his feet now so he has room to grow.  He did have a bit of trouble walking in them the first time but got the hang of it quickly.  They go up almost to his knees (he is 33 inches tall). He wears them mostly for dress-up right now but has used them in the rain once.
