I do like the fit, I got this size, not sure the fit and a D is usual for me but this fits. I like it snug.One feature I don't care for it's it rides up at the front band, us shorter waisted ladies need longer band or more fitted to our needs.any suggestions on type of bra's to help that problem?But I do like it , I will try the front hook next.
