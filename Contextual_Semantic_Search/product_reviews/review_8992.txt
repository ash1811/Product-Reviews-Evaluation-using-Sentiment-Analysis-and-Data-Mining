I don't know if Amazon sent me the wrong color or if the picture is wrong, but the picture that shows the LEVI 501 STF 501s in "Black Fill" is not right. The picture shows an inky blue 501 and what Amazon sent me was just a Black pair of 501s. I don't know which is wrong, but I'm sending them back and I don't want someone else to make the same mistake.Amazon needs to update this page or their inventory because if the picture shown is correct, then they sent and pulled the wrong pair, which I find is highly unlikely since all the items are given an item number for identification, and not pulled from a verbal or visual description.The 501s themselves deserve 5-stars once you find the right ones that will shrink to your body shape and size.
