I had a similar experience to another &#34;poster&#34;.  I ordered a blue pair and a black pair.  The blacks shoes fit well.  The blue were small and tight.  I measured them against each other and the blue was definitely smaller.  Sadly Amazon would not let me exchange them and the price had increased significantly...so I could not buy them again.  One style.  Two sizes for the supposed same size.  Beware.
