Hanky Panky Signature Lace is the best panty I have ever worn.  You can put in the washing machine and nothing bad happens to the material they don't wear out either, lasts a long time.  One size fits all is really true believe it or not the thong is very comfortable I wear it under my gym clothes and hiking clothes.
