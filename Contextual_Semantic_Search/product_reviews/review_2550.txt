In Florida, we do a lot of boat diving. That means hauling gear to and from your car to the dock, and loading and unloading gear onto the boat. This little weight bag takes the hassle out of loading your gear bags. Dive gear is bulky, and heavy plus bulky on a boat makes for awkward transitions. Removing the weight makes it much easier to load your gear, then just hand your weights down to the boat. Easy as pie.
