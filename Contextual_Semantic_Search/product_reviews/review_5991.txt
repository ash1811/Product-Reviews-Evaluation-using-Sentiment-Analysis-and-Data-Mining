Over the years I have bought many different brand of tennis shoes.  These Easy Spirit are the most comfortable I have ever worn, so that is all I purchase now.  They conform to the foot, they are comfortable, the leather on top is soft, and they wear well.  I put them in the washer and then set on top to dry and they turn out great every time.  The only time I have to re-order is when the heal wears to one side only because of the way I walk.  I have since bought an insert for inside the shoe to tilt my one foot so the shoe does not wear like that any longer.  I LOVE THEM.  I have also bought black to wear through the winter with slacks.
