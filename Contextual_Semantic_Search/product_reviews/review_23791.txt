I ordered a 5x just incase they shrank when washed. What I got were a 5x top and a 4x bottom. The bottoms were too long and the top just fit snuggly. Good thing I ordered a size or two up. In other brands  I get a 3x. You can tell these are their lower end products. They are okay in a pinch but I would not order again
