I wear a medium in pants.  I ordered this pants in a large because I wear a lumbar back brace.  I couldn't even get these pants up to my knees.  They were like a size small.  The sizing is so off, I would not know what size to order.  I have several other pairs of pants like these and I wear medium or large in them with brace.  Totally disappointed.
