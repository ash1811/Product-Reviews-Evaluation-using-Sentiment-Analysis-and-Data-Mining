I'm a minimalist wallet kind of guy. I was looking for something to hold about ten cards (credit/ID/medical) and a few bills. And I wanted them all to be easy to access. The wallets I've found so far are either too bulky or require bills to be carefully folded. Once I placed a couple of cards in this wallet, getting bills in and out of the center fold was nearly impossible.I designed and made my own duct-tape wallet which works perfectly and which will have to suffice until I can find a more durable (and classy...) leather equivalent.
