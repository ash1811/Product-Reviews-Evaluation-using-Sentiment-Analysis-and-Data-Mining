I LOVE THESE!!! I live in Florida, so this fabric is divine in the summer. Remember those nylon slips from when you were a little girl? You know, like the ones your Mom always wore? That's what this is made of. It is so lightweight, you feel naked. It's wonderful in this heat. Why don't they design more clothing in this nylon? I now want to have a few dresses made out of this stuff. I found my new favorite fabric, teehee.
