Due to the fact that these 'little machines" are cheaply made , i didnt have great expectations......."you get what you paid for"........was i so wrong!!.....this watch winder is outstanding!!......a beautiful design, extremely quiet, quality materials and it actually works!!!........i couldnt be happier.The price for this item is more than reasonable , you couldnt get a better deal. If you have more than one automatic watch  this winder is a must!!!
