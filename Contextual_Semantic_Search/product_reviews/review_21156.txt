My son is 11 and a half, an avid skateboarder dude who is now wearing a size 6. He really hates flip flops and sandals but I needed to find him something to wear around the pool and at the beach. I already own and love Sanuk flip flops so I took a chance on these and he just loves them. They are wider to fit a young man's foot and the design is cool, they look great and he says they are extremely comfortable. I still can't believe I got him out of his Vans lol. Thank you Sanuk :)
