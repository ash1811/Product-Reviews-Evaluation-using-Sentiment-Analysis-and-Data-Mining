I receieved my carhartt relaxed fit jeans,in 38x28&#34; and all I can say is they are great!! made like the levis of old, Only better for me because of the 28&#34; length. they fit perfect. levis never did make a 28&#34;, and I hate rolling up the cuffs,so that allways left about 1,1/2 dragging behide me. But no more smile.I will be ordering more. thanks carhartt and amazon,  Pitbullman&#34;
