My wife bought a couple of these first. I saw them and liked what I saw. Then I learned that she had bought a men's vest, so I was pretty sure I could have one, too! The zipper on the pockets is necessary, since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out. I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist. I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that. The material is pleasingly soft and warm. They clean up in the washing machine.My wife's two vests are the same size, but the waistband is larger on one than the other. They were manufactured in different countries.
