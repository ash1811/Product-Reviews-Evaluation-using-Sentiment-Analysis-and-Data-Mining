My sons are 3 & 5 years old and love this costume.  They run around the house and play in it all the time.  It is made with nylon type fabric, not an expensive costume at all.  But the mask works great, with velcro, and the cape is wonderful.  And you can wash it with no issues!  That is key with a small child's costume.  I would really recommend it.
