I don't know what others are looking for but I didn't find what I had hoped for in these shorts. The fabric is stiff, almost rough rather than supple. The crotch has a 2 - 2 1/2" inset that is unsightly and the seam in the back is folded over at the waistband, and sewn down. Poor workmanship. Also, the waistband is the kind used on men's underwear, which makes the shorts look like an undergarment. Return policy is poor and shipping is high so make sure you are not going to return these shorts.
