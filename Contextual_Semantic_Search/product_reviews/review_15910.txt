I usually wear work boots (construction), and a lot of the socks I've worn in the past tend to fall down after a while.  This causes the tops of the boots to chafe my ankles.  These socks stay up all day.  On days which start out cold and warm up, they keep my feet comfortable, without excessive sweating.  And, the cushioning on the bottoms of these socks feels pretty good after I've been on my feet for a few hours.  All in all, well worth the very reasonable Amazon price.
