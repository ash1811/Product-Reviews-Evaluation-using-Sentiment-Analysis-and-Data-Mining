Love the shoes! I've been looking for a pair of the Minnetonka Thunderbirds with a good sole. This one has a nice boat sole with some tread. I ordered the red - and it's not TOO red - more of a saddle color - a nice russet shade in a soft leather. Fits well, true to size. Very happy with this purchase.
