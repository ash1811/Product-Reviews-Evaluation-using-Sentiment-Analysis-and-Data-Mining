I give them credit where credit is due, these are well made and authentic looking paratrooper pants, that said, they are way too small in size and I believe the problem is that they don't cme in specific size ranges only S,M,L,XL. I went to the manufacturers site to try to get a handle on what those sizes represent but to no avail they were just too small. Now they do offer straps that afford so latitude in size range but it's very limited. I was also disappointed in the width of the pant legs themselves, I expected them to have more flair to them then that had. I'm going to return these and in spite of how well made they are I am not going to try the next size up. Because of the lack of precision in sizing I would not recommend these to someone else. I know that this is a common issue with fatigues but it would seem like it would make more sense to make them in size ranges say of 2 inches rather than small fits 28-32&#34; waist because you really don't have 4&#34; of play so unless you are a perfect match it's hard to get them to fit.
