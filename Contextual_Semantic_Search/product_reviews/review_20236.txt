The sizing is smaller than expected; I ordered a large and it's more like a medium, so future buyers need to be aware of this. Decent sleeve length but the length of the shirt overall is quite disappointinh.  I had ordered one size larger in hopes of using the shirt as an over-shirt, but it's just too short for that.
