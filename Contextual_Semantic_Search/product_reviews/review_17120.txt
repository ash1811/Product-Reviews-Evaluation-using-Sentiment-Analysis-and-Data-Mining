I use these pants for working around the house particularly when I am preparing a room for painting.  In the past, I also purchased Dickies Men's Relaxed Fit Duck Carpenter Jean.  Those fit great being loose enough to be very comfortable for working around the house.  I was surprised to find that the fit of the utility pant being reviewed was much tighter even though both are made by the same company.  Strange that they would use different patterns for essentially the same pants.  Because of the tighter fit (less comfortable for me as I am a big guy weighing about 250 lbs. in a six foot frame) I am only awarding a rating of three stars.  If the fit was comparable to their Dickies Men's Relaxed Fit Duck Carpenter Jean pants, I would have awarded five stars.
