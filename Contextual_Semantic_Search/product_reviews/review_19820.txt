As I am overseas, I find reviewer feedback valuable when making online purchases to ensure I don't waste time and money on shipping. I listened to fellow reviewers and ordered a size up (if I had followed sizing chart provided by Amazon.com, I would've had to return for bigger size). Slippers are beautiful, well-made and oh so comfy.
