I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  It was one of three Invictas purchased as special gifts for him.  This watch was just that...special.  It's a timeless classic that I know he'll be wearing frequently.  It's a handsome watch.  It looks and feels expensive, but was very economical.  You can't beat that...a great watch for a great price.  Buy this watch!
