I used to be a die hard Levi man but their quality really dropped! The last 3 pairs lasted 6 months then holes in the legs appeared (not in the seams!). I switched to Wranglers 4 years ago at my brother-in-laws suggestion (about half the price of Levi's) and they're a perfect fit and after 4 years still look and fit great; I hate to retire the 4 year old pants to work pants (painting, mechanic work, etc) since they still look and feel good.
