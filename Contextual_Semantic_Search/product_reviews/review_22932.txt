These shoes are wonderful, I do a lot of prolonged standing, have back and knee problems, the support is wonderful.  My son  told me about them as he works in a hospital and the Dr's and Nurses wear them. I had to buy everyone in my family a pair for Christmas.  Shoebye are the best, prompt shipping and good packaging. I will continue to buy my Klogs from them!!
