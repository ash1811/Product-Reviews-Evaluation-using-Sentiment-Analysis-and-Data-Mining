THEESE BOOTS ARE EVEN MORE HANDSOME IN PERSON. I BOUGHT THEESE FOR MY HUSBAND AND HE LOVES THEM ....HIS ONLY COMPLAINT IS I SHOULD HAVE ORDERED A WHOLE SIZE BIGGER INSTEAD OF A HALF SIZE ...I ALWAYS ORDER A HALF SIZE BIGGER BECAUSE THE WINTER SOCKS HE WEARS ARE QUITE BULKY SO HES A LILTTLE SNUG IN THE TOES ...BUT WITH &#34; NORMAL&#34; WINTER SOCKS A HALF SIZE SHOULD BE PERFECT
