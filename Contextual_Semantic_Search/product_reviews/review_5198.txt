Bought this just over a year ago and the strap is falling apart :o(  I wear my watches daily and do a lot of physical activity so I need them to be able to take a lot of abuse.....this one did not perform well at all.  The color fades to a yucky tarnished brown color....pretty for a few months and then....well yuck!  Since you can't change out the strap this thing is a terrible waste of money.....now I have to buy a new watch and it won't be one with this type of strap.  The strap has a wider end to it and it keeps catching on everything!  Oh and did I mention that the strap has stretched and stretched.....I was using it on hole #3 and now it's on #5 and still stretching......just NOT a good buy.
