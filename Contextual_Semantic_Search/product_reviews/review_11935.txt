I bought two pair of these.  One for me, and one for our son (17).  he was not so keen on the brand, but the fit is great.  I like the sharp clean design, and they fit just fine for walking shoes.  No complaints.Fast free shipping, fair pricing, quality product, adiquate packaging.  What more can we ask for, right?  Thank you Amazon.com.
