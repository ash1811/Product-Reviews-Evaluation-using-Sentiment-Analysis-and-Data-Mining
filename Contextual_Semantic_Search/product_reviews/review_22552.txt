This watch looks slick. I noticed that other people had trouble setting the time. It can be difficult but I just followed the directions on the watch and with some patience got it set correctly. I wear this watch everyday. I haven't noticed any of the second hand problems people have mentioned.It took a couple of days for the band to feel comfortable but now it does. The box it comes with is pretty cool looking too. I am excited to no longer have a need to buy batteries.
