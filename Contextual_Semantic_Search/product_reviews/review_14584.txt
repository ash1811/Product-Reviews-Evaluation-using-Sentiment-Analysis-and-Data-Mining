I love my Birkenstock Boston Clogs.  I have owned several pairs of these shoes since I was in high school and I keep coming back to purchase more.  These are the most comfortable all weather slip-ons that I have ever owned.  If you are on the fence, don't hesitate.  You will love them forever.  Here's a tip I wish someone would have told me years ago.  In general, women should purchase the narrow size while men should purchase the regular size.  I normally wear a size 8.5 (regular width) in women's flat shoes, and the 39N fits me perfectly.  Try this classic style.  The comfort and quality will not disappoint.
