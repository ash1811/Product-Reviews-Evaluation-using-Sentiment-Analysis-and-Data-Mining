Most torsolettes do not hold me up properly, this one did wonderfully.  I am a 34F and it gave me great lift and shape.  Nice bonus of smoothing out your waist as well.  It is a bit tight fitting and digs in a little at the top of the back however because it holds me so well I don't mind.  I will just need to tone up me back more.
