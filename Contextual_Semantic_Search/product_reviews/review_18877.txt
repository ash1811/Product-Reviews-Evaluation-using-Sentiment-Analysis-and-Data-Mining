It's interesting to read all of the wide-ranging experiences with this product! I have a biggish foot and consider my "real" size to be 10.5, but sizes vary from manufacturers so I tend to use a 10-11 range. My foot is not thick or boxy, like man feet. These fit a little loose for me in the wide size, but mostly loose in the heel. My foot is not especially wide, but a pointy toe box is not workable for my feet so I can see why people with actual wide feet would not find this wide enough since it fits me only very, very slightly roomy in the vamp. These have a European kind of casual look without swerving into hippy-wear. I wish I had bought the black ones when I had the chance. Anyone unhappy with your shoes in 10 C/D, return them so I can buy them! I bought Olive and even get compliments on them from men!
