All right, this is not an invitation to walk all day in them, because they just aren't walking shoes.  However, they are oh-so-comfortable putz around in shoes.  The yoga mat is satisfyingly squishy while still being relatively supportive, and the upper is seamless and soft for perfect comfort.  Am waiting till this coming summer, then am gonna buy another pair, this time in aqua :-).
