These shoes run small.  I always wear size 9 but after reading other reviews I ordered 9 1/2 and they are a little tight.  You should definitely order a half size up, or maybe even a full size up if you want to wear socks or add your own insoles.These shoes don't get a 5 star rating because they have &#34;faux fur&#34; insoles that don't come out (or at least I haven't found a way to get them out yet).  I would rather use my own insoles, and I only want faux fur in my slippers or maybe winter boots.
