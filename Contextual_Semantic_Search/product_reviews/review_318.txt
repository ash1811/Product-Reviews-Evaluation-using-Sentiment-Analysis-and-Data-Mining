I wear a size 7M and was leery about ordering one size smaller, but did it and I am very happy. I use orthopedics in-soles which fit inside nicely too. Very comfortable shoe and quality is excellent. Highly recommend. With Amazon, if the shoe doesn't fit, return it for the right size, but on your initial order I recommend ordering 1 size smaller.
