This is lightweight, nice material, easy to wear under clothing, secure place for passport, money, hotel key, driver's license. The strap is a little long so we just cut it off shorter. Perfect for detering pickpockets and not noticeable under a shirt (not so under t-shirts, but still safer than in a pocket)
