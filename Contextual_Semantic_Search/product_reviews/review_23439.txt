Cute bag, good size for around town.  Nice to have everything organized and in place.  Credit cards, id, checkbook, etc are in perfect place.  The large zipper compartment can hold kindle, play book and organizer with ease.  Do not expect your droid cellphone to fit in the secret strap compartment - not going to happen.  In fact barely fits in the side pocket.  And the net to hold water is tiny so no water there but nice to drop in your keys and holds them secure.  I use the secret compartment in the strap for cash - perfect.  The strap to hold keys is great though a larger clip would be useful.
