I was willing to spend up to $80 on a watch that/had did a few basic things:1) large display with large easy-to-hit lap button2) had at least two time-lines independently running, so that I could see a cumulative time and a last-lap timeThis watch does it. I looked at other watches for more money and the money was not even a consideration, because this watch covers those perfectly.I use it for speed work and road races. Its 50 lap is going to cover a person in any race (if you're doing an ultra marathon, they're not going to have mile markers that often anyway!). There are a couple of display formats, but I use the default, which has a cumulative time in the large numbers and, when one hits the lap button at a lap/mile, it freezes everything on the display, showing the cumulative at that last click as well as the last mile's time. It holds this for 10 seconds and then resumes, with the cumulative time on the bottom and the current lap on the top. One could probably switch those around, but I've not tried.Its 50 lap memory works well.Its 3 alarms are cool and it also has an interval timer, which I must admit I've not used.Timex OBVIOUSLY put a lot of thought into the design and functionality of this watch. There are no silly things that were added that are of no use. Clearly they interviewed runners to determine exactly what this watch should have. The night mode is also cool--if one holds down the light button for 4 seconds, the watch enters night mode, and now any button click at all will turn the light on for a short bit. Very useful for night/early morning runs.
