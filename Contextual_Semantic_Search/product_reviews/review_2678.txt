I wasn't sure if I was going to like this as I was buying it online, but it is the perfect size and I love the big numbers and  ... my husband keeps trying to steal it! I have relatively small hands and a narrow wrist so was concerned about the size of the watch face because I know some of them are rather large (for a man's wrist) ... this one is perfect!TIP: I measured the top of my wrist to get an idea of what size watch face would work.
