The Rosetta Stone process gets you involve through what they call immersion right away, and I found it quite fun.  You run the application and learning CD's through your computer, plug in your headset/microphone to the USB port, enroll on line for the web support and community and off you go.You can hear it, see it, see how your respond, and it pretty much sweeps you along and gets you quite involved.  I have learned languages(the Romance languages) traditionally in school and self-taught over the years, and I found Rosetta very helpful and engaging.The negatives are the price, and this is only Level One.  It's a fine start, but if you're serious, you're going to have to do a lot more work and dish out for the next level.  Your call!May I suggest, for quick learning, say for a trip: get a tape/cd and a book.  Learn the quick, important phrases, practice some everyday- use it, use it, use it- hear it and say it, and if you can, practice with a native speaker- you really learn that way, and you get over the nervousness of being ignorant about the language and constantly fretting about making mistakes.If you're willing to pay the price and put in time- some of us just love computer, and it also includes an Audio CD for practice elsewheres, the Rosetta Stone French will give you a good, fun start into French or any new language.
