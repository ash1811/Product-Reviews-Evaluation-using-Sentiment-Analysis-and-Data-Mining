The perfect sized watch for the guy with an average sized wrist.. Extremely functional and an eyecatcher to boot..The locking crown keeps out the water and coundown timer is based on one click per one minute..The luminous feature really is great for low light to no light situations and holds up for over 9 hours brightly. Best part is it's a Seiko!
