I had one for a long trip to Israel.  Held my small camera, sunglasses, a few shekels, energy pills, and a bunch of small misc.  Darn if I didn't give it away 6 months after we returned home.  Tried other over the shoulder small bags but I missed this one for it's rugged look, perfect size and comfortable carrying.  Being made of canvas you can won't mind tossing it around or getting it dirty.  And, it is manly!  Send me another!
