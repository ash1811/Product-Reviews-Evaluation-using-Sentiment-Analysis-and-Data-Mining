Fits well with extra inches round the buttock and thigh.  Just the type Im looking for. Normally jeans are either too tight or too baggy. Not comfortible for oldies like me. I ended up buying bigger or pleated. This one fits me well.  I bought W36 and L28. Only if they have size W36 and L26/27.  That will be perfect.
