I had much higher hopes for this bra- I was hoping for something as comfy as a stretch half-cami or light weight sport bra, but with enough shape and support that I could wear it around, to work, etc.  It was a poor compromise, and not acceptable for either.  I'm better off with a soft sport bra for home, and a real bra for work.
