I got these for my wife. She loves them and they look great on her, very cute! They are handmade, albeit overseas, entirely of very soft leather, including the bottoms, which are soft. My wife says some people will wear only these shoes because they believe standard-shoe-rubber insulates them from the earth, while these allow them to remain connected to it. I'm not sure if I believe that, I'm more of the opinion that a shoe can't connect or disconnect you but I digress, these are great shoes. They slip on and off. They really look great. Because there is less material, they make my wifes feet look smaller, which is kind of cute, and I don't have a thing for feet or anything. They look much better in person. They are very simple, no weird colors, no weird patterns, just nice clean lines that go with just about anything. I told her she shouldn't wear them outside because they're too pretty to get dirty, but she does, and they hold up!Hope that helps!
