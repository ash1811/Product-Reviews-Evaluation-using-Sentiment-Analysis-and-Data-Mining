For the average kid this is probably ok. I found the sleeves long compared to the length but that was ok because it didn't cause my son to trip. My son has a proportionally large head (3T-4T hats on a 24month body) so we had to do some alterations for the ears to fit.  He liked it so much he wore his ears long after the robe came off.
