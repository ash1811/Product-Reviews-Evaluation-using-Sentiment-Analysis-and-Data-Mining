When it has came down to Invicta, they definitely have known to make classy watches for so many years. But yet, they also have captured the essence of simplicity with all their classic watches. While they have caught on so much with their oversized pieces, they still have remained in simplicity with their classic automatic watches. That does come into play with this classic two-tone Pro Diver automatic watch. IT is very easy to setup, and delivers a nice elegance in design and style. I like the watch because it is very easy to take care of, offers a simple screw-down crown, and looks absolutely great in a great gold and silver finish. Yet, I do have a couple of gripes about the watch. The first one is that the unidirectional bezel can sometimes stick, and not rotate correctly. The second one is that I wish it could've had a bit more illumination from the hands. But nevertheless, this is one classy model that Invicta made for any horologist. I absolutely recommend this as a great buy for anyone that gets into Incita watches, with this for their first automatic timepiece.Price: BSetup & Comfort: B 1/2+Overall: B
