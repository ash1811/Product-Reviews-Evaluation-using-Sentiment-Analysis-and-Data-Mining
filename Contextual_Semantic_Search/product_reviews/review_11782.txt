I love my Merrells.  I bought this pair to replace an older pair that worn out over the years.  These shoes are comfortable, sturdy, and goes with so many outfits.  I've worn them with jeans, khakis, and shorts, along with almost any top you can think of.  I've walked with them everywhere.  These are great for vacations when space is an issue since they are so versatile.My only complaint about the Jungle Moc is that the flaps at the top instep of the shoe curls up a bit after a few wears.  The curling is not too noticeable but slightly annoying.  However, that does not stop me from wearing (and loving) these shoes.Overall, The comfort and fit alone makes these shoes worth every penny.
