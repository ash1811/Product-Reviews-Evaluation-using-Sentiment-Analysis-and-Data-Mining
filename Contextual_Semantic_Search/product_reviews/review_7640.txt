I bought a pair of these in large which is the same size I wear in Hanes briefs, but these run about one size smaller. They were a little snug when I tried them on, but after one washing they were way too tight. I have a 36&#34; inseam and the large size was way too short. If I pulled them up in the crotch area they were maybe half way up my calf. I ordered the next size up and they fit great. They are very comfortable and help keep me warm though, so just be aware of what size you need.
