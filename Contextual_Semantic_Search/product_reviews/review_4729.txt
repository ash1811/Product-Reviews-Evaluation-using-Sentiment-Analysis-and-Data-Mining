I'm of medium height, long legs, slim but muscular build.  These shorts fit perfectly, and are very comfortable.  They look pretty good as well, but I'm no fashion expert :-)  The fabric is soft-feeling and easy on the skin.I've found Carhartt shorts quite good both for everyday wear and for walking/hiking.  They last quite well, I haven't had to throw any out yet.
