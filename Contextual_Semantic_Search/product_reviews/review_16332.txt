I'm pretty picky about boots, especially because when I wear them I wear them all day. This is my second pair of Dan Post boots (I wore the other pair out completely), and this brand is my all-time favorite. There is very little break-in needed and they fit well from the first time you put them on. The price is also very reasonable. My one warning is make sure you have a good pair of tall boot socks when you wear these boots or they will rub against your calf.
