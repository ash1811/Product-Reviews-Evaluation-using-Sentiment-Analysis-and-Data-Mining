In a bra, I can usually wear a 38DD or a 40D, so I wasn't sure what I would wear in this bustier and sent for both.  It turns out that the 38DD fit me much better in the bust, so I sent this one back.  I do love that the stays don't show like they do in most such garments. I would have been much happier if I could find my size in black or neutral, since I'm not planning to be a bride anytime soon!
