I wanted this to protect my dress shoes for work. I occasionally take the bus and in Iowa winter weather can be harsh. I was skeptical as some of my dress shoes have long pointed ends, but these overshoes work perfectly. easy to take on and off. covers the shoe fairly well. couldn't be happier.i would recommend this to anyone wanting to protect their shoes from any sort of damage via weather.
