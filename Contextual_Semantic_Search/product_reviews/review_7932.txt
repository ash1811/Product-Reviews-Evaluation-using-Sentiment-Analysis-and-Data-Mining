I have always had a problem finding hats that actually keep the cold wind off of my ears which is where I seem to get the coldest..These ear muffs adjust easily for a perfect, comfortable fit. They are quite warm and seem pretty durable. It is very hard to find ear muffs like this these days, so I was very pleased to find a good quality product at such a reasonable price..
