I wear these when backpacking.  I wear them for several days in a row without bathing.  THEY ARE FANTASTIC.  If I had a ton of money I would buy about 14 pairs of these things.  My junk has never felt better than when wearing these.  They breathe well.  They are true to size. They are durable.  They are a gift from God.  Buy these.  Your man parts will thank you.
