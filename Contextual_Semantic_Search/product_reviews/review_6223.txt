I use to purchase Docker's all the time because of the quality, recent purchases of Docker pants have shown that the company is greedy, charging a high price for a poor quality item.  I decided to make a switch and try some IZOD pants.These pants fit perfect for me, the quality of the material is what Dockers used to be and at a much lower cost to me.A three way win.No more button popping, no more inaccurate lengths in their sizing chart (Dockers), no more thin easy rip issues.
