You just can't go wrong with Carhartt...well, at least I can't. The fit, durability, and appearance has me hooked. And the &#34;chicks&#34; seem to appreciate the way it makes a man look like he knows what he's doing! Seriously though...these are great Tee Shirts that you should be very pleased with.
