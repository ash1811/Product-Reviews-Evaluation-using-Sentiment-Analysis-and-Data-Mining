I bought this jacket for my dad, who is an avid golfer and wanted something to keep him dry during light rains.  The Large was a perfect fit, and the blue is the perfect shade - not too bright or too dark.  He said it has plenty of flexibility for his swing, and isn't too warm or cool.  It does well with keeping him dry, too!
