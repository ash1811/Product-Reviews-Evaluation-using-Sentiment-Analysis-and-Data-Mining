The size is exactly as you'd expect. They aren't skinny pants and aren't really baggy. The waiste fits well and doesn't dig into my sides like many pants do. I hard to bend over to pick something up and they had an obvious stretch to them so I had no fear of tearing/ripping. They're a nice set of pants for work or play. I ordered Khaki and will now order black and charcoal as a follow up order.Updated:I now have charcoal and black and they fit just as well. They are a fine quality fabric for warm or chilly days.
