I was always a Lee Jeans guy, but hadn't purchased any lately....saw the price and the fact that they had my size 31/34.....ordered and remembered why I like Lee. These feel like they should. Fit without being  too constrictive or too baggy.. quality is good..love the black....have to order other colors now
