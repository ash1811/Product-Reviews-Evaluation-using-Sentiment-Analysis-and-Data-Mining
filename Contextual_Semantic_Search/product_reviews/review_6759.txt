These are the most comfortable socks I have bought. They are nice and thin and do not bunch up when I put my loafers on. They also stay up. They come up to a normal length on your leg, not too tall nor too short. I tried the Gold Toe Fluffies but they bunched up, sagged and were too warm for Florida.
