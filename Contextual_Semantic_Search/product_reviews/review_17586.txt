I can sometimes squeeze into a 12 so I took my chances with these tights. They're very tight and the crotch doesn't quite reach my crotch because my thighs are too big, as I expected. Hoisting them up all day gets a little annoying. But I bought these for a cosplay, not regular use so it's fine that they're snug. They look cute and are perfect for my cosplay! I just wish I could find the same tights in plus size....
