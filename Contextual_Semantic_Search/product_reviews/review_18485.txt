I purchased these slippers as a gift for my husband. He wears a 10 1/2 so I ordered size 11. He has a narrow foot, I was concerned they may be too big but they actually fit perfectly. I had seen lots of reviews on issues w sizing but going up 1/2 size even w a narrow foot worked out fine. Nice, thick solid slipper, well-made. My only complaint is the sole leaves minor scuff marks on my hardwood flooring.
