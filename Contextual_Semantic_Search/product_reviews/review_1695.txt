Love this jacket. Looks and fits great. Only thing is that when working the sleeves seem to pull a little short. Not working they look and fit fine. maybe I need to get use to the elastic cuffs. Overall it's great. Thought of returning and getting a &#34;long&#34; size instead of regular because of the sleeves but the price was more and didn't want the rest of the jacket to look and fit too long.
