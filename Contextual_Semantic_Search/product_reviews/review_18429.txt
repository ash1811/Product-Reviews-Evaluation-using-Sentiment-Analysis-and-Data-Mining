Surprised how long these are for the 32 x 30's.  I'm sure the cut is part of the issue.  Just a tad baggy feeling.  Usually I wear a 32 x 32 but those were like clown pants.  I'd say the waist is true to size but the length is something you may want to consider sizing down a bit.  The quality of the fabric and the non-iron, out of the dryer performance is second to none.  Now that I know more about the sizing for these I certainly wouldn't hesitate ordering another pair in another color.  Overall these are a great work pant
