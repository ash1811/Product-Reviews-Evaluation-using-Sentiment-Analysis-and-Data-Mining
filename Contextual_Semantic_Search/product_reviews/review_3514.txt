I agree with most of the other reviewers here; these are wonderful.  A garter-belt or bustier is a must with these, because there is no "stay-up" band in these stocking-tops, and if you ask me, imho, it's much better that way.I just adore the darling lace applique of the stocking-tops, and the sheer stockings are very elegant and sexy.  The lace design is simple enough that it pairs well with many different garters, be they solid or lacy.I got these in "city beige" (a bit darker than nude) and black (although not TOO black, but rather a lovely shade that isn't really "smoky" but adds a wonderful black shimmer to your legs) and loved both colors.  I will definately be ordering more of these.Very sexy and elegant!  I strongly recommend these.
