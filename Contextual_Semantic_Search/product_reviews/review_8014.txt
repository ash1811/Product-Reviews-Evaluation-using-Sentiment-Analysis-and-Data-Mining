With a natural H size cup, comfort and support do NOT always go hand in hand. I say natural because I can't imagine that implants weigh as much as mine, if they did NO ONE would get them!This is one of the few bras that can keep big breasts contained.I just had this silly thought using the word 'contained', as if they were wild animals trying to escape, but honestly, if you are well endowed and looking for a sport bra, I bet you DO feel that way sometimes! Girlfriend, try this bra.It looks great under clothes, very smooth. Jiggle is down to minimum, as is backache. With this bra, even shoulder pain is down to a minimum. Based on reviews, I went up in the band size for comfort, but the smaller band size actually would have been better. As you probably know, most women overestimate band size, leading to ill-fitting bras. Even knowing that, I'm guilty.Lastly, this bra is a good value. In my opinion, if you have a full cup size, and try a bargain bra, it just ain't gonna work, sister! Considering that a supportive albeit prettier bra exists, such as a Prima Donna bra (which I LOVE), or Le Mystere, this is a fraction of the cost.Hope this review helps, I highly recommend this for well endowed women.
