it is a very comfortable boot (even more so with my walk-fits in them), its steel toe, there are 2 hooks to lace (not like 4 or 5) , and they fit great! I like the black and after a week or 2 I hope to have them broke in nicely.they feel a little clod-hopperish initially, but you compensate and then don't even really realize it after a while. hit them with some waterproof spray, which absorbed right in.  will strip and wax them after then newness fades.I wear a 9 wide (608 new balance), and a wide in my work boots (sketchers and elkwoods), and a pair of irish setters and these cats fit as true for me.
