Review by William's wife:Pros: This bra has excellent support for the busty among us. In fact, it feels more supportive than most sports bras.Gives a nice shape.Cons: the band runs small, the fabric is extremely itchy, and the cut is weird (I could absolutely not wear it with a scoop neck dress or shirt).
