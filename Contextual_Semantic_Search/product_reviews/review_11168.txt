I couldn't possibly love these shoes any more. I had a pair of Keen sandals that were similar but after several years of constant use (at least in the warmer months) one of the straps finally gave out so I got these. They are absolutely perfect. I love the color selection - I went for bright yellow and they're pretty true to the picture on my monitor. Very cute.More importantly, however, these things are incredibly sturdy, comfortable, and offer great support. I use them for hiking with my dog or just walking around town. They are comfortable enough and offer good enough support that I can wear them all day. The toe guard is surprisingly sturdy - nothing you bump into will hurt your toes in these shoes. The canvas straps and all of the construction in general seems extremely well done; nothing on these shoes feels cheap or flimsy. It's also extremely convenient that I can go running around in the rain or mud or whatever and just hose these shoes off. They can take anything.The only complaint I have, and it is minor, is that they are difficult to get on, especially in the beginning. If the place where you slip your foot in was just a smidge looser I would say these shoes are absolutely perfect. It does seem to be loosening a bit with wear, but I'm not sure yet if they'll ever "break in" to the point where they're easy to get on.I bought my regular size and find that they are perfect.On a side note, my husband has a slightly different version of these in a much less flashy color and he loves them as well.
