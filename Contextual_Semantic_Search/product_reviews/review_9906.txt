I just bought this shirt for my husband and he loves it.  He is 5'8&#34;, 195 pounds and in good shape for a guy in his 50's.  He usually wears a Large shirt, but likes T-shirts and tanks a little loose.  I ordered the XL.  The shirt fits perfectly, but it's not loose.  The XL is a perfect size Large.  But it looks great and my husband says it feels great on.  It seems well made.  I would definitely recommend this item.  And I will be buying more of them.
