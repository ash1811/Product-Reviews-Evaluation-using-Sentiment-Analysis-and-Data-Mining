Sizing runs a bit small, unlike the hi-cut version with thin waistband that I just love. The lavender like violet color is very nice. Wish it was availiable in the hi-cut, slightly sheerer version. The leg elastic was a bit tight at first, but loosened up after a couple of wear/wash cycles. I like nylon briefs the best, as long as they have a cotton crotch. Will order more in the next size up when these wear out.
