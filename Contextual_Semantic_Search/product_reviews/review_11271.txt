JanSport Big Student Classics Series Daypack (Black) JanSport is a household brand. I've always had a back pack from JanSport when going to school and work & Out door activitys. My option for this purchase of the Big Student Classic Series is to have more capacity during shopping. I bike around and my old back pack needs to be upgraded. I wil have a follow up review later: 9/1/2012 recieved delivery in 2-days, Carrier ON TRAC Faster than USPS. This pack exceeds my old packs capacity. Lots of compartments (5) in all & all zippored. and of cource a bottle carrier. With all these designed compartments. I can organize my stuff neatly. I can include a basic First aid kit and store my Bike night lights & reflectors. With this pack I can pack more when I go grocery shopping. California has the ZERO Grocery Bag policy so this back pack can carry a lot. Especially if I have to bike to safeway twice a week. And regular shopping @ Target, Great Mall, Going to the bank. Exception BayPack from JanSport. Well designed to fit the needs of myself and everyone who needs extra capacity. The Shoulder straps are shaped in a "S" design to conture ones over the shoulder shape. Well designed better than the old style padded ones. For the price its well worth it. I chose the basic Black. Good job Amazon. I have order 10 times from Amazon On Line and was not disapointed in any of my recient purchase's. I have other items in the cart. awaiting to be "One Click" check out. $500.00 and still going.
