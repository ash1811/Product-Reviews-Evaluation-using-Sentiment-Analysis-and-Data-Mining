Long years ago, when I was a studient at Paris-Sorbonne University, I bought Ray-Ban Sunglass in the year 1980 or 1981. The lens of my choice was "changeable", and at that time one carved on the lens "BL". It seems to me that BL is the initial of Bausch & Lomb (FRANCE). 30 years or more have passed, but the gilding did not yet change. At this time I have chosen the lens of G-15XLT. G means Green color, 15 means that 15% of light can pass through the lens, XLT means Extra Light Weight. This is my second purchase of Ray-Ban Sunglass. This is very useful for humans.
