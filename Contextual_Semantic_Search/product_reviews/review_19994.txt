I ordered this thinking it looked cute and it would help keep my face out of the sun. The plastic band-piece (that wraps around the forehead) is quite painful. The hat sits uncomfortably on the head and it's an odd shape. I like that it has a large bill...other than that I don't like this hat. I'll force myself to wear it while gardening...if I can tolerate wearing it that long. Most likely I'll get a headache after about 15 mins.
