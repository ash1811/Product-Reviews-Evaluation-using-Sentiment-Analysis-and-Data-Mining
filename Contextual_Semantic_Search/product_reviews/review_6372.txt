Bought two of these for my husband with sizing help from reviewers.  After washing, they still fit great!  No noticeable shrinkage.  These are light weight, so he can wear around the house with lounge pants to relax or layer with a t- shirt underneath to do some weekend chores. Light gray doesn't seem to show stains so much ( perspiration, glue, cooking grease spatters).  Very happy with this purchase.
