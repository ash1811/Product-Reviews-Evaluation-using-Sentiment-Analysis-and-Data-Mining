These socks say they fit mens shoe sizes 6-12.5.  I wear an 8.5 mens, and they were way too large on me--the heel of the sock was sticking out of my shoe!  These really should fit something more like a mens 9.5-12.5.  I mean, how can a sock, other than a tube sock, properly fit both a size 6 and a size 12.5?
