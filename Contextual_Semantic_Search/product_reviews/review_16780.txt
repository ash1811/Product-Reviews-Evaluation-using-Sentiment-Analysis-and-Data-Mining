I bought one of these shirts in a size larger than I normally wear thinking it would be loose and cool for working in the summer heat.  It's a really good quality shirt but it's pretty huge on me.  I don't mind since it will be a beater shirt and the huge size probably will help with cooing airflow in the heat and humidity.  I'm ordering another in my regular size because I like it so much and I like a loose fit anyway.If you order it, be aware of the sizing.
