These work very well. Love the color and the feel. Stick on very smooth and can't see under clothing unless it's a light colored thin shirt. Best I've found for the price. Very easy on the skin and easy to take off, no pain at all, and stay on all day long. Middles sometimes tend to puff out if sitting or laying a certain way but go back when standing up. Great for the price and no pain when removing!
