My wife bought one exactly like it about 5 yrs ago. The light was getting very weak so I attempted to put a fresh batt in. After many attempts to get the back on,( when I could get it closed with a plastic clamp, 1/2 the gasket would squeeze out), we threw it away and managed to find the exact replacement. My wife likes this watch beceause it has a expansion band that fits her and the idiglo for if she gets up in the middle of the night and at work. She wears it 24/7. Showers, wash dishes and everything with it on. She works in nursing so she washes her hands many times a day. It never even once fogged up in 5 years.I guess for $30-$40 it is not bad to throw away and replace every 5 years as long as we can get exact replacement. Mabey next time I will take it to jewlery store for batt. replacement.I did keep the spring bars out of the old one. They are nice to have on hand.I gave it 4 stars due to batt. issue. Otherwise it would get 6 ot 7 stars.
