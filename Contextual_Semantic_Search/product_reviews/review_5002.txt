I bought these to travel. It's what they're marketed for. You can theoretically take two pairs and easily travel the world with it. Wear one, wash one. They dry really quickly once you've wrung out the excess water and surprisingly don't retain much odor. I've taken many pairs over the years to about 40 countries now and now I just wear these as my default underwear even when I'm not traveling. They're just that much more comfortable.
