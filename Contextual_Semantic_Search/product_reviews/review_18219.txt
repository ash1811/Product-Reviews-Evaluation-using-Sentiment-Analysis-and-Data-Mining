I normally wear 10D in most shoes; I ordered these in a men's 10.They were far too narrow. I wound up giving them to an 11 year old girl and though they were a bit long they fit her ok.They were also remarkably heavy, which I suppose could be seen as a sign of quality but which I personally found annoying; why would I want heavy slippers?If you can find a size that fits you and don't mind the weight you might like these as they seemed to be made well.
