Overall, I really like this shoe. It's comfortable, and has a skid-free sole. The heel is just a tad wide for me, however, and I get a little bit of heel slippage when I walk. Also, I wish they were  just a little bit lighter-weight. I'm a nursing student, and this shoe satisfies my needs providing for plenty of comfort for a reasonable price.
