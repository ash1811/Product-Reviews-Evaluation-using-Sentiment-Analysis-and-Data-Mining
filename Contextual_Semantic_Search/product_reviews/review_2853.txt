My daughter learned how to tell time very quickly and easily with this watch.  She likes the slip on strap - the material is comfy to wear and the adjustable strap makes it easy to size her wrist (she's 9 but has a tiny wrist).  The butterfly that moves around as it counts seconds is a big hit!  I was concerned the butterfly would make it difficult to read the watch but that isn't the case at all.
