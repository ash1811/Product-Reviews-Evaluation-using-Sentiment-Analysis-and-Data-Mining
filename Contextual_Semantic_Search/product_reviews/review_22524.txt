I think the watch looks better in person then on the internet. It's large and easy to read. The only thing that takes one star off is the band. Yes, I knew it was ugly when I ordered it, but that's not the problem. I have an average size wrist, and I wear the watch on the second to last hole, using the very last hole when I work out. Besides the band being too short, it's a great watch, and well worth the price.
