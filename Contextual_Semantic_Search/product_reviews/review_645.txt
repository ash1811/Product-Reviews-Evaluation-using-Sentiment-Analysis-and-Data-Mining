These are great. They go on how they should and they stay the whole day. I'm pretty sure they'd stay a whole week if I wanted them to. They're very cute too! One note -- if the fabric you're wearing is white or somewhat sheer, you might want to buy tan petals instead, as the pink is very light and will show through as a white bra would.
