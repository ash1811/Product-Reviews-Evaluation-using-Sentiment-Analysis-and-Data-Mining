Worked for a while.  Then it broke.  Or maybe I lost it.  But for 10 bucks who cares.  This is the kind of watch you get before a trip where you don't want to risk losing, breaking or having stolen your real watch.  Might also work as a kid's first watch but it might not hold up to kid-level abuse.  It's cheap (in cost) because it's a cheap watch.  So there you go.
