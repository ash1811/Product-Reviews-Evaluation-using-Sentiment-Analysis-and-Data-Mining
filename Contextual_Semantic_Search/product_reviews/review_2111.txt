For fashion or for dance, working out, etc., these leggings are hard to beat. Great fit, true to size, comfortable, too. They're made well and the Supplex fabric is firm enough for a great fit but not overly constricting. They wash well  and are worth the additional money compared to the flimsy, lower priced leggings in bargain stores.
