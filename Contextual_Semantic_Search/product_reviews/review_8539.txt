I have been buying these for years and they were one of my favorites!  The sizing is not right anymore and the top doesn't go as high anymore not even covering my bellybutton, and is doing that awful roll down that I hate! I don't know if they changed manufacturers or used different patterns to try to save money because the sizing is completely different than before.  The fabric doesn't have the same stretch as the one I got last year. I am the same size as I was with the past purchases that fit me fine.
