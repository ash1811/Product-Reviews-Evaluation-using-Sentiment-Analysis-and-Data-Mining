I got this bag as a sports tote for my 8 year oldInside we are able to fit-water bottle-soccer ball-2 pairs of shin guards-extra child sized adidas track pants-child sized mesh soccer short-childs sized sports jersey-childs sized under armour shirt-soccer cleatsand we have plenty of room to add more items, remember these are childs sized items I haven't used it for an adult yet but I am going to use it as a gym bag once sports are over with for the yearPros-well made-roomy for a small tote-looks exactly as picturedThe only issue I have with the bag is that it doesn't have multiple pockets its one open area inside but for the price who cares its a nice bag and I am glad I purchased it.
