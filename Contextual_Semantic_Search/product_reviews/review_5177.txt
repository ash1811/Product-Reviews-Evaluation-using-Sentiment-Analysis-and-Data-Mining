I really enjoy this watch. The gray is an unusual color, but it isn't as dark as it appears in the photographs. The watch case is slimmer than most watches I have owned and slides easily under my shirt cuffs. I did change out the band for a dressier dark brown. The one that comes with the watch has a dark brown leather trim surrounding a black mesh like material. I don't often wear watches specifically for out doors activities so I didn't really like the band.
