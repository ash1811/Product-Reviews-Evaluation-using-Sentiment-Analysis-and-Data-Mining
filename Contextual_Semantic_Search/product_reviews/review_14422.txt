This is the watch that I have been using for over 15 years.  When one's battery stops working, I just replace it with another watch.  And the price of this watch has gradually gone down over the years.  It has more than enough functions for me.  It is my day to day watch and I also use it for all of my exercise walks for time, splits, etc.  A very reliable and dependable watch at a very reasonable price.
