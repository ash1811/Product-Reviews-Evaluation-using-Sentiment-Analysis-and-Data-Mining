I like these bodysuits, but for me they weren't worthy of five starts. The did shrink a bit more than I thought they would, and the neck/shoulder area is a little loose for me. It doesn't tend to stay flat. Otherwise, they are perfectly serviceable and the fabric is soft. I don't regret buying them but will probably stick with Carter's brand in the future.
