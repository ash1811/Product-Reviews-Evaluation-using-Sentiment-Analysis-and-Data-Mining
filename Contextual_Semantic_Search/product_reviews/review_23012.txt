I've been wearing this particular brand of Rockport for over ten years.They're classy, shiny, comfy and are generally the best pair of shoes for work that I've ever owned.Now.......that said, they have had "issues" over the years.Way back when the soles were simply horrid.The entire sole on one shoe literally split right in half.For a $100.00 dress shoe that is simply unacceptable.Now, flash forward ten years and the sole issue has been resolved but my most recent pair the right inside heel wore out VERY quickly which resulted in a very sore right heel.Other than that?There aren't many shoes that can stand up to a midwest winter but these do.Between the rain, sleet, snow, salt on the roads no shoes hold up better than these.I give them my recommendation.
