I got these for my husband who is up on his feet for 12-16 hrs a day (surgeon)... I know they are technically labeled &#34;hiking&#34; socks, but the extra support & cushion they offer seem to really make a difference for him. Neither of us ever thought much about his socks - just made sure he had good shoes to wear. I noticed he tried to &#34;recycle&#34; these by wearing them repeatedly between washes, so I just ordered a few more pairs :)
