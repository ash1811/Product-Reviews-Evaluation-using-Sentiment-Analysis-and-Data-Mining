The two biggest problems I have with this watch are the lack of a second hand, you do get a second readout in the digital display but I find this almost useless. Also if you shine a flashlight on the each face it is readable in dark but after a short time it is no longer readable which is very bad for me so I very rarely ware this watch at night.
