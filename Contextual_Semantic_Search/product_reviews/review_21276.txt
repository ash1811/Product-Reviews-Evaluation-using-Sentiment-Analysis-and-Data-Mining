I have many pair of the Sanuk yoga mat flip flops.  I bought my  first pair on sale at the Outer Banks, NC on vacation.  I had never heard of Sanuk before that.  I was very excited when I found them on Amazon.  I now have them in blue, pink, lime, orange... The are extremely comfy.  I have worn them all day at Magic Kingdom, Orlando.  That's a lot of walking!
