These shoes are a great choice for every day wear - very comfortable. They are great for airport travel - easy on and easy off for security check.  However, they are NOT designed for serious walking.  Do not depend on these to see you through lots and lots of fast walking.  They are perfect for just kicking around in.  Highly recommend.
