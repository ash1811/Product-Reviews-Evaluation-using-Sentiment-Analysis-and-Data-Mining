I love wigwam socks, they are super comfortable, wick away moisture, stay very dry, very warm, all day long. I have dumped every sock in my drawers and replaced them with wigwam. This is my only pair that has silk in them and they are extra comfy but wick away moisture a little less than the straight wool ones (most are 60/40 and 80/20)
