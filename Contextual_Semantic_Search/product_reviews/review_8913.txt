My poor mother had a robe for 40 years that she hated.  I didn't know that.  The reason she kept it so long was because I had bought it for her as a kid.  Well - when I found out about that not long ago, I immediately went online and found this robe to replace it with.  She cried when she saw it.  It was exactly what she had wanted for so long.  The robe is so soft, the color so rich, and the smocking so beautifully done.  It's perfect and mom is happy.
