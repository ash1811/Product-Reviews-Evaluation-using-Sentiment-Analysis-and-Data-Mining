I bought this robe together with the long gown.  As you can see in the picture the robe does not close in the front, but is only buttoned at the top and is a split opening all the way down.  If you buy the matching color gown, it does give the illusion of being closed.  The material is a little thin so I am not sure how see thru it may get in strong light.  It is winter here so it is fairly dark when I get up so it is hard to tell.  The robe is very comfortable to wear, with generous room in the the sleeves.
