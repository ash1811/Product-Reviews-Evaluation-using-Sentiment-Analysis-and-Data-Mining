They SHOULD be tight, and after one day of wear these stretched to my footbeautifully. I ordered my true size. I may try ordering half size down because my current pair may stretch too much. The straps are already attached so I just slipped them on and hit the floor. Solid shoe, no surprises, does what it is expected to do. I like split soles so this works for me. I'm glad there's a slipper that is reliable so that whenever I break or lose a pair I can order on Amazon without worries and get a new pair by the next dance event. I use these for partner dances, so not sure how they work for other dancers
