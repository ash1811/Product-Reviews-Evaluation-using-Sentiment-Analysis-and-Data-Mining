I read zillions of reviews online before getting this bag. The amazon price is the lowest of all vendors. I have been it using this for about 2 months now.Pros:Saves my backRolls smoothlyCons:all kinds of hair and gunk get stuck in the wheels from rolling it on streets.The bag is not spacious. The placement of the bar that is connected to the pull-along handle is in the center of the bag. It feels hard and also reduces the stuff that can be in the bag. I feel that my regular backpacks of comparable size hold more stuff.The computer pouch/sleeve is very tight and a 13 inch laptop sticks out on top.
