These versatile shoes help feet cope with urban cityscapes and trails pounded dry and hard as asphalt. They look great at work and play, and provide more arch support than other Keen models. You may need to insert a better insole, but that is de rigeur these days. As usual, Backcountry did a super job with fast and accurate order fulfillment.
