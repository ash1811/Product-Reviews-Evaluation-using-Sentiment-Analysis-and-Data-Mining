I've never worn boots much, but entered the market when I started riding motorcycles last year.  That being the case, I can't compare these to others...however, I love them and will probably eventually get another pair in black.After several months of riding and limited walking in them, they look and feel like they're going to last a long time.  If anything, they might be slightly roomy inside, and people with slim feet/socks may benefit from an added insole.
