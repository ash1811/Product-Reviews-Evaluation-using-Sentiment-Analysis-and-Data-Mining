I put on this bra and could not quit giggling.  My breasts took on a life of their own.  I think someone else mentioned the cone shape - they weren't kidding.  They were surprisingly perky for a wire free bra.  However I knew this bra didn't quite hit the mark when my husband walked in and asked what had happened to my chest.  I liked the full coverage and the take off lift experience.  However I found the band around the ribcage to be a bit scratchy and not super comfortable.  Not my cup of tea.
