We were always faced with dirt and grime carried in on the soles of peoples shoes on our hardwood floors. To stop this, we bought these shoe covers and our guests love them as much as we do. They don't have to take off their shoes when walking on our floors anymore and the anti-skid is a plus with hardwood floors.
