The ring is pretty, but believe those who say it is big. It looked even bigger because I received a larger one than I ordered. Instead of exchanging it I just gave it someone else whose finger it fits. And when it does, it looks really nice. The silver is very shiny and together with the stones they catch light and make your hand look very sparkly when you move it.
