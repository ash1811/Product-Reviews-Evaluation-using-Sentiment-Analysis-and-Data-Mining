My son is 17 months old but very tall (35 inches) and large (30 lbs) for his age.  I was worried that this would be too tight but it fit him perfectly!  The material is very thin.  If he had to have worn it more than the one evening on Halloween, I doubt it would have lasted long but being able to put this over his regular clothes and having the option to take the cape on or off was wonderful.  I would definitely recommend this as a Halloween or a few time wear costume.  If this is for consistent play, I don't think it will hold up well.  Overall, I'm incredibly pleased with this product.  I'll be checking out their other costumes next year for Halloween!
