I've been wearing Reef flip flops for over 15 years now.  Each pair manages to last 2-3 years before they become the grimy, muddy, yuck outside the door shoe (only because the sole is worn down).  You know, slip on to go out and drag the trashcans back in.  I can wear these comfortably and walk ALL DAY vacation, beach, shopping, around the house they are my summer GO TO SHOE.  Hail to the REEF!
