The earrings I received did not resemble the ones from the picture on this web site.  The very bottom bead in the picture is a very pretty pink-ish color and that's what I was looking forward to when I ordered these.  Well, the earrings I recieved had more green on the bottom bead than pink.  I didn't like the fact that there was more green than pink and I didn't think it was worth returning them so I literally got out a bottle of pink nail polish and just painted them the shade that I wanted.  Wasn't what I expected but you get what you pay for.
