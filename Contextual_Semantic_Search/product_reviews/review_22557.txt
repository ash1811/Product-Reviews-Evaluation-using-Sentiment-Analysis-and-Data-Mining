I like this watch, I especially like it for 90 dollars.First, for those who like to just feel as though they god a deal--Citizen lists this watch on their website as $215, not the 150 that Amazon puts as the list price.At 36mm its nice for a smaller wrist (though I did chose to order a short band for it) and still looks like a man's watch.The style is a little bit Bauhaus and a little bit Skaggen-brand though I expect the watch exceeds Skaggen-brand quality.I like the 12/4/8 numbers so that the day date window does not interfere with the numbering symmetry--clever and the numbers are nice and thin so with a glancing look the just seem like hashmarks.For what it is it is terrific--a nice watch for a non-labor work environment.  If you want a rugged piece of industrial equipment--definitely not the watch for you.  Looks professional without being arrogant.  It is simple with no unneeded markings or complications.  Eco-Drive is a nice feature.  At a 90 dollars, you don't really have to lose sleep that someone will mug you for it or if you accidentally bash the ying-yang out of it you haven't exactly ruined your future.
