I recently purchased a pair of Levi's 505 Straight Fit jeans in "Silver Fox." I like gray jeans, unfortunately the ones you find in stores almost always have ridiculous looking fake distress marks or weird "printed" crease lines on either side of the crotch area. The Silver Fox 505s arrived with some stupid looking faked wrinkles on the legs either side of the crotch, but thankfully no darker printing just raised bumps in the fabric. It didn't feel like it was permanently part of the fabric, so I decided to take my chances and keep them. Luckily, after washing, the fake wrinkles came out so these areas are smooth like the rest of the pants. Why do these clothing companies mess with this stuff? The color is a light/medium gray, but there are some variations in the color running up and down. It seems to be the way it's made, not some kind of a finish added to the fabric. The size (38/32) is true and the pants are very comfortable. The price was right, and Amazon's service was good. I knocked off a star because of the stupid fake wrinkles. I want to buy new pants, not ones made to look beat up!
