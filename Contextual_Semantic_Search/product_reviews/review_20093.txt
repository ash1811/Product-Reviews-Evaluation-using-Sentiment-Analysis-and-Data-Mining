so I couldn't decide after all the reviews what to do.  I picked up my size (9) the first time (yes returned) and they were too big, I mean TOO big.  AND A NINE ISNT BIG! my work boots are a 9, my new balance sneakers are a 9 wide but you have to lace them, and that's a big point. you obviously are not lacing these boots, they are big.  size down and get it right the first time.  they pay for return shipping so its not like it costs to be wrong.  I also wear walk fits, they snugged the boot even nicer with thick socks.  for less than $25, well built rubber, nice tread, and steel toe?  no brainer.
