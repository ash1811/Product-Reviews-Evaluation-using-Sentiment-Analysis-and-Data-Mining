I like these. Nothing will ever be as good as the Barely There cotton/spandex briefs I used to buy, but they have been discontinued.Plusses: Full-cut briefs, substantial fabric. Bali quality.Minuses: Elastic around the legs and waistband. I greatly prefer self-fabric legs and waistbands. Elastic digs in and makes briefs look like grandma panties. Which  I guess they are, but to they have to look like it? Also, for me, these were a little too fully cut. If I ordered them again I would go down a size.Don't get me wrong, these are a big improvement on the generic six-to-a-package briefs you get in big box stores. They just aren't my all-time favorites.
