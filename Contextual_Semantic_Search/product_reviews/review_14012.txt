First off, they have 7 belt loops. Levi now only has 5. This makes a very large difference. Be wary buying online, on one link it shows an image with 7 loops, the link while it is in the cart shows 5 loops; all 3 of mine came with 7 loops so maybe I was lucky.Second, all sizes are all made in Mexico. Levis are made in many different countries depending on exactly which size you get i.e. 34x30 made in nicaragua 34x29 lesotho with completely different fittings.Third, Lee costs significantly less than Levi.I used to be a Levi guy but no more. Lee does not have significantly less quality denim, however, I have not truly tested this claim; only time will tell. At least Lee is consistent. Even if Lee is worse, I can buy two pairs for the price of one Levi. If in a year my body stays the same, I can trust that if I order the same pair of jeans, they will fit and be made in mexico.
