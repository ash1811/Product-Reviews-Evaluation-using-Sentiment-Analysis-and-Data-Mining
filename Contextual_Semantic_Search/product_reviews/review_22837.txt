This style of Teva has been a favorite of mine for about 6 years now, my last pair were starting to wear thin, so it was time to get some new ones, (they tend to last me about 12-18 months with regular warm-weather wear.)  I usually get black but this time I went with the Blue/Pink design.  I sort of wish I had stuck with black, but they are cute.Honestly, I just don't know how you can go wrong with Teva's strappy flip flops.  They are great for a skirt, jeans, dress, shorts, just about any Spring or Summer outfit.  They are cushy and leave interesting tan marks...  In my experience they don't tend to start stinking like some sandals, but they also have held up a to a few soapy scrubs when they got something slimy on them.  They are also super lightweight and easy to walk in.  I know this won't be my last pair.
