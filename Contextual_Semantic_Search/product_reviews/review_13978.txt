These are regular fit jeans, but they fit smaller than skinny jeans. I wear 30x34 in Lee's vintage SLIM dungarees, so I assumed the 30" waist for REGULAR fit would be just fine. Nope. Couldn't even get the 30" up over my thighs. I had also ordered a 31" waist pair as well, since other reviewers had noted the small sizing. No luck there either, couldn't button them. I have since ordered a 32" waist and will give it a shot.The material and quality are fine, the denim is heavier weight than Levis are these days, the colors are nice (I ordered tarmac and battleship), and the length seems true. So no complaints there. Just make sure you order the waist a couple sizes up...
