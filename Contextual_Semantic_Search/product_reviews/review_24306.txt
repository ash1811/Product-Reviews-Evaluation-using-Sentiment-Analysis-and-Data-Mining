Love this watch. Could not find it this year and really wanted it for my other granddaughter. The features are great for a kid! My granddaughter sets timer and or alarm for when she is to be back home and the indiglo light is a plus. A very good quality watch for kids. Water resistant as well. Highly recommend. Cost is reasonable.
