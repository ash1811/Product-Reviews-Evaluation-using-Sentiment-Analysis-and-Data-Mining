I finally found it!  What has to be the cheapest, flimsiest watch band ever known to western man!  That being said, you'll note I still gave this watch 3 stars.  It is what it is, as the cliche' goes.  For an $8.95 watch, this fits the bill as a work in the yard/garage knock around watch.  It is water resistant (which means oil resistant) and in spite of the smaller than expected face, it is readable and has a pleasant "wheat" color to it dial.Right out of the box, I saw the good and bad in this inexpensive timepiece and immediately ordered a cheap "Swiss Type" nylon and pleather 16mm band (from Amazon, of course).  So, for $20 I have a custom watch which I think will take a reasonable beating  thus saving wear and tear on my better watches.  It has a plastic crystal, is super lightweight and likely will not become a family heirloom.  But, it fills a need and looks decent with the addition of the better watchband.If, like me, you are a person who feels lost without a watch and need an inexpensive beater, this will fit the bill. But, I cannot emphasize enough how cheesy and cheap the band is. It takes a 16mm and if you order this watch, consider picking out a $10 band to go with it.  You will the have $20-ish  invested, so when shopping for comparable watches keep that price point in mind.  Or, if a super thin and lightweight plastic band is what you want, $8.95 on Amazon will get you into this watch, ready to wear.I hope this review is of help to you.
