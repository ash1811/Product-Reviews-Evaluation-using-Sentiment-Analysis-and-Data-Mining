i bought these high quality slippers having soles useful outdoors to get the mail and paper when it's 5 degrees outside. they fit as expected from my experience in winter mountaineering, which is a yearly treat here in golden, colorado. i ordered a full size larger to accomodate my 2 pairs of winter socks. myself, i have the insulated slippers come up my ankles to full height. these slippers last years and years.
