This vest is a little more bulky than my old Columbia vest (that are not being made anymore).  I usually wear a medium and these fit as my other mediums do.  The length is fine and I am only 5' tall. I had to cut the tags off of the collar though because they were making the back of my neck itchy.  They need to make them tag free.
