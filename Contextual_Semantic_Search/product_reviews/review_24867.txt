Well made, but there's a large jump from 12D to 12-3E though. I'm somewhere in the middle for width, so I chose the 12D's.  They are a tiny bit too skinny.  Hopefully they will wear a bit, but still, a width size in the middle wouldn't kill you would it?------------EDIT 3/27/13:  Add to the total cost $$ of these boots:1. A set of knockoff Dr. Scholls foot pads "Spenco Polysorb Cross Trainer" $142. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY at least one set of "Foot Petals - Heavenly Heals" $14The Heavenly heels are for the BACK of the heel. If you don't add these and you're socks aren't made of thick rubber, these boots HURT. They have 0% padding. NO padding whatsoever. Try walking in these or god forbid working in these things for longer than 30 minutes. The back of my heels are killing me right now. Just tap on the heel part of these boots from the inside and you'll hear an echo. If these boots came with Dr. Scholls and at least some padding for the back of the heel, I would give this product 5 stars. As it is, I have 2 months of training starting in 4 days and I really needed these boots. Now I'll have to *2 day ship* some heel padding to me at even more extra cost. Hopefully these Heavenly heels work!!
