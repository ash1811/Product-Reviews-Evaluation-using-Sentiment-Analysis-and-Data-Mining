I bought this bag for work, I'm an ER nurse and needed a sturdy, spacious, good looking bag. This isn't it. I use it as a beach bag instead, I don't like it or care for it. The price is decent but this is just not a stylish bag. I only kept it because for the price it was too much of a hassle to send it back.
