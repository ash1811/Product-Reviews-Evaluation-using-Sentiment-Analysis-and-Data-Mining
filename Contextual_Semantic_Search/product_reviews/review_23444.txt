I had a number of day bags but none that seemed to do it all.  I was tired of forgetting things I needed in another purse when I switched for other outings.  I wanted something that would work to shop, travel, walk to grocery store, go on walk with dogs, run errands, quick trip to gym,  etc.  I am a short gal at 5'4&#34; and it fits comfortably. I saw this at Bed Ba and Beyond but even with my 20% off, it was still way more than I wanted to spend and was glad to find an Amazon vendor that had it for half the price!What I like:1. Comfy strap! Lots of cushion to avoid shoulder fatigue.2. Velcro pocket on side big enough for iphone5 or smartphone in otterbox.3. Water bottle pocket, now given it only fits 20 oz and smaller, I don't need a gallon of water in my purse4. Secret pocket in strap5. Lots of pocked and space6. Organizational pocket with slot for pen and cardsI was able to purge 4 bags because this 1 is so awesome!!!!
