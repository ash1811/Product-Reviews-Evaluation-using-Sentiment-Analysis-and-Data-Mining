Normally I buy Wrangler denim jeans, but my company requires black pants on the job. I have had black wranglers in the past & for some reason they fit snugger in the waist than the denim ones. I ordered the next size up & they fit perfect. Price was good also, along with top quality. Add Amazon's 2 day shipping & I'm a happy camper.
