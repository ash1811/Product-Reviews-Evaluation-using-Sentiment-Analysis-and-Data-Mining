These are my favorite pair of socks.  They feel amazing, keep my feet warm and are very comfortable.  When I'm heading out on a hike, these are the socks that I usually grab.They are expensive but well worth the price.  During the winter (I live in the mountains of NC) every Friday my friends and I would get together and go for a snow hike.  I don't remember one time where I was cold and these socks play a big role in that.  My friends were complaining all the time with their feet.You can't beat Merino Wool/Silk!
