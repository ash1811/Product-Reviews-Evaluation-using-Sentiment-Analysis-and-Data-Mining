Nice fit and good looking pant to wear daily or on the golf course.  Wouldn't ordinarily wear jeans to play at a country club but on closer look you can see they are a cut above the more casual blue jeans.  Am losing weight and may have to order the next down size and would suggest if you are around a true 36 you could probably get by with a 34.
