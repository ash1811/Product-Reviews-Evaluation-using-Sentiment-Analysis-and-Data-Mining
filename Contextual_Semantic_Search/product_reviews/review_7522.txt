Bought these for a Halloween costume. I followed the advice of other reviewers and ordered up. I usually wear either an eight or an eight and a half. They are a little tight on my calves, but I haven't adjusted any of the straps or lacings yet, which would fix that easily I believe. They appear well made with no noticeable defects.
