This shoe is fabulous. Nice soft lambskin leather. This pointy toe is the most comfortable. there is no discomfort when walking at all and i am 300lbs and the heel sustains me quite well. i wear size 11 with regular shoes and sandals but a 12 in closed to shoes. this is very sleek and professional an yet comfy and stylish enough to wear to church or to hang out.
