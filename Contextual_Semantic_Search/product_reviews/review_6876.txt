I like the way the top part stays put (no bunching down as I wear them) and smooth fit with no seams bothering my feet. Out of the package they didn't feel very cozy, but now that I've worn them I see that they are. An excellent product.Update: It's now many months later and I'm still a fan of these socks. I never wear out clothing, but I have a long history of wearing out socks --however, these socks show no sign of wear. Something else I like about them is the way they come out of the washing machine: still white and bright. I go around in my stocking feet whenever I'm in the house, and don't hesitate to wear the socks outside when I need to pick up the mail or water a plant. Other socks I've owned never looked clean after being washed because of all that I put them through -- but these socks launder beautifully every time. All these months later, they still look new.
