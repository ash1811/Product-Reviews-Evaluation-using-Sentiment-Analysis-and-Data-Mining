I bought these for my daughter who is 5 and just started wearing a size 10 street shoe (she still fits in a size 9 but they are close to being too small). I did a lot of research on sizing, even looked up the Capezio sizing chart since I know ballet shoes can run small. The Amazon sizing is way off but even the Capezio size chart says these should fit true to street shoe size. I ordered a half size bigger just to be safe and her foot barely squeezed into them, toes were crammed to the end. I returned them and ordered a Bloch pair (those I know run 1.5 size too small so I knew what I was getting). Quality of this shoe was good and seems like a nice ballet slipper but beware they DO run small so order up at least one full size if not 1.5 size up.
