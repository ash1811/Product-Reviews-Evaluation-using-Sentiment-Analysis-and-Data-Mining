Purchased these socks a couple of years ago, and now purchased them again. My husband still finds the first bunch more then serviceable so we are saving the new ones for the time being. I caught an excellent sale on Amazon.Even without the sale price the socks are well worth it. My husband wears them daily and loves them. Made very well, and hold up beautifully to all the washing and wearing. I recommend these socks to someone that is looking for a well made sock with a little cushioning on the bottom.
