Keeps my boobs nice and perky, and it fits comfortably.  The only real problems I have are that they do produce a somewhat missile-tit effect, so you'll have to adjust yourself.  I always wear a tank top with a shelf bra over my bra anyway, so that helps.  I wish the material was thicker, and that bra companies would stop assuming anyone over a C-cup doesn't want any lining - I don't need people to know just how cold I'm feeling!  But otherwise, quite nice.  I wear a 42DDD, which is hard to find in wirefree without spending a fortune.  And the color is gorgeous!
