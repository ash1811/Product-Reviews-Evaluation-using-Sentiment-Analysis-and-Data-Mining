However I did sent these back because they were too big.  I bought 48 and 46.  I never opened these because I tried the 46's first and they fit perfect.  I rate five stars because returning them was a piece of pie.  Or is that a slice cake?  Whatever, I never had to leave home to send them back for credit and if there's one thing I hate doing is going to a department store and standing around waiting to return clothes.  Everything was included, all I had to do was mark the reason, ie: too big, seal them up in the box and put the pre-addressed lable on the box and UPS was there the next day to pick it up.  That is the way to do business.  Well done.
