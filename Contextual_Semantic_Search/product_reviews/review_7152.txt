I have a size 14 foot, so I assumed these would be fine for me, to wear with my size 14 New Balance walking shoes.  My mistake!! -- as soon as I washed them and ran them through the dryer, they shrunk down, probably to a size 12 or 11.  i can get them on my feet (barely), but they aren't comfortable.  I probably should have returned them, but just couldn't be bothered.  They are not recommended.
