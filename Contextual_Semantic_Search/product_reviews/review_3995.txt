Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean. He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either. Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he's a happy camper.Recommend.
