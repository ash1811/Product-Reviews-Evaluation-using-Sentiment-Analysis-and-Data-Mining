I am partial to Black Tanks. I think they do not give you the "wife beater" look as much. These are really nice, the only gripe I have is that they are on the BIG side. Its not a bad thing in most cases, just something that should be taken into account. I will definitely order the CK again but next time in probably a medium and hopefully that will be a perfect fit.
