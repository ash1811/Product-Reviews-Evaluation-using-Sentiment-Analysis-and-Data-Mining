Ok, this bra just arrived. The instant I saw it, I had to try it on. It's just what I needed for that go-to bra to put on when I'm not yet sure what I'm going to wear over it. It has a low cut front so no probs with V-necks. IT's so basic, elegant, simple & comfortable ! I literally am forgetting I have it on.This is not a minimizer and the 34DD has the wider , padded front strap part as noted in the description but even it has an elegant , finished, low sheen & polish that makes a peek of it with sleeveless clothes ok. The cups are softly molded yet form fitting . Finally a "molded" cup for today's "privacy" issue etiquitte without feeling as if I'm in a suit of armour or a Viking/Wagner opera costume. The back is comfortable yet flattering without that aforementioned pesky "armor look" that some of the wider backs give through your clothes,too. Yep, this is the GIRLS new  "hang-out" for autumn & those 25 hr. days.
