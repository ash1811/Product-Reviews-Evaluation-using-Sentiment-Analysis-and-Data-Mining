This bra is a soft cup with no underwire but with the support it gives you don't need it.  I can't say enough good things about, but I went back and bought a second one of the same bra in a mauve.  I wear a D and it's been awhile since I have been able to find a comfortable all day bra with the support I need too.  Great buy!
