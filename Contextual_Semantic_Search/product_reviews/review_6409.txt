This is nice quality. My only problem with this is it does shrink some in the dryer. It wasn't a terrible amount. However, I should have bought the next size larger. This was just a nice fit before washing and drying. Actually wouldnt have hurt this sweatshirt to have been slightly larger to begin with.  After it shrunk I gave it away. I am buying more of these! The material is very nice. I am ordering a larger size.
