I'm a fan! I was looking for a pair of red cowboy boots and these are perfect!Probably wouldn't have bought them if the red weren't majorly discounted though. Red color is really nice, but it is most definitely a true red. Quality is good and they are very comfortable. A little large, I'd say size down if you're between sizes. Even then I can still wear them with super heavy socks. They seem to be a good fit for narrow feet.
