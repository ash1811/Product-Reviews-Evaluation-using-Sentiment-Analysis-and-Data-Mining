I did not know these would become my favorites shoes!  I normally don't wear clogs. I bought them only I was about to undergo back surgery and I knew putting shoes would have to be easy because I would so limited in my ability to bend.  These shoes certainly are easy to put on and off, and in addition they are sooooo comfortable.  I imagined that clogs would slip off easily while I walk, but this is not so. They are comfortable and secure on your foot, and easy to take off when you need to remove them.I am looking to buy a second pair.Updated 9/10/11I now own two pairs of Easy Spirit Women's Travel Time Mules.  Both are extremely comfortable.I am posting a photo of the black/grey mule.  The stock photo shows the shoe darker than it really is (I was hoping to get something closer to black/dark grey), I hope my photo is helpful to show the colors well. The dark colors is better described as dark dark grey and the light color is medium grey.
