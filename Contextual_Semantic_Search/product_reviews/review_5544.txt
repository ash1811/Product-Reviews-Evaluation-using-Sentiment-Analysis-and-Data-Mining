I paid extra for Carhartt pants for their &#8220;legendary&#8221;wear properties and made-in-USA origin, and their pants wore out prematurely, and production was moved to China.So I tried the more blue-collar Dickies. They look better, they fit better, they have a much better pocket design, and so far they seem to be wearing better. We'll see over the long term but so far I'm happy with them. They're made in Mexico, an improvement, I guess, over China. Not much seems to be made here other than cars, kitchen/laundry appliances, and Mac Pros...
