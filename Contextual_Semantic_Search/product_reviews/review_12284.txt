As a guy who keeps ruining the magnetic strips on his credit and debit cards (as well as my NYC Subway MetroCard) by throwing them into my pants pocket to leave my wallet behind or in my knapsack, this was my perfect solution.Comfortably holds four cards, each in their own slot, with two one each side. The center section is open as well, allowing a small amount (very small) of neatly folded cash.Nice, simple style, durable, and not much larger than the cards themselves, so perfect for nixing the bulk of your full wallet when you're on the go.
