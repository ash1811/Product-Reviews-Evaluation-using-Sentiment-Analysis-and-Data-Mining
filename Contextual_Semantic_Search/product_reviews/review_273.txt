Always in style, no matter what era! These converse shoes are the exact style I wore in the 80s and my dad wore in the 50s.  Now my daughter is wearing them today. They dont provide any kind of cushion or support, I am so surprised they were actually worn for basketball back in the day. Fashion and color choices make these shoes a forever classic.
