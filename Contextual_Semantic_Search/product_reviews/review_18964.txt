I was sick and tired of paying for watches that gave up on me after a year or so and decided to just try going with the tried and true, Timex. An analogue watch, battery powered with easy to see hands , the month and date clearly visible and a light up face when you are in low lighting at the push of the stem. The band is much nicer than the price would lead you to believe and the entire package is really a true bargain I think.I must say this watch is a real winner.  It is nice looking, durable and is the most accurate timepiece in our home , keeping a minute by minute pace with our DVR's.  In the 14 months I have owned this watch I have only adjusted the time for daylights savings and that's it. I do adjust the date when we get our under 31 day months.You do need to be a bit careful when pulling out the stem to adjust these things as I accidentally pulled it ALL the way out once, but it went right back in and that was 12 months ago and as the commercial says, it takes a licking and keeps on ticking.  When the battery goes out on this one, I will most likely just purchase another identical watch. Sure you can pay more, way more, but if all you need is to know what time and date it is, this watch will get you there and then some. Recommended!
