I bought these to wear as work out pants.  I ordered the large, I wear a 40x30 size pant.  These fit fine, they seem to run a bit large.  They have an elastic waist with a drawstring as well to tighten up.  The length was about right, only a little bit longer than I expected.  Overall no real complaints.
