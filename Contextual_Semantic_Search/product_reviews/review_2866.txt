Have used this sterling silver polishing cloth for years.  Connoisseurs is the best for removing dark tarnishwith white cloth and polishing to high shine with pink cloth. Much better on your sterling jewelry than theliquid, too powerful cleaners which damage the finish.Everyone who has sterling MUST have one of these cloths.  Also, cloths are large with a lot of cleaning service.
