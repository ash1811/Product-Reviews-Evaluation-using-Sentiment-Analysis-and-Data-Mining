Just to get to the point, my problem with the shoe is that the leather seeps in water. When it rains or snows, the leather gets soaked and in no time, my feet starts to feel wet. This mostly happens at the front of the shoe where the leather meets the sole. At first I thought that the shoe I got was just a lemon. Distraught, I called the Clarks customer care service and they sent me a new pair of the same shoe without any hassle. But alas, after the first day of rain, my feet were soaked again. I am compelled to say that this line of Clarks is just poorly made. Don't buy this shoe if you plan on being outside in them on a regular basis.
