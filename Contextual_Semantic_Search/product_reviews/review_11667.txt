I have these in 3 colors now and I love all of them. They fit as I expected and I usually wear socks with mine especially when hiking. The color is beautiful in person and the height is perfect. It doesn't take me long  put them on because I usually do not take the laces off all the way I just loosen them and only take the top notches off. The laces are about 72 inches so there is plenty of it to just loosen them and with time the laces themselves just like the boots will stretch to your foot.  With practice it becomes a faster task. If you don't have a pair of these in your closet to wear with your skinny jeans then you need it. It keeps my toes warm and looks great.
