color in ad is accurate.  nice quality bandana.  I don't use for head wrap, i drape over small lamp to moderate the brightness at night, works well for this purpose and is a good size (22 by 22) unlike many bandanas which are more hankerchief sized.  Watch for dimensions when you order this type of product.  Arrived very quickly.
