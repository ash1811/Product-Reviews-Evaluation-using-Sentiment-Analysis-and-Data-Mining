I got this as a gift off my wishlist. Basically I just throw stuff on there & my fans will buy stuff off it in return for autographed photos. The photo is kind of misleading to say the least. I gave it 3 stars because of the robe. Same material as the night gown but it seems to be alot better then the night gown. it ties in the back in 2 places which to me is very had to get on without help. Or maybe I am just awful with tieing things behind my back. Honestly if your looking for something sexy & classy to impress your guy, this isnt the best product. However I do use the robe on hot days after showering when I'm to lazy to get dressed right away. I can't say it was money well spent since I didnt pay for it. but it was worth getting it for free.
