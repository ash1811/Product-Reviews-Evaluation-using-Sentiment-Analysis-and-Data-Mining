My wife and I both buy Merrell's and love them. It is all about being comfortable, and getting great wear out of this shoe. When I have purchased a product less expensive in the past, I got exactly that...an uncomfortable shoe, or one that did not last long. No problem with Merrell's...I purchased them with confidence.
