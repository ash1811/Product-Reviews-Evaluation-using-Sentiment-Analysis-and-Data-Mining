I got this for my 6 yr. old son, even though it is big, it is really lightweight. The straps are great, there are plenty of pockets and the 2 main compartments make it easy to carry school work and separate gear.It looks better than the picture and he got lots of compliments. It will be good for him for a long time. The price was great for a Jansport pack.
