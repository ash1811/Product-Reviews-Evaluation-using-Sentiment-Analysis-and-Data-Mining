I just threw away these pants that I bought 6 months ago.  The black faded to a dark grey, with lighter grey wear around the edges.  The fade would look fashionable for jeans, but not for dress pants.  Next time I will stay away from cotton for dress pants and stick to the synthetics, or washable synthetic wool blends.  Those other materials hold their deep black color nicely for years.
