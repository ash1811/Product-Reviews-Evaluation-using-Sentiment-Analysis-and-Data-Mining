I bought this because I lost mine a few weeks ago. I purchased the lost pair back in January from Sunglasshut for over $200 for the polarized version. I came accross this here and thought I would try it since it's fulfilled by amazon, I couldn't lose :-) I'm glad I did, not only that it's genuine and original, I saved $75! You will not be disaapointed.
