This is my sixth pair of Rockport Pro Walkers.  They are the most comfortable shoe. PERIOD !I have them in White, Sport White (which is really Light Beige), and Black.  They're all comfortable.  As long as Rockport keeps making them, I'll keep buying them.  The only thing I would change would be to make the arch a little higher.
