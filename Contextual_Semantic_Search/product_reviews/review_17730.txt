The Princess Sneaker was one of my all time favorite shoe by Reebok.  In my opinion, something has changed about this shoe, the leather doesn't feel right.  Something is off about it, the softness isn't there and the wide didn't feel like it normally would.  I wonder if I got a rip-off version of this shoe?  Just speaking on my experience.
