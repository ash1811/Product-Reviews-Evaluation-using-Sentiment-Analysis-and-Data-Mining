I don't have flat feet.  No one does.  I have fallen arches and they need supporting.  I have medical arch supports which are about 1/2 inch thick and doesn't fit in any of my shoes - negates the whole reason why orthodics exist in the first place.  These do a pretty darn good job of supporting your feet every which way possible.  I simply kncked one star down cuz Birkenstock sizing are all over the place. These, for my fee, run a full size large.  Other Birkenstock models differ.  very hard to buy online wihtout trying on.
