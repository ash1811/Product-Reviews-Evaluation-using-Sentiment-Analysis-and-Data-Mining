The closings on this bag are magnetic not velcro, or zippered  I think that's an improvement.  I have found I like the magnets better.  Velcro picks up lint and looks scruffy after awhile. Zippers can be annoying, sometimes jam and take longer to get at things. The microfiber is easy to clean.  I also like the two divided pockets on the side instead of the one large pocket.  It's easier to know where my stuff is rather than rummaging around in the larger pocket.  This bag is exactly like another bag I've used for years except much less expensive and I like the change to magnets and two smaller pockets.
