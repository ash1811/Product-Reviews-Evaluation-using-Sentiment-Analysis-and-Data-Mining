Well, I was desperate for a bra lately, as I'm recently pregnant and gaining in size. I saw the reviews on this one, and pounced on it. I've never worn a comfortable non-underwire bra, so this was a leap of faith for sure. I was disapointed when I tried it on... first off, it's super tight around the ribs. I know I'm a 38, and that size fits me with any other bra I wear, yet this one has no give whatsoever, and also is worn much further down on the "ribs" so I suggest you order up a few inches. I also noticed the material was super scratchy. The straps in the back- the metal adjuster parts DIG into your flesh if you have to twist. The cups give you a triangle look that points unnaturally high and sits strangely high on the chest. It looks just awful under a tee shirt. Then there's so much material on the top, over the cleavage, that you can't wear anything that's not completely full coverage over it, so it severely limits your outfit choices. Plus the straps are wide, so they'll show on any tank top, no matter how thick-strapped the tank top may be... I am NOT a fan. I wore this for 40 minutes and wanted to burn it. I'm sending it back!
