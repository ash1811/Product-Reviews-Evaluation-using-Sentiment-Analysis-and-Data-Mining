These are not the docs I normally wear. They are not made in England. They are shaped like clown shoes the sole wears out and the leather rubs off IN LESS THAN A YEAR! I did not wear these often due to the tackiness of the boots. This is just a low quality replica of what was once more than an icon. Very poor craftsmanship. Took the length of time to break them in as it did to wear them out. What a waste!!!! I will get the vintage 1460s from the DMs website instead next time around.
