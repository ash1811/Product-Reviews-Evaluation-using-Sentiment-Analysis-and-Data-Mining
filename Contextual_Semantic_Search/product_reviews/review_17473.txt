I've tried a few different products.  This is the best by far.  Now I can wear light, skimpy bras without attracting attention to protruding nips.  They work fine with a tank top if it has a "shelf" bra built in.  These don't always stick to your skin, so I wouldn't try wearing them without something to help keep them in place.  They look like they will last a long time & withstand many washings.  One time I had a problem with itching, but just once.  I've worn them many, many times with no itching.  They arrived with a nice, hand written note of thanks for buying them.  Really appreciate this product that solves a problem for me !!!
