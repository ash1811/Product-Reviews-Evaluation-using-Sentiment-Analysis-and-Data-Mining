I was looking for new gloves made of fabric with minimal loss of dexterity.  From the product photo and the product description, these sounded wonderful.  They looked like they'd fit trim and snug, but have enough stretch to not be restrictive.I measured my hands, and they are 7.5" at the knuckles.  Bingo.  Size Large fits 7.5".Only it doesn't.  These gloves are by no means snug.  They are over-sized.  The finger seams are crooked, and the thumb gusset sits too close to my thumb.  Furthermore, the fingers are odd lengths.  My fingers are rather short.  The index fingers fit well.  That means if you have long fingers, the index fingers of the gloves will be too short.  The remaining fingers are far too long.  In fact, the pinky fingers are nearly as long as the index fingers.  These simply are not well-made.  They feel strange on my hands.  I've bought gloves that were too large or too small before, but I've never had a pair of gloves so oddly-shaped.The fabric is decent.  It isn't that stretchy, though.  On the palm side, the gloves are covered with oodles of gripping dots.  They'd be great if I could actually grip anything, with my thumbs being pulled away from normal by the gussets, and the fingers being so long.I can't recommend these gloves.  If the cut and sewing are typical of Manzella, I wouldn't even recommend the brand.  I'll donate these to Goodwill.
