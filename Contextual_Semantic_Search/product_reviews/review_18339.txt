The good news...these slippers look and fit great!  And they actually feel great -- keep my feet nice and warm, not to  hot or cold -- until I actually stood and walked in them.  The bad news...WTF!!!!...the feel on the sole of my heel is like something is protruding up from the slipper's heel/sole...both left and right slipper.How could this be???  I literally thought there was some kind of foreign object lodged in the slippers.  Not so...just feels like there is.  Is this a manufacturing defect, or could these slippers actually be designed to be this uncomfortable...and PAINFUL!I really wanted to keep these slippers.  Like I said they look and feel great as long as you never have to stand or walk in them.  Sending them back tomorrow.....WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!
