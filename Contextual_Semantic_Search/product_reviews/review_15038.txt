If I wore these pants for an hour my waist line would be cut in half.I think it was the elastic as the pants without the fabric would have been XL.  I probably could have salvaged the things with a new elastic.Second item from Champion that was not so good.  I did find another brand that was a great fit, check my other reviews.I did send an email to csr@txshirts.com and they did not respond.  I now see all the others who have had similar experience from them in other reviews.  They know it is not worth the money to return them or the bother involved.  I threw them away.Not sure why they are still selling here.  I have always had good experience with Amazon and guess these guys are getting below their radar.
