These are great underwear for a child is who mostly trained but has an occasional small accident or still has trouble getting all the way to the potty before releasing. I would certainly not use these for a child who is having bowel movements or completely releasing his bladder into his underwear- these are not meant to be substitutes for cloth diapers. I have been using them for my 2 year and 9 month son for his transition into preschool (new potty, new people, stress!) and they are amazing. They soak up just enough to avoid a completely soaked child but still allow the child to feel that he  has wet himself. If the child has a complete bladder release, urine WILL soak through to their other clothes. My son is slender, but of average height and at 32lbs the size 3t fit him perfectly. The legs holes are designed to be a little roomier, but there is no gapping even on a slender child. I can see him wearing these for a few more months- which will be more than enough time for him to complete training.The texture of these is fantastic for a sensitive skinned child. My son has mild autism with severe textural problems, and the soft cotton of these does not bother him at all. The more expensive brands bothered him texturally, (Those "more absorbent" ones people rave over.) So these have just been wonderful.
