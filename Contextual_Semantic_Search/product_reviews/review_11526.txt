Ok, so it's summertime and I love to wear strappy tanks and pretty dresses.  Well, I have always struggled trying to hide my bras, either the color or the straps or even parts of the bra itself.  This bra can be worn as an everyday strapless with any kind of top or dress and it stays up!!!  Best bra, as soon as I have a little extra spending cash I'm going to buy three more!!
