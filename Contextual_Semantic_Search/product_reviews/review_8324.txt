This is one of several Invictas I've purchased, and I've been pretty impressed.  However, this model is so small that it hardly qualifies as a men's watch--and I'm a fairly short guy.  I've seen watches this size advertised as ladies' models.The second problem with this watch is the clasp.  It almost takes a pair of pliers to loosen the safety clasp.  While it's nice to have a tight fit, when you can't take the watch off, it's a problem.Timekeeping is fine, and I still recommend Invicta watches to others.  But unless you're a really small guy, this watch is simply too small for wearing.  (You could, however, give it to your wife or girlfriend;)
