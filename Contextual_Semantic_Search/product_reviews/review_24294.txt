I purchased this watch to take hiking on the Appalachian Trail. The watch stood up to the challenge. I was very impressed with the watchband. It's Velcro material was comfortable and easily fit my large wrist. I was able to take it off and attach it to my backpack when not wearing the watch. The movable dial on top allowed me to keep an eye on the time I was taking between breaks or over miles without having to remember exactly what time I started.  It all a very durable watch.
