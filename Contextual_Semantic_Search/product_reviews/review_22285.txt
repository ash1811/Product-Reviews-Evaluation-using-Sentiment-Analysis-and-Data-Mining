I have a very full closet of shoes. These are one of the best! They are very attractive. They are comfortable. I was thinking they would have a little more padding for the foot and that they may not need socks. They have a little less padding than i like and socks do have to be worn with them. They run big, so get a size down.Would definitely recommend. Gorgeous high quality shoes.
