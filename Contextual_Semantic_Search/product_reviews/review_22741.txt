I received this robe for Christmas a few years ago and it's just awesome. It comfortable and is still in perfect condition. I especially like how these robes are very absorbant. I've had a few in the past that were heavier, but really didn't absorb anything.In fact my SO liked it so much that she stole it from me for over a year. Well, this Christmas I got her one and now we are both happy :)
