The watch itself is great. It's very nice looking, the band is very cool and the whole thing is super light and thin. There are only two issues I have with it: First, the clasp is not very easy to use. Second, the hands don't glow in the dark.There is also no second hand, which makes it kind of hard to tell if it's working, but I don't really mind not having one.All in all, I would recommend this watch for someone that needs a basic but classy watch that doesn't get in the way of clothing or gloves.
