The costume says its size 4-6, and fits children 44-48". When I received it, however, the size small package says it is 2-3T. It is tiny. I ordered for my soon to be 6 year old who wears a size 5T and is 44" tall. This would NEVER fit her the way it fits in the photo. She should be well within the range stated, but instead the costume is sized for a toddler. Had to send back immediately and replace with a medium, which is for children 4-6T. Looks to be good quality, but Very unecissarily confusing!
