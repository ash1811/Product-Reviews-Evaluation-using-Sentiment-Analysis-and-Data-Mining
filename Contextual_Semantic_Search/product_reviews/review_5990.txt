Perhaps these look better in smaller sizes.....I wear a 9 1/2 to 10M.  These looked so, so dorky on, I can't wear them.  They're very old lady-ish. Also, the collar of the shoe sticks out at the sides on me.  It isn't snug or even close to snug around my ankle area. It's not a stable sneaker...my foot was sliding around a bit, & yes, I had the correct size. I'd have to wear a thick sock, which would really push the dorkiness factor over the top.
