I normally love the Ahh Bra By Rhonda Shear, it is very comfy but offers little support and modesty.The Exquisite form bra looks and feels great, but the only drawbacks are:Fits tight; see below for recommendations for fitFront closure is difficult for people who may have arthritis.The plus sides: see below for recommendationsI enjoy working in the garden, fishing, horseback riding, hiking, etc. and wanted a bra with some support for these activities.The bra is 100% cotton with some spandex in the band area. My measurement of the band area below the breast is 37 inches, after reading online I ordered size 40, it is somewhat tight but stretches out over time with wear, enough to be comfortable.Be prepared that the cotton will shrink a little so it is a good idea to order up in size, I normally wear a 36 C in most stretchy bras, but ordered a 40 D and could not be happier.The back support area eliminates back bulges and offer great support for back problems. The cups fit is as expected but is a lot like the shrink to fit jeans of old.So, measure the area beneath the breast, order up to 4 inches higher,  Order up in cup size, if you are a C cup, order D, If you are a D cup or larger I would recommend ordering up to two cups larger to  allow for shrinkage.The cups offer great modesty without padding.  For ladies that are well endowed and do not want to &#34;let it all hang out&#34; this is a great alternative.I recommend this bra for those women who are well endowedWant modesty without paddingNeed back support and breast support for activitiesWant cool cotton for summer or for hot yoga activites
