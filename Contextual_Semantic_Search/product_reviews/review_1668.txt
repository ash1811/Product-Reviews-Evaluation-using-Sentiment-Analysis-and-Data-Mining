I wanted a specific color and size of this which I initially saw at a local sporting goods store.  The best price I found was at Amazon.  They were about $2 cheaper than the store.  I noted that Carhartt T's tend to run a little large.  I wear a large in most all types of shirts, but wear a medium Carhartt.  I stayed pretty true to size after washing and drying.  I'm a Carhartt fan!
