Some of us can't bear to have scratchy labels in our clothes. To my chagrin, I've ruined shirts by carefully cutting out brand-labels that are more intensively constructed and sewn-in than the seams themselves, only to find I've left a hole. But no problem here! This is a basic, comfortable shirt, with no annoying neck-level labels to contend with. It leaves ample shoulder room, yet is well designed and flattering, even if there's a bit of a tummy involved. Holds up wash after wash. It's a surprisingly versatile and classy looking shirt, considering the modest price. Enjoy!
