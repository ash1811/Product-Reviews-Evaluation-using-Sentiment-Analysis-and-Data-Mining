Bought these, hoping for classic gold toe quality (nice heft, thick cotton cushioning, long life).Unfortunately, I was completely disappointed.  While these are a slight step up from cheapie Hanes socks from the big box store, these are NOT the same quality we used to get from Gold Toe.The six pair I bought shrunk, pilled like mad (bits of cotton sluffed off inside the sock after every wash) and they all developed holes within 3 months of wear.  No, I don't use bleach.  They simply were not made of very high quality cotton and wore through at the friction point at the ball of each foot.I won't buy Gold Toe socks again until I hear that they've returned to their classic standard.Why, oh why, can't women get the same high quality socks that men can buy so easily?  I hope Gold Toe reads the mail and improves their manufacturing standard.  Until then, I opt out.
