i bought these to replace the ones I had for nearly 5 years which had simply worn out. Normally I'd complain about thin material but these hold up and remain comfortable without binding.  I wear them to workout and they take a beating pretty well.  They also stretch a bit and with my, uh, size that's a plus.
