For a "comfort" bra this was very uncomfortable!  I usually wear a 36 to 38D but this one in 38D was very tight around the band and also itchy.  This was even on the last hook.  I don't usually wear Playtex so maybe the sizing is different -so it's back to Victoria's Secret for me.  I was really hoping for a comfortable and supportive bra that didn't add anything - not so easy to find.
