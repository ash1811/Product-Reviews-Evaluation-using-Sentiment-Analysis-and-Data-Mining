I purchased this watch as a Christmas gift for my husband.  He LOVES watches and I try to add one to his collection each year.This watch is a beauty!  So far (two days after Christmas) it has kept perfect time and he's already had one person confuse his watch with a Rolex.It IS a heavier watch, so if you're looking for ultra light, this isn't the watch for you.All in all...a great find!
