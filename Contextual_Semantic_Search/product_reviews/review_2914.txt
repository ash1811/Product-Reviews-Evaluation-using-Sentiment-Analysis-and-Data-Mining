Read all the reviews here and went up a half size to a 9 and next time might try the 8.5 as they are just a little too big. Have walked about 20 miles in them in a week and no complaints at all, other than if you walk where some gravel/rocks are you might get some grit under your feet. These shoes are very comfortable on and my feet do not hurt after a long walk(5 miles or so) in them. Will be ordering at least one more pair.
