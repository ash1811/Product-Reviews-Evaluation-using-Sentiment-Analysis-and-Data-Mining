The bag seems to be well-made and durable, and the inside pockets are great for a tote bag- I can keep my phone and iTouch readily accessible, and they're well-fitted in the pockets so as to not fall out easily.  However, the straps on this bag are way too short.  Don't expect to be able to sling it over your shoulder and go.  You'll end up needing to carefully squeeze it all the way up over your shoulder, or just carry it in your hand the whole time.  Pretty inconvenient, when I buy a tote bag I want to throw some things in it, throw it over my shoulder, and not think about it- but now I have to constantly be thinking about it because its uncomfortable to wear.If I'd spent more than $6 I would've returned it, but it wasn't worth paying return shipping.
