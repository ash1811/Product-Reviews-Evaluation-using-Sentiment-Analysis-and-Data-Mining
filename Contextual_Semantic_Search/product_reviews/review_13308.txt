I have no question about the authenticity of these Ray Bans, having owned several pairs.I wear the 58mm, which is good if you're a male with a normal sized face, like me. If you have a relatively large face, obviously go larger in size but the larger ones do look too big if your head does not match. Likewise, going smaller than a 58mm is not advised for most men unless you have a significantly smaller than average face size. Women can go smaller than 58mm but most men shouldn't.
