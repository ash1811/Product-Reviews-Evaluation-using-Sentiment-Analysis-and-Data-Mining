I bought the black one in 34D....this bra would be fantastic if the straps were made softer as they make the skin sore by the shoulders after about 30mins of wearing it...I bought this bra thinking it would feel like another boneless Bali bra that I bought in a store, but I was just slightly disappointed when it arrived. ..but its not bad for the price...
