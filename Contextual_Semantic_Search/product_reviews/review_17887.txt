While the sock itself isn't so bad, they seem to run fairly small. They seem like they may wear out quickly with heavy use. I would recommend getting a larger size if you are on the higher end of the size chart. I did notice these had more lint than the average sock, too. I ordered these because I enjoyed other Wigwam socks but these I am not too impressed with. I prefer the Carthartt or Timberland sock to these.
