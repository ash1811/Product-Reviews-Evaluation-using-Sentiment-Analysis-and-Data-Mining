To see these they don't much look like crystal to me.  They have an opalescent appearance like they had some iridescent colors fused in them - but really they just pick up the color from whatever you are wearing.  So that I guess is a plus - they will match whatever you wear with them.The clasps are solid, and these won't fall off easily which is a definite bonus.They are not as attractive as the photo though.  I think the photo makes them look more "expensive looking" than they are in real life.  That being said, I will still wear them from time to time.
