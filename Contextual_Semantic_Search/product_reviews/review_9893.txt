Like another reviewer, I bought one of these to see how the fit and quality would be. The quality is nice for the price. The fit is where the warning comes in. I typically have to buy athletic cut shirts as a former football player, my shoulders and neck are bigger than the regular cut shirts are made. I bought a 3X, though I usually only wear a 2X in most shirts, as long as they are athletic cut. Well, the 3X is too tight. The cut out area around the shoulders doesn't quite cover my shoulders and the neck, as another reviewer mentioned, is way too small for a 3X shirt.On a positive note, I am back here to order 3 of the 4X ones. I do really like the lightweight material of the shirt and everything about it, except the cut of it.Hopefully this will help any of you that are wondering about the cut. From the best I can tell it is regular cut, not athletic cut. The difference for me is that I can wear a 2X comfortably in athletic cut, but I'm going to need a 4X in this one.Still a good product, feels like it will be perfect for working out or just sitting around the house on weekends in.
