These slipers as they are called are really a soft type of shoe, you can easily wear them out and look just great. And Im very fussy about looking good. They are a fantstic quality I bought the terry lined ones so I guess its better to wear them out than the fleece. They are great value, so comfortable and good looking going to buy more in other colors.Excellent with Jeans/Tee.. Very good product, one of the best items so far I have found in footwear on Amazon. GREAT!
