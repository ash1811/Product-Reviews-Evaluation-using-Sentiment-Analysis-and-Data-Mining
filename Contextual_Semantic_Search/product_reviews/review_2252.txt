These were perfect for my son. I bought 3 pairs in Different colors. He is very happy. Fit is perfect. Oh one more thing, There is nothing Cooler than a pair of Button Fly Levi's. I wore them as a kid & as a Mom still do. In fact I order the men's sizes as its easier to get the exact fit.. Love em Love em Loveeee em. A must in Black Ladies...
