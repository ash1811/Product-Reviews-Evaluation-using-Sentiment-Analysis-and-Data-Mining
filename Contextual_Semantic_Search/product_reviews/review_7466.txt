Although this shirt is very oversized, it would seem most ordinary shirts are undersized somewhat, it seems to be a great, quality constructed shirt. I will keep it and wear it as an over shirt when I go fishing. I also have recently bought one in another color in an extra-large size. I will say that the X-Large size is closer to an XX-Large from any other manufacturer. From now on I will only order them in X-Large size, and wear them proudly. Overall I would say they are very well constructed and should last a long time if taken care of.
