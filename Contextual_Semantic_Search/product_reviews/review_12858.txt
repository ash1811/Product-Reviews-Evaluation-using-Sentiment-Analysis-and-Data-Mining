There isn't much to say about these except that they fit great. I wear a 29-30 depending on the brand and the 30's from Levi's fit like a glove. I have found that finding 30x30 in the NJ/NY area is sometimes a bit tough as Americans tend to wear larger sizes than other countries. Purchasing these on Amazon really simplified the equation and in general I am quite happy with these.  The quality on these is great!  After reading some of the negative reviews, I will keep an eye out for defects and post an update if these start falling apart.  As of today, there are no holes, loose threads or anything that would be construed as a defect.
