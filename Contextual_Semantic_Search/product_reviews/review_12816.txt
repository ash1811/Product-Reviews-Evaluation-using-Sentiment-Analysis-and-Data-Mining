When i got this bra i was so happy ... i have been looking for this model for years ... but then when i finally tried it on it was big ... i know my size (i constantly measure myself) and i always wear a 38C ... but the cups were so large i cannot wear the bra ... so know your size well and maybe contact the company before you buy one
