These bras don't fit like they do on the model. As with previous reviewers, I found that they are very lose in the cup area. As a result I have not worn them and I don't really know if I will. A very good buy is the minimizer bra by this same seller. I love them. Unfortunately I don't see them in white. I would love white ones, but only black and another nude-looking color is available, when I checked. Please consider white ones!
