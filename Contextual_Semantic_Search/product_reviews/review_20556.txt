The thin fabric insole comes unglued first and you get a waffled footbed that's uncomfortable on the soles of your feet. Then the toe box comes unglued from the rubber outer sole. Since the toe and the sole separate, I get a scoop of sand in there when I walk across the beach. Worthless junk! I bought four pair for the family and they're all the same garbage.
