This is a well-made, comfortable, not-too-heavy denim shirt, which I'll probably be using a lot for just hanging out, not just work.  I definitely plan to buy a few more of these shirts.  And, best of all, the sizing is right; too many shirts made overseas tend to be way too small for the labeled size.  These are right on the money, for a big guy like me.
