Fantastic shoes that are both light and comfortable, yet the strps are very sturdy and not filmsy as with some sandals.  I received a couple of compliments about the shoes already and they fit very well.  I wear an 8 and ordered an 8 and 1/2 for room and the shoes are very roomy yet my toes are not sliding forward.  Would highly recommend this shoe.
