Nice and thick cushioning, but not too thick a sock.  Well made.  I can see why some people are so loyal to this brand.  So comfortable, especially in the toe.  Warm and dry feet is so important to a diabetic.  These socks are great.  I bought 6 pair for myself. Just the right size. We are going to buy some crew socks for winter here in the UP.  I wear one pair as bed socks.  No binding on the ankle.
