Rockport is supposed to be known for comfort, but these bad boys don't deliver.  I suppose since Rockport got taken over by New Balance and then Adidas, quality is being sacrificed to boost the bottom-line.If you lift up the insole you will feel underneath it is like a piece of steel.  There is literally no give to the shoe.  I bought them thinking they were Rockports--known for quality--however Rockport isn't the same compnay today.  I probably could get more comfort from a $30 pair of shoes in a baragin bin, then these overpriced clunkers!
