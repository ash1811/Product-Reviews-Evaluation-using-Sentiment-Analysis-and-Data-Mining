I love this product.  I bought the lesser expensive model (without a chronograph) several years ago, and finally bought this one because it just looks so nice.  It's great.  I get compliments on it frequently.  It's certainly not something I'd wear with a suit, but it's perfect for wearing around the house.  I wear the other model for working around the house.
