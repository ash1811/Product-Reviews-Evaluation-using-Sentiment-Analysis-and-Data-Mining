This bra has been on the market many years. There is a reason for it. It is a very good supporting bra. The straps stay up without digging into shoulders. The band around the back is  wide enough that it doesn't fold up. The cups do provide definition which I personally like. To say it makes one look like Madonna is a misnomer. If it did I would never take it off! ;-)
