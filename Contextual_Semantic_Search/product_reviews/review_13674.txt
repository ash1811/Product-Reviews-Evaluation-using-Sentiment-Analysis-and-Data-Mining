My son wore this on Halloween; it looked very good!  However, my son did not wear the so-to-speak helmet; it is made of rubber and the form does not hold true to the picture.  A nice, solid, plastic helmet should be offered with this product; I likely would have spent another $10 for it should it have been available.  Never the less, the costume still looked good even without a helmet.  I did find a nice shield and sword for about $15 to add to the costume; I could not find the exact same one as within the picture.  My son still plays occasionally with the sword and shield.
