If I could give these six stars, I would... just like everything else I've bought from Luvable Friends for my baby.  They're soft, durable, wash great, don't shrink, and are comfy and adorable.  So much more than you'd think you would get for the price.  I've ordered the pants in two different sizes so far (and many different colors) and just ordered the shorts to add to our collection.  They're all great!
