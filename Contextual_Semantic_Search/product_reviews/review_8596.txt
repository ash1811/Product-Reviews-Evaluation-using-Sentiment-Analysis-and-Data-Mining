Love these panties!  They fit like a dream, with no gaps, and no pinching.  They stay in place (no ride up!) even on my relatively skinny bum.  The fabric stays flat, and they hit right on my hip bone--no show when you are wearing even very low rise jeans.  Sturdy, washable, and cute---so cute!  The little cutouts in the sides are quite handy, too......:-)  You can also buy these at Kohl's (use those discounts!!), but they aren't available in all the colors found here.
