This was a Christmas gift and I absolutely love it. The black on white design makes it extremely easy to read and it looks great.Setting the watch was a bit time consuming but following the steps in the included DVD made it easy to do. LOVE the perpetual calendar. Having just come out of February, this is the only watch I have that I did not have to adjust the date on. I'm still amazed at how long the hands glow in the dark. No light but who needs one!This was my first deployment clasp watch and it took me a while to figure out how to size it, but once I did, I had to laugh because it was so simple. On the underside of the silver bar that goes across the band, there's a little piece that flips up so that you can adjust which hole it engages. The band takes a bit of getting used to, but I now find it very comfortable and easy to use.Love the eco-drive concept. No batteries AND no watch winder. Ambient light seems to be enough to keep it going - I haven't made any special efforts to keep my wrist in the sunlight or anything :). It even has a warning when the charge is low - or so I've read - haven't seen it - where the second hand starts moving every OTHER second (still keeping proper time), so that you can see if it's getting low.Overall, I think that this is a unique and fine looking watch. I've recieved compliments every time I've worn it.
