It looks as shown but manage your expectation:1) It's short (and thats that I have a short torso), sits above waist for awkward fit2) i had the opposite problem, it ran big (XL) & is very stretchy so it didnt cling3) my blouse came with 2 big holes on the side (I would have never known IF it wasnt for the contrast against the white label)I had to keep it cause I was attending a wedding & didnt I notice the holes until THAT day. You need to cut the product label off cause it shows right through the blouse (sewn into lower side hem)But it is beautiful & i did get lots of compliments, it just didnt fit the way I expected.
