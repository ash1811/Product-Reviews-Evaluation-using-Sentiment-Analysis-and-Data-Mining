I love these Sketchers!  Besides being cute they are so light that you feel like you are barefoot!  I need arch support and Sketchers tennis shoes have that feature built right in!  I have to say that you will not regret this purchase!  I have worn these for years and could not find them in local stores but found them here and bought some because they are my favorite tennis shoe!  Highly Recommended!!!
