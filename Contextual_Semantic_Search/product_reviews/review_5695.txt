Tried on my boots as soon as I got em and although they were a tiny bit tight at first, I'm now wishing I'd gotten a half size smaller.  I have a wide foot, but these break in easy. And fit my wide foot even though they're a B width!  They just seem a hair too long.  Love the stitching on the upper half.  Like how they feel..I'm hoping they have enough arch support for when I wear them all day.  All in all a quality boot!
