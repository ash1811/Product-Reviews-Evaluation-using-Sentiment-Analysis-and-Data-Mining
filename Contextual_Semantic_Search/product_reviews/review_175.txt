My daughter recieved this purse as a gift and we found it was missing some of the pieces. Since the pieces were sealed in a bag, it was a clearly problem from the manufacturer. When we went to exchange it, we found all of the purses on the shelf were missing at least the mirrors! Pretty bad quality control, if you ask me. We ended up stuck with an incomplete toy... pretty dissapointing.
