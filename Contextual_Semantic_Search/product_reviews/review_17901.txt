I like the Wigman Men's At Work 3-Pack Socks, Black, Large. You can tell right away they are made with durability in mind. Like many reviewers before me, I think these socks are above average, perhaps the price a little high, but in the end you get what you pay for with very rare exceptions, and these socks look and feel like they will not disappoint with the passage of time. 4 Stars.
