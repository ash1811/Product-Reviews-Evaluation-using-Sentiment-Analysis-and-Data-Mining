I ordered this in a wide, and it's still too tight around my the ball of my foot.  I wear either medium or wide widths (my foot's not super wide).  Glad I didn't try the medium width as I wouldn't have been able to fit my foot in.  If you have a narrow foot, these shoes would be great.  However, I returned!
