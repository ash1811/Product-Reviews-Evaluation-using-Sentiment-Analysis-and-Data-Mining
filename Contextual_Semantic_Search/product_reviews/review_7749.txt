These are great pants, but I could have got a pair of these that would look just as good from a different manufacturer for about 10 bucks cheaper than these....but, Ive already washed them, I love them, and Im not sending them back..Great looking pants and the quality is great, although a little thinner material than real army pants, they are probably still very durable....I wear BDU's most all the time...they are more comfortable than blue jeans.
