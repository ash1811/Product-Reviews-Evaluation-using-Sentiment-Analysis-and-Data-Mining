I got these sandals after reading numerous reviews raving about them.  I personally don't find them to be off the chart.  They are bit stiff and even though there is a rough bottom to them, I feel like they are kind of slippery on some surfaces.  They aren't completely uncomfortable but I've definitely owned more comfortable sandals for less money.
