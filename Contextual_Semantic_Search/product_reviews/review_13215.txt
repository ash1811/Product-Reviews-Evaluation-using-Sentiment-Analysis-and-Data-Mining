This Playtex bra is nice, feminine and lacy. It is the classic old school style bra that you expect from Playtex. It's NOT the modern style round and molded cup that's popular today. So, if that's what you want try something else.If you find that this bra is slightly too big as some have said. Try washing it in the washing machine and drying it in the dryer once or twice to shrink it a little. That's what I did and it worked. Then, you can hand wash it if you prefer. If it's too small all I can say is try a different size or style.This bra is exactly what I expected. It priced right, supports well and looks great on me.
