This are just plain, light, comfy shorts for summer or pj's. They were a great price, so figured I would give them a try. They are nice to have on hand for something quick to throw on to get messy or lounge around in when you don't want to get &#34;good&#34; clothes dirty. They seem well made and the sizing seems accurate.
