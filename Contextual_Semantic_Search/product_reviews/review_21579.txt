She has had these for about 6 years wears them all the time. they start out a bit snug and the wool mats down a little. She loves them so much I'm buying her another pair for Christmas. Beware of fakes. I bought some at a discount last year and they were not real. An easy tell is the soles are stiff and not nearly as flexible as the real ones. The fake ones came with hologram &#34;authentic&#34; badge of some sort. Real ones don't have holograms anywhere. Get real ones, if they are on deep discount they are most likely fake. Talked with a distributor of UGG and he told be UGG is very stern about price regulation.
