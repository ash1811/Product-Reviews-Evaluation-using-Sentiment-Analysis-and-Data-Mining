I have been pleasantly surprised by how comfortable these shoes are!  I usually shy away from shoes without socks unless they are sandals but these have been great.  I wear them everywhere...on walks through the park, grocery shopping, poolside, to the zoo and even to our local amusement park/water park.  They are quick on, no socks to mess with and you feel like your feet are safe (no stubbed toes!) and supported.  I will always own a pair of these.  My 3-year old equally loves his Keens as well and probably picks to wear them 90% of the time.
