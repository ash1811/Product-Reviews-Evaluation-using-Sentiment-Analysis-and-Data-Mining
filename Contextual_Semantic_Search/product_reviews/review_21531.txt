This is big for short - 2 - 3 nights - trips but perfect for longer ones.  Extremely convenient to hand on a shower curtain rod, it also holds a great deal.  Bottom snaps off for those shorter trips. Clear pockets make early morning easier as you can see everything.  Tidy, well made.  Just a bit too plastic-y, but all the good qualities overcome that.
