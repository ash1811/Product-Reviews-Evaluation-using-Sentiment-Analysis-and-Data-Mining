I purchased this watch for husband.  He loves the watch!!! As far as I know, there is nothing he dislikes about the watch. He did have to have several watch band links removed because he has a small wrist, but it is normal for him to do so and we expect that anyway.Hubby did have to read the manual to figure out how to set the day/date, but it wasn't too difficult.This was my first Invicta watch purchase and was great!! Because of this watch, I have now added many Invicta watches in My Wish List for hubby down the road.
