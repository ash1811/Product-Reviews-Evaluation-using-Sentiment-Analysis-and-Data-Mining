Just buy it. You won't regret. As far as color's concerned, black is great. It's not as boring as it looks in stock pictures, and complements beach/summer very well, not to mention it's more versatile. Perfect size, even on my thinner wrist. Quality all over the watch. You will like it a lot! It took a year for me to actually get this watch (wasted a lotta time reading on forums, etc.) and now I regret that I should've bought this watch in the very beginning. Hope this review helps you make decision.
