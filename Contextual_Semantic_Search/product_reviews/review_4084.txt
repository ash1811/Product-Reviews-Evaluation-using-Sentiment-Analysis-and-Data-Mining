I am a larger woman and the plus size fit great! The silicon kept the stockings from rolling (always annoying). I've found Leg Avenue products to be a little on the cheap side as far as quality and construction in the past, but these stockings seem like, if handled with care, they will hold up well. I will definitely buy these again.
