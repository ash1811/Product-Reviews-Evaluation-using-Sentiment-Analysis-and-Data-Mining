I bought these for the arch support for standing hours on end in surgery with my flat feet, but the toe box is narrow so when my feet move forward even a little, my toes painfully hit the sides and top of the toe box. If it hurts after a few minutes, it would cripple me by the end of a day. But very attractive, great soles and great arch support. Wish they'd fit.
