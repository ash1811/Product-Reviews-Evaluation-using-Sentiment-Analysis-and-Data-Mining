My old socks had either worn out after years of use or slowly got nabbed by the Gripes in the laundry, so I ordered a set of Gold Toe knowing that those were supposed to be the name-brand.Straight out of the package, they look and feel very nice (they are a perfect thickness), and as you start to put them on, you think everything's going to be great, and that's where it ends.  Unfortunately, once I got the socks all the way on, I could feel a very distinct seam in the toe that was driving me nuts.  I tried adjusting the socks several times and swapping them for the other foot, but the seam was still very noticeable.On top of that, since they are polyester, they do tend to slip down my leg a little more than my old cotton socks.  By the end of the work day, they were slightly sweaty from being less breathable than cotton, though not terrible.I will wear these until they wear out or I get sick of them, because they're not terrible, but I would not buy these again.There is a similar style brand I used to buy that has a gold stripe on the toe instead of the gold block, but I can't remember the name and haven't been able to find them online at the moment.  I bought them at a military exchange store, and they were very comfortable and lasted me for years, but it's driving me crazy that I can't find them again.
