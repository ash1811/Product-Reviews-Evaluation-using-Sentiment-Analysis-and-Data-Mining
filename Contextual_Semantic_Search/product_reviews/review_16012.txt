I am very pleased with this bag...it is not heavy or stiff like other canvas bags. Its color is the perfect gray and not too dark to use this summer. It was not estimated to arrive on-time but it arrived early so I was ecstatic to be able to take it on my trip because I wanted to use it as a beach tote to put EVERYTHING in. It definitely big enough for that task :-) and I was even able to get a towel in it. Very happy with the product and the seller...will be looking for this bag in more colors very soon.
