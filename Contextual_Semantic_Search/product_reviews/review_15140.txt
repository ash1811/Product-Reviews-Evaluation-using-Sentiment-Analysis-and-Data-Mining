These are pretty decent sweat pants. The only thing I would prefer would be a bit more tension in the elastic for the waist. That said, there is a drawstring and I'm pretty thin.They are warm and comfy around the house and have no manufacturing flaws I can detect. Also, they are not &#34;staticy&#34;. They do pick up a bit of cat & dog hair but not excessively for black sweat pants. I like them.
