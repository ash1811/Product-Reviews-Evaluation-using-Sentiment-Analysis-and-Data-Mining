They are nice pants but they do not wear well in the seams.  I'm a short fat guy and I buy two pair at a time, I wear them two days in a row, 5 days a week (mandatory dress code) and they always wear through in the inseam on me.  However they are very comfortable so maybe thats the price for comfort.  I go through two pair every 4 months.
