Yep these are worth the money.  Not sure I'm going to fill an entire drawer with them, but they are comfortable enough to get a few pair. I like the fact that they are thin and breathable.  The cup doesn't offer quite as much support as other boxer briefs I own but this is OK because that just gives the whole assembly room to breath.
