This ring is my wedding ring and i couldn't be happier with it. I wanted a CZ ring because i dont want to buy diamonds. (a horible industry i wont give my money to!) So i wanted an alternative. This ring is very underrated and elegant. It is perfect by itself, i tried it with a band but that was too much. I would recommend this ring to those who are looking for a inexpensive,and socially conscience alternative to diamonds.UPDATE from 2009,stone fell out after about a month.
