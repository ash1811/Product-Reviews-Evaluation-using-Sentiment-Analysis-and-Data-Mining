I bought this watch for my husband for Valentine's Day. He lost his last Skagen in his travels and was so sad. The day he opened this watch, which by the way comes on the sweetest little Skagen pillow which is just a little touch of class, it went on his wrist and hasn't come off since. My 11 year old son has decided he wants one exactly like it cause as he says, it's very cool. High praise indeed.
