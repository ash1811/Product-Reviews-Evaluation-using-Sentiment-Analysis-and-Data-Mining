My father had this shoes about 35 years ago. He handed down to me, and I wore it in college. Then, it died. This shoes lasted longer than some people live.I bought this for my father, because I love him. He tells me, it's super comfortable, and it fits perfect. I'm going to buy another set of this, so I can pass it down to my child.
