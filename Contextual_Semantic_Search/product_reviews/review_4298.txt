This is my second pair of Keen Men's Newport sandals.  The first pair lasted seven years.  In addition to wearing well, they are extremely comfortable and protect you toes very, very well.  I throw them in the washer with other laundry about once a week to keep them fresh.  You can't go wrong with these.
