These bras were purchased as a gift but i found them to be very nice! I will include that they are &#34;good, sturdy bras&#34; for someone who has large breast. I believe they would work well for someone who had smaller breast. They are accessible and come in common sizes. Now, if you are looking for a fancier bra then this would not be the bra for you. But, if you want a bra that is an &#34;every day bra&#34;, then this would be a good bra!
