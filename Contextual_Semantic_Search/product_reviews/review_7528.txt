I usually am not a big jewelry purchase person but this caught my eye. I do wear earrings daily and so do friends and family. This made great mother's day gifts for my mother, my daughter in law and myself! The pair I gave my daughter in law was my granddaughter's birthstone so that was a nice touch and the one I selected for my own mom matched her usual jewelry choices.I was very happy with the size and quality of the stones and the settings.
