The reasons I like these socks: 1) they come in a a women's L, which fits those of us with shoe sizes 10 and above 2) they fit like a glove (pun) (no bunching, wrinkling) 3) they are very comfortable and a great alternative to wool socks for hiking in warm temps 4) they wash well 5) they're a good height above the ankle 5) the blue (the only color available in L) is attractive.  I bought one pair to try them out and liked them so well that I purchased another 2 pair.
