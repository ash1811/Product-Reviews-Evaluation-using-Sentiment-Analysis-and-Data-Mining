Fortunately the shirt was a little large to begin with.  I did use the lowest heat setting available on my dryer, but it went from being a little larger than normal size, to a little smaller.Being around 6'6&#34;, this shirt is the perfect length.  I've paid nearly twice the price for similar products though.
