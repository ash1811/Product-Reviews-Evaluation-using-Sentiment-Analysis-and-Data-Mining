As soon as I saw this dress I had to have it..it's all retro hotness, so I thought it would be perfect for dinner parties and such. It arrived and I've worn it only once.  The bust portion is WAY big (I'm a 36C and usually have the reverse problem with dresses) and the waist is a little tight (I'm a size 14).  This was my first strapless dress, so I felt a little self-concious with the loose bust enough as it was.  I think I could deal with it if it came with straps.
