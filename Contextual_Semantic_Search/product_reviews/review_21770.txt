I was looking for a more masculine way to lug around my baby boy's diapers and wipes.  This bag fit the bill perfectly.  Enough room for a pack of wipes and a stack for pampers.  Small pockets in front are fantastic for small things like Bourdeaux's Butt Paste, hand sanitizer, etc.  A far cry from the intended purpose of this bag (ammunition).  OD green color beats the jungle animal rainbow diaper bags I found in local stores.
