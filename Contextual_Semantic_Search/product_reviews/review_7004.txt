Gold Toe has changed the way they make their men's socks, and not for the better. The material is thinner, especially on the sole. There&#8217;s far less cushioning than before. The fit is tighter as well.One pair in my pack had significant fraying at the top edge right out of the package.Rather than be a premium brand, these socks are now just a tiny bit better than the cheap socks from brands such as Fruit of the Loom. The only saving grace is that the elastic is a bit more comfortable.I bought these on a price dip so I got 6 pair for $11.99. Had I paid the regular price, I would have returned them.Very disappointing quality, and I would not purchase them again.
