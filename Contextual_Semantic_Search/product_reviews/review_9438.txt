These are not as small as some may think - Very nice pair - not too gaudy not the dull types too - u can use both sides- One side as CZ and the other side is soft plain metal.Really good buy - For sure office wear- Wont say u cant wear with a dress - But may not be the fancy types or flasshy types if your looking for one like that.
