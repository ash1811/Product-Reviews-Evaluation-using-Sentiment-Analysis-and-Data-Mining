I wear a 10.5 size shoe and hoped the XL size would fit. The length only needs to be about 1/4&#34; longer to feel comfortable. I kept them because while a bit small they are what I needed for a soft slipper with a good sole. They are attractive and very well made. The cost was a factor in my decision to purchase them, too.If your size is closer to a 10 then you will be very satisfied with these slippers.
