This look and feel cheap. They weren't that expensive so what can I expect.  Maybe I should have bought a more expensive brand so I could have something that is better quality.  The really feel and look like I am wearing some cheap moccasins.  They are ok for shuffling around the house and stuff.  They are almost like house slippers with a rubber sole.  They are also lighter in color than the picture portrays.
