I run between D and DD and chose DD. This bra has a fifties style fit, ie the breasts project straight out but a little wide very different from today's squash em round underwire cups.  I had a little bit if empty cup so it wrinkled a bit on me and my breasts were pointing a bit east and west.  I think that would have been lessened if I could have worn a smaller band size but the 36 was already quite tight.  A D might have worked but I was looking for a bra without wires to wear with an under bust corset and the area between the breasts didn't rest flat against the body so it pushed the corset &#34;busk&#34;, front boning away from my chest causing an ill fit.  Since I couldn't find a bra that worked well with a corset I switched to Orchard Corsets over bust corset and will never go back to bras again except for exercise.  Corsets redistribute the weight of your breasts and bra caused neck and shoulder pain is gone forever.  It's odd that so many people are anti corset when my corsets are so much more comfortable than an underwire bra.
