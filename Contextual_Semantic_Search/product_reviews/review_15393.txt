I have many of these. I use them for scarves in the fall and winter and they are great to take on trips. They are lightweight and smooth which is my preference.  When I saw these items from Sakkas on Amazon I wondered if they would be the same quality as the ones I've bought locally and to my delight they were!  For a very reasonable price, you get a beautiful shawl/scarf.  I love the turquoise/black.  Stunning!
