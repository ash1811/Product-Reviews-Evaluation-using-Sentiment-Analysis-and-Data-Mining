After reading several reviews for this bra, I was hesitant to order it, but it looked so pretty, I decided I could always send it back! I got the light pink color and it fit as a 42B like a glove. Being a 42B is a very odd size. When I was pregnant, my diaphragm grew eight inches, my cup size stayed the same. The problem getting such a strange size is that manufacturers all assume we are enormous women and therefore, they don't seem to be able to figure out that just because our diaphragms are weird, it doesn't mean we need rows and rows of hooks to hold us together. This bra has five hooks, which is a bit annoying (three would have sufficed) and why I downrated it one star.Otherwise, it fit perfectly, better than most I've learned to live with. And it's really very pretty and feminine. Because of the five hooks, I cannot use it as a lounging bra, which is sort of what I wanted, but it really looked very nice under tighter fitting tops and shaped me up better than most bras I've bought. I recommend this bra if you are a genuine 42B, but beware, it isn't one you can comfortably hang out around the house in. Being so pretty, that is a shame!
