Boy was I impressed, Thought I might have been disappointed in ordering these. But I was wrong, VERY Comfy, very breathable, very supportive. All product details are a tee, wash, dry with towel and let air dry for a few hours, and ta da you have a fresh clean pair of undies. Kept me cool and dry all day.
