I needed a pair of boots for a wedding and had been wanting to get some for awhile anyway. Good quality for a good price. However I had read to get a half size smaller and usually wear an eight so I got a 7.5. I should have gotten a 7 because these run BIG apparently. It still worked alright though. Other than that they are great!
