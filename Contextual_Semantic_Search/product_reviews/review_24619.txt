Originally, I ordered a size 13, but it was way too small.  Nicely, Amazon replaced them with Size 14's as it wasn't my fault that the slippers are undersized.  The new ones fit fine and were quite comfy.After I wore them for about 2 months, I noticed a gap along the seam formed by the top and the sides of one of the slippers.  The gap was caused by the leather ripping apart where the lacing goes.  The gap continued to spread. Then the second slipper did the same.From the past reviews, it looks like its hit-or-miss whether you get a good pair or not.  Definitely a miss for me.
