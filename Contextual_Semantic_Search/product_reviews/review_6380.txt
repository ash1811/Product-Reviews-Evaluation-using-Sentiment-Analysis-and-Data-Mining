I bought this hoodie for my girlfriend. She usually wears a Large. I was afraid to buy this hoodie online because i was unsure of how it would fit. but it fits perfect! Fits her just right! The material was great, very soft on the inside. The blck color was so good and rich, not faded at all. I would def. buy this again! The price was also good! what a great deal, and great quailty. hope this helps!!
