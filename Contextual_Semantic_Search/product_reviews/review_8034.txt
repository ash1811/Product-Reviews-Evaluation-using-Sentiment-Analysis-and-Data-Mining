This watch is just cool. I am a minimalist in how I dress most of the time, and this watch fits my personality well. I love how simple it is. I get a lot of compliments about it too. This watch keeps time well, and it's incredibly cheap. I never really understood why one would pay hundreds of dollars on a watch. IT'S ON YOUR WRIST which is close to your hand which is something you obviously use everyday. Watches are going to get worn down so why pay too much money?
