I understand that I wear a size 38DDD, but I still feel that even if I wore a smaller size, this bra would do nothing for me.  It is like a normal bra and will be used as such.  It gives less support than some normal bras that I have had for over a year, a medium amount of lift and if I wore this to run, I would probably get hit in the face with a boob.  No lie.  The fabric is thin and does not &#34;hold you in&#34; as a sports bra really needs to do to be effective.  Two stars because it does not do what it is intended to do.  If you are looking for a good sports bra, I would definitely not recommend this one.  If you want a &#34;lounging around the house, comfortable cleaning bra&#34; then yes, this would work for you.
