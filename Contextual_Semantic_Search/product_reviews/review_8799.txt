As other reviewers mentioned, find a fit guide for this slip somewhere else before buying.To get the right length, meausure a skirt's length -- a 24 inch slip will hit you around the knees, a 28 inch will be mid-calf -- the number is the length from your waist to the end of the slip.For the bust size, measure the fullest part of your bust, NOT your bra size.For reference, I'm 5'8" and wear a 36E bra -- the 38 slip was tight, I should have bought the 40. However, because I measured for length, the 24 inch length was perfect for my slightly-below-the-knee dresses.Love the stretchy straps and the lack of hardware. Most comfortable slip, ever. Lasts a lifetime, or thereabouts -- the slip I just ordered was a replacement for one that must be 20 years old (and still in good shape -- it just didn't fit my aging body, LOL)!
