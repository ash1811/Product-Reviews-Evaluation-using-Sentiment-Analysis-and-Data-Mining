I have been looking for a shoe like this for a long time.  Too bad I can't seem to get a pair that fits. My foot measures 7 1/2 medium on a shoe store fitting scale.  This is the size of all my dress shoes.  I first ordered the brown in my regular 7 1/2.  This was at least a full size too small.  I could barely squeeze my foot into the shoe.  I returned them for a size 8.  This shoe is so large it falls off my foot.  I think there may be a production problem with the brown color.  Based on other reviews I think the other colors may run more true to size.  This is a great looking shoe - too bad the brown and I are not meant to be together.  Thanks Amazon for your  great return policy and customer service - you take the worry out of online shopping.
