I like the support this gives.  You do need to order at least a size larger around than you normally wear (I almost think maybe I should have gone two sizes up).  I have to say it is a bit tough to get into, but once you get it on it's great support.  By the end of the day, it was digging into me a bit at the bottom front.  Also I would like it better if the straps were just a little further out from my neck.
