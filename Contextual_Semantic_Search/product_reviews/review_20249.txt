Great looking slipper with quality materials.  This is my second pair.  My original pair was the fleece lined model and this pair is terry lined.  The terry lined model runs slightly smaller and narrower than the fleece lined version.  It also has a much softer back heel cup.  The fleece lined slipper can be slipped into with no pushing; the fleece stiffens the heel and it does not collapse when putting on.  The terry lined version has a soft back heel and folds itself down when trying to slide into it. Sometimes, I have to bend over to get it on.I recommend the fleece lined slipper version rather than this one.
