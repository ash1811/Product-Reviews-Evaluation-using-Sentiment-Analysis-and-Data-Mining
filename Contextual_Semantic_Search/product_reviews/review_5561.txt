My boyfriend works outdoors (trims/cuts trees under the powerlines in Northern Wisconsin) and it gets quite cold in the winter. He had been wearing good old fashioned long johns when I bought him these for his birthday. They are all he wears now, instead of 2 pairs of long johns. He loves them and I love not having to wash 10 pairs of long johns. I also have a similar pair (women's though) and they are incredible .Not too bulky but very warm in the winter months.
