This is an update from my original 5 star review. This watch lasted six months. Turns out the band and case are not stainless as described. Hubby bumped his arm at work and the case broke off from the band. This was just a little bump, NOT a big hit. It shouldn't have even scratched the case or band. Inside the metal coating, the case and band were plastic. It was not fixable, the holder for the band cracked right off. Second bad watch from Casio...in my opinion two strikes they are OUT. Looking nice and having features is no good, if the watch itself is shoddy. And describing it as stainless is VERY misleading, unless you count a thin coating of metal over plastic as stainless steel. What a rip off!
