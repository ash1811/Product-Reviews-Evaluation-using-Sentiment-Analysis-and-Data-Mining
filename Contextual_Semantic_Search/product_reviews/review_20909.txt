Even when it's not too cold, these are so nice to wear around the house. Very plush and comfortable.If you have a pair of tight shoes, they'll be even tighter with these, they're thick!With how thick they are, I wouldn't have expected these to be as breathable as they are.  I had one pair I kept as house socks for a few days (when I went out I would switch to thinner socks), and these never got stinky.These are the most comfortable socks I've ever worn.
