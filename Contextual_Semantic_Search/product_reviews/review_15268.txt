This necklace is extremely pretty; while the pendant is significantly larger than I was expecting (it's about an inch across, maybe a bit bigger), it still works as formal or casual jewelry.  The matching earrings (Sterling Silver Open Double Flower Earrings) go perfectly and can really class up an outfit.  I was worried that the "double" flower aspect would make both the necklace and earrings too busy, but that is not the case at all.  Generally speaking, I think they can go with any outfit and I would recommend them highly.
