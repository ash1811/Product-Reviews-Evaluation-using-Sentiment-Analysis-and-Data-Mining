My granddaughter came for a visit on her birthday, which was Easater Sunday.  I placed these shoes among other Easter things in a big sand bucket.  She was delighted to get them.  She put them on right away and wore them around the house, on the boat, and, of course, to the beach.  Very happy with these shoes.
