Playtex is a name you can trust, and it is great to know that many companies who specialize and create women&#8217;s lingerie have started to realize that wired bras are not the only solution for lift and support for women who purchase their products. I ordered this bra for two reasons; I love Playtex products, and it is a wire free bra. The delivery was on time, the packaging was neat, as expected of a Playtex item. Since most bra sizes by various companies are sometimes irregular, I decided to order a size larger than my actual desired size. This bra is extremely comfortable, no tightness around my shoulders, bust line, or underneath my arm area, the material is soft, and the seams are perfectly placed in the design of this bra. The support is excellent and firm, (while walking or running, you do not experience excessive shaking/jumping up and down), and it does not give you the look of an unnatural shape in whatever outfit you are wearing with this bra underneath your clothing. I am definitely pleased with this bra, and will purchase in more colors. I would recommend this bra to anyone interested in a well-fitted bra, that definitely provides lift and support where and when needed in an area of looking for a women&#8217;s lingerie product with fashion and style.
