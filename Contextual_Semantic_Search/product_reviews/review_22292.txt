The shoes are fine BUT they are not the color of the picture. The shoes are not brown in color, they are the off-white looking ones. I dont know if the picture is of the wrong shoes or if the company just messed up my order. I bought the shoes for my little sister's birthday, thankfully she liked the off-white color better. That is why I only gave two stars, because I did not get what I thought I was ordering.
