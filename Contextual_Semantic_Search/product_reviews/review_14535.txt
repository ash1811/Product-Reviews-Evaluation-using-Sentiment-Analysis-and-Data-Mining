I got my first pair of Birkenstock Arizonas about 25 years ago.  They lasted me well over 10 years.  I replaced them with another pair and have now added yet another pair to have at work.  I love them, they are by far the most comfortable footgear I have ever found.  Arizonas are easy to slip on quickly when you roll out of bed, and can be worn all year if you just choose socks appropriate for the temp (wool for winter, etc.).  I truly love these - my Arizonas are one of those rare items you find that are so perfect and last so long, you value them way beyond the price they cost.  I hope Birkenstock keeps making these forever, I am a loyal customer for life on these.
