Due to a recent injury, and a very swollen foot, I ordered WW width. I was hoping to have something that I could get on my foot, since this will take a long time to heal. The slippers that came are actually more narrow than a regular width! The box label says WW but they are FAR far from it. I am NOT impressed. BEWARE!
