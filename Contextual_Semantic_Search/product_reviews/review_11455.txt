This is exactly what I was looking for.  After having had three kids I'm having a little bit of trouble losing the baby flab.  I am 5' short about 130 lbs and have a short torso.  I was a little hesitant to buy this because of the mixed reviews but I bought the small and hoped for the best.  I cannot wear this thing backwards as other reviews have suggested it pokes me in my breasts and hurts like crazy if I do. When I put it on correctly (hooks in front) I can wear all day and not have any problems!  I love the fact that it gives my back proper support. It's not something you put on and forget you have it on but I don't feel like ripping the thing off my body and hurling at the nearest garbage can either!  All in all I'm very satisfied with the results and will definitely be buying more.
