There are hundreds of reviews on this shoe and the worse review i saw at the time i purchased was a 3 star so that alone should tell this is a pretty good item. It is super comfortable and gives excellent arch foot support out of the box.As someone with heel spurs, i have always needed a strong shoe with arch support. Even the best Dockers and Hush Puppies i had to buy third party support arches like Dr Scholes. Not necessary with this Clarkes.  It is that good.If you are doubtful because of the price or just think it's too god to be true? Shed the doubt or fear and have a go.Thus far it has stood up to te beating and i do a bit of walking and standing butni have only had it for a few months so put that into perspective. Did i also mention it is quite a good looking shoe?
