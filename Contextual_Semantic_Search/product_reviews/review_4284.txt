I have a size 9 wide foot, high instep, and flat arch, so I ordered these one size up as I do many times when a wide width is not offered.  I loved the black color and the covered toe bed comes up nicely for added protection.  The fit was still a bit snug on the width (but getting better as I keep wearing them) and a bit difficult to insert my foot due to my high instep.  Length wise it was perfect in ordering one size up.They are comfortable for trail walking although a bit of a pain to take on and off if a pebble gets into the shoe from the side openings.  Love the covered toe beds and the shoe is comfortable on the bottom of my foot with just enough arch support but not so much that it bothers or hurts my flat arch.The disappointment comes in that they are slippery on wet boulders, wet tiles, and muddy trails.  We'll see how they hold out as I see several persons on here have complained of poor quality and stitching.
