I do a lot of brisk walking, usually from 4 to 5 miles a day.  For that kind of walking I use a more athletic, cushioned and flexible style of shoe than this one.  I bought this shoe for occasions where I wanted a shoe that looked better but would be comfortable walking up to two miles. It fits that bill but I wouldn't recommend it for longer walks.  It is too "stiff" for that.
