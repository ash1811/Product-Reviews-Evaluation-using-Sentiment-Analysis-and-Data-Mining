I ordered a pair of the mini Ugg boots, and was not happy with the quality of the FAKE leather (I left a review there too). I've had several pairs of Bearpaws, so I decided to order these, which are similar to the Classic Mini Uggs, but with the buttons on the side. These are ADORABLE and super comfey, and the leather is definitely not going to leak as the Ugg boots seem like they will. Can't beat the price difference either, $135 vs $45, hello!I'm officially a BEARPAW for life!
