Tried out thigh high -- and now prefer them to panty hose -- comfortable, and they stay up.  Was concerned they might &#34;slide down&#34; as the day progressed -- but well-made band keeps them in place without and pinching....don't notice the band after  putting them on.Like the ability to only have to throw away &#34;one&#34; of the pair if you get a run....and can easily mix with other packages of same color as color quality consistent.At first, was concerned about price (more costly than panty hose) -- but fit, feel, and durability make up for this.  Would recommend product, quality, style, and vendor.
