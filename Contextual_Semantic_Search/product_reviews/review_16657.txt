Suggested retail price is $99? Ok that is way too much in my opinion. I tried these on; and ordered them a half size bigger. Great: didn't walk out of my ankles. Odd: toes hit top of shoes. Another odd thing is that they have light fur inside of them; how can you wear a barefoot shoe with fur? Would imagine they would be warm..so I sent back. Gave to daughter in next town to drop off, then another of my 3 kids saw them on here and wanted them. So first pair was out the door and had to order all over again!  Sheesh, goofy us! She has different feet than I do; so we will see how they fit her and how she likes them...the price was certainly right!  So I will recommend for: quality construction, nice ankles-not too wide, and the odd look of them! At this price point, if they don't fit her I will donate to the church rummage sale!!
