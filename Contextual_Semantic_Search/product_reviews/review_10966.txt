I just ordered this hat yesterday and from the reviews I have no idea if this hat runs big or small. I never start a review  before a delivery, but I will find out the truth in 1-2 weeks (that's my delivery window). All my existing hats are a size large and they measure 22 1/2 inches. If the sizing chart is correct, that puts me between the med. and a large size and this hat should be the perfect example of whether they do in fact run small or large!  At this point I have given Henschel the benefit of the doubt and given them 5 stars and - fits as expected. It's going to be interesting to see if any of that changes. I HATE TO HAVE TO RETURN ANYTHING AT MY EXPENSE. I Will update-stay tuned! -THE VERDICT IS IN! The size large is a perfect fit for my coconut! I was between a med. and large and I went with the large size and it is just slightly loose so I would say the sizing is right on. It took 9 days to receive and I love the hat! My "ONLY" complaint is that they did a great job of double boxing the hat for delivery protection, but whoever packed the hat needlessly "Jammed" way too much course packing paper into the hat box and smashed the hat into the bottom of the box to make room for the packing paper. What a joke! For that reason only I deduct 1 star from my original 5 stars. I hope this review helps someone else!
