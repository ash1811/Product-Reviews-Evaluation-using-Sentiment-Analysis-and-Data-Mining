The difference between this model and the lighterFruit of the Loom Men's 4 pack crew T-Shirtsthat Fruit of the Loom offers is like night and day. I am not knocking the lighter weight model, but these are beefier and, well, actually luxurious against my skin.What I love is the tagless design, which adds to the comfort. The colors are vivid  and stay that way. I usually purchase mine locally and have some of these that have gone through thirty wash cycles and they almost zero fade. Another thing I love is the relatively thick cotton fabric. Compared to the lighter ones I mentioned, these are noticeably heavier, but still breathe on hot, humid days. I wear this model both as an outer shirt, and as an under shirt, and it works well in both scenarios.Stitching, and seams are strong and straight, so the workmanship is solid. Although they are pre-shrunk I recommend ordering the next size up if you are borderline between sizes. Also, after ten or so wash cycles the inside printed label fades to the point that you have to look at the seams to determine if they are right side out or not. Other than those minor issues these are a real value and exceptionally well made.
