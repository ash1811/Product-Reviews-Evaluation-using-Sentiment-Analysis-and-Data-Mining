The toe post is not stiff or thick. The straps are fully padded so they feel soft.  I have a moderately narrow medium width foot and the straps are perfect.  The yoga mat bottoms conform to your foot and give cushion, support, and a pretty good arch support.  One can walk in them all day without getting aching in the arch or other foot areas as happens with flat hard bottom flip flops.  I am pretty much in love with these shoes.
