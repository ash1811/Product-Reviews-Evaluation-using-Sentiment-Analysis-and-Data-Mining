Classic brown dress shoes are becoming increasingly hard to find (as well as mens' brown pants--khaki yes, brown no).  Thank heavens Rockport carries traditional styles in many colors--just one reason the company has so many loyal customers.  These shoes are well-made, comfortable and look nice.  Everything you could want in a shoe.UPDATE:  Two months after buying these shoes, the rubber sole on one shoe (in toe area) separated from the leather.  We returned them to Rockport, and they are replacing them at no charge.  The whole process took several weeks.  Rockport makes a determination whether to replace--that takes about a week, and shipping out takes about another week.  We were disappointed the shoe split, but we also appreciate a company that stands behind its product.
