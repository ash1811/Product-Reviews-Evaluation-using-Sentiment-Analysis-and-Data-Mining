So, I got these because for YEARS i've spent hundreds of dollars on sunglasses, they always wear out and start to break after 13 months.  These were a &#34;recommended for you&#34; offer, on Amazon, and many of my friends like them, so I figured i'll try them.I opened the box, the inner box itself (the Ray ban box that the actual glasses were in) was torn to shreds so the glasses fell out and i stepped on it, oops. But it was fine, they were in a case, but the fact they were fine blew me away. They fit really well, they look great, and they seem strong, I'm really happy Amazon turned me onto these.
