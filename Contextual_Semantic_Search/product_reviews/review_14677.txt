These are so very cute, but they were huge. I think my daughter's normal size 6 in UGG boots did not translate with slippers. Other than the sizing though, these are terrific shoes, comfortable and great with jeans. I had to return them because of the sizing and she said not to reorder in the smaller size as she'd rather have tall boots. I have nothing negative to say about this product and shipping was fast, well packaged and on time.
