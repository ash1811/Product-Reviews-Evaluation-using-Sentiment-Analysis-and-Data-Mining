Levi's 505 jeans have been my go-to work pants for about the past 20 years.  I could go to any store, and pick up a pair with the 505 label, waist 33, and length 32, and have them fit just like every other pair I own.  However, Levi has decided to re-shape these, but to retain the same 505 label.  They are now designed for the teenage boy, twenty-something market.  They sit uncomfortably low, on the hips rather than at the waist. They are tighter in the crotch. I suppose boys want to show off their &#34;package.&#34;  I've spent the past year or so trying to find something to replace to old 505's, but with only limited success. These are no longer your father's jeans.  Too bad for me that I'm still your father.
