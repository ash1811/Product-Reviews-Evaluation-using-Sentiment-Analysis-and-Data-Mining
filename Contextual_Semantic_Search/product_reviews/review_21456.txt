I love these pants! I take a size medium and they fit perfectly! I love the ties at the bottom and top (you may want to cut them and use a lighter/flame to melt the ends to keep them from fraying - BE CAREFUL and DON'T do that while you are wearing them). There are no belt loops but the top ties can be tied tight enough not to bind but enough to hold a heavier belt clip cell phone/case. I do that all the time. There are lots of pockets so you can put a phone in one of those instead, if you prefer. The pants are low-rise and thus do not bind the waist. They are also quite rugged, don't fade in the wash, and don't shrink. The material is medium weight so if you live in cold weather areas, you may want to wear long johns underneath in weather below 40 - 45 deg. F. They may be too warm in weather 75 or above. These are great for doing outdoors activities, working around the house or car, or just going out shopping or errands.
