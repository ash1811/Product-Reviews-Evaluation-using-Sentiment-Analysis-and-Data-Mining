I do like theses shoes and I have gotten compliments while wearing them. The reason I gave them only four stars was because they are a slightly larger compared to regular low cut canvas converse mainly in volume not length.  The tongue does not stay in place. It tends to slide to the side a little exposing a bit if your sock at some point during wear, but nothing terrible.
