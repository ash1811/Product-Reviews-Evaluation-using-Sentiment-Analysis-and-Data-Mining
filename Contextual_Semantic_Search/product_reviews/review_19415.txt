I got 2 of these in the chestnut and espresso colors and they're gorgeous. I'm a true size 8 w/ narrow feet and every ugg that I have (including sandals) I always get my regular 8 and they always fit and the same applied to these. They were snug at first but not to the point of discomfort. When I got them I wore each of them for an hour or two in the house (bought them to wear outdoors) and then I sprayed them w/ the ugg stain repellent/waterproof spray and let them dry. The spray erased the snugness after drying for the recommended 24 hours.
