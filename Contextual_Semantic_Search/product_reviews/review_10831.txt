These are the best pair of shoes that a man can get. I am so sure that after my 1st pair I bought 10 more pairs of these shoes, so far I am on my 4th pair and I have 7 more of them stocked-up in the closet. The size is very accurate - I usually had problems with correct sizing but with these shoes the problem is gone, I wear 13D. But the most important feature of these shoes is the comfort, I wear these shoes 10 per workday on average and my feet never feel tired and I never had blisters on the back of the heels with the Prescott shoes, they feel pretty much like slippers. My Adidas rubber-gel slides that I wear at home weight more than these ones. Sometimes I have to walk far, for long distances and even run so these shoes are a blessing. I wouldn't change these shoes for any other brand or model of shoes out there because these shoes were proven to me by years of wear, even in the rain or snow (I don't reccomend wearing them in snow, but I work in the city). I just hope that Bostonian would not discontinue and keep on making them.
