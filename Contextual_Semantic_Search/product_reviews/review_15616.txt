I got this for my 3 year old Star Wars obsessed son. He loves it and it's super cute.  The outfit is a felt like material with the brown vest attached under the off white robe. The ears are floppy and do not stand up like in the picture but I don't feel that takes away from the costume. He's 38 inches tall and it is the perfect length.
