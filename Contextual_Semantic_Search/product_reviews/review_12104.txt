I purchased the Cordovan. Walked about 30 ft around the house and the leather/finish where your feet bend already showed signs of extensive wear/cracking. This is not the normal breaking-in wear. I own other Dockers shoes and this never happened to them. The order was returned to Amazon as defective.
