i had some converse and long story short i drew on them and they got messed up so i got a new pare and these are perfect. fit good. and these are mens. ok so these shoes say mens five but really they are a womens 7 i think or 7 and a half! so just go on google and search what your size is in mens and you can get the mens ones too. they are exactly the same as the womens so ya! i hope this helped
