I got these in the tortoiseshell color and like them a lot. They are just a wee bit tight on the sides of my head, but I have a large head and this is always an issue, which is an easy fix with the adjustment machine at my optometrist's office. They are probably fine for 99% of the population in that regard. I like that they are large enough to block a lot of light. They are definitely a bargain and the seller was very fast shipping them.
