Far better than the Carhartt. as  have both.  The Riggs' material is softer than Carhartt's, comes out of the dryer ready to wear, where the Carhartt has a very wrinkled collar and the Riggs pocket has a nice leather tab for clipping an ink pen to and not allowing the shirt pocket to gather up.The only thing the Carhartt shirts are better at is their large color selection.
