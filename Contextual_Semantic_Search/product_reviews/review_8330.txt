I had to remove three watch band links to reduce the band size enough: In the, "16 PCS Watch Tool Kit", http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000T9VK56/ref=pe_175190_21431760_M3T1_ST1_dp_1, the blue plastic fixture is used to push the watchband pins out(and in) so you can take band links out. The pins in the band are like cotter pins.  They look like tiny screws when looking at the band, but they are not.  You push the pins out of the band by screwing the blue fixture pin into the side of the band pin that DOES NOT look like a screw slot - so that the slotted end of the band pin pops out of the band.  Then you can just pull the band pin out with your fingers.  It does NOT take a lot of force when pushing the these pins(or you're doing it wrong).You fine tune the band size by positioning which pair of the four pairs of holes you put what could be called the "end of band" pin.  That band part that has "INVICTA" on it has the four pairs of holes.  This pin is spring loaded on both ends.  I was able to push one end at a time in and move that end off a hole; then do the other end and relocate which pair of holes is used by nudging the pin/chain a bit.  It is about 1/8" between hole pairs.  It will be clearer when you start fiddling with it.Be careful not to lose either type of pin.  All I did was work over a table and be careful.  You don't want to lose a pin in a carpet!  The end-of-band pin is very easy to lose as it can go boyng to never never land on either internal spring.  Don't force anything. It might take a little bit of fingertip type force in working with the end-of-band pin.
