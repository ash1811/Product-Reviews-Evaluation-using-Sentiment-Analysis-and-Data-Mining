There is no question that Invicta has really been known for the distinction and the knowledge of watches for the horologists ( watch collectors) in any one of us. But they have also been known so much for the over-sized timepieces as well., and the classic distinction in their automatic watches. The Pro Diver Automatic watches for men is no doubt, a class act. They are simple and easy to operate, simple to read at night with the excellent illumination on the hands. My one gripe about the watch is the unidirectional bezel can sometimes stick and lose than appeal, especially if you want to tell time while diving, or elapsed time for your personal deeds. This has good water resistance and easy to protect screw-down crown that works on the watch nicely. This is a great timepiece from Invicta. I like the watch, and it handles well for its money.Price: BSetup & Comfort: B-Overall: B 1/2-
