This T-Shirt I found last week in my local store and bought two in white (size Small). This is a very comfortable T-Shirt. Super high quality. Since this T-Shirt has exceeded my expectations, I recommend this to you for the following reasons:1) It washes and dries with no shrinkage (as far as I could tell). Because I have kind of itchy skin, when I purchase new clothing, I always wash it first to get the sizing etc out of the fabric.  For washing this I used Tide Gentle Detergent and washed in warm water. (This made the T-Shirt soft with no perfumes or dyes as they sometimes regular detergents make my skin itch). The dryer - I dried this for 30 minutes on regular.Result is a great and ready to wear T-Shirt after I washed it.2) True to size - Noticed that others said that this T-Shirt runs a little small and short. For me, I found it true to size as I am short at 5 foot 3 and wear a small size. This T-shirt fits me well and it is not too long, not too small - in fact, it fits me somewhat loose because I like some wiggle room in clothes so I can move in comfort).3) Not too thick or too thin - This T-Shirt can be worn year round--In summer I plan to wear it as a regular T-Shirt. In fall and winter, it will be worn under my sweater or hoodie. This is a perfect weight/year round T-Shirt!4) Soft and So Comfortable - I like soft but not limp so this T-Shirt is soft but not limpy soft, this way, it is a stronger and more durable T-Shirt than a super soft one is. This is a comfortable T-Shirt that is not too tight or too loose.5) Price and Value - This is the best price and value I have found, the white ones are found in most stores (I bought white). However, I like this line of T-Shirts so much, I plan on ordering more on Amazon in different colors.***If you are looking for a great quality T-Shirt at a great price, this is the T-Shirt to buy!
