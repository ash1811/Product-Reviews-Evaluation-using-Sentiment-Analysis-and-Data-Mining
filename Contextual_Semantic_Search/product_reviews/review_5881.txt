I would imagine anything made of 100% cotton is liable to shrink, common sense will tell you that.  To reduce shrinkage, wash in cold water only and dry at lowest heat setting in your dryer, better yet, dry outdoors on a clothes line.  I have to wear the black colored ones for work and so far after multiple washing, no fade in the color.I take size Medium and when I bought them they looked awfully big, but after the first washing, they fit perfectly.  I do think Hanes allows for the shrinkage.Highly Recommended
