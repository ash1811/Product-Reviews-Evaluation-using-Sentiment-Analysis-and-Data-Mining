I bought my husband this watch to replace his less expensive but similar looking Invicta Pro Diver (which stopped working one day after my husband accidentally hit the watch against the wall and the spring inside it got messed up; the watch repair shop guy was amazed because the Invicta watches rarely break). My husband is extremely tough on watches!! He hasn't taken the Citizen watch off for over a year. It looks good and he hasn't broken it yet. The band did have the numbers rub off, the crystal has some minor scratches, and the plastic watch keeper pieces both broke off. We're replacing the band with a Zulu style one because the replacement bands for this particular watch are around $50 (thus the 4 star rating instead of 5 stars).This watch will hold up even with hard use. Best option for the price!
