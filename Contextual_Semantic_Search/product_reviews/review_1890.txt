I got these as a daily deal, and I'm so glad that I did. Even though I had to wait a couple months, they are worth it. The price is fantastic, (even the regularly listed price), for a very nice cut, vibrantly green and well matched stone. The setting is sturdy, and ranks right up there with very expensive jewelers. Simply a can't miss earring!
