I bought the yellow lense version and they are great for biking at dusk and they fit my big fat head nicely. The lenses however are quite large . . . too large, in my opinion.  Other than that, they seem pretty sturdy and the clarity it great.  These would also be great for driving but get the dark lenses for bright sunshine protection.
