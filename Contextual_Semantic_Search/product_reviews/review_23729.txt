Fabric is pretty nice and seems like it would last through many washes. However, the cut and fit does not look right.  It is more of a boyish cut. I ordered an x-small, which fits around the waste and bust right. But the shoulders are bit wide. Comparing this to another Dickies top I bought (different style), the cut of the shoulders are extended past the natural line, which gives you a linebacker look. It's priced right and the color is a lovely purple, but I can't overlook the fact that I look like a football player when I wear this.
