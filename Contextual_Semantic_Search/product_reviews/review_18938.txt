Order this watch for my 7 years old son to replace the expensive POS I got from Macy's! He really love this watch. The elastic band is comfortable according from my son, and he has a small waist. the only complain from him are these 4 side buttons, they are hard to press to make selection. other than that, he is happy and I am happy.
