I've always had a problem with my bra straps slipping off my shoulders.  This has solved that problem.  The only thing that you need to do is make sure your bra is hooked and step into it pulling it up from the bottom.  Once up the straps will straighten out.  It's so nice not having to spend the day pulling up my bra straps.
