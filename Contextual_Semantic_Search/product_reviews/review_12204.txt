I wear size 10 or 10.5 and these fit me perfectly.  My last pair lasted me 2 years of very regular wear before wearing holes in the soles, so I picked up another pair.  I live in Southern California and wear these every day.  They needed a week or 2 to get sufficiently broken in, but now are super comfortable, just like my old pair.
