Got these for my birthday.  They are very true to size and roomy enough for a pair of warm socks.  I would order your shoe size.  I have only had them for a month but they are my best friends, especially in the morning when I have to walk outside to get the paper.  I would recommend these to anyone who wants more than a fleecy sock-type slipper.
