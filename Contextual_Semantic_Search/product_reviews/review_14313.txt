I just got these and haven't had a chance to wear them.  They are seemingly very well made and the dickies I had in the past lasted for a long time so these should too.  Where I work I go thru allot of jeans.  I have been buying the cheap ones from the chain stores and they don't last at all.  If you work hard you need something that will last
