Skechers are  my favorite shoes, especially these Premium Sneakers!! I always use this style as my go to shoe for when I want to make sure my feet are comfy!! I have ordered and worn several pair of this style over the years. I have &#34;flat feet&#34; and these shoes accomodate my orthotics very well. The shoe has a lot of cushioning as you walk. One great shoe! You can't beat Skechers brand!!
