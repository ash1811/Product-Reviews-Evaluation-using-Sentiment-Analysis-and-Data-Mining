My nieces really loved these.  They are very cute and the music is actually really nice to listen to.  They loved winding the back and watching the horse spin.  They aren't all that sturdy, but it's a very pretty music box with lots of secret compartments for girls.  One thing, watch out for the little door knobs.  When mine came in one was unscrewed and in the box.  So you might want to check the box before giving it as a gift.
