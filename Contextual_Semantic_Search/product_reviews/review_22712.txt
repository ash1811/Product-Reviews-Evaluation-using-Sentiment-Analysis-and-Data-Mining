This was a gift for my boyfriend last Christmas, to replace another chain he was using of some random metal that would sometimes color his neck orange (boys are weird sometimes, I would've thrown it out the first time it happened). Anywho, he loved this gift and wears it everyday. I love that it doesn't make his neck smell funky or turn his skin colors. It also looks really good and is well made. Another plus is it's made in Italy, and he's Italian so he thought that was cool. Highly recommend!
