My Mom asked me for some wool socks that were thin, went at least crew length, and mens sizes would be fine. With that I found these Gold Toe socks. When she put one on to try at Christmas she was very surprised to find they go above the calf and were very soft. They were thin as she asked and she said they felt very warm. I recommend these to those women who find that womens socks tend to be too small.
