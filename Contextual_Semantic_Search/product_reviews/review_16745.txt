Of all the companies that you would think would manufacture their products in the USA, it would have been Wrangler. I was shock when I saw the label that said &#34;Made in Bangladesh&#34;. You have got to be kidding me! The quality and fit of the jacket was so so. Some of the holes didn't line up to the buttons, and some of the seams were not finished completly. Amazon and Wrangler need to put the country of manufacturing on the site when they sell a product. My bad. Lesson learned.
