I usually only wear sandals or clogs, but it's been so cold lately that I decided I needed some boots. I wear a size 7 1/2 and I was worried about the fit, so I did try on a few different styles in local stores. I was shocked that I needed to go to a 9 in these boots, but there is SO MUCH fleece lining that smaller sizes hurt. I wore them yesterday and my feet stayed toasty-warm and I got quite a few compliments on them!
