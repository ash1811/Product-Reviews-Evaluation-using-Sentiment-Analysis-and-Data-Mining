Okay I love everything Converse. I already had pairs of Converse in sizes that fit me, so sizing wasn't an issue at all, I ordered the size that all my other Converse are, and it fit me well.The green color is just awesome though, lots of people have commented on them. I like Converse in every color, but the greens are probably one of my favorites.If you like Converse All-Stars and you like the color green, then go for it.
