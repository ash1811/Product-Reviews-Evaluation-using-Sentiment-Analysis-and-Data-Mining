I am a 38D in all bras, Victoria Secret, Playtex, Beyond Bare, but this one is way tooooooo tight.  The cups are also a little too small, and yes, as another reviewer mentioned, I also feel like I looked like torpedo chest too.  I would not recommend. I love Playtex bras but they made a mistake with this one.
