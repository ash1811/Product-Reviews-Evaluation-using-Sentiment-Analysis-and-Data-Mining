First off, my black lab ate my slippers, so i purchased a pair of Sorel slippers because these slippers where not available at the time.These slippers (Tamarac) were the most comfortable slippers that I have ever worn with great support on the bottom and warmth on cold nights.They are too hot for summer use.Order a size up if you are a half size.My new Sorel slippers are comfortable, but i liked the Tamarac Cody sheepskin twin gore better.
