I ordered this bag to replace a smaller, very tattered Jansport bag I got my boyfriend 5 years ago. He is a musician and often goes back and forth from the studio, work and home. This bag fits everything he needs; pedals, cables, laptop, pro headphones, a winter jacket, lunch and more... The zippers hold up very well even though it always seems like bursting. He especially likes the S style straps. Great price from Amazon as well (was $32 when I ordered and elsewhere can be $50+). Would definitely recommend.
