I love these pants I have bought these in 5 different colors. I ordered a second pair of the black, woodland and desert. I wear them all the time.I'm a 34 in the waist and medium fits me snug enough to wear my glock inside the waist with a quick draw clip. Not enough room for my inside the waist holster.
