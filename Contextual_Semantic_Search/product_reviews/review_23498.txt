Boughtt his product to complete a fireman Halloween costume.  It was the right price and actually very durable for the price.  Is has an adjustable plastic band on the inside so the hat can fit even the smallest of heads.  My son has complained that sometimes his hair gets stuck in the band and pulls when he takes the hat off.
