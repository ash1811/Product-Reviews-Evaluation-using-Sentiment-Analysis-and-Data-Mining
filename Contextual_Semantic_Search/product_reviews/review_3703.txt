These jeans are awesome.  I see that there are a lot of negative reviews about how Levi's changed the fit of these jeans (however long ago...), but I wasn't wearing them back then so I cannot speak to that issue.  But from what I can tell there shouldn't be any complaints about fit!  These jeans look great and fit well.  They are also high quality.  What else could you want?  Them to come with money in the pockets?  Well me too but that goes for everything I buy.  Get a pair, you won't regret it!
