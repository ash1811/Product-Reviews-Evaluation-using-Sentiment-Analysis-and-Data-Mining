These flip flops are not the same as the Reef GINGER flip flops I bought a couple years ago and still use.  There is not as much arch support as my old pair and they feel kind of like cheap styrofoam soles.  I'm still going to wear them, but if you are buying these to replace an older pair... they are not the same.  On the positive, they are true to size.  I wear a size 8 and they fit.
