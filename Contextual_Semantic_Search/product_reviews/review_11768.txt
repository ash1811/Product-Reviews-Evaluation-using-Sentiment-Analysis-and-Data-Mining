These moc's are the best I ever had.  The moosehide is buttery soft and the size was perfect. from all the size comments on the reviews I was torn between ordering my usual size and some that said order a half size larger.  I went with the usual size and it worked out well.  They are great for just about wearing anywhere, with or without socks.  made very well and comfortable.
