I bought these because of the inseam was 28&#34; and in fact it seems near that.  I am giving it 4 stars because the dye is super strong, it may take a few washes to get it out, and even then I think if I were to wear them in heavy rain they'd probably bleed on skin, shirt, boxers, ,socks, shoes and anything and everything touching them.  Hopefully after a few washes the ink will be good and solid.
