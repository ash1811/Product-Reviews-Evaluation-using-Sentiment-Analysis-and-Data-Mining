This hoodie is absolutely perfect, epecially at the price that I got it for (which I have noticed has increased). It's so soft and warm and fits a bit baggy on me, which is how I wanted it. I ordered a medium. The head hole however is a tad bit small which makes it a bit difficult to get on and off smoothly, but that isnt a big deal.Overall I love this sweatshirt and I would love to order more.
