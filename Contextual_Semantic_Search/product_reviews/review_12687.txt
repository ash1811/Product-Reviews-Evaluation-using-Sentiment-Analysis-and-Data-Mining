Bought the Playtex Women's 18 Hour Original Comfort Strap Bra, Black, 40D, for a great trooper of the female sex. A fine senior that all of a sudden looked like their you know what had perked up, not necessarily a bad look, and she commented very positively on the fact that they supported her you know, very well. So much, in fact, that I have been instructed to secure at the very least a couple more pairs. Not knowing much about sizes and the endless variations, I was thrilled that some time ago it had been determined through excessive research that this great trooper was size 40D. It worked like a charm, and even though they are pointy for such a respectable senior citizen, they also support the before not supported you know what. Solid 4 Stars.
