I got this a few months ago and was trying to live with it. I have to buy another one I got so sick of this ugly shape and hard nylon material. The opening on the legs cuts in to your legs almost stopping blood flow! There is no way to adjust this, it's not elastic either but something hard and set and feels extremely uncomfortable. Generally, it's badly cut, badly designed, ugly and shapeless on the body, it sits on your like some kind of plastic bag you pulled over your privates. Avoid this like a plague.
