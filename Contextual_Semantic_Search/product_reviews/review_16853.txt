These panties are very comfortable and fit well.  They have that "barely there" feeling.  I'm 7 months pregnant and bought these to wear during the last trimester and also post-partum.  My only issue is they are indeed thin, which makes them more comfortable, but I would like the crotch and stitching in the crotch area to be a little thicker.
