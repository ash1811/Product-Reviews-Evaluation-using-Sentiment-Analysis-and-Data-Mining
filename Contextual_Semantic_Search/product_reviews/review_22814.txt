Overall these tevas are very comfortable.  Tevas are always well made, and the sole is very cushy.  The only problem I had is with the straps when I first started wearing them.  After wearing all day, because the straps are made of a braided nylon/plastic fabric, the tops of my feet and around the tops of my big toes were a little sensitive, but I did not get blisters.  After wearing several times, it feels like I've broken them in and no longer run into this problem. Just as comfortable as reefs, and I think more so than havaianas.
