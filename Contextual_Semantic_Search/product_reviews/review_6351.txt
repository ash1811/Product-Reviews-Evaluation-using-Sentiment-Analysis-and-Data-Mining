I bought 3 of these sweatshirts and love them all. They are a great quality and warm and soft and cozy.  They have a reasonable price and fit nicely.  I am a female and I bought a small and they fit comfortable. I normally wear a medium in sweaters and shirts but thought since this is more of a man's sweatshirt  I would try the small.  I must admit if I was a store, I would of tried the medium just to check.  But I am pleased with this purchase.  Shipped quickly.
