This bra is ok. I ordered a 40DDD and I believe that is my correct size. The bra fits, but lacks comfort. The underwire molded cup design is not meant for all day wear. It looks great under t shirts though. It's difficult to find bras that fit in store. I had this bra some years ago in a too small size, but always loved the way it lifted and minimized. I wouldn't have purchased it if i would have known that it lacks comfort. Overall a good quality bra, but not comfortable. I recommend the Playtex 4049 instead. It looks great under t-shirts and is very comfortable.
