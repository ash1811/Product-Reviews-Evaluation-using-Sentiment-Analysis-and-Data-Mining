Such a cute costume!  It seems very well made, and has held up well to my daughter running around the house in it saving the day.  I love that the cape attaches on the shoulders via velcro, much better than the around-the-neck cape on my son's costume, which irritates his neck.  This costume also came with cute accessories, including the shiny boot toppers and the gold belt. The top is also a very soft velvet-like material, with little gold bands at the sleeve. A great pick, we're very happy with it!
