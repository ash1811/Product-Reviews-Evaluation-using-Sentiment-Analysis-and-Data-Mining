So if you are among the overly blessed like myself (34DDD) then you will find that most pretty bras are just not for you. I like this one and even though I ordered the correct size I found myself sort of spilling out of the top ever so often, and really really spilling if I bent over at all. Just becareful maybe order a cup size larger for this particular design?
