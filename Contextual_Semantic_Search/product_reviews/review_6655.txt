It said to order a size up, so I did, and the size 10 fits as a size 9, perfect. I'm not a dancer, but I wanted a simple nude heel and I thought &#34;Dancers would want comfortable shoes right!?&#34; I was right! They are wonderfully comfortable! I was quite surprised. The only thing is I might have a cobbler add a layer of rubber to the bottom, not really any shock absorption, but that's not a complaint, you can tell from the picture there isn't a whole lot to the sole.
