FOR ME, THIS IS THE ONLY BRA THAT'S COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO WEAR ALL DAY EVEN THOUGH IT HAS UNDERWIRES.  I HAVE BEEN WEARING PLAYTEX BRAS FOR MANY, MANY YEARS AND OVER TIME, THE QUALITY OF THEIR BRAS HAS PLUNGED (NO PUN INTENDED) DRASTICALLY.  THIS IS A NEW MODEL FOR ME AND I WANT TO SEE HOW LONG IT TAKES BEFORE THE WIRES POKE THROUGH AS THAT IS WHAT USUALLY HAPPENS TO THEIR UNDERWIRE BRAS THAT I HAVE OWNED.  ON THIS MODEL - THE LACE ON THE TOP PART IS TOO STRETCHY AND SHOULD BE OF THICKER QUALITY.  BUT AS I SAID - PLAYTEX PRODUCTS ARE NO LONGER WHAT THEY ONCE WERE IN MY OPINION.  I PICKED THIS ONE OUT FOR COMFORT FIRST, THEN SUPPORT.
