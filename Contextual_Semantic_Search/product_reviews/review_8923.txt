This bra might have been nice if I was able to use it. 36 D is the smallest I've found rib size. I find that 36 is still too large around the ribs, but the cups fit. I was excited to find an inexpensive bra with 34 size! Unfortunately this bra fit way too tightly, more like a 32?. Plus, as other reviews reported, it does not fold down very far for nursing. It might work for pumping only. Maybe it will fit better after some baby weight starts to drop off, being that it has only been a few weeks
