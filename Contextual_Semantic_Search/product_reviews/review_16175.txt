Got these for my husband because it is so cold in the building he works in in the winter. He said they were fine but he wouldn't consider them heavy weight. We live in Michigan and have horses so for that he needs a really serious pair of thermals. This wouldn't be the ones he would want for that. But did just fine for what he needed them for in his workplace.Kathy
