So, unlike the majority of the women who bought this product, I'm very small busted and petite. But I wanted to try out the awesome support of longline bras, since everyone used to wear them, right? I buy a lot of vintage clothes and women had some tiny waists. Normally I wear a 30C, so I bought the smallest size - 34B. When I received the bra, I tried it on and it fit everywhere except for the cup, which was great. So I unpicked the bra cup and re-sewed it to fit my breasts exactly. It took a few tries, but I managed to tailor the bra to fit me. I wore it out on a trial run, and realized that I needed the &#34;band&#34; to be a little tighter. I added darts to the sides of the chest to make it fit better. I think, over all, it was a successful experiment for me.
