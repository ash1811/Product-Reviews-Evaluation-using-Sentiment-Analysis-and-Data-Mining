I was looking for a small travel bag that I could use for my tobacco pipe when out and about, this was a great choice! As a note, I have the older bag (second product image) not the newer one with the front that opens.DESIGN/QUALITYThis is VERY well made, using only the best quality materials. In over 2 years of use, the velcro is still very strong, the seams have not come loose and the strap is still...well...strapping.UTILITYThis pouch is surprisingly useful, not just for my original intent but also for camping, hiking, computer repair and a million other things. I love throwing it in my carry-on with all of my important documents in to keep them all in one place!WHY 4 STARS??- Good for the price (+)- Very good quality - no wear after two years!!! (+)- Extremely utilitarian! (+)- The older design (which I have) does not have all of the pockets of the newer one (-)OVERALLThis is definitely a helpful bag, and the olive drab color means it's very masculine. The longevity of this product has really impressed me, especially considering the low price I paid. Recommended.Feedback welcomed - if you didn't find this review helpful I would love to know why so I can continue to grow as a reviewer!
