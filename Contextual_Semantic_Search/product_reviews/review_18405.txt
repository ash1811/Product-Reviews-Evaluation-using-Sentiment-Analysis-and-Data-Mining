My son got this for Christmas.  It is s a nice wooden box that contains a treasure trove of pirate goodies.  There is a hidden panel in the bottom of the box for special treasures. It is good quality.  The only thing I would change is that the coins are very plastic looking and not shiny gold like my little pirate wishes they were.
