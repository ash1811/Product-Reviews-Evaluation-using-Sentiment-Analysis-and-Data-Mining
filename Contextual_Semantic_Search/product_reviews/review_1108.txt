I've been wearing these for over 15 years and love them!  They are cool, comfortable, cute and sexy at the same time AND they last a long time.  Although I'm a size 4, I have a "full caboose" and these accommodate that very well.  One of the other things I just can't stand is when the bottom rides up (like those boy shorts)in the rear and these don't do that with me.
