i'm a new mom and thought that the only swim diapers out there were disposable.  i was cautiously excited to find this one, and so far it's great!  i will update if i have any problems with it after more use.  (we also haven't had a poop in it yet, so i can't speak to that!)  i ordered the 12 month size for my bigger than average 8.5 month old, and it's a little baggy but still fits tightly around the legs where it matters (not too tightly, but just right).  it also still fits underneath his one-piece swimsuit so that's fine by me.  i think he'll be able to wear it through the summer, which was my plan.  it takes awhile to dry due to all the padding, so i might need to throw it in the dryer at times, but otherwise i have no complaints.
