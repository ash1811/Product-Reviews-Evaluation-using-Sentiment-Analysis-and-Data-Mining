Nice looking boot for day hikes or around town or travel; with jeans or khakis. Light weight but still feel sturdy and durable. Good tread, toe kick, sole seem able to handle pavement or trails. Have worn in damp conditions but can't yet verify if really waterproof in puddles and streams or how well it lasts. Sizing seems true with medium/heavy socks. Reasonably comfy out of the box. Only negative is a bit of a bulge in leather on one boot, slight but noticeable.
