After all the great reviews I couldn't wait to get a pair.  I have actually never given a product less then 4 stars because I try to be nice, but honestly these are horrible.  The fit is terrible and the look is so cheap, it would be embarassing to be seen wearing these. They wobbled on my foot.  I am size 5 1/2 to size 6 depending on the the cut of the shoe.  I got these in a six and the only reason I could get them on was because my foot is on the narrow side, but the back of my heel hung out a bit with thin sock.  It was nearly impossible to adjust the cheap shinny plastic buckle for my instep. If you are used quality shoes like Dansko or Clark's, don't even bother to order.  I kid you not, that these look like cheap plastic shoes purchased from the Dollar Store.  For the price (though not expensive) you can do a lot better.
