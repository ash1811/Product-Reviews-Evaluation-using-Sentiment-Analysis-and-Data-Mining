I'm a cheapskate, so I was pretty excited to find that some colors of this were available for around $6.  I bought two brown and two orange and they've held up very well for more than six months of regular wear.  Very comfortable weight, and no pilling or holes so far.Orange isn't nearly as ugly as everyone will tell you.  Give it a try!
