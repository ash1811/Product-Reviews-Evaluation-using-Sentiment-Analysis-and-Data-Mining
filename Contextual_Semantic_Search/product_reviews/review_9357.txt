These are nice stretchy pants, perfectly lightweight for summer; they are excellent for running around the house with my two infants. HOWEVER, these do run small. I am 5'10'', 155 lbs and ordered L and they are on the tight side. I am hoping to shed some baby weight soon so they will hopefully fit better, but XL would probably have been a better fit. FYI, I am now M in a brand like Champion.
