This a perfect camo shirt. Although it is Smokey Branch, it is still green. I bought an XXL since XLs that I had in the military would barely fit in arm length. This XXL shirt is a little too big but I can deal with it. I have many patches to put on this shirt. I plan on wearing it around the house in the winter time.This is a good quality shirt and I am very happy with it.
