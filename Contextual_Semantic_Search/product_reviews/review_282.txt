Maybe I should have exchanged them for a bigger size, but when I tried them on they fit fine.  They were perfect in the length so I thought the sizing was ok.  But after an hour my toes feel pinched and hurt. They look super cute but it is really hard to wear them for any period of time.  My feet are not wide by any means, so it was disappointing to have this issue.
