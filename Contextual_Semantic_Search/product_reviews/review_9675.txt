I had to give it away. Although I do wear a medium, this gown was VERY VERY large and so I had to give it to a 150 lb woman..someone who is 5ft 3in tall, and weighs 125 lbs and wears normal medium would not be able to wear..it fell off me.So, just be careful when you buy. It was beautiful though...I have ordered before and had only one other I could not wear..it was so small I had to donate it as my twelve year old grand daughter was too young to wear it.
