These have 9 heavy duty belt loops. The size and length are accurate. The material is a little stiff - towards canvas - only washed once tho. Very little shrinkage. Not as soft as old blue jeans, but feels armored. Much more rugged. I am buying another pair - different color.UPDATE: Its been 3 months since I bought the Jeans and the zipper broke. I wasn't even wearing them at the time. In hand, I tried to unzip all the way down and it was hung-up. Zipper teeth section pulled right out. Very disappointing.
