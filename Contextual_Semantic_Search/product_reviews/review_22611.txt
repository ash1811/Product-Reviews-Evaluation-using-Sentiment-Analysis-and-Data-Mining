this watch, very simple, just time, the mobil crown for help timing, and the day display, is more than enough if you are looking for a watch of a good size, accurate, no battery changes (excellent, so the pressure inside is optimal).I have used in two different continents and, besides change the time (of course, it was not going to do it automatically), the watch is excellent.I have used with casual and formal clothes and it is look very good (sporty of course).And overall, excellent watch for a good price.if you are looking for a sport, dive watch, and casual wear, don't look other way, this is what you are looking for.
