Never really a fan of jeans as I prefer the more standard khaki pants which I wear on regularly for work. These jeans however changed my perception and definitely feels as though they are made to last a lifetime as the materials used are quality to the touch and even the stitches used are of a high quality. Would definitely recommend these to people who appreciate a good quality jean.
