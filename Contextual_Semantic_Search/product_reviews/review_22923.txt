I took a pair of brown shoes in to a repair shop who said he polishes shoes for ten dollars.  When I got them back, they looked actually worse than when I dropped them off...  I decided to take the task on myself.Having never attempted to polish shoes before, I had to get online to figure out instructions... but about an hour later, I had those brown shoes looking very very good- all thanks to this polish.I am sure that there are others out there that are better polishers than I am - and they are probably using this stuff too.
