Wow!  These flip flops are definitely the best I've ever owned.  I've been suffering with plantar faciitis for a few months and was told by a friend that these give your feet really great support.  Well, she wasn't kidding!  My condition has improved dramatically because of the support that these flip flops give.  I slip them on immediately upon rising in the morning and alternate between them and sneakers.  I've noticed a tremendous improvement and will definitely buy them in more colors.  They are also very reasonably priced.
