These pants come so close to being perfect! The fit and color were accurate and true to amazon's descriptions. They are stiff at first, almost like wearing a new burlap bag. A few washes later and they're getting much better. If you leave them in the dryer they will dry pretty wrinkled and in the wrinkle's creases it leaves faint white marks. I have no idea what these are, but they are unsightly. They also come with a slight boot cut which makes them fit perfectly until it gets to the knee, they it looks baggy. My biggest complaint is lack of security in the pockets. Aren't these suppose to be for rugged carpenters and outdoorsmens? None of the pockets have any buttons or even velcro. I spend a nervous day in downtown New York City constantly feeling my pockets to make sure my wallet and phone hadn't slipped out. Other than that, I love them. They are constructed like Fort Knox. The crotch definitely isn't going to split anytime soon. I can see these lasting for years.
