This fit a little larger than I expected, but now I consider that a blessing!  He has suddenly been growing out of some items marked for 3 months, but these are still a nice fit & won't be tight for a while yet!  They wash well & he seems quite comfortable in them - I love the softness of the cotton.  Very pleased!
