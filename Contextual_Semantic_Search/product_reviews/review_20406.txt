These are the greatest pajamas I've ever owned. Waited to see if I was going to like them a month later,I do! I ordered the blue ones for me and my daughter, she loves hers too.Then I ordered them in black.To get black I had to order thermal in the plus size.I wear 16-18and the xlarge fit perfect, changing to the plus size only made them fit better. The only difference is about 1inch more space in the chest area.perfect pj's, love them,
