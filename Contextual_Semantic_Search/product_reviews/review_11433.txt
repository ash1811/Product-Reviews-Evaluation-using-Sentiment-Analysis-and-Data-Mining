I am 5'3" and about 160 lbs. I was measured at a lingerie store and told I should wear an XL in the flexees waistnipper #6868. I wore it for a couple of hours and while yes it did slim me down a bit it became loose after a couple of hours. It lost it's snug fit within about two hours. I will be trying one that has the extra rows of hooks where I can tighten/loosen it.
