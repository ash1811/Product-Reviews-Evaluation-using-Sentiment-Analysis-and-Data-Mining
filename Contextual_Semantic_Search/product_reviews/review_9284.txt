Just so comfy and easy to slip on!  Warm and half sock/half shoe. Perfect for the winter and snug. A lot of slippers that try to be Isotoner slip off feet but these stay in place without being too tight. Don't be surprised!  The soles are THICK and a bit stiff when they arrive, but soften a lot from wear. I would buy one-half size smaller than my foot in the future.
