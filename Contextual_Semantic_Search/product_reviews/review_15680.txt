This little wonder has been redesigned and no longer has the slip pocket on the back.  They have also made it just a bit smaller both in width and depth so it will not accommodate my passport which has extra pages.  I have been using one of these for years to hold passport, small phone, hand wipes, credit cards, cash, state ID and lip gloss - and it has worked brilliantly - sliding easily under a coat or jacket - for to and from the airport and in flight.  This newer remake won't cut it for my needs. Thank goodness my old one is holding up nicely - I just wanted a back up with contrast light lining.  If you don't need it for a fat passport - or a slightly large phone, maybe it will work for you.  But this one is going back.  Glad Amazon has such great shipping and return policies.
