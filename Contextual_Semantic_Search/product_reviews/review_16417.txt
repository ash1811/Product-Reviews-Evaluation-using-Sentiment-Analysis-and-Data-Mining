Love these shoes - they are allowing me to pursue Zumba and belly dance without having to get a total knee replacement. And I have a white pair for work as well - I am a nurse and deal with surgical patients so there is a lot of twisting and turning involved in my job. These dance sneakers keep me from torquing my knee in all of those situations as well, and help me be the 1st one there whenever the emergency call bell goes off. I do have a history of a false high arch - meaning it is actually flat when I stand up. Plus I've had a Morton's neuroma cut on my right foot. These shoes support my arch, despite the split last, and the toe box allows the splaying that occurs, in my forefoot with each downstep, since the surgery. Hence, duh, 5 stars!
