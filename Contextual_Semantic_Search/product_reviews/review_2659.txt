I was looking at watches with my friend and when she came across this one, I wanted it too. Little did I know she had bought it for me for Christmas!!! :)  You can't beat a Timex! It's a Men's watch and although I am a woman, it looks good on my dainty wrist. Large face watches are still in and this looks really classic, simple and stylish enough for everyday. I had to adjust the band but that was nominal in price. I love the date/day mode as well. The blue face is such a nice color and I think will look great in the summer too! Can't say enough&#8230; it just a great watch, fashionable and a great price! Enjoy!
