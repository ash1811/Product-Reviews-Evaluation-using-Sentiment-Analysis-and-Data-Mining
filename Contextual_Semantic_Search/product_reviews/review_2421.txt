I do not wear knee highs very often but when I do I wear Hanes Silk Reflections Knee Highs.  They are very durable and feel silky on my legs which I love.  They look good and stay in place all day long.  Hanes Silk Reflections Hosiery are my favorite and I have been wearing them for 15 years, so when I do buy knee highs I did not have to think of which brand I would buy.
