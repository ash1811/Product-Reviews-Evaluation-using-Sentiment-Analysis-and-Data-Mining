I LOVE these tees!  I purchase them 3 or 4 sizes too large, and use them as sleep shirts.  Much less expensive than a similar women's sleep shirt, better made, and lots of fun colors.I purchased this in 4 colors, and the total price was about the same as one women's sleep shirt.  They wash well, too.Very happy with this brand, construction, quality, comfort.
