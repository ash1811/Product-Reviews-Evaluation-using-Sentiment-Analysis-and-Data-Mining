I have these in a wide width in three colors. I love them! I have heel spurs on the back of my heels, and these are great for walking with no pressure on the heel. Note, they do not work well at all for me with socks! They are a much better summer shoe than a winter! With socks they slip about, without, they are great. They do not breathe well, and my podiatrist highly recommended using foot powder every single time to avoid fungus. I purchased the superfeet blue shoe insert to go in it, and they work very well together. You can easily fit orthotics in the shoe. It is so easy to change an insert in and out of it.
