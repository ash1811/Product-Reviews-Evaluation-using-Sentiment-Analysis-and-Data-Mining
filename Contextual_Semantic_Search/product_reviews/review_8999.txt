These jeans do not retain their color and after and after one wash they shrunk so tight that I can no longer fit them and have had them less than a month.  I  am very disappointed  and feel like I have wasted nearly $100 dollars on two pair of jeans that are of no use to me,  I don't believe I will order anymore clothing from amazon because the return window has expired and it is too short for something that is mail order.  There is not enough time to see if the item is satisfactory because I tried them on and then did not wear them until 2 1/2 weeks later.  Also, there are never any jeans for the low price that Amazon advertises; they are always  from $46 and up.
