The Keen Venice style is the most comfortable fit for someone with a B width foot. The straps don' t come up as far upon the instep as the other styles of Keens. The shoes give good support and are very comfortable for long walks on surfaces that are not rocky and uneven. Size 8 seem to fit appropriately.  Didn't have to size up.
