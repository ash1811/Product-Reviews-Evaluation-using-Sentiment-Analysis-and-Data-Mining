I read other reviews stating to get a size larger.  This is true.  I am a size 8 shoe, however, I purchased the size 9 sandals. They do run on the smaller size.  I wish there was a little more clearance around my foot (more shoe around my the bottom of my foot), however, they do the job and they look nice.  I guess it all comes down to preference.
