After completly opening the package and extracting the watch (difficult to say the least), I saw the tag on the watch that said "Synthetic Leather".  The Amazon product description says "Leather Strap Watch", but it is NOT a leather strap!  The whole reason I bought this watch instead of others is that it was advertised as leather.  Turns out, I should have gotten a different watch.The watch is very nice-looking, numbers easy to read, functions, and while the pink strap is pretty (and NOT leather), it is just a bit dustier than pictured.If you like the way it looks and you don't care about the leather part, it's a nice watch.
