These type socks are very reasonably priced and shipped quickly. They fit true to size up to just under the knee. They stay up all day. They are very comfortable. They do not pick up lint bad when washing and drying. They help you put on and take off boots yet do not slip on the sole when walking. They last a long time (years) if you start with a new pair for each day of the work week. I recommend to all.
