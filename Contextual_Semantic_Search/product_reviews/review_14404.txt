Happy with the watch. Large display and functions I can definitely utilize in my swimming days to help me count laps. Two time zones. Like always Amazon excels at customer satisfaction and Timex as most of us know is a dependable watch. I like the size of the digits, I just do. 4 Stars for the Timex Men's Ironman Triathlon 100-Lap FLIX System Watch # T5E231.
