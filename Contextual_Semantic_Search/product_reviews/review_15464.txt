I have been wanting a pair of back zipper moccasins for a long time.  These were a great price and very comfortable.  I normally wear a size 7-1/2 or 8, so I went with the size 8.  They fit great, even with my socks.  The sole is thinner than I expected and I have high arches.  I add an arch support insert to the boots and that works great.  I, also, bought the matching Minnetonka fringe purse.  Great dual.
