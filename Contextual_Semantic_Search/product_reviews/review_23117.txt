I have a big head, and a lot of glasses feel tight at my temples.  These do not.  (I wear a 7 and 7/8 hat)Though I have never had amber lenses, these aren't too distracting.  I normally buy darker glasses because I'm fairly photosensitive, but I've been riding my bike a lot and there are a lot of transitions from bright areas to places where there's a lot of shade on the local trails.  These areas in the shade are too dark with the darker glasses, but fine with the amber.The only drawback is that they do feel a little flimsy.  The lenses are anchored to the glasses only at the nose and the temple.  The hang separated from the frame over the eyebrow.  That may cause a problem, but for the price, they're easily replaceable.
