Ok, I wear a 44x30 pant.  It can be hard to find that locally, and sometimes it can be problematic ordering them on-line.  You never know what you'll get.These fit perfectly.  I'm used to Dockers, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but these are pretty much like the old Levi's pants I used to wear many years ago.  A substantial denim fabric that isn't too soft OR too stiff.  It's just right.Really good workmanship too.  These will last a few years.Definitely for casual wear, but they are cut very nicely so that they aren't too baggy anywhere, yet there is plenty of room to move around and stretch, bend over, etc.I knew they were good when I put them on and didn't want to take them off.  Recommended.
