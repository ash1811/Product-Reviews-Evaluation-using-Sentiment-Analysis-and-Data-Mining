My  bra came on the 17th June, however, it is a lovely bra. Love the lace design.only one problem the cups were a  little big .size 38 DD. was somehow  too big  should have taken 38D. I also ordered the play tex comfort 18 hour gel the comfort strap the same size but it fits very well. This is my second purchase of the comfort gel.  Thanks play tex.  Keep up the great job.
