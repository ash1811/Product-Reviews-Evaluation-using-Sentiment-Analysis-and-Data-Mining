I've bought several packs of these to replace some old Hanes that tend to wear through in less than a year. So far, they're still surprisingly thick after multiple washings, and very comfortable. I could wish they were less expensive, but I'm learning that sometimes the more expensive stuff lasts a lot longer, thereby making up the difference...
