I read the reviews on this product thoroughly, so I was well-aware of the problems with the short posts. However, I have very petite, thin ears, so I thought I would be able to wear them. Not so. One earring could be worn, but I had to secure the back in so far that my ear turned red. I could not even get the back on the other earring because the post did not stick out far enough. Oh well. I returned them.
