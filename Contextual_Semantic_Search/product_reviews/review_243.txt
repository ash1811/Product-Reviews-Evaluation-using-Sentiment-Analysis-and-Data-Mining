This is a great high quality pair of shoes. The canvas is high quality and the stitching looks good. The inside of the shoes are also great. Buy chucks here for $20 ish less than at other places. Also make sure to buy a half or a full size smaller than what you normally wear. If you get these in the correct size you won't be dissapointed!
