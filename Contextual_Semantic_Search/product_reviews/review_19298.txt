On the advice of my husband's podiatrist, we bought two pair of these low-cut Targhee shoes. Perfect for my husband's very flat feet. They're stable, roomy, accommodating enough for his orthotics, and comfortable for all day use. No other shoe has offered him the support this shoe has. Achy feet--gone!Additionally, they're well made and good looking. I see another pair in his future.
