I had bought this to do my oil paintings and not get paint on my clothing. However, they are pretty comfortable and I found myself wearing one on a hot summer day around the house  Should have clicked four stars because the color fades after one season. However, I only paid 10 dollars for it, so no real complaints....bought a few more.
