I bought these about 4 years ago from a JC Penney. I have bought several tennis shoes or walking shoes since that are just not as comfy so I tried to find these and couldn't.  I found on Amazon and they look and fit the same EXCEPT that the right heel seems a tiny bit more loose.  Still these are my favorite comfy shoe so I am pleased.  I have bought more expensive shoes that are not as comfy.
