I supposed I may just be spoiled by fine, soft wools, but these socks are made of some of the scratchiest, least pleasant wool-blend fabric I've experienced. As a sock, they function just fine - I prefer a slightly tighter fit than these (as the Gold Toe nylons tend to be), but have not had any issues with them falling down, so functionally they are tight enough. But the fabric itself just isn't comfortable, it doesn't transparently blend in with my body and form a second skin. It's very apparent, and rather unpleasant. I'll keep these around, as socks do have a way of going missing and losing their mates, but I certainly won't be buying any more.
