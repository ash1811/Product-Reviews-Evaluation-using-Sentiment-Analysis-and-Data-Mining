This is the third pair I'm buying because these are durable and look good.These are worn six days a week at work (walking around, bending, squatting, running), they are extremely comfortable with a stylish look (semi faded).I wish these were the same price as the Wranglers available at Walmart (19.99) but they don't carry the exact style (theirs are straight leg) or the exact color.If you need inexpensive jeans that look good, are durable, and allow you to move around these are the ones to get.
