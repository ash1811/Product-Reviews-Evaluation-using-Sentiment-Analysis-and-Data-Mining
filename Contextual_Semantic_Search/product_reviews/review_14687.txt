1/1/14 update my wife and daughter fight for these slippers. They are the first thing my wife outs on in the morning and the last at night. Gents buy your loved one these slippers and you will not be sorry. The liner is great no color transfer and the are warm and comfortable. Prior I said I was so pleased to see that my wife is loving these slippers. In the past we tried others that were real fur but dyed black. the dye came off and my wife stop wearing them. Many other issues started to show and then we order Ugg for me and I loved them I bought these for her so I can wear my slippers. Thank you for keeping the highest quality standards
