At this price,its a fairly good replica of the Rolex Sub Mariner.Seems to keep perfect time after 3 weeks.Has not gained or lost any time.Although the band is a nice stainless steel and quite handsome, i plan on replacing it with a Modena Presidential Rubber watch band as i have on a few others.Changes the traditional look to a more sporting look. This NOT a real dive watch as there is no screw down crown, so buyer beware before entering the water.I've been so very happy with the 3 Invicta's that i have purchased from Amazon, that i have just ordered an Automatic Invicta  Diver  and a wonderful watch box to hold them. Although the MSRP are a little excessive you  would be hard pressed to find a better watch for the price.
