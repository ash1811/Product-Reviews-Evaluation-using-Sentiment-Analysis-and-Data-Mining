I read the other reviews about the pointy cups and I don't have that problem. I ordered the same size as my regular bra and it seems to fit just fine and is supportive. I don't like the sides of the bra - they are very thick/tall - where your normal bra has sides that are only an inch or two, this is more like three or more and makes me feel stodgy and fat. Not as flattering as some of my other sports bras.
