Very comfortable and nice-looking shoe despite being made of rather rigid leather. Good arch support and thick sole like a walking shoe but can pass as a dress shoe. I had pair that was black and liked it so much I got another in brown. The brown leather ones have a different-colored dark brown stripe running down the middle of the top portion which I'm not crazy about. I think it distracts from the shoe and makes it look less dressy. But I'll keep it, because it's hard to find nice shoes that are roomy enough for wide feet. Length-wise, this shoe is true to size.
