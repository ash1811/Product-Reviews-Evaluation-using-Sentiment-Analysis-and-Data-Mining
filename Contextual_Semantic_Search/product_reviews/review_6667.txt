These shoes are the bomb! I read they ran small, so I got a 10, as opposed to my regular size 9. Out of the box and onto my feet, I couldn't believe how they felt! So comfy, so cute! I'm presently looking for another color. I always thought dancers shoes must be the way to go, and it looks like I am right!!
