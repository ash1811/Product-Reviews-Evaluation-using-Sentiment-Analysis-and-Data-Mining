I bought a small and managed to squeeze into it. Girdles are meant to be tight not loose. The way it closes in the middle forces everything to be smooshed towards the middle. After wearing it for probably 6 hours I took it off only to find that it had formed a crease below my new belly button, and my scars on the side, where the incision ruffles, were more ruffled looking than normal. This is not delicate on your skin so I wouldn't recommend it post tummy tuck.
