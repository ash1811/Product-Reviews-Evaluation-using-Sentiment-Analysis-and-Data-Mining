I purchased two sizes to figure out which was appropriate and sent back the one that was too small. I used this size chart from Dolphin's website [...] Google "dolphin size chart" and for me it was the first link, Dolphin Swim Wear). I wear a 4 or 6 dress size, but my rib cage is huge apparently (36), and the 36 fits perfectly (it's tight as it should be for a suit) and the 34 was way too small. For reference, I'm 5'3, not busty, about 140 lbs currently. So my advice to use Dolphin's size chart (duh). I've only worn it twice but in the lap pool it's perfect, no complaints yet!
