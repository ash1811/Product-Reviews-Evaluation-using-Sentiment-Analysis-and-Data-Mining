I read previous reviews that warned of these tees running small and short. I normally wear a Medium but border on a Large. I like my tanks long so I ordered XL. I could have gotten away easily with the Large for length and fit, but the XL still fits well, nice and long so I'm keeping them. They are a nice weight and fit.
