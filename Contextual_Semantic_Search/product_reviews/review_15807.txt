The person who received these Thorio  socks hasn't had a pair prior to this time.  They were a Christmas gift.  Most socks he buys are a bit too tight and wear out at the heels.  Getting one's grown son socks usually gets the required,  "thanks, Mom".  In this case, he  really  loves them.  Amazon delivered them before the holiday even tho' ordered late.
