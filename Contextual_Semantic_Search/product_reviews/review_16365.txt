I find this a comfortable bra to wear all day. It does not ride up, nothing pokes me and it seems sufficiently supportive. The taupe color is perfect. I have a few thin white blouses and nothing shows through. The only thing I would change is the design. I am not a fan of this granny lace pattern, especially not in that taupe color. Something about the combination of lace and shiny that I do not like. Other than that - like it and will buy again because it is so comfortable.
