I like this bra as I like the fit and the underwire is comfortable. The only thing I would suggest is for the straps to be more substantional, especially for size D and above. I do have trouble with one strap slipping off my shoulder.. Also, I like when bra straps can be adjusted from the front instead of having to remove bra to adjust the straps like which has to be done with this one.
