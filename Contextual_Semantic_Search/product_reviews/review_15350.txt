I have been trying to find this bra for months!  I had one that I bought a long time ago, and I loved the fit.  Unfortunately, when I looked at the tag(s) to determine the name brand and size, it was too faded (by washing) and, without that information, I was unable to shop by brand.  Fortunately, I tried Amazon...and found this long-lost item that I was looking for.  No other bra fits me as well...  I ordered several of them!
