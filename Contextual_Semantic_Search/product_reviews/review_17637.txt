The only thing I do not do is sleep in them (well not usually). It is very hard to find shows as light as not wearing anything. I cannot stand shoes that form fit and are all fluffy and hot. I have run the gambit in color as they became available and not in my size. I used to let them ware out completely but now I use the new ones for work and the old for play and the garden. There is a pair that does not seem to want to wear out I keep hanging from the treadmill.The only thing I regret is they did not even ask what I would pay for them to be made in the U.S.I am giving serious though in having a backup pair.
