Being a 42DDD, it's very hard for me to find bras. So when this came in, I really wanted to like it. Unfortunately, there are some flaws that keep me from loving this bra. First of all, the straps are not fully adjustable, which I knew when ordering, but the straps are actually very big and slide around a lot. Secondly, the &#34;petals&#34; on the bottom/side of the bra are aggravating! I'm constantly itchy where they lie on my skin. And lastly, this bra is THIN! I know a lot of bras in larger sizes don't use any padding, but even when I wear this under a thick cami and t-shirt, it's slightly see through. The cups and band fit true to size, and well enough that I will be keeping the bra, but it's not my go to.
