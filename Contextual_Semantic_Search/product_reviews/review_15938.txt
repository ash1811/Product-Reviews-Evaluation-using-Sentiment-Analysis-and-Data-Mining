Nice fit, great feel.  They have a decent amount of cushioning without being too heavy or too thick, and they don't seem to generate much sweat.  The last pair(s) I had did not last as long as I would have liked for this kind of money (they became thread bare at the top of the heal), but that may just be how hard I am on socks.  I'll update after some wearing time.
