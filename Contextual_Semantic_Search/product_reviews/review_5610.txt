My husband needed a bag for a 2 week trip and bought this bag. Let me tell you that its HUGE!!! You might want the next size down.  He got the largest size and I'm 5'7" and could fit in this bag with room to spare!! With that said, its strong and sturdy and will fit literally antyhing you can put in it.
