I have been wearing Gold Toe for 30 years.  I was looking for some gray over-the-calf Metropolitans but they don't make them.  I tried these but they are really black.  It is VERY hard to tell the difference between their black, gray and navy colors, even under a strong light.  Quality is good, not up to what it was a few years ago, but still okay.
