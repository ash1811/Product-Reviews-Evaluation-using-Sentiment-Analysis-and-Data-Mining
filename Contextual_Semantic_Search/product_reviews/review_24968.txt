The PAG 40 is an older model in the Casio Pathfinder series.  It does not have some of the features of the newer models.  However, it does have one of the best displays of the entire series.  It also has a "rugged" look to the watch which I and many find appealing.  It isn't an atomic model, but it keeps very good time.  The "abc" features of the watch are not always precisely accurate, but close enough for the average person's needs.  I tend to use the barometer and I like the 24 hr graph to show the barometic tendency.  I have several different Pathfinder models and this older model remains one of my favorites.  The only "negative" would be that a battery change involves getting 4 new batteries.
