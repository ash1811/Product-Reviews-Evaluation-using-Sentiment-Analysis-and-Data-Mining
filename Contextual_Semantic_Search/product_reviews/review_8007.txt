The edges are a bit sharp. I used this to jump rope. Gave me support for about three weeks, and now it's a bit too ehhh.. Does not give me enough support to really do the kind of exercise that I like. For now I just use it for non exercise purposes. I would not buy this again if you need an exercise bra for a larger chest.
