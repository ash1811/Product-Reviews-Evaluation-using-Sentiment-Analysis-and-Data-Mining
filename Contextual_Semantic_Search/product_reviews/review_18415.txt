This is a great treat for our four-year-old. He loves the coins and chest--particularly the hidden compartment--though he could care less about the bandanna or eye patch. He loves all-things-pirate, and for that I'd like to give the product four stars. It's not that well-made, which is why I give it this rating. The wood is a bit rough, and the bandanna is shoddily hemmed with a few dangling strings.  While I'm sure he will have fun with the chest and coins for a while, the rest is pretty much invisible to him.
