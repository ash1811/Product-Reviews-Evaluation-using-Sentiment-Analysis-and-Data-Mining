I got a the black ones in Small. I am just under 5'7" and 120 pounds and they fit well. Not too thin, not too thick and the color is a genuine deep black. I actually bought two more pairs after that - they are very comfortable and flattering. I just wish they were maybe an inch or two longer. They don't look like "highwaters" on me but they hit around my ankle. Not enough of a gripe to keep me from adoring these though...but if you are taller than 5'7" or so you make wish to look elsewhere. Other than that I love these! Hold up well in the wash and look great on.
