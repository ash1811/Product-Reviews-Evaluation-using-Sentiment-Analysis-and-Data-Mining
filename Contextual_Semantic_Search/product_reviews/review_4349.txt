This wallet is awesome.  It's a nice vinyl material so my cards don't stick or get damaged as they did with a leather wallet.  Plenty of room yet Slim enough where I can still fit it in my back pocket even with 20 plus cards inside with change and cash.  Looks just as picture portrays.  I've been trough lots of wallets and this is my favorite yet!  Beautiful colors too!
