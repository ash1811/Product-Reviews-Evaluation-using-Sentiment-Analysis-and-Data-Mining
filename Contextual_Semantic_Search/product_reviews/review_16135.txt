After researching many bags to fit ourBritax B-Safe Infant Car Seat, BlackI decided on this bag. Britax makes a bag specifically for their seats, and I want to purchase another Britax seat after our son outgrows this one, but many reviewers said that they were cheap and the zippers broke. AND it was much more expensive than this bag. I ordered this bag online since it wasn't available locally, and with my prime account, It got here in time for our trip!I tried out the bag at home doing a test run since I know it can be stressful in the airport and we were going to gate check the seat. It is much easier to get the seat in when the sippers are fully open. We didn't take the base, but I would guess that it would fit too since there is a LOT of room. We also put the infant seat adapters from theBritax B-Agile Stroller, Blackand our Ergo Baby Carrier Black with Camel Lining in the bag with the seat. Next time I will stuff some clothes and other things too since they check or gate-check any seats/strollers for free.PROS:seems sturdy after one use on planeExtra room for storage or baseWill fit larger seat when baby growsbackpack straps for easy carryingCONS:very bulky to carry when child is using the seatlarge to store when not in useOverall, I am happy with this purchase and will update if anything changes. Will use this bag again on our trip to Puerto Rico in July and hopefully it holds up! I plan to use it for many years!
