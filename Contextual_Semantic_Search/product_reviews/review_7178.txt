I've always liked Gold Toe products and these socks are no exception. They have remained soft after many washings over the past few months and they are extremely comfortable. I find that no-show socks can often struggle to provide the balance of truly being no-show without constantly slipping down under my heel. These socks have struck that balance perfectly.
