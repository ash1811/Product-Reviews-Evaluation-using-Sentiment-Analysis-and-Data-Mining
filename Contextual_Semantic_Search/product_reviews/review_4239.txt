Comfortable, somewhat supportive bra.  This one had the highest rating in an article I read (don't remember where) but isn't as good as the Glamorize.  This one fits like a minimizer bra.  Not the best looking shape under clothes - kind of sits lower or draws the breast downward.  Not the best buy for the price in my opinion.  Still a little bounce.  I prefer the Glamorize a Full-figure Sports Bra.
