These sandals are comfortable when I'm just standing but I had a hard time adjusting to them when walking.  I recently spent six hours a day, three days in a row wearing them and did a lot of walking so I consider them broken in.  I find the bumps under the area between the toes and rest of the foot somewhat uncomfortable.  They push into my feet while walking.  I have a wide foot so the outer side of my feet go over the edge of the sandal.
