The flat format is genius for those of us who regularly overstuff our poor luggage. Have used this on perhaps a dozen trips from northern California to Hawaii to the Midwest to the East...wonderful. I am planning to get one for my mother for when she visits. She is the queen of organization -- she may have already beaten me to the punch!
