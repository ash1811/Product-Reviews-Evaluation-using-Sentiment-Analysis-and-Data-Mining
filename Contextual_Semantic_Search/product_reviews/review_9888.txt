I've been looking for muscle shirts for a while. I finally came across these ones which were pretty cheap. I ordered black, white, gray, oxford, and red colors. It seems that the gray and oxford colors are NOT %100 cotton. They are only %50. The rest are %100 cotton. I tried returning and purchasing new ones a few times but it seems that this is the way it is. I contacted Amazon support and they couldn't guarantee that I'll receive the %100 cotton - I don't quite know what is the deal.Anyways, the shirts are also oversized - I initially ordered large which was too big for me. Medium fits well even after laundry/dryer.
