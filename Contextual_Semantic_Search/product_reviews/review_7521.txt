5 stars! Yusss! I got these shoes for my halloween costume ( Selene from underworld ) . They looked great and were actually pretty easy to wear all night. I usually wear a 8 - 81/2 and I ordered a size up, and I'm sure glad I did because the fit snug. Great buy. I will wear these with other things as well. Love it.
