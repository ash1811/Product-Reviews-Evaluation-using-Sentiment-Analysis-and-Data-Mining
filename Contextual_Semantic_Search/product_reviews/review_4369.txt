yeah, I gave my husband a man bag.  He only uses it when we travel (hides it in the car as he won't admit to needing one).  He does like it, great for the cell phone, car keys, wallet iPod etc that he needs to keep track of.  It has a military look which he preferred, but the canvas that the bag is made out of is very thin, I don't think it could take much abuse.  And that's why it gets 4 stars instead of 5.  At least I no longer have to lug his stuff in my purse!
