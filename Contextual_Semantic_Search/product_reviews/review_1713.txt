3/23/11  We've been having enough snow here in South New Jersey these last several years that we are getting out our snow blowers and doing our share of shoveling.  Having said that, what we get here is nothing compared to other areas on the USA, but for here, a 1/2" shuts the schools down.  We've had a number of snows producing several feet and on our 360' driveway thats allot of shoveling.  I got the Carhartt Men's Quilt Lined Duck Bib Overall for my fiance and they were fabulous.  While running the snow blower he was comfortable, warm and not soaking wet.  Actually, he had to take his jacket off.  He wore them over jeans, but they were warm enough that you really would only need long underwear under them.Although, this is not really the place for this review I will say that I also bought him a pair of Carhartt Men's Insulated Waterproof Breathable Gloves ASIN: B002VWJWYU which he loved and at Amazon you will see 18 reviews and almost  stars.You cannot go wrong with Carhartt.
