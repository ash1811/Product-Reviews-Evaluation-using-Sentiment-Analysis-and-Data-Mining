I bought a pair of these sandals several years ago. I have worn them almost daily--I live in the south, so they are always in season. They have an arch support built in, and are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn--light, well-cushioned and supportive. Recently, my daughter was complaining that her feet hurt. I bought these for her. She loves them as much as I do. I heartily recommend them for anyone! (The strap system comes far enough forward on your foot, that your toes don't shift to the side, which is a problem for both of us with many thong style sandals.)
