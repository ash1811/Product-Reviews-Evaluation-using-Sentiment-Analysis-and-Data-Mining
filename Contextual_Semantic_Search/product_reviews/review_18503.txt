For $29.99, the white gold and gemstone earrings are a great buy but the stones for the ear posts are rather tiny.  For a smaller person (I'm 5' 5"), they would be OK, but for an adult, they are too tiny.  The teardrop portion is larger but the teardrop gemstone lacks the fire and dazzle that one usually sees in a true gemstone.  I bought these to go with a 14k white gold blue topaz ring I purchased at Macy's clearance fine jewelry for $146 (reg $500).  The topaz on the ring is large and shows its class by refracting light very nicely.  These stones seem more to be glass than gemstone.  Oh, well.  For the price, it is to be expected but don't fool yourself that you are buying the caliber of gemstone earrings that you would see in the Macy's fine jewelry case.
