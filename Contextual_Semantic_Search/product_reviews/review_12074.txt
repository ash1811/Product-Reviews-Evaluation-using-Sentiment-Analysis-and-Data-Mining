I bought the black colored shoes to add to my wardrobe as basic work shoes. I have worn them for about 4 months about 2-3 days a week to work at the office.Wear: They require polishing about once every two weeks. Small splinters have peeled off from the side of the sole of my pair when wearing them outside. I cut them off with scissors, so this is not noticeable yet. Other than that, they are holding up okay.Comfort: Best if you plan to wear them in the office or somewhere where you aren't on your feet much. I wouldn't recommend their use if you plan to be on your feet all day, as they may get a bit uncomfortable. However, loosening up the laces helps. I am a light guy and don't experience this with my brown pair of Bass shoes retailing for $120 which I paid only $37 for when I was in El Paso last Summer. I guess you get what you pay for. Hopefully, I will get a year's use out of the Docker's shoes.
