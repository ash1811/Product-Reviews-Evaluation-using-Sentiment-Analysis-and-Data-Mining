I've had many Russell shirts in the past.  I like athletic t-shirts that are a little loose vs. fitting tight like a white t-shirt for wear under a dress shirt.  So the Russell brand is my favorite and fit just as expected.  I also like the cotton polyester blend which is cooler than a plain cotton t-shirt
