This is a great, amazing bag and sturdy, comfy, everything. The only problem with it is that it faded pretty quickly. I don't take it in the sun ever, not at all, but it did fade a lot. I don't know why. Anyway, this faded look would be just fine if I were a guy and could hang with a more rugged look, but I'm a female teacher and kind of think it looks grungy. I like the bag though and still use it sometimes.
