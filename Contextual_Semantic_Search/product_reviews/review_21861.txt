These shirts looked good out of the package, but once they were washed, it was a different story.  The shirts shrunk up to almost a &#34;belly shirt&#34;, which is not attractive.  The material is so thin you can see nipple through it.  Once the shirt has been worn all day, the sleeves and bottom of the shirt become stretched out and misshapen. These were bought as undershirts under work shirts.  I feel they are cheaply made and will not last for more than a month.  Terrible shirts! Will never buy these again.
