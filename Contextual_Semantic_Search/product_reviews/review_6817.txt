These are alright socks. I like the fit well, they're definitely tight on the leg which is great. I'm not in love with the material. It doesn't really wick away moisture in a good way, and they can start feeling a bit swampy and get funky pretty quickly. The material just also doesn't feel particularly nice. Because of this, I can't say that I really love Gold Toe socks, but I do tend to repeat buy them because they are a good value. If nothing else, the otherwise kind of icky material allows them to maintain their shape and elasticity for some time and just generally hold up well.
