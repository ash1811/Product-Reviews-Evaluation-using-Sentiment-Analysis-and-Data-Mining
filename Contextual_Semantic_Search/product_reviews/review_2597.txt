I like to wear these when mowing or working in garden during full sun days vs slathering on the pore blocking sun screen.  If you think about what you spend on sun screen vs light weight clothing - clothing by far comes out ahead since I just sweat the sun screen off..I usaully get 3-4 seasons with tops and 1-3 seasons with bottoms.
