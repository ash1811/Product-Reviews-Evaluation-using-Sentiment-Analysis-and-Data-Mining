Finding pants that fit is a real chore for me.  That's why I stick with Dockers.  Dockers' khakis are so soft and comfortable.  They fit me perfectly.  I might even say it's slimming.I'm 5'5".  The length is a little long when I'm barefoot, but it's the right length when I wear my mules.I bought a range of colors for work.  Very nice.
