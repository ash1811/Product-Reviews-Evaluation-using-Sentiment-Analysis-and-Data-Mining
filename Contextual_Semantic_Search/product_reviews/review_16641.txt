The pants fit well and seem to be just as described. The pants button fell off on first trying them on. The button used a pin and metal button receiver. However this button used a plastic receiver instead of metal and it was cracked. I installed an after market all metal jean button and pin and it works great. Shame a good pair of pants uses a cheap button.
