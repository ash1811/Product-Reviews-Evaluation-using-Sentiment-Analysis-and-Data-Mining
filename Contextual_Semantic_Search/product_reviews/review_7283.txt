My 3 1/2 year old daughter grew out of her size 9.5 Bloch Bunnyhop slippers. I got these in a 10, which is her current shoe size. They are fine, but a little on the big side. The laces are ridiculously long, so they come untied a lot. The quality is great and she likes them, and wears them for ballet class. I guess it's good to have room to grow.
