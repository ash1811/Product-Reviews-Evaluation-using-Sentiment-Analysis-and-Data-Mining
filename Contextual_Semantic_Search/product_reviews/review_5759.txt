I can always rely on these Fruit of the Loom Heavyweight tees to fit me right.  I'm a big guy at 6'1&#34; and 240lbs so I go with a 2XL to give me some extra height because my upper body is tall.  These fit great right out of the box, and fit even better after the first few washes.  They don't shrink vertically and just fit me the way I want them to.  I'm very satisfied, and the color was exactly as pictured.
