The fit is tight. I wear a size 10M but these are narrow. My big toe knuckle rubs the edge and becomes very sore. I have to were socks to prevent blisters making the fit much tighter. I sit driving all day so I just wear them when I need to walk. Cost too high for my amount of wear. I like this style of shoe for work. I had found the brown version at Payless Shoes three years ago; that's how long it took to wear that pair out. This year Payless did only the black, white, and some other bright colors. That made me sad. Then after my search for brown athletic mary janes I became sadder. Very hard to find! Finally I found these.
