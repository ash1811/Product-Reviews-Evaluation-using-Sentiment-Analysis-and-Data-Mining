For the price of a 5XL shirt made me wonder if this shirt was going to be cheaply made. I took a chance and ordered some. When they arrived to my surprise they are made pretty good. Yeah a little thin, but for the price I would defiantly order more in the future. It is a shirt that is affordable enough to buy if you have gained weight over the years(For me that is a lot of weight) and plan on loosing that weight fast. That way you aren't out of a lot of money if you are fortunate enough to loose weight. These will be the same brand I will order if and when I am able to down size each time hopefully in the not so far distant future..... I would recommend these shirts regardless of price also to anyone. These shirts are very soft and very comfortable.
