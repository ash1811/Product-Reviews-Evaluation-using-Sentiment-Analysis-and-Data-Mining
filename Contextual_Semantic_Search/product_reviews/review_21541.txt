I love this bag.  I bought it for airplane/foreign travel, but will use for all sorts of travel.  Mainly I love that the three main sections are enclosed between the two shoulder straps, because I am not a fan of exposed pockets.  I can drop just one strap and get interior access.  The two snap sections can easily accommodate any article that exterior pockets would hold without security worries and they also have zippered slots;  the center section is generous enough for the emergency clothes I carry on a plane, has well organized slots,  and a big plus is the double ended ( two-way?) zipper and opening access.  A paper clip or tiny lock can hold the pulls together for added security.  I love the way the three sections are somewhat flexible regarding which holds the larger loads.  The fabric is light-weight, beautiful, sturdy.  It folds down compactly.  I am OK when newer models lack some pockets that were in previous models, they still have plenty.My only complaint is that Baggallini (and its main competitors as well) does not ever seem to get the size of modern smart phones when they make those cute little holders or outside pockets!  Mostly they are all too short.  I think I would only be able to use them for tissues.  An inside phone pocket is OK on this bag and fits my iPhone5 well or the phone could go in the small zippered bag on the tether.  I love those tethering straps and the cute wristlet bags that are included; they have some padding!I still give it highest marks, for the service provider, price, and product.
