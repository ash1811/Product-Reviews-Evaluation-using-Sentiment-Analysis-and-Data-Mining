UPDATE!!! I now own two of these bras, and am about to buy a third. I see reviews all over the board. All I can share is my own experience. I still love this bra. Some advice, wash it on cold and hang to dry. I accidentally put my gray one in the dryer once, and I've noticed it's not quite as firm of support as it used to be. But the Black and Tan dot one is perfect, and the material of it is a bit thicker than the gray heather. I have no issues with seam lines as I read in one review. Also, I often undo the top 3 or 4 clasps if I have a low cut top, and then have an awesome cleavage showing bra. For the price and the large size I need, this bra is great! I do wear a 36 band in all bras and this one is no exception, so I have not found the sizing to be off. I'm still hoping you will introduce some more fun prints. The Black and Tan dot is nice, but I would love some other options!Boy do I love this bra!! I need a 36I, and I can only hope for a "boob tube" situation with most any sleep bra. UNATTRACTIVE!!! But this bra actually separates the girls in to two actual breasts! I am impressed! And it's very comfortable!! I find that any day I am staying home, I just wear this bra all day! I am also a breastfeeding mom, and while I wouldn't recommend using this bra to nurse away from home, unless you want to be out in public unhooking 7 clasps, it works great at home! I will be ordering more of these. And I love the heather grey!! It looks great under all kinds of fun colorful tshirts. Looks more like I have a tank top on than a bra! And the price is great too!! Thank you very much!! I hope you come out with some more "fun" prints!!
