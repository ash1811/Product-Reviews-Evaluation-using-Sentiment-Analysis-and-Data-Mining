My husband bought these to wear to a Pirate Mardi Gras Ball. We also noticed several other gentlemen wearing the same type of boot tops. They held up well and fit great! My husband has very wide calves and we were pleasantly surprised they fit as well as they did - and stayed up! Great addition to his pirate costume!!!
