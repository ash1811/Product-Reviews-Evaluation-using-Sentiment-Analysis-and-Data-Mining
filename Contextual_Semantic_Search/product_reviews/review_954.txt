A little stiffer than I would have liked. But because the waist does run slightly smaller it fit a bit snug in the underbust and under the arms. I am sure that also the stiffness contributed to that. But if you order a size up on the waist size and are looking for something sexy and not something to wear for support all day it is a super cute and sexy bra...
