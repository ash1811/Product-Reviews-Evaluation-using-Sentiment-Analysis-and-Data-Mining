For many years, I've worn this type of shoe.  I always bought the cheaper ones, not wanting to spend the money for Keds.  They always washed up nice and I could get at least three summers out of them.  NOT THESE!!  I washed them ONCE, by hand, with laundry soap and a little bleach.  They're more yellow than white.  I'm VERY disappointed - I finally decide to spend the money on some &#34;quality&#34; canvas shoes and get ripped off.  They look terrible, the entire top and sides of them are yellow.  I've washed them in just plain laundry soap and water, bleach and water, rinsed them in just water, used Sneaker Whitener. NOTHING WORKS.  I will buy the &#34;cheap&#34; but QUALITY ones this coming summer and skip the Keds.  I guess they'd be okay in colors, but I always liked white, with a tan and summer clothes, they would go with anything.  Time to also send Keds an email now that I've found the details of my purchase.  VERY disappointed.
