I don't have any problem with the watch itself.  But, the band is far too short.  The circumference of my wrist is 7 inches.  I am barely able to secure the band.  Since the leather band on another Timex watch broke off after just a few months I thought I'd give the velcro closure a try.  I'll have to look at a different brand of watch in the future for a longer lasting, better fitting band.
