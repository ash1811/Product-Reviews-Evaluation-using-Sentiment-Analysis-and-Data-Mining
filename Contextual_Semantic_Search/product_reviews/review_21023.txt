Very comfortable and soft, they are really nice.  They have a very thick sole so you feel like you are walking on air, yet are still solid.  I don't know how they will hold up over time, but so far I REALLY like them. Only problem I have run into is that my feet get TOO warm in them, but I have a tendency to be on the warmer side, so for those that don't have this problem, they are probably perfect!
