Although I have not worn these boots  for a long period of time; they are comfortable when brand new.  In other words, they do not need to be &#34;broken in&#34;.  They supply excellent arch support and I would say the fit is true to size.  I ordered a half size bigger to allow wearing a heavier sock.
