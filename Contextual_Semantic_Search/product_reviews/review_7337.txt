I own a pair of cobras in both leather and in canvas, and I love them both. I mistakenly purchased the leather ones when I first started taking ballet classes, but was very pleased with how long they lasted. My canvas shoes are much more comfortable for everyday practice. Breathable, with some give, I would reccommend these shoes to anyone looking for a good pair of ballet shoes- Even my instructor and all my classmates encourage people to buy them!
