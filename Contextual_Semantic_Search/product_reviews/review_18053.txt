I bought my first pair of these exact type of shoes back in 2006.  I absolutely love my Premium Skechers, and I will continue to buy this pair until Skechers no longer makes them.  They are sporty, fun, and cute, and I love to simply run around in them. I really liked purchasing them from Amazon because Amazon offered these shoes in the specific size and color scheme that I like...and at a better price! Way to go, big A!:)
