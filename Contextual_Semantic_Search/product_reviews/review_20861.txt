I've worn Lee, Levis, Old Navy, and other brands, but Wrangler are by far the most comfortable jeans out there.  The fabric is also good quality.  My Wrangler jeans have lasted years longer than my Levis which seem to have regressed in fabric quality over the years.  I also love the greyed indigo color. It's a nice break from the typical shades of blue.
