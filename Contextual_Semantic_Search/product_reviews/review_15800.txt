If you need great cushion and breathability, these are the socks for you. I use them for running, tennis or just walking around a new city. My mom has been using Thorlos for 20+ years and I am hooked also. They are definitely much better than sports branded socks, which don't provide you with support, the amount of cushion or the comfort of these socks...well worth the extra money spent.
