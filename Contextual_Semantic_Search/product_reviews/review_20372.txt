I needed to replace my old vests and chose this one.  It fits perfectly.  I ordered my usual coat size and it fits nicely over a sweater or sweatshirt.  I love the pockets (inside and out) and it keeps me warm on a cool morning without being too warm as a coat would be.  The color is good, too (I ordered a nice neutral brown).
