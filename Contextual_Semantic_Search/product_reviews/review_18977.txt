I had another Timex sports watch....had it for many years, and the battery rarely had to be replaced.  I finally did replace it, and then the chime wouldn't work, but I still used it because of the timer function.  I finally broke down and bought this one to replace it.  Love the strap...makes it so much easier to get on and off, and won't wear out like the rubber ones.  I'm sure it will last a long time, just the previous one.  Love the available functions on this watch.
