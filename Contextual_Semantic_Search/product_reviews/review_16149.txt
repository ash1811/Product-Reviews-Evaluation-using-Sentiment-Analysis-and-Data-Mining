I had read several different reviews of carriers for car seats and decided on this one.  I was flying with my son alone and needed all of the free hands I could get.  Not only did I have to car his car seat I also had his stroller, a small carry on bad and I checked his pack and play.  You may look a little silly with this giant back pack, but it is genius!  Loved it so much.  Also, you can put other things in the bag.  I put all of my son's clothes, diapers, blanket, etc.  The construction is very sturdy as well.  Loved this product!
