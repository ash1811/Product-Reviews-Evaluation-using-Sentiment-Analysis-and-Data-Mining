I haven't had Topsiders for a long time, but used to wear them a lot &#34;back in the day&#34; (60s & 70s).....  The Brown/Buc ones I just got are a good representation of a classic brand.  There are some differences - like another reviewer I do wish the insole ran the full length of the shoe rather than ending halfway, but they do still feel just fine once you are used to it. Don't expect the kind of fit and feel/support you get from an athletic shoe - these aren't that kind.  We all wear trainers a lot these days so a classic casual shoe like a Topsider will feel quite different, but these are still very comfortable.I went to a local shoe store and used the foot caliper measurement device to get an accurate size.  My right foot was just a shade over 10.5 D, and the left was l little smaller than 10.5 D, so I ordered my topsider in 11D and they fit perfectly, with just a bit of extra room at the toe which is the correct fit for any shoe.  I got mine on sale, so they were a great value too.  Buy these with confidence that you're getting good quality.  I will buy Topsiders from Shoe Mart again.  Good value and fast shipping.  I'm pleased.
