I've tried these on a few times before buying them. I must have tried different standard white v-necks as one medium seems to fit a lot tighter (which is desired for an undershirt) than others. I bought another two sets from Marshalls and they appeared to be the exact same product but fit a lot looser. They are very comfortable and I kept both.
