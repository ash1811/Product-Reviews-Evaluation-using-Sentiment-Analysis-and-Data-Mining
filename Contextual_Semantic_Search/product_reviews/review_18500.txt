Gave these as a gift and the recipient was surprised at how "dainty" they were.  More importantly, they arrived broken, so she returned them and received credit because they were no longer in stock.  I see that they are now available, but would not order them again because of the description I received from the recipient.  She did love my 5x7mm swiss blue topaz earrings in white gold so I thought these would be an even more beautiful and elegant gift.  I was wrong and wish I'd sent her the same as mine.
