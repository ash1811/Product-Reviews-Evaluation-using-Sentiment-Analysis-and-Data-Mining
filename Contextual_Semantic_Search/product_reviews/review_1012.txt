I have been wearing these for years and really like the brand and fit.  I used to buy them on-line from Hanes, but then I discovered they were available from Amazon cheaper.  This time however I needed to purchase them individually, rather than getting a cheaper price by ordering 6.  I would like Amazon to bring back that option.
