i have had these ballet slippers for many years, this year i am fortunate enough to be able to order a few new pairs and as always i ADORE them! not to rough when first worn, very comfy and will last me a long time! thanks (O:also though i have a wide foot and ordered these 2 pair in wide , i didnt need to i could have used just the regualr width. the elastic ties will straighten that out for me just fine though so im keeping these.
