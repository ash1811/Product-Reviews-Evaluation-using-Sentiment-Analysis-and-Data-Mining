After reading the glowing reviews for these earrings I ordered a pair as a gift for a friend.  When it arrived opened the box to find the earrings in a plastic jewelry bag - they looked dull and something that could be easily made by my teenage daughter.  I held them up to the sunlight (out of the bag) and yes, the crystals change color as expected, but at least the pair I received, are not Swarovski quality and lack the brilliance in color I was hoping to see in this item.On the good side - they are not overly expensive.  Honestly though, I think they probably cost no more than seven dollars to make (having looked at jewelry making stuff in craft stores...).  The packaging is your basic silver cardboard jewelry box for earrings with a piece of cotton batting in it.  The earrings are in a small plastic jewelry bag, and the box is inside a plastic bag for shipping.They probably would appeal to some, but for me, they are a a 5 out of 10 in terms of overall value, look and quality. If I didn't need them as a gift 'right now' - I'd return them.
