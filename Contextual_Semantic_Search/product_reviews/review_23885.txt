I've always been a fan of Ray-bans, and these are classic in style. I received them within two days of ordering them and they come with their own case and everything. I have a funky schedule for school and most of the time, when I go home the sun is right up in my face, these shades handle all of that with no problem. They're great shades and they'd make a great gift.
