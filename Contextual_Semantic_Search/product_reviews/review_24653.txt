The only thing they could do to make these better is put a more textured gripping sole on them, to prevent slipping on carpeted stairs.  They still have much better soles for traction than any of the other slippers I looked at - they're not completely smooth and hard plastic, like the others on the market.They are well made and warm.The extra wides really are extra wide, so the sizing is accurate - you don't have to buy a size larger and have extra space in the toe.  8 3E really does fit a size 8, wide.
