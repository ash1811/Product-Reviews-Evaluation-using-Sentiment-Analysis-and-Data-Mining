This watch is very nice looking and has a solid feel to it. So far its keeping very accurate time. It is a bit chunky so if you have overly small wrists it may be a little bit big but I have smaller wrists (6.75 inches) and I can get by wearing it. Three negatives, it is a hair puller and the edges could be a bit smoother and the clasp is impossible to open for me unless I use something sharp to POP it open. I have fingernails and it's still difficult to open. Overall a great watch for the money and the packaging is beautiful.EDIT- on a side note do NOT expect good service from Invicta. They do not answer emails (do a search, they are known for ignoring emails). Once the sale is made they could care less so be prepared. The kool-aid drinking Invicta lovers either A. had to never deal with them on a service issue or B. are so brainwashed they look the other way. I sent them over 10 emails over a 2 month period and not ONE reply. I am not alone. These companies that do not reply to email should just get rid of their email system. ShopNbc also has a special email address for Invicta customers and same thing, no responses whatsoever. I had to email Citizen twice and both times I got a response in less than an hour. From now on I will only by from companies who respond to a customer. Just a forewarning.
