These Dickies 'workpants' (which are suitable for casual wear as well when khakis are appropriate) are sized much smaller thatn the same size in the jeans we purchased. Luckily, my husband is quite fit so he could make the smaller size work but they may not work for folks who like to kid themselves about their true size.
