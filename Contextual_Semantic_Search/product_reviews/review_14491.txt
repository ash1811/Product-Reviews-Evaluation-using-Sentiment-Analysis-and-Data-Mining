Pros:1. It's a Birkenstock.  Very comfy and every other reason why you want to buy one.Cons:1. The color of Tobacco brown is more like light tan.  From the picture, I was expecting a dark brownish color.  Not a big enough deal for me to ship the sandles backSummary:Very comfy sandals.  Molds to your foot after a week or two of wearing it.  A nice alternative to flip flops (I just can't stand that flip flop noise).
