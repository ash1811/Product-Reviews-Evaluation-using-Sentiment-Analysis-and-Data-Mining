too long. I usually wear a large. i'm 16.5 and 34/35 but this shirt is larger than other size Large that is usually get from the Gap or Old Navy.However, the company GotApparel was insanely nice about the return.They credited my account and told me not even to ship the item back.I will now try purchasing a size Medium.
