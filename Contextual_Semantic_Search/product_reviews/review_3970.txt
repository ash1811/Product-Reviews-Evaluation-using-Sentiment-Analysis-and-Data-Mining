These jeans have the best fit out of any jeans out there! Iam 6"2 185lbs and its hard to find jeans that fit me. the 32x36 fits me perfect in these 517s. Ive had 3 pair now for a couple years and they are still holding up great. I came to Amazon today to get more but there out of my size. Ill be back.  GREAT BUY FOLKS
