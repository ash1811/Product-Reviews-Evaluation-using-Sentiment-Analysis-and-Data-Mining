I had a hard time choosing between the size 2 and 3. (42 bust and 37 rib cage)  The 3 seemed like the best fit for the rib cage, but I thought I'd need a 2 to really compress everything.  I'm glad I went with the 3, because if it were any tighter, and it would probably hurt my rib cage.  As it is, it seems just right.When I first put it on, I thought it wouldn't control bounce enough because it felt just a tad roomy in the top part, but it works!  There's still some movement, but it doesn't hurt at all, and I don't feel like the breath is being squeezed out of me.  In fact, I hardly feel constricted at all, other than in the band around my rib cage, and that part isn't uncomfortable at all. The top and bottom control panels do exactly what the video says--they minimize bounce. I did several jumping jacks without a problem.  It's really  hard to believe that it can do that without being squished too much.It does make you look a little like you're wearing body armor, and under a shirt it definitely doesn't look like you're wearing a normal bra.  But I think it looks fine. It just flattens you, and depending on the fabric you're wearing you can sometimes see the seam between the top part of the bra and the bottom support.  Turbo Kick and the elliptical trainer aren't places to have fashion shows, anyway, though, so I'm definitely keeping mine.Shipper, OneSweetOne, was also fast.  I ordered on a Wednesday, got it on a Tuesday--one day earlier than indicated.UPDATE Jan 31st 2012. I wore my bra to a hip-hop aerobics class and it worked great!  We did a lot of jumping around and bouncing, and I enjoyed it more than I've enjoyed aerobics or dancing in YEARS.  I think there's still a shifting movement in the bra, but I honestly don't notice it since it's not impeding my workout. I feel like I have better balance and control as I move.
