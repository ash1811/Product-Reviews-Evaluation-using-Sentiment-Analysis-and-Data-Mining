First and foremost, these shoes are cute.  They come in a variety of colors with black as the base.  I bought the purple.  Although I bought the larger size, they are snug around the ankle and stay on well.  They also rinse out well and dry faster than my previous water shoes.  All and all I like them very much and would buy them again just a smaller size.  I do Aqua Bootcamp so my water shoes get a work out.
