The band supplied with the watch is huge, and the directions for removing links are arcane. I've watched tutorials from You Tube, read the directions thoroughly, and found explanations online but was still unable to remove the pins to make the band smaller. I'm not sure the watch is worth the bother of taking it to a jewelry store for the band to be re-sized.
