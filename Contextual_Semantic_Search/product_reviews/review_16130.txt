I have had this bag for over 2 years now and it has traveled quite a bit and is still in great shape.  There are some tears but nothing that has completely gone through.  I don't know why any parent would travel without putting their kids' car seat in a bag.  Plus, you can store extra things inside the seat and since you don't have to pay to check a car seat, it is pretty helpful.
