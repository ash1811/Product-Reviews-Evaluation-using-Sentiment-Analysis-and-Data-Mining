The ball earrings are beautiful and I was very disappointed to find that the posts are so short, what you would expect to find on earrings for a small child.  The posts were also thin, but that was okay.  Also, the tension backs were so tiny, I had a hard time handling them.  If I had purchased them for the Jan 2007 price, I might have kept them and had new posts and backs put on by my local jeweler.  The photo shows the posts and backs to be more substantial.  Sadly, I have to return them.
