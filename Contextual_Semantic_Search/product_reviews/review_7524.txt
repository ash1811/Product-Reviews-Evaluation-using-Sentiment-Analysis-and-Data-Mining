I guess I was expecting too much after reading all the great reviews.  However, I was SOO disappointed after opening the boxes.  The stones are small and get lost on my ears--and I don't have particularly big ears.  The settings are thin and bendy.  Here are my comments regarding each set:Garnet: Too dark.  When they're on my ear, you can hardly notice that they're red.  They look almost black.Amethyst:  Too light.  They're almost pinkish, and don't look like amethysts at all.Blue topaz: Too light.  The color is washed out and almost unnoticeable.Citrine:  Again, washed-out. The color is more yellowish than orange.Peridot: This is the only set with which I'm even the slightest bit happy with.  Nice lime-green color.All in all, I wish I'd spent my money on something else.
