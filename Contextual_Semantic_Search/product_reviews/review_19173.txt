I was concerned after reading some of the less favorable reviews.  I was also aware that they would not be blue.  I was impressed when I opened the box.  The crystals reflect the colors of its environment.  The clear crystal with the silver makes these look very clean.  The size is appropriate and my daughter loves them.  Worth the money.
