My late father got me into Rockport shoes years ago and he was not wrong.  They take care of my feet so well that I do not think about them - well made, they last for years and they are as good the last day before I get new ones - does not matter what I use them for or need them, walk, run, climb, sit, they work - I will probably never change.
