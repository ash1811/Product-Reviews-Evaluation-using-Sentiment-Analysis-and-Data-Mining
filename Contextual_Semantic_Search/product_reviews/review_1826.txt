I bought these after reviewing several items on line, and then trying a few at local shops, but got the best deal at Amazon. These shoes are very comfortable, and they also look good in dark jeans, or with cotton casual khaki style pants, and a sport jacket.  They are the perfect shoe for international travel, when you can only fit one or two extra pair in your luggage.  These are light enough, for the travel and very comfortable to walk for all day excursions.  They look good and fit well.  I wear a wide width shoe and these shoes really work well in the wide width in the toe box and arch but not too sloppy in the heel.  I choose the Black Tumbled style to work in casual, and business casual type settings, and they do work. I have had them now for a few months and I am very pleased.  Together with a pair of deck shoes, and light formal dress shoes, I had all I needed for 3 weeks in Europe and a cruise.
