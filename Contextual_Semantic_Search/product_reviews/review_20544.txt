Even for running, this bra keeps my DD/DDD chest well-contained and stationary.  Provides superior lift and support too, and makes a great profile under clothes with no &#34;uniboob&#34; effect.My only complaint is that despite the underwire, the girls still touch a bit in the center, creating a sweaty place on my sternum that becomes prone to heat rash.  Not pleasant.  I have to stuff a handkerchief between my breasts to prevent this.  Nevertheless, this model provides the best support and lift of any sports bra I have ever used so far, and that's saying a lot.
