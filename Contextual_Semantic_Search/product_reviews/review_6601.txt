I brought 2 pair of bearpaw from the owner but they are of different quality. This one is with hard fur and the size is right. Another pair of boot is the same size of the Camel color. However the Camel one is with soft fur but the size is a little small. And the first time I try the Camel one on, one of it's button fall off. Now I have sewn the button on by myself.
