These are beautiful earrings.  I feel like they are the perfect size, not at all child-like (to me) as some have posted.  I don't like super big hoops and feel like I look silly with anything very large in my ears, but these are absolutely perfect and understated.  They are also quite substantial--no flimsy wire-like feeling to these.
