I'm wearing them as I type this review. Although I love the massaging affect of the insoles, the slippers tend to angle when I walk. Meaning, they leave my toes and heels falling off of the slippers whenever I walk in the; weird, I know. I find myself tightening the straps, but to no resolve. I'm not sure if it's an issue with my pair only, but if not for that annoying flaw, this would be a 5 star purchase.
