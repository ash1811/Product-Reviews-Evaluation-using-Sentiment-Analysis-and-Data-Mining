The bra looks lovely on. The strap design gives the effect of skin peeking through, & the shape it gives is surprisingly natural, I.e., more of a sloping, projected look as opposed to very round & boosted up. So that's either a plus or minus depending on your preference. But the straps are very thin & fairly rough on the sides; I found they cut in after more than a couple hours of wear.
