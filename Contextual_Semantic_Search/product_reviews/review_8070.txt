I already had a pair of these that I have owned for over ten years and are still in great shape, and decided to get a couple more to go with some Mary Jane shoes I bought.  They fit nicely, the ruffle is super pretty and holds up after many washings.  Unlike other ruffled ankle socks, the lace stays crisp and the nylon sock does not stretch out of shape and fall down.  I love them!
