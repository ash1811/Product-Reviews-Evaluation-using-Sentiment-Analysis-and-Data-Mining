Just as with the Champion 6-Pack &#34;Performance&#34; socks I ordered, this sock is not at all as pictured in the photograph.  It appears from the photo that there will be a nice thick cushion from heel to toe.  Not at all true.  Gold Toe used to make a great crew sock that looked like this.  They still make a great ankle cuff sock with a thick cushioned sole.  Why not with the crew sock????  Can't find it in department or athletic stores either.
