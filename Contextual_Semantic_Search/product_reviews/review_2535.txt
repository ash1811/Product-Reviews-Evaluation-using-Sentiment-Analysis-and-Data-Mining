I learned about SmartWool socks at least 10 years ago, and have been pleased by their fit, cushioning and especially wicking qualities ever since.  They also wear well, and I may even have some of the first ones I bought,  I wear them all year, in hiking boots and sneakers, except when I wear sandals in warm weather.
