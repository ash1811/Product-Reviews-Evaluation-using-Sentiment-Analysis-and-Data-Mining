Comfortable and tough. These are no BS work jeans, and the cut is designed for work. Compared to fashion jeans, they look baggy in the groin and knees, but that's the beauty of them. There is a lot of space in the seat, groin, and knees for squatting, kneeling, and working over and around things without showing the dreaded plumbers crack or getting your jewels compacted.The belt loops are twice as thick as regular jeans. There is a leather patch on the right pocket opening for you to clip a blade or tool to without ruining the denim. The rear pockets have reinforced edges on top. The right side has a hammer loop, and the left side has a nice tool pocket on the thigh.The denim feels slightly stiffer, and denser than the soft stonewash stuff out there. Still comfortable. For me, that toughness makes me feel safer.
