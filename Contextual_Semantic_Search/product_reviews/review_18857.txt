These are nice sandals, reminds me of the ones I had when I was a little girl. I am usually a 7 1/2 wide and since I have short toes, got these in a 7 WW and I am glad I did. I don't have that extra inch of space in front and the width is perfect, actually doesn't seem wide to me, but Just Right.I like the soft padding but every time I take a step, it blows out air somewhere and makes and embarrassing hissing sound!! Very strange and I really hope it goes away with more wear.And the last pet peeve, though you can see it from the photo, is that the strap that goes over the top of the foot is not very long, but seems to be ok so far.Bottom Line: so far, so good, hoping the good will turn to great...
