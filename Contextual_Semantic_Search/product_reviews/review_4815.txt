I ordered a medium I'm 5'6 140 lbs and this jacket is great! My only complaint is that its a little long and kind of boxy, but that's what the cinch cord is made for. Overall it was a good purchase. Tapered seems and fully waterproof, it makes rainy days just a little more bearable especially if you're a college student like me that walks to class.
