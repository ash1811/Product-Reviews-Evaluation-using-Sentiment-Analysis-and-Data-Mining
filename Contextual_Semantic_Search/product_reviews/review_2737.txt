I'm hard on watches -- They usually get scratched faces way before they stop working.  I buy this model because it has an alarm, 2 time zones, backlighting, and a timer that I frequently use when I'm grilling.I knocked this down a couple of stars because months after it arrived I discovered the backlighting does not work.
