Its now 1/1/14 and I'm still very happy to have bought Ugg and this is the best fit. One half size bigger. It will stretch a bit but will stand up to the outdoor. You will want to wear it all the time.  They are warm, comfortable and I find myself wanting to wear them when I drive around town. You cannot tell they are slippers. They are stylish and have a very good sole. If you are in the car on those cold mornings you will appreciate them more.  I wore them year round even in the summer as I only had to take off my socks. No smell in the sole and the tread is great.  The outer sole is excellent and can be clean with a good brush. Try them and you won't regret it. I now have two pairs off UGGS,  the stone boots with the full liner and will be buying neither pair of loafers.
