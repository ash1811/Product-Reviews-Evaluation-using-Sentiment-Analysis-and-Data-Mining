I recently bought a six pack of these gold toe sock in black, because $12 was a great price for a six pack of gold toes. I can tell you they are not the same quality of the pairs I had 5 years ago, and it makes sense why the price has gone down. They have changed them and have made them lesser quality, so that now they fit too loosely, they are thinner, less comfortable, and the material seems more coarse and more prone to wearing out. They have ruined what was a great sock. I recommend buying Adidas or Nike dri-fit socks which I now consider to be better quality.
