I wear a size 11 so finding shoes or sandals can be a challenge. I ordered these and they fit like a dream. Even offering support in the arch of my foot. Surprising for a "flip flop". The way they are constructed, with the straps across the top of the foot, make them feel more like a regular type sandal than a flip flop.
