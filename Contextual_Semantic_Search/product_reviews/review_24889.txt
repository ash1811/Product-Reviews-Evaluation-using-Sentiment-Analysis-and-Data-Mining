I have been looking for a wallet with this type of change purse for a long time. My grandmother had one when I was a little girl. This wallet holds all my credit/debit/membership cards and still closes fine with the checkbook out of it. Since I rarely write a check these days, that isn't a problem at all. I love that it has no zippers as the last few wallets that I have replaced only needed to be replaced because of a bad zipper. It seems to be well constructed and is real leather so it should last a long time.
