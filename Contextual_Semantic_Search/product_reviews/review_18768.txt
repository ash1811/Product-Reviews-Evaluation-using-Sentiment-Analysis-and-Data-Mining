Very happy with my purchase.  The best thing about the leather sneakers and the main reason why I buy them is because you can wipe them off.  I have had canvas shoes before which are basically the same to me but when they get dirty I either have to try and wash them and hope the shoe stays intact or leave them dirty!  I don't know about you but every time I put on something white I get it dirty!  I would definitely recommend.
