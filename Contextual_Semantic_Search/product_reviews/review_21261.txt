My sister introduced me to Sanuk flip flops, and I have since bought three pair.  I love them and wear them every day.  I would love to eventually have them in most all colors.  I have neuropathy in my feet (as does my sis) and these shoes help the hyper-sensitivity in my feet, and make it possible to walk comfortably wherever I go.  Don't go another day without them.  You too will be amazed.
