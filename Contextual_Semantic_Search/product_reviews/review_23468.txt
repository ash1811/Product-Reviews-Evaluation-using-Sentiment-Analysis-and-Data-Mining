This purse has many pockets, but beware if you have a fat wallet. It has sections for credit cards and other cards but they are too shallow, and fall out. The cell phone pocket on the outside fits my Iphone 4 + case perfectly. There are two zipper middle pockets inside for mirror, etc. If you are the kind who likes to throw water bottles, sunscreen in your purse this is not the purse for you. Anything large/thick makes the purse look awkward and bulky.I do like this purse but mine arrived with the white lining showing, and it was dirty so I returned. I would have kept it if not for the nylon fabric. I hate the feeling of nylon against my skin, and as much as I tried to like the nylon I couldn't do it. Overall a good design, needs a few improvements. I just wish Baggalini would make purses in something OTHER then nylon!
