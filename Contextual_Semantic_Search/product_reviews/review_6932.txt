I originally ordered these for my Mom and the socks were too large for her small feet. But I now have 3 great pairs of socks. The socks are very soft and fit so well. The fit is very smooth and seamless. I have worn these inside my house slippers and they stay up. The tops stay up without marking my ankles. Doesn't get any better than that.
