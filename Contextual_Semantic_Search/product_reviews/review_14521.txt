This is an extremly comfortable shoe...but you need to get the right size, I actually went to a shoe store and tried on several styles and sizes, who knew I would take a narrow ....I usually wear a woman's size 10, I ended up with a 42 narrow in a different style that was the most comfortable.Great shoe, next time I'll know what size to order.
