Excellent materials that are durable but breathe well, however, there are some thing one should know. Firstly, Bark is olive drab not khaki. I have no idea where amazon got the pics for this product. Secondly, the lining in the back pockets are only on the exterior wick makes them better than nothing, but also makes it no less likely that any sharp object put therin will stab you in the ass. Third, the was a lot of loose threads on my pair whe I bought them so inspect your garment well before you pull off the tags.
