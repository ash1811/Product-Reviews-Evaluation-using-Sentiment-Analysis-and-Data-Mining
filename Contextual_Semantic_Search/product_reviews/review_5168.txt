This watch is perfect for me.When I lost my 8 year old watch on the train, there were features that I had to have on my new one and this watch has them all.- The indiglo light is a must for me as I'm often in a dark room and need to know what time it is.  The light is just right without causing a disturbance for others.- Once I started looking for a watch, the date feature became very attractive to me.  I use it all the time now and don't have to look at the calendar on my cell phone as often.- The gold and silver look of the watch set things up for me so that I can wear any earrings, etc. and feel it all comes together.- Water proof and comfortable to wear.  It's great!
