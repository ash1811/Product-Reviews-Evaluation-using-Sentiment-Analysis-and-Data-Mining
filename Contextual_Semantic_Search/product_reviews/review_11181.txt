OMG.  These are so comfortable.  Great for hiking, walking, and soon will test out at festival-going!  They do not seem to need ANY break-in.  Nice wide toe box.  As all the reviews state, go up by half size.  I wear a 9 and got a 9.5.  I have a little extra room at both front and back but the extra room allows for foot swelling. I may have been able to get by with a 9, but I'm very happy.Yay for upcoming Bonnaroo 2014!
