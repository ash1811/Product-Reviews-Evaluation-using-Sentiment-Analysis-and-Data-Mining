These are very well made underwear.  I've been wearing this style for over ten years and every new batch I get are better made each time.  Better materials, more stitching, and the elastic lasts longer.  I like this style because it holds my junk where I like it to be held, they don't ride up, and they always clean easily.  My only complaint I doubt there's a solution for.  At times you might grow out of them, right up and over the waist band, because there's no 'stretch' in them.  Fortunately this is always a temporary condition.
