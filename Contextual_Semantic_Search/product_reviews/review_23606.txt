I gave them a five star rating due to the quality being great and the photo doesn't look as good as they do when wearing them.  The moonstones are beautiful and flawless.  I also love how light they are.  I don't like earrings that are too heavy and these are the perfect weight.  They were also delivered before the estimated date so that is always a good sign that this is a good company and I would order from them again and recommend them to friends and family.
