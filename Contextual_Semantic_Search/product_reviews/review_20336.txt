It's a nice shirt.  I bought two.  Material is not too heavy but heavy enough that you can't see though it.  I've washed them a couple of times and they haven't shrunk.  The band on the collar hasn't wrinkled like some do when they aren't sewn right.  It's really a nice quality.  The fit is ok.  I ordered small, I usually wear extra small or small.  I didn't want a tight fit so I went with small.  It fits well through the shoulders, the neck is not too tight, but it is snug at the hips and the cut is straight so it sort of billows at the waist which is ok.  I would definitely recommend buying it.
