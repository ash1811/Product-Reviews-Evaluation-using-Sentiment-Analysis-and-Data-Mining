Please note: the watch is fantastic. It's the description of the size that is the problem. As I now see another reviewer mentioned, the watch should be advertised as Women's not Unisex.I have subsequently purchased the Men's version of this watch, the Timex Men's T5E901. I absolutely love the watch. The functionality is the same as the &#34;Unisex&#34; (Women's), but the strap and face on the 901 are larger.This is the perfect workout watch, especially if you swim as well. It's low profile but very functional. Ladies, this 961 is the right size for you. Gents, I'd suggest considering the 901.
