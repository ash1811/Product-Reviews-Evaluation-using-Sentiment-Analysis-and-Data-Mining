We ordered the Wheelie from JL Childress thinking it would fit when comparing measurements.  It did NOT fit.  The ProRide is a new seat and you don't see a lot mentioned on which bags will fit this seat.  The Ultimate fit just perfectly.  No complaints.  Nicely padded.  Nice straps.  My husband wished for wheels, but we were already wheeling two bags of luggage so the backpack on this made it just perfect.  Buy it for your Recaro ProRide!!!
