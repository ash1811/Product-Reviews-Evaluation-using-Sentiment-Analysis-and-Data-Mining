Being an actor, I was looking for something trashy for a character.  I figured with the name Hanes and such a cheap price, I would get something really bad - something I could use for this particular scene and little else.  What I ended up getting was something I actually like and might wear some time.  I was able to match the shirt with something awful for the part, but the shirt is actually not too bad.
