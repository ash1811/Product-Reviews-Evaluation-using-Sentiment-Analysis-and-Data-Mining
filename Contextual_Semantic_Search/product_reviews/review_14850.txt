I am 5' 9" tall, 160 pounds and average build. I purchased the Carhartt and Wrangler Riggs work shirts in size large, to allow for dryer shrinkage.Overall, the Riggs shirts come out of the dryer ready to wear and have a nice, soft feel. The Carhartts come out of the dryer wrinkled, especially the collar and seemed to shrink a bit more, which I can feel with a slight restriction of my upper body movements.The ONLY advantages my Carhartts over the Riggs is the long sleeved variant has more room in the forearm area, where the Riggs is a bit snug, and they have a much larger color selection.Overall the Riggs seems to be a noticeably better shirt.
