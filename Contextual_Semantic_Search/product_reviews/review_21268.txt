This is my third color (black) in these flip flops. I love the gingham on the inside but my favorite part is the yoga mat bottom. I can walk for miles in these and not feel an ounce of pain in my feet, legs or lower back. These are my favorite flip flops and I highly recommend them, especially if you live in a city and walk a lot!  Cute and comfortable - what more can you ask for?
