I am surprised by all the glowing reviews for these flip flops.  Yes, the are comfortable, but they are also very utilitarian looking. I was expecting something a bit cuter and more graceful when I ordered them.  Instead, they just look like unisex black flip flops, no feminine characteristics at all.  The strap proportions and styling are just like my husbands' and my son's Sanuks.  I love the gingham check inside the straps but it is invisible when the sandals are on your feet.  I wasn't looking for something girly, but I was surprised that these flip flops lacked all feminine flair.Also, and more importantly, they soak up water like a sponge and take a long time to dry out.  This isn't practical for flip flops! Other reviewers have also noted this but I didn't read carefully before I ordered.
