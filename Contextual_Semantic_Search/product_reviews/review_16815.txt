I really needed an outdoors shirt for when working in the brush -..mostly to protect myself from poison ivy and scratches. This is a great shirt for that use. I normally wear a 2XL tall dress shirt, so ordered a 3XL version. Perfect fit with good room for stretching and for wearing a longsleeve tee underneath. Nicely prewashed and soft to the touch but its is very strongly constructed. Highly recommended.
