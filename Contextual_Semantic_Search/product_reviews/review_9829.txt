I purchased this 6 or so months ago and do not regret it at all. In this period, I have smacked it against hard surfaces and it has not scratched at all. It holds a charge even when not in sunlight for weeks. I would definitely recommend a leather strap to go with the watch. There's not much else to say about it, it's a great watch for those who are purchasing their first semi-expensive watch and those who own many other watches.One tip, you can take it to a jeweler to have it fitted. But if you have some all metal thumb tacks and a hammer, you can fit it yourself. It's really easy even on the first try. Also, a small eyeglass screwdriver will work in place of a spring bar tool if you want to replace the strap.
