I have been wearing these socks for 20 years!  They are the best socks to wear around the house or out walking.  Only a few stores sell them locally and it seems like when I check in to buy the socks there is only one pair left. So happy to find that Amazon now sells them for about the same price as the local stores and they have multiple quantities.
