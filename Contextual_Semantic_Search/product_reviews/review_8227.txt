For this price, $85, there is no way you can find a better watch. This is a solid stainless steel watch waterproof to withstand 200 meters. It has a scratch resistant mineral crystal and a workhorse under the hood, the Miyota 8215, a 21 jewel automatic movement comparable to Seiko's 7S26, and ETA's 2824-2. I bought this watch for $99 and have no regrets. It feels heavy and the bracelet is well made. If you want a Rolex look alike with a performance to match , this is the watch. Another version with coin edge bezel is available, but it cost a little bit more. This is the watch that made people wonder if Rolex watches are really worth the money. Also, for $350, you can get model 9937, the swiss version with sapphire crystal, and 25 jewel automatic movement.
