I own all the camo colors- tiger stripe camo (not shown) is actually my favorite.Not the highest quality shorts but for &#60;$25 they are well worth the money.  Construction is good; although I recommend washing in cold water and hang dry to reduce any color fading and minimize possibly breaking the lightweight zipper or popping buttons.The long length is good for those 6ft and over.  I like the adjustable waist as I tend to lose weight from end of Winter towards Summer.  I can wear the same shorts and not worry about them being too tight at first then becoming too loose in the Summer.I also use these shorts for hiking and mountain biking.  Some of the camo shorts I've owned have lasted multiple years which is great for them being inexpensive and the activity I put them through.
