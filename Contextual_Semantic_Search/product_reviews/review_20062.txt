These are like being barefoot without all the Legos, sewing pins and parts of broken dishes that were missed in the clean up.I used to live barefoot for almost 20 years.Shoes never felt right, then I moved out to a place with weather that forces you to learn to wear shoes.These are the answer for most of the shoe requiring times, like having toddlers or people who repair things and ask if anyone saw where that screw went.
