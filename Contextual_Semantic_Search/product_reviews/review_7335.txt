The only reason I took a star away from this rating was the fact that the black ones do NOT have the cute little daisy print on the inside. It's just a plain white material. I know that may seem a little picky, but if you are going to show the product, show it accurately, or note that it doesn't come with that design on the inside. That was actually one of the reasons I bought this one, outside of the price.Otherwise, it's a pretty good shoe overall. The wide shoes are little too wide on the sides, but a good width at the toes. I had to buy my daughter at least 1/2 size larger than she normally wears, and in the wide width.Other than the pattern inside the shoe, the only thing I've noticed as a draw back is when I tighten them with the string, they tighten in the back first, which makes them too tight on her heal before they are tight enough on the side. That's the only comfort issue she's had with them. But, the extra room on the side doesn't look too bad and they don't slip off.Overall, I'm happy with these shoes. I think they are good buy, and they have held up well so far. She mostly plays in them, and has worn them outside. No scuffs so far. I think you'll be pleased, but if I were you, just go up 1/2 a size to make sure they fit. That way she'll have room to grow in them. You can also tighten them, so a little larger shouldn't be that big of a deal.Good luck.
