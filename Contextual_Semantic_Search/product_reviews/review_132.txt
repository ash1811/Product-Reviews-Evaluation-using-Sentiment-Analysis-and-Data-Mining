We bought these wings to go with the Buzz Lightyear deluxe costume, and it really made the costume whole! They are inflatable so some care is needed but we have had them for a year and a half now and my son still uses them for &#34;super hero&#34; play time. Great buy, would recommend to anyone buying the deluxe costume for a great and i believe necessary add on.
