The only thing that would improve these shorts would be if they were made of cotton.  These aren't made for women but they fit fine and are very comfortable.  I don't like pockets on my shorts, don't like shorts with uncovered waistline elastic, like them long and these are almost exactly perfect,  I'm very happy.
