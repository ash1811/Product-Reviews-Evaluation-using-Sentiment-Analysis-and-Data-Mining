I was excited to try out these cute moccasins, as I was happy with the other styles of Minnetoka's I have owned in the past.  However, within 3 days of wearing them the lining of the soles started coming apart!! I tried to put the lining of the sole back in place, but the glue they used has became gummy and lost its adhesiveness.  I am very disappointed in this product and will think twice before purchasing another pair of Minnetonka's.
