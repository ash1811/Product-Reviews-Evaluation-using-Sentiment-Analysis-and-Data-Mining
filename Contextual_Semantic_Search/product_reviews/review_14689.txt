These were not my first pair of coquette's. At first I felt like a previous reviewer and didn't think they were authentic. They don't look expensive like uggs normally do. The structure of the slipper was not sturdy. By that I mean when I put them on the entire top of the slipper moved like fabric scuffs.  The soles do not come out for replacement and are soles are &#34;ouch&#34; hard. I wore them so I won't send them back but I won't buy them anymore either. The ones I received were made in Vietnam. So much for Australia! I also purchased a pair of ugg ansley charms, they were too tight. I settled on a pair of  ugg &#34;I Do&#34; short boots Pretty pricey for a pair of house shoes but warm shoes in Wyoming winters are a luxurious necessity.  I've been treating myself to ugg products for years. They just don't seem as high  quality and substantial as they used to. Last year I bought a pair of bailey button knee high boots by ugg. Guess what... the insoles don't come out so I can change them. Fashion vs. substance I guess.  My husband has been wearing the same pair of ugg men's slippers for about 6 years now, we've replaced the insoles twice. I know coquette's aren't going to last forever, who wants forever house shoes, but I expect more from ugg.
