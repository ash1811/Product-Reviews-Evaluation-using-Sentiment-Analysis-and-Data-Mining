Yeah, they're ugly.  But they're comfortable to wear on cold days, which is why I wear them.  They're not cheap in price, but they do last quite a while, so for me it makes more financial sense to buy a pair that lasts versus buying a new pair or pairs of boots that don't and I may or may not like as much.  The black dye does &#34;leak&#34; onto socks, so keep that in mind when buying the black boots.
