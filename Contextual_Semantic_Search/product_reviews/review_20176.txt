I bought this hat for general outdoor activities whether it be hiking or mowing the lawn or just sitting in the sun at the beach.  Its light weight and breathes well and for those of us with fair skin it really saves the back of your neck from sunburn.  It seems  pretty well made for my use.  If you are going head first though thicket/thorns when hiking or hunting it may not be up to your standards.Also I wear this in the milder parts of winter.  It keeps the windchill down and can keep your head and neck warm but not the the point of sweating.  I tend to have trouble with a regular scarf getting to hot around the neck or getting in the way.  Also its easier to unbutton/unzip the neck of your jacket if you need a little ventilation after working up some heat.
