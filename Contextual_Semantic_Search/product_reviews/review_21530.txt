Some call this cosmetic bag pricey, but once I used it, what I paid for it didn't matter. It is fantastic. I can fit everything I need for a 2 week vacation plus my usual makeup. The quality is excellent, the zippers, stitching, vinyl fabric. I have never had a hanging cosmetic bag before and my first use was in a small bathroom with no vanity space. It is so convenient, hangs on hooks or doorknobs. Highly recommend!
