I think sneakers are a matter of personal taste. I like the ones that let me "feel the road." I have had a pair of these for years and this is an additional pair, I was afraid they would stop making them or change the way they make them so I bought the extra pair. I always reach for these. Due to their styling they also just look good with shorts, capri pants, etc.
