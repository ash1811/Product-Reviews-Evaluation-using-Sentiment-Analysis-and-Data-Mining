Got this for my friend who is a workout buff and wants to show off his masterpiece upper arms. The price was good and the quality seems fine. He felt it ran a bit large so put it in the wash immediately to tighten it up (I got him a 'medium' and he wanted it more snug than loose). He is about 5'8 1/2 and 169 lbs if that helps on sizing, with a decent sized (but not super large) chest and fairly narrow waist (32).
