I love the shoes!!! I got a half size bigger and it was a good decision. The bottom of the shoes were slippery but once I got use to the shoes, it was very easy to move around in. The shoes are very lightweight and flexible which was a must. I would recommend these shoes for anyone looking for a lightweight and flexible shoe.
