I bought one pair of these for my husband to see if he liked them. When I saw the quality and heard him talk about the comfort, I immediately ordered another pair.....should have ordered a couple more AND I WILL! I usually order Levi's relaxed but these seem to last so much longer and have the extra room men always want in certain areas (said that as nicely as I could). Now, after washing a couple times, I will no longer purchase those other jeans which are very weak in the pockets/crotch area and seem to tear easily. These Carhartt jeans are amazing! My husband really loves the comfort. I'd recommend them for work, as well as, dress jeans. Very handsome! You get much more quality with Carhartt and pay less. You can't beat that!UPDATED: May 15, 2014 The last jeans I purchased were washed three times and have torn on all corners of the back pockets. I should not have been so quick to give such a great review since the one pair held up pretty good. In looking at them again, the pocket corners are all thin and fraying/tearing ONE MONTH LATER. I use a light laundry detergent and don't leave them in the washer so it can't be that. I guess I will have to continue my search for those sturdy work jeans. If anyone has suggestions, please let me know. Thank you!UPDATED:June 21, 2014 THESE JEANS SUCK! I am returning all three pairs I bought to Carhardt. The entire seat of these jeans finally just ripped two months and just a few washes later. I have already patched all three pairs twice. The material is very, very cheap!
