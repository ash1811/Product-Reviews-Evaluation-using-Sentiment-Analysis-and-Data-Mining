{"text": "This ring is so pretty. My boyfriend got it for me for christmas and it looks way better than expected! I thought the price was great (I feel bad when he spends money on me so being under $15 was perfect!) and all the reviews were so good! I thought it looked nice in the picture, a cute little single stone ring, and boy, when I opened the box I was surprised! I knew all the reviews said good things but the picture did not do it justice! its so shiny! I've never owned a ring more beautiful! I get so many compliaments already! He gave it to me a few days early so I wore it to work sunday and monday, we're not planning on getting married for a few more years cause we're young, but I wear it on my left hand (I wear my class ring on my right) so many customers told me how pretty and shiny my ring was, and a few even congragulated me for being married! It looks real! We work at the same grocery store and our manager asked if we're engaged and so did the lady at my bank! Its so pretty and looks like it would cost more than $13! I love it!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.052427974", "1": "0.35020196", "2": "0.044646736", "3": "0.15660463", "4": "0.036060445", "5": "0.22331646", "6": "0.13674177"}}
