{"text": "COMFY, always comfy.  These are high quality flip flops with memory foam foot-beds.  No pain no worry.  They are stylish and I love the green flower pattern.  This is a brand I really like.  I do usually wear a half size up for (Jambu) flip flops and a full size up for close toed.  Since I know this, they are always the right size.

Yep, I would recommend.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07397217", "1": "0.22524916", "2": "0.27038643", "3": "0.2692543", "4": "0.018274074", "6": "0.1400422"}}
