{"text": "I like the Citizen Eco-Drive models - they are basically maintenance free.  This Eco-Drive is a decent mid-sized model.  If you like big dive watches, then I recommend theCitizen Men's BJ8050 Diver watch.ThisCitizen Men's BN0000-04H Eco-Drive Professional Diver Black Rubber Strap Watchis a true dive watch with a unidirectional bezel and super bright luminous dial.  It even has a convenient No Decompression limits (NDL) table printed on the high quality rubber watch band.SEE MY PHOTOS IN CUSTOMER IMAGESLike all the eco-drive models, this is a 'set it and forget it' watch.  This is great if you are watch collector, or you don't use your dive watch every day.You can replace the strap/band with any 20mm strap/band.  This watch needs no expensive proprietory replacement band that only the manufacturer stocks.  Great!CONS:The numbers are painted on the bezel - so, they would eventually wear (etched on numbers would have been better).The date window is tiny but still readable.The small recessed screw down crown is a bit cumbersome to manipulate.In all fairness, you only need to unscrew the crown to set the date 5 times for the year (for the 30 day months and Feb).I gave this watch 4 STARS.  Despite the limitations, I like this watch.  It's an attractive, quality Citizen Eco-Drive dive watch that is well priced.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.29636055", "1": "0.11301073", "2": "0.25854588", "3": "0.104590006", "5": "0.039266467", "6": "0.18631983"}}
