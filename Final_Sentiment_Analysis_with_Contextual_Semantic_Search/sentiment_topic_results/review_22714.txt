{"text": "Not the best pants in the world but these are Dickies. If you want a pair of &#34;office casual&#34; pants that will last you and are cheap these are it. Wash them a few times before wearing to lessen the &#34;swish&#34; sound they make as you walk and loosen them up a bit.Like the header says, standard. These pants are pants. You get 2 front pockets and 2 back packets that will fit keys, a wallet, a lighter. Hook snap at waist and zipper fly.  Color. I never iron them. Standard wash and dry. If I leave them in the drier too long they come out wrinkled and I just hang them for a day and they come out fine.I bought these to replace 2 other pairs I have in rotation that I have worn at the office for 3 years now.Belt loops are a tad tight for thicker leather belt.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.27933353", "1": "0.28285933", "2": "0.04562376", "3": "0.06534594", "4": "0.083991215", "5": "0.12251442", "6": "0.12033182"}}
