{"text": "Purchased this bag because the one I had has seen better days. Took it to NYC this weekend and walked around all day with it pretty much full. It is very comfortable to wear and made of light, yet tough materials. The strap successfully transfers the weight from the lower part of the bag (my back) to my shoulders. It has plenty of padding and was very easy to wear. It is easily adjustable to suit. After wearing it all day my shoulders were a little sore but that's not because of the bag. If anything it helped spare my back and legs. Being on your feet for 12+ hours walking around will make anyone's back sore.The bag has plenty of space to store all your items. An excellent day trip/overnight bag. It will also be very nice for hiking. Excellent areas inside the bag to store all your stuff and/or keep it separated. It seems to be well built. Not the most heavily constructed bag. For one of those you will need to purchase a $100+ trekking bag. But this will suit me just fine. I can use it for many purposes. Can't beat the price/quality and I am very happy with my purchase!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.058622476", "1": "0.32268757", "2": "0.15933754", "4": "0.04899331", "5": "0.27674502", "6": "0.13133307"}}
