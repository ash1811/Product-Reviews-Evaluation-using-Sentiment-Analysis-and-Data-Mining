{"text": "I was trying to stay away from the casio brand because it was going to be a gift and I was looking for something a little more 'high end'. Casio seemed to be the only brand that offered the design I was looking for, digital and analog together.This review would be more like 4.5 stars, the product has been owned and worn daily for about 3 weeks now, the only draw back seems to be that while it hasn't scratched the glass has scuffed easily.Apart from that one thing which so far has caused no permanent damage it's better than I was expecting. It came in a nice box that I could easily wrap, easy to follow instructions and secure packaging.The features are really cool, multiple alarms, you can set the analog hands and the digital read out to different time zones, it tells you not only the date buy day of the week. The seconds are a digital circular count down. While it's a bit large it doesn't look bulky or bad at all. I must have looked at 300 watches before deciding on this one and so far I believe I chose the right one. While there are alot of featues a quick read through of the instructions show it's actually pretty easy to set things and easy to remember for the next time. Overall so far good product and I would reccomend and am glad I chose this for my gift", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.052341957", "1": "0.1723953", "2": "0.21345347", "3": "0.23617063", "4": "0.07508721", "5": "0.06350854", "6": "0.18704286"}}
