{"text": "This is my fifth pair of these shoes.  Dockers has been making them for several years and they are a good all purpose waterproof work casual shoe.  The uppers are durable and a change made (in pair 3, I think) to the inside of the shoes has made them both more comfortable and long lasting.  The only reasons these don't get a 5 star rating are the shoe laces, which neither stay tied nor last, and the soles, which have very shallow lugs that wear away relatively  quickly compared to the uppers.The upper leather grain varies from pair to pair from almost smooth to &#34;football&#34; pebbling--that all look pretty good. For the money, these are a good value and do the job.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.27974278", "2": "0.32218158", "3": "0.093145676", "4": "0.08923262", "5": "0.13450766", "6": "0.07894931"}}
