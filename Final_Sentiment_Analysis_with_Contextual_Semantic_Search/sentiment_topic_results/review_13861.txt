{"text": "I needed some simple shoes for walking my dog and climbing the steps at work.  I didn't want to have to tie them and I didn't care if they were fancy, so I went with these.I'm mostly happy with them.  They are easy to get on and off without using my hands.  They're a little snug but I do think they fit true to size (and I was getting them to replace some shoes that were a size too big, so I may just be having to make an adjustment).  They seem well made and are generally comfortable to walk in.The only thing I don't care for is that the right shoe gave me a big blister on the back of my ankle; it has since rubbed pretty raw and I have to keep a bandaid on it.  I'm not taking off too much from my rating for that because I have had this problem with other new shoes, as well.  Just be forewarned that if you're not used to wearing Keds or other shoes that are approximately this height, there may be a breaking-in period.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24524862", "1": "0.40501136", "2": "0.10592402", "3": "0.043565392", "4": "0.067611486", "6": "0.12998272"}}
