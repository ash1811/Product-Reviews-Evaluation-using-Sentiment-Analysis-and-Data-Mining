{"text": "I've been buying Hanes black tube socks for most of my life.  They've always been 100% cotton, durable, and comfortable.  Well all that is over it seems.  These are a mere 64% cotton -- the rest acrylic and poly BS.  Much like their underwear, it seems 100% cotton is now too much to ask for in this world.  They still seem reasonably durable, but the softness is gone replaced with a much rougher texture.  I'm disappointed.Update 11/2013It's been under 2 years since I bought these socks. I am throwing them away at an alarming rate as all the heels have developed huge holes.  I have other socks that are 5 years old or older still going strong.  These are garbage.  They linted and linted until there was nothing left from the inside.  Lint gets everywhere when you pull them off.That's it, I'm done with Hanes forever.  Another trustworthy, American brand destroyed by cheap Chinese manufacturing.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06924312", "1": "0.18882723", "2": "0.124076106", "3": "0.3893517", "4": "0.072220474", "5": "0.10002127", "6": "0.056260083"}}
