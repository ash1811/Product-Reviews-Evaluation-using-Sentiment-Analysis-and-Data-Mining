{"text": "With this inexpensive grade of diamonds, visible flaws are  very likely, as are off-colors.  Maybe I lucked out, but the 1/3 cttw stones in these earrings were surprisingly bright and clear to the unaided eye.The slightly smaller size of 1/3cttw may make these flaws less apparent. Your results may be hit-or-miss depending on your particular stones. Mine was more hit than miss, so I gave these pretty earrings to my wife. I also got a pair of the 1/2 cttw diamonds (very similar but more expensive):14k White Gold, Round, Diamond Stud Earrings (1/2 cttw, J-K Color, I2-I3 Clarity). That pair was dull and cloudy, as shown by shining a flashlight into the stones, so they were returned.Amazon's lenient return policy applies equally to jewelry, of course.For me at least, these 1/3 cttw earrings worked well.
