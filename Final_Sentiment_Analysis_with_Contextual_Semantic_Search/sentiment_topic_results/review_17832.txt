{"text": "Received this as a gift and it is a major upgrade from my previous casio watch. I have had no problems at all with any of the functions of the watch, it has survived already lots of time in the water and trips to the gym. I love the second counter display, the light is bright enough and it is just heavy enough to have a decent weight. Great watch overall. Band is also very comfortable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21741727", "1": "0.25922033", "2": "0.21453612", "3": "0.05091212", "4": "0.13629895", "6": "0.1175155"}}
