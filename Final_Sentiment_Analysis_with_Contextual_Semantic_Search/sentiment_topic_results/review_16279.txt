{"text": "My first pair of these were bought by my lovely wife for me as a gift.  After two years (being the only foot covering I've worn around the house) of constant wear, they are getting too ratty to go to the store in :)So I had to get a second pair.  Am still using the first pair when out in the garage, etc.  They fit a touch snug for the first week or so, but then conform to your feet, so don't buy them loose!  I wear a 12EEEE (New Balance), and the 12EEE in this slipper works great!BTW - thank God for Amazon, and the 'order history' - it makes repeat buys much easier when you can't read the tag any longer!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10351559", "1": "0.24636799", "2": "0.09430753", "3": "0.25139225", "4": "0.10808833", "5": "0.05338128", "6": "0.14294706"}}
