{"text": "This watch is Retro Cool - you grandpa might have worn this in the 1970's.Got it today at WalMart for $28.92.  I like the blue face and spartanly simple dial.Planned to immediately put it on a green canvas strap, but found I actually like the silver expansion band! I last wore an expansion band in 1970. The watch and expansion band have slim profile and won't trip you up walking through a doorway like a lot of the trendy 42+ mm watches. This watch has a pleasingly classic appearance.  Still might put it on the green canvas band later, though.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22290567", "2": "0.27132276", "3": "0.25910413", "4": "0.10900213", "6": "0.13280503"}}
