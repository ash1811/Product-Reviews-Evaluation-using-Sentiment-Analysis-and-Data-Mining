{"text": "I'll keep this short. The shoes fit, they are a size 7.5, i am between a 7-7.5, depends on the shoe, I know my feet well. The reason they only get 4 stars is because when I bought them, it was just ONE PAIR. In the checkout, it still had them as ONE PAIR, but tell me why when they get delivered they are in a GIANT box, and there are THREE PAIRS of the white keds I got, and I was charged for ALL 3 PAIRS. I was pretty effin pissed, so right now I'm still in the process of settling the refund for two of the pair I returned, and I kept the one pair. Weird how that happened, and annoying and time consuming. But the shoe itself is really nice, and pure white, how I wanted it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.027250716", "1": "0.1550425", "2": "0.08643024", "3": "0.37417263", "4": "0.3246345", "5": "0.029868413"}}
