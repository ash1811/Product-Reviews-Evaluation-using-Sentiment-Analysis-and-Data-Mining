{"text": "I use these shorts as pajamas in warmer weather.  I like that they have pockets for carrying stuff around the house.  However, they are fairly thick and I don't ever see myself using them for exercising, there are plenty of better options out there.  I'm also curious how Soffe shirts, which are a cotton poly blend, can be top of the line undershirts in my opinion in terms of fit and feel, but these shorts are just average at best.  I think soffe should thin these things out and make them in line with the undershirts and they'd have a great product.I have a 35 inch waist and the large fits well.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12963526", "1": "0.34899685", "2": "0.06772292", "3": "0.19224733", "4": "0.0678696", "5": "0.022541896", "6": "0.17098618"}}
