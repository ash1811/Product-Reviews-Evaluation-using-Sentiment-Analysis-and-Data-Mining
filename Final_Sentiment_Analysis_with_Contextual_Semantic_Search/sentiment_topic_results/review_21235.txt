{"text": "I owned these sneakers years ago, and have always described them as &#34;walking on clouds&#34;. Recently, I needed a pair of sneakers for walking, and decided to see if they were still available~~~and, much to my surprise, they were! My original pair were men's, so I duplicated that purchase with these, and could not be more pleased with the comfort! I take a size 9 in women's, and the 8 in men's are a perfect fit and allow a little extra room!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.48162046", "2": "0.089687385", "3": "0.09589795", "5": "0.18759876", "6": "0.13834457"}}
