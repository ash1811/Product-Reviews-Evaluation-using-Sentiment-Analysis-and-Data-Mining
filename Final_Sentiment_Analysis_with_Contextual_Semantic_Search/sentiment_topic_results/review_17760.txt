{"text": "I bought this DW5600E after my Casio GW700 started to go goofy on me.  My first 5600 survived 28 years.  I thought the GW700 would do the same or better, what with Atomic TIme and Solar Power, oh my.  Like most reviewers have indicated, after about a year and a half the back light (way cool blue) started coming on with minimal arm motion, which drains the battery.  The Solar Power became less and less effective, meaning the bloody watch wouldn't hold a charge, regardless of how much direct sunlight the watch was exposed to.  I'm a soccer referee (albeit in Seattle where sunlight is precious) and often on the pitch from dawn to dusk (which you would think would be enough sunlight to charge the bleeding battery.)  Instead, in the middle of matches, the entire face would go black while the watch communed with the radio signal in Colorado or something, for 10-25 minutes at a time.  \"Ref, how much time to play?\"  Uh, I dunno, and run over to an assistant referee and tell him to give me a sign for when the half ends.So I was in the market for a waterproof (it rains a bit in Seattle, eh?), blast proof (G-Shock), low maintenance, relatively accurate watch, with some kind of stopwatch/timer that was easy to use, and built without even a nod to planned obsolescence (Sp?).  You know, kind of like my first G-Shock. 28 years is longer than most marriages these days.  Anyway, I read a blistering review on Amazon from somebody that refocused my priorities: day, date, time, and timer function.  And forget about how easy it is not to have to reset the time when changing time zones or going on Daylight Savings Time.  Forget about Solar Power which only lasts a year and a half.  And forget about way cool blue, that energy-sucking vampire light.Most difficult for me was giving up on aesthetics.  My GW700 came with a black metal band, a low profile round case, a black display, and a raised cool blue metal face guard.  The 5600E ain't changed in years:  grey display, black display numbers and letters, ultra-thin low-profie rectangular box shape, and too many print sizes and colors cluttering up the display, making for an ugly grandfather when seen next to the GW700.  But it works.  Reliably.  On and off the pitch.  I don't need a piece of art on my wrist.  I need a watch with a stopwatch function that works under any conditions.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16194311", "1": "0.12732945", "2": "0.114512995", "3": "0.15466596", "4": "0.040899664", "5": "0.28676534", "6": "0.113883495"}}
