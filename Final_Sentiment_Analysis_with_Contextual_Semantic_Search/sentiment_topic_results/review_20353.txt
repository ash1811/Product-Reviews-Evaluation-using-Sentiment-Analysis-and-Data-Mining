{"text": "I ordered the black tank in 34F/G.  I am somewhere between a 34GG and 36H right now in bras.  This did not fit at all.  Not even close to getting it over my boobs. So I returned it.  I knew I was probably pushing it since this is sized for an F/G but it's really hard to find a nursing tank out there for someone my size.  It looked nice though and if you are truly a F/G it might actually fit.I also ordered the Glamourmom Full Bust Nursing Bra Top in long and that actually fits pretty well.  If you're in my size range I would definitely go with that over this.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10313582", "1": "0.20902008", "2": "0.07845793", "3": "0.22355963", "4": "0.10709308", "5": "0.05027002", "6": "0.22846344"}}
