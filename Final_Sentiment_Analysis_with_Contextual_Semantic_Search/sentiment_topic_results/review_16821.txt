{"text": "As a woman with large, hard-to-fit feet (12ish, and wide) and a variety of minor health complaints, it's hard to find shoes that are in my size, don't hurt any part of my body, and are not as expensive as a houseboat. People have their complaints about Crocs, but I have found nothing better, and I have nearly a dozen pairs stashed in my closet now, for fear that one day the supply might dry up and I would be left sole-less again. I love that they are available in crazy colors, too--\"grape\" is my current favorite. After years of being told \"maybe you can find something in the men's department\" or being pointed toward grey nun-like oxfords while other women could wear whatever they wanted, it's at least something of a consolation prize.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.023675287", "1": "0.22721851", "2": "0.1606022", "3": "0.29578677", "4": "0.09826657", "5": "0.061895344", "6": "0.13255535"}}
