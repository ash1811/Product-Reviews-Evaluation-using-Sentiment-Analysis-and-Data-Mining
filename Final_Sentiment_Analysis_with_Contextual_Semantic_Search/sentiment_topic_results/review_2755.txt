{"text": "I'm glad that Keds are back in style because it's great to have a shoe that's both cute and comfortable.  I had been wearing a knock-off version, and I am impressed with how much more cushioning and support the name-brand Keds have.  They seem to run about a half size long and a little narrow.  I usually wear an 8.5M, but I found the 8W in these shoes was just about right.  (I probably could have worn the 8M, but the 8W will allow for thicker socks in the winter.)  Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04170251", "1": "0.2949781", "2": "0.050080135", "3": "0.2945887", "5": "0.19489121", "6": "0.12076644"}}
