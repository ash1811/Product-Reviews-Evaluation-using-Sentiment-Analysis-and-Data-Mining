{"text": "We bought these shoes for our 7 year old son as he needed a new pair of dress shoes to wear with a suit.  These Deer Stags had many favorable reviews on Amazon so we gave them a shot.  When the shoes came, they looked good, felt well made and my son said they felt comfortable on.  They fit true to size as well.  Another nice thing about these shoes is they are versatile enough to be dressy and appropriate with a suit but not so dressy that they look out of place with more casual clothes.  We found these shoes to be a good buy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3580625", "2": "0.21743909", "3": "0.14701492", "4": "0.09862988", "5": "0.04122395", "6": "0.1350686"}}
