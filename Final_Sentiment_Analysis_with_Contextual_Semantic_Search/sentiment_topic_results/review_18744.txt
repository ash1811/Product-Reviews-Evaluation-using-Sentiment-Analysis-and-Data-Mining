{"text": "I got two pairs for my grandson, since I knew he'd grow fast before winter was over. These are nice, soft, foot conforming boots. No, they're not waterproof, but they're not really meant for kids who are walking into puddles and snow drifts anyway. He was able to walk around on dry pavement just fine. They don't have any cushion in the sole, not meant for long walks. Absolutely great for keeping his feet warm in the car.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.24558352", "2": "0.18785174", "3": "0.13477123", "4": "0.22287306", "5": "0.103999116", "6": "0.10176989"}}
