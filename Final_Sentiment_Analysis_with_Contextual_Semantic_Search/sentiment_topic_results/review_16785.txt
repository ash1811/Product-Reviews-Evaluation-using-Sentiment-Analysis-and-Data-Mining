{"text": "This is a gift for my mom on Mother's Day. Watches have always been a fancy for women and they consider it as a fashion accessory. This particular piece I picked from Amazon the Bulova women's white patterned bracelet watch is definitely a jewel. The metal strap comes in a bi-metal design a blend of silver and gold in the shape of tiny hearts. The dial is oval in shape to add grace to the uniquely designed strap.Another worthwhile feature of the watch is that it comes in full Arabic numerals which is hard to find and this gives it a classic look. To top it all the watch is both scratch and water resistant.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.23644279", "1": "0.10839608", "2": "0.2520524", "3": "0.15856385", "4": "0.10569867", "5": "0.025167627", "6": "0.11367858"}}
