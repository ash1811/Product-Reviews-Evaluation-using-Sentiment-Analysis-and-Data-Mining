{"text": "I normally wear a 37w 32 inseam and these fit me fine in large.  In fact, there's probably another inch or so in the inseam and the waist is plenty roomy for me.  There are pull tabs on the waist to adjust the fit, and the legs have cinches at the bottom to allow for you to blouse them above your boots.As someone else mentioned, these are good fair weather pants.  If you want cold/wet gear this won't work for you, but you can get by in cold/dry.The material itself seems durable, though I should note these are military \"style\" pants.  These pants are replacing a set of actual Army BDUs and the material is somewhat different (there is also a zipper fly as opposed to a button fly...I took off one star because zippers don't always work well when out in the field...).  I don't think these will hold up as well as actual issued BDUs but for camping, hiking, or just plain wear these will work fine.  Pockets are generous and there is ample reinforcement along the major stress areas.  The pattern matches the woodland camo pattern of the Rothco Combat Shirt (also sold on Amazon) which is a plus...sometimes there is variation among woodland camo patterns but that's not the case here.I purchased these for a hiking/camping trip in a few months and I think these will work nicely.  Again, if you're looking for indestructable pants these may disappoint, but for moderate duty you will likely be pleased by these.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.030234566", "1": "0.36728835", "2": "0.16628997", "3": "0.17066365", "4": "0.08298758", "5": "0.14258283", "6": "0.03995301"}}
