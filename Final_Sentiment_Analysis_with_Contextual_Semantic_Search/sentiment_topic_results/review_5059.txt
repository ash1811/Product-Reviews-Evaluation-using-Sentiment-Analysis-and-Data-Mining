{"text": "I bought these for my Gf.  We looked around at stores on line and retailers.  We found some that were cheaper than the one's we bought here, but the material was different.  For example, instead of leather there are new models out there that use some kind of synthetic material making the shoe a lot cheaper of course.  I believe that you get what you pay for and shoes that are going to get a lot of wear need to be quality.  These shoes can last for years!  No complaints and no substitution.  Worth the money!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06410312", "1": "0.22984032", "2": "0.22152375", "3": "0.048186645", "4": "0.12838615", "5": "0.20915641", "6": "0.098803625"}}
