{"text": "I was attracted to these at my local department store, and tried them on there. Fortunately so, for I knew to order a size 10 rather than my usual size 9. Mephisto thinks that a European size 40 is a size 10.Amazon's price was much cheaper, so I ordered the shoes from them.The shoes are comfortable right out of the box and have great arch support, but they do tend to run narrow. My foot is average width, and they are barely wide enough for me. If your foot is on the wide side, better choose another sandal.Overall, pleased so far...we'll see how well they wear.Also: the \"silver/sand\" color is actually silver/sand boa---and is a faux snakeskin look that is very attractive---much more so than the photo.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1066195", "1": "0.30964944", "2": "0.18732731", "3": "0.100757994", "4": "0.162741", "6": "0.13076706"}}
