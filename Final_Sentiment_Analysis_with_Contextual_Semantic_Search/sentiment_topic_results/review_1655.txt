{"text": "I wore this under a new dress that showed my pudgy stomach. It really held me in and gave me a smooth look in the dress. Not too much as to not breathe just as if you were sucking it in without actually sucking it in since at some point you relax and boom pudgy stomach! My only complaint is the granny line I wish they came up higher in the leg but these were a good price good fit and actually do what they say. These are not for everyday as one reviewer said. I could not wear these everyday but definitely a must for date night in the slinky dress.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.093984984", "1": "0.31648156", "2": "0.097818464", "3": "0.25157538", "4": "0.13686337", "6": "0.10045888"}}
