{"text": "These are wonderful socks, not too thick, not too thin. I was looking for something like the Columbia hiking socks that I can't find anymore. Those wore like iron. These seem to be of made the same. Three points:These are NOT cotton as is stated below the item. If they were they would not wear like iron. They are Coolmax.The size is correct. I wear a 8 to 9 shoe (depending on brand) and the med. is correct for that.I did notice at the Sports Stores that they don't sell this style anymore. The \"newer\" style seemed a little better fit for a narrow toebox like I have. But, they were a higher price, so I went with these. I ordered 2 pair, and then ordered 2 more pairs after I recd. them and tried them on.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.118077636", "1": "0.3021832", "2": "0.13804182", "3": "0.1366879", "5": "0.20790467", "6": "0.094784714"}}
