{"text": "I received these just in time for the midwest's arctic blast that chilled the wood floors in my home. I wear a size 8 in shoes, so I ordered the size 8-9 knowing that they might be a little big, which is fine; they're compatible with my thick wool socks, and they're easy to slip in and out of. I'm glad I opted for the style that has a covered heel, otherwise I suspect my foot might slip around more. I think they're worth the price I paid for them and hopefully they last me a while. They seem well-made and sturdy. The rubber sole has good grip for climbing my un-carpeted stairs. They don't provide any arch support, but with a slipper I didn't expect that, yet they provide great cushioning that makes walking around on hard, unforgiving wooden floors feel better than it did in just socks. White probably wasn't the smartest choice since I forsee them getting a bit dingy, but I'm only wearing them around the house. I'm very pleased with this purchase so far and I would definitely recommend them or buy them as a gift. I'm also impressed with the other styles and colors of slippers and house shoes I've seen by the Acorn brand on the internet. I'm already tempted to buy another pair.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10628918", "1": "0.1971308", "2": "0.07320842", "3": "0.20976846", "4": "0.2232041", "5": "0.1503413", "6": "0.04005778"}}
