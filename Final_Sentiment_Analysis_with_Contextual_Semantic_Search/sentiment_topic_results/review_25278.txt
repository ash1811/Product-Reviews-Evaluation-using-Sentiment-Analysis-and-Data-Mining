{"text": "Be careful if you have wider feet, you MUST get the wide version of this shoe. My feet are leaning on the wide side and usually I can get away with regular sizes, but not this time. However, when I got the correct size, they feel great! Lots of cushion and support. Great having the mesh on the top and sides too for ventilation. Can't wait to take them on some hikes this spring when the weather gets nicer!! They seem to have very good grip!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.040767673", "1": "0.17698976", "2": "0.19247879", "3": "0.22289363", "4": "0.09841694", "5": "0.06402619", "6": "0.20442699"}}
