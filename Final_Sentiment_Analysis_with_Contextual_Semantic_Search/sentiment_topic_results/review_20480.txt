{"text": "I haven't bought a Timex in years,so I didn't know what to expect.  I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box.  As you may expect from the price, it's not a fancy watch, but it's the perfect watch if you are looking for a simple and inexpensive watch.  I wear mine every day to work and it's quality is what you expect from Timex.  The strap is skinny which is perfect for my small (6 1/2 inch) wrists.  I did not even have to have holes added.  The face is oval and gold tone. If you are looking for a cute watch with a small face this is a watch you should consider.  At it's price, I would definitely buy another if it came is silver tone.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1556703", "1": "0.1820712", "2": "0.20914133", "3": "0.20579584", "4": "0.03829652", "5": "0.16231015", "6": "0.04671465"}}
