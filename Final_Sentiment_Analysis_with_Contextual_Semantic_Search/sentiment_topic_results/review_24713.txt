{"text": "I am writing this review after owning these pants for about six months:  These Red Ledge pants are great.  They are sized true with the understanding that they will be worn over another pair of pants, although sometimes I wear them without another pair of pants underneath, too.  These pants are extremely light and are able to be packed in a (supplied) mesh sack.  They have thus far held up very well during inclement weather outdoor use, snow shoveling duties and the like.  These are my second pair of such pants, with the first pair lasting me ~15 years.  These pants will definitely fit the bill if you are looking for lightweight, waterproof, reasonably priced nylon pants and they will most likely last you a number of years.  The only minor complaints I have are that they are quite noisy when you are walking in them and that the buttons at the bottom, while well intentioned, interfere with walking and bang against your ankle as you are doing activities, particularly if they are unfastened.  Do not let this stop you if you require a pant of this type.  Overall, I really like them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15508255", "1": "0.49679264", "3": "0.12765546", "4": "0.10754436", "5": "0.038202986", "6": "0.072536305"}}
