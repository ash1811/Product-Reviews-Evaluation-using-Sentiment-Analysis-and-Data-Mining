{"text": "I HAVE YET TO RECIEVE THIS ITEM IT'S BEEN 4 DAYS PAST THE ESTIMATED ARRIVAL DATE AND I PAID FOR 1 DAY SHIPPING. I WANTED TO WEAR IT FOR MY BIRTHDAY YESTURDAY AND I ENDED UP HAVING TO GO OUT THE DAY OF AND BUY MY OWN AT A STORE NEARBY. I'M VERY DISSAPOINTED AND I PLAN TO RETURN IT AS SOON AS I GET IT! IT MAY HAVE BEEN A GOOD BRA BUT IT'S WORTHLESS IF IT ISN'T DELIVERED ON TIME!!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.18312468", "1": "0.26567307", "2": "0.06370026", "3": "0.07430637", "4": "0.076378554", "5": "0.156862", "6": "0.17995505"}}
