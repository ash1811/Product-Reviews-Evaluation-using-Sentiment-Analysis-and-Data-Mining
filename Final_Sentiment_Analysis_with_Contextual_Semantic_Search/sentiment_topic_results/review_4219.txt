{"text": "These shorts are soft, and I love the pleasing colors -navy blue, a light blue, and a soft lime. This is a baby gift, and I was happy to have the choice of 6-9 months size. The soon to arrive baby may weigh 12 lbs.. I chose these cute short comfort and ease. I believe they will easily combine with a cute one piece shirt with snaps. I do not know how they will wash, but I have no reason to believe they will not meet reasonable standards of excellence. You will hear more from me if there are serious problems. The shorts arrived on time a nd were well packaged.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.24405386", "1": "0.24008909", "2": "0.08275677", "3": "0.11307574", "5": "0.1835097", "6": "0.13394341"}}
