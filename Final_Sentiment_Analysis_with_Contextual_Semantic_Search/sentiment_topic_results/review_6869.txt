{"text": "I ordered four of these Carhartt's workwear T shirts.  I usually by Penney's but I have read they stopped selling the ones that I liked.  Gave these Carharrt's a chance and so far I have been impressed with them.  I don't use them for work but leisure and around the house activities.  I have always liked their work jeans and I find these a nice addition.Overall they seem to be made well and are roomy.  I wear a 2xl and tall too.  They seem long enough for me and I am 6'5&#34;.  See how the work in time but for my early impression of them, they seem very good!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07445819", "1": "0.19692491", "2": "0.17437957", "3": "0.18399212", "4": "0.14339563", "5": "0.15234154", "6": "0.07450806"}}
