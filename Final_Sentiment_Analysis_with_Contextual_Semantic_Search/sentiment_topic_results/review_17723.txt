{"text": "The ones I got off amazon were all china models and never kept accurate time. Also one had a module that was very crooked in the case. got a thailand model instead of china that is perfect. It says on the back of the watch MADE IN THAILAND. I bought it at walmart, a few things about the thailand model thats different than the china model:  the bezel is the same color black as the strap.(china model is lighter) Also the buttons on the thailand model stick out more than the china.(this is important to me because it makes it easier to use)  The numbers are clearer when looking directly at it and finally the white paint that says PROTECTION and G-SHOCK on the bezel are a whiter paint that is more crisp and precise lettering. finally the thailand one is accurate to within 10seconds a month and the module lines up perfect.  I will keep this watch as long as I can, the features are perfect and its the perfect watch for me right now and I tried a bunch analog and digital.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10097602", "1": "0.11203395", "2": "0.08838543", "3": "0.16337161", "4": "0.14488037", "5": "0.1269589", "6": "0.2633937"}}
