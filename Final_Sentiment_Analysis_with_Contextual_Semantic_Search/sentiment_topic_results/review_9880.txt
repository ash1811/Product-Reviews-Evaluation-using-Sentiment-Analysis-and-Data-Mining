{"text": "These boots are comfortable after wearing them for a few hours, but they are somewhat oddly shaped. The middle part is kind of slouchy and the calf part is very tight. Anyone who walks a lot so has legs with some shape might find these boots tight in the calf. There is a little elastic thing on the top that stretches, but they feel tight. Also, the foot part is large for a 9, yet the calves are small, so it's a slightly weird fit. They are attractive well made boots. They do not go up to the knee though. On me they are a few inches short of the knee.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03041617", "1": "0.33007297", "2": "0.035052605", "3": "0.23085852", "4": "0.15074442", "5": "0.15546532", "6": "0.06738997"}}
