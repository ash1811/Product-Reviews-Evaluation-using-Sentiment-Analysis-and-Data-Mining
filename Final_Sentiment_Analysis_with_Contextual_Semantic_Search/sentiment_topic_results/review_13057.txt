{"text": "I only paid $66, MSRP is $99. It has Holofil insulation. Looks real good, has pockets to keep your hands warm when not wearing gloves (kinda shallow) and a zippered pocket for misc.. The belt is useful as a strap to keep the suit rolled up when stowed and when overdressed I tuck the arms inside and the belt holds the rest up.The hood is insulated but kinda useless as you will need a balaclava. There is a snap at the neck but the suit leaves your throat unprotected so you really need the balaclava. The legs are short so high boots are required as well as straps to make the legs air tight unless you are wearing gaitors. I am 5' 7\" w/short legs and the size small is perfect. When seated, the crotch does not ride up but the legs do. The lining feels good.I use gaiters to keep out cold air, rain, and snow. I got the best.  Gore-Tex Crocodile gaiters by Outdoor Research. They were expensive but I got a good deal on Amazon for $43 which included 2 day free shipping with Amazon Prime. They are water proof and tough and go on very easy. I just use the velcro most of the time. You can wear water proof shoes or boots and your feet will be warm and dry.This suit works good for every day use. I went to the hardware store for a snow shovel following the seasons first real snow and was warm in 29 degrees. My 4X4 truck is unheated but I had on a scarf and warm hat and mittens. I was not overheated in the store with the front zipped down. I even stayed warm with the window down when the windshield fogged up. I then shoveled the walk in comfort.UPDATE: The Polar Vortex here on the East Coast USA has made this suit a necessity and I wear it a lot.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06773445", "1": "0.18100518", "2": "0.26207405", "3": "0.06422985", "4": "0.099183954", "5": "0.11631753", "6": "0.20945495"}}
