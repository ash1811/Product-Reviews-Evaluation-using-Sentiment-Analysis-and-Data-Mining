{"text": "I bought this for my spouse who cannot dress himself. His 11mm watch always seemed to get caught on his sleeves while putting tops and jackets/coats, etc. on/off.  So far, he's worn this Skagen for a couple of weeks and NOTHING has gotten stuck - not even his tightest shirt sleeves.  The unit itself is really classy.  It didn't know that June only had 30 days in it but it's been keeping great time and the band isn't as difficult as others have reported for putting on and taking off.  I'm so glad I purchased this.  THIS WOULD MAKE A GREAT GIFT FOR ELDERLY WHO WEAR A WATCH!Highly recommended!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15596959", "1": "0.18783484", "2": "0.14066863", "3": "0.12941144", "4": "0.09241604", "5": "0.20960182", "6": "0.08409765"}}
