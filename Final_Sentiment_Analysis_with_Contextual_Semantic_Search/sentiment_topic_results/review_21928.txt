{"text": "I just had a baby, and have HUGE milk engorged breasts. They are in the DD/DDD/E range. I went to the department store to try on bras, nike, danskins, adidas and other champions, this one held my breasts in by far the best. I worked out my entire pregnancy, and was worried about how I was going to work out with these ginormous breasts bouncing on my chest, I figured I'd have to wear a regular bra underneath my sports bra to hold them in, but not with this one. Highly recomended. Especially if your number is smaller in retrospect to your cup size (like a 32/34 is not a normal band size for a DDD, so it was hard to find a reg sports bra in the S/M/L sizes.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14946121", "1": "0.12318687", "2": "0.12143837", "3": "0.34228078", "5": "0.08725548", "6": "0.17388888"}}
