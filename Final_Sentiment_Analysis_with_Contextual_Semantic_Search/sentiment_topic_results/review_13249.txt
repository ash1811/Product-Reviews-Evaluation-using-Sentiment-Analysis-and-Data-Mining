{"text": "I got these leg warmers in order to keep my calfs warm in my drafty basement, where I am typing this review this very moment. I have experienced none of the complaints which some other reviewers noticed, but on the second day of wearing them, I discovered they are the perfect accessory for shovelling snow. I can't say they are better than long johns, but at 30 degrees fahrenheit, with a breeze, these woolen wonders do the trick very nicely thank you.I might suggest an unexpected benefit from these and the fingerless gloves I bought for that very same drafty basement. It's a great inexpensive way to give yourself a present once every week or so, especially if you live alone. But I digress.I especially like that there is no trace of itchiness or sense of tightness which one may sense with elastic bands to hold up socks or stockings. And, they do not 'bag' or 'bunch up' on my calfs, which are a bit more substantial than those on the model. This may be a virtue of the cable stitch knitting, which may be more comfortable when stretched. Between price and function, its hard to see how you would go wrong with these, assuming that you really want leg warmers.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.034458585", "1": "0.19422922", "2": "0.19437619", "3": "0.25984475", "4": "0.11716648", "5": "0.085442044", "6": "0.114482746"}}
