{"text": "I popped these into an old pair of slippers whose shearling had worn away.  The slippers themselves were still in decent condition, and these insoles helped extend their life a while longer.  The sizing worked fine (I didn't need to trim the insoles), and they felt warm and comfortable.  Will purchase again when needed.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.19478247", "2": "0.30348668", "3": "0.16588905", "4": "0.097449295", "6": "0.228816"}}
