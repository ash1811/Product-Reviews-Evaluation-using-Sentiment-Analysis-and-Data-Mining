{"text": "I'm a fan of the jean-styled Khaki; a lighter-weight, bit dressier take on the classic 5-pocket jean. One of the best is theDockers Men's 5 Pocket Khaki D3 Classic Fit Flat Front Pant. I also have similar pants from Izod and Perry Ellis. This Levi's 505 Trouser follows much of the pattern set by these other pants, but with a couple interesting twists. The classic blue-jean-style front pockets aren't used here, rather there are two slash pockets much more typical of the classic khaki. One great detail is the second front pocket on the left, it has a zipper closure at the seam and opens to a nearly full-size pocket behind the main pocket. Great place to keep your front-pocket wallet with some added security, and should make these pants a great choice for traveling. The rear pockets will look familiar if you have any 505s. Fit is good, and sizing seems true to my 505 and D3 5-pocket pants. I have two pair. \"Atomic\" is a light gray with a hint of green tinge (looks very nice) and \"Pewter\" a great medium-dark gray. Each has subtle tonal stitch detailing and are a nice cotton twill fabric. Highly recommended.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10386897", "1": "0.31525946", "2": "0.10360864", "3": "0.04203127", "4": "0.14555015", "5": "0.16683109", "6": "0.1228504"}}
