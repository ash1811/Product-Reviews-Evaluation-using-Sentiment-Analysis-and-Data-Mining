{"text": "My son is going to be Darth Vader for Halloween.  We purchased this to add on to the costume.  He's happy with it.  It's pretty cheap, and plastic, but that's what we expected for the price.  Overall a good purchase.  Hope he doesn't break it before Halloween.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.3478975", "1": "0.15479566", "2": "0.11933907", "3": "0.08113752", "4": "0.28488514"}}
