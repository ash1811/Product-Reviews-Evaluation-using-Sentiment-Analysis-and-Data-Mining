{"text": "this watch is pretty much perfect for me. it is durable, long lasting (had it for quite some time with no problems what so ever - no battery problems or scratches or anything). i've had a lot more expensive watches that might look flashier but don't last or function long. at the time i bought it, it cost something like $10-$14. can't beat that. only complaint is the alarm is too quite and the indiglo function is not very bright.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.18656965", "1": "0.45342347", "2": "0.18433024", "3": "0.044131104", "4": "0.12491092"}}
