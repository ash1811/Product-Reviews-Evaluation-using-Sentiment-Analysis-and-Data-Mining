{"text": "I have 2 styles in various colors--all with the soft footbed (Florida and Arizona styles).  I have narrow feet with high arches and these sandals give support to my feet. Better than slippers for around the house and great for running around in hot weather.  I won't buy anything but a birk with a soft foot bed.  A physical therapist recommended them.  Watch for them on sale.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12401806", "1": "0.10111378", "2": "0.19518909", "3": "0.15193006", "4": "0.15252024", "5": "0.16193451", "6": "0.11329422"}}
