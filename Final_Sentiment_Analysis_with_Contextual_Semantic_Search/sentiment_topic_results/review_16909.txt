{"text": "I bought these instead of Arborwear's comparable version (which is Aerostich's preferred pant). The Arborwear pair were suggested by a far more experienced rider than me. However, he's never tried Carhartt, and I've never tried Arborwear, so I really can't compare the two.Regardless, these Carhartts are a pretty solid pair. They're of a very thick material, and they seem like they'd handle well with sliding on asphalt&#8211; in the event of a wipeout. They also allow plenty of room to move, and the gusseted crotch is great. They breathe fairly well, but could do better. I haven't tried any of the knee inserts, so I can't speak to those, but they do have that option.The biggest reason for me docking a star is due to sizing. I wish they had more/different sizes. The size down was a bit too small, and the size I ended up getting was a tad to big. All sizes were baggier than I'd like. It's partially just a style thing (because I think big baggy pants look goofy), but for riding purposes, it's also somewhat of a hazard and inconvenience. The gusseted crotch allows for all of the movement and flexibility you need for motorcycling. The baggy leg portion adds no value, and my legs were the part that actually breathed the least, so the extra size didn't even contribute to that.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19069391", "1": "0.30560216", "3": "0.15578578", "4": "0.1351485", "5": "0.11019966", "6": "0.10048866"}}
