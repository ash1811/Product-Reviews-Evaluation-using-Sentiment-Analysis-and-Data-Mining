{"text": "Still going strong into school year number two!  We originally purchased this to replace a school bag that had really bad zippers.  My boy picked this out on Amazon because of the camouflage color pattern.  I arrived as expected and the quality looked great out of the box.  I was surprised today to find out that I never wrote a review on it.  Well, its still going strong and the boy still loves it.
