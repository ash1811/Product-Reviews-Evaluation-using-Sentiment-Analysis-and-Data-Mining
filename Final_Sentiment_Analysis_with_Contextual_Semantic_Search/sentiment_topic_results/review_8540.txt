{"text": "The style of these shoes is different enough from my other Reeboks, the toe box is much narrower than the usual 8.5 W that I wear in Reeboks.  I have worn them with thin socks, but they're almost uncomfortable when wearing for a short time.  After wearing them for an entire day, my pinky toes hurt.  A little disappointed with the fit of these shoes, and feel I should have done more research, then I would not have purchased the shoes.  I'm keeping them for footwear emergencies.  Maybe ordering one size up (a 9 W) would have been more successful.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17571609", "1": "0.32845926", "2": "0.19437344", "3": "0.03740152", "4": "0.12655759", "6": "0.13477904"}}
