{"text": "I buy these for my 8 yr. old son. I had to look for underwear for him that doesn't have the scratchy elastic waist band. He's a husky boy & the elastic band was very uncomfortable for him, although they were a bigger size for him, they still dug into his side and left a huge red mark. I finally found these undies with the elastic band covered with the jersey like soft material. He loves them & will only wear this kind from now on. He says they're very comfortable and fit well.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.41690475", "2": "0.10754803", "3": "0.1459622", "4": "0.10361793", "6": "0.22010651"}}
