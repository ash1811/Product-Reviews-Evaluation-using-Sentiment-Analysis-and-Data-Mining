{"text": "This the second package of these socks I received. Please note the size. First order I called and told Amazon I got the wrong size. The second order came and they are also the wrong size. I did not call the second time because it is not worth the hassle. I figured out that I would keep getting the wrong ones.  What they are sending is shoe size 6-12 which is a sock size 10-13. I was ordering these for myself, but they ended up going in my husband's sock drawer.  At the same time I ordered him a package of white ones in the larger size. They were the correct size. What I think happened is the packages are mismarked, listing shoe instead of sock size. That would be fine if you could tell before you order. Still love the socks, they are so soft and cushiony, just wish I could get in my size.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19025454", "1": "0.17603032", "2": "0.14591052", "3": "0.18313734", "4": "0.12107977", "5": "0.1201078", "6": "0.06347968"}}
