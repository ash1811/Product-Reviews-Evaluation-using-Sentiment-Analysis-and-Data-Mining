{"text": "i normally order a size 11.5. Other reviews warned this shoe runs a bit small so I ordered a 12 which fits fine but could be a bit wider. i have never ordered a wide shoe before so was hesitant to try it without having the chance to compare in store. Other than the size, these compare favorably to my RockSports which are still my favorite and cost less to boot (pun intended).", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11903305", "1": "0.33695117", "2": "0.18644106", "3": "0.19892713", "4": "0.07680407", "5": "0.04206453", "6": "0.039779"}}
