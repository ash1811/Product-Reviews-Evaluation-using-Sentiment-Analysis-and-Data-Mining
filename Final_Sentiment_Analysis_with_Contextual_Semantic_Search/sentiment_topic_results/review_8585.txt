{"text": "This is a great shoe for the average foot. It is sturdy and has good arch support. I have been wearing these shoes for at least 10 years. They can last 1-2 years with continuous use. They have good arch support. The color stays well. Occasionally there is a separation of the seam near the big toe. I have been through more than a few pairs of these shoes but, they are worth the investment for the comfort and stability they provide for the feet.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.037623372", "1": "0.2517727", "2": "0.15868333", "3": "0.29430664", "4": "0.19313872", "6": "0.06089018"}}
