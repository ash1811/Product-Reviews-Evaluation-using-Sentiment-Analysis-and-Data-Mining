{"text": "Best bra I have bought in along time. A good price and seems to be well made. It is soft and comfortable, I can not stand wires that pinch and poke. I think it fits very well. I buy most of my clothes now online, Nordstroms, Amazon, Ulla Popken etc... I find Glamorise products fit well consistantly. I have waited to write this review after a wash and found it held up well. Over all worth the stars I gave it and certainly worth the low, low price!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.037446946", "1": "0.55447435", "2": "0.039725903", "3": "0.031019902", "4": "0.18501095", "5": "0.054515056", "6": "0.09780693"}}
