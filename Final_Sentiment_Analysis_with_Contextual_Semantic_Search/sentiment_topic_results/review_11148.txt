{"text": "i bought it when it was in the gold box deal for $19.99. it's a very pretty and shining gold just like the photo really. the gold ball is so hollow and made it very..very thin. the push back lock is a little tiny super small that i had a hard time to hold it in my hands and tried it on my ears not easily. i'm 4'11&#34;, my ring size is between 4 and 5, imagine even my fingers have the hard time to put it together on my ears, that's not good for me. when i received it, the gold ball had the little dent about 3mm, and the push back i could not use it, it fell through right away when tried it on. so i returned it without the problem. and if you are the one who always change your earrings several times a week or a month, i would not recommend to buy this one. but if you are so careful and very delicate on jewelry, it should not be a problem.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.24927601", "1": "0.1972329", "3": "0.2391679", "4": "0.108382516", "5": "0.09598954", "6": "0.1076265"}}
