{"text": "Definitely a sharp-looking shoe.  I have narrow feet, and it was even a little tight for me.  But it does provide good support.  You will want to be sure to buy this from a place that offers non-hassle returns just in case you need to up-size it.  I wear a 9 or 9.5, depending on the brand.  I went with the 9.5 with this shoe and am glad I did.  Overall a good buy for the cost.  I will update this review in a few weeks to comment on well it is holding up.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.095692284", "1": "0.32203814", "2": "0.11349219", "3": "0.1903926", "4": "0.042489145", "5": "0.09486173", "6": "0.14103392"}}
