{"text": "My first pair lasted a little over 2 years of daily use without socks, lots of walking, and use in the saltwater every week or two.  I replaced them with a pair of Sebago's, which I hated despite trying to tough it out for 3 or 4 months.  Now I'm back to the original and disappointed I wasted my money on anything else.  These are much softer, more flexible, more comfortable, and I think they look better.FYI My last pair were made in Indonesia.  My new ones are from China.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11855385", "1": "0.23947418", "2": "0.111917436", "3": "0.22916533", "5": "0.26884302", "6": "0.029181452"}}
