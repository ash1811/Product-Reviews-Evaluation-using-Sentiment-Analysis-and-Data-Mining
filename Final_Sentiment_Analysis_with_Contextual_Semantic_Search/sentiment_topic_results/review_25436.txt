{"text": "I bought my husband a pair of these Old Friend slippers last Christmas. He was used to the moccasin with the long Indian name that starts with \"M\". However, when I ordered a pair for him, the sole began separating after one month. When I called the company to tell them, they asked if I wanted a refund or an exchange. I asked if this was a common problem with their moccasins and to my shock and dismay she said it WAS! Obviously I asked for a refund. I started looking for the best reviews on men's moccasins that were not of the \"M\" brand. I found these and my husband loved them. He has a narrow foot and at first he was worried they would be too big. However, he ended up loving them. He's harder on his slippers than any man I've known. If he's in the house, they're on his feet, except in bed. So, after a year they're pretty worn. He asked me for a second pair so he can use the old pair as his \"outdoor pair\" that he uses to grab the mail, take out the trash, grill, etc. Bottom line, these are really nice slippers. Very comfortable and warm and he's requesting a second pair. Enough said.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.036049552", "1": "0.18364081", "2": "0.16105416", "3": "0.12313736", "4": "0.19223177", "5": "0.16123198", "6": "0.14265437"}}
