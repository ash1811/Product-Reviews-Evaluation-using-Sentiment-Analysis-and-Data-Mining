{"text": "ROckport Men's World Tour walking shoes just fit.  Requires virtually no break in period, and its look is timeless. This isn't a shoe for formal wear, but it does well for dressed down business or walking about.  The sole is balanced, giving good lateral stability as well as great support.  There is ample toe room with the gradually rounded toe.  The one complaint if there is one is that Rockport could do well to invest more in laces that don't come undone easily.Otherwise, it is the most comfortable shoe and a good value.And the sole of the shoe won't break apart in two year as does the Ecco brand.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15725176", "1": "0.31871164", "2": "0.14132994", "3": "0.17809151", "4": "0.08289297", "5": "0.08065513", "6": "0.041067034"}}
