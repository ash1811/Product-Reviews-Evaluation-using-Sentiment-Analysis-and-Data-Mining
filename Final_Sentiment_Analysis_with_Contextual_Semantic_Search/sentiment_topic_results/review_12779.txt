{"text": "I purchased these great little boots for my grandson who is  2-1/2. We don't get rain too often so when it does rain it is a 'big deal'! He loves wearing them, even in the house, but with his fireman's rain coat also on, he is just too cute! I purchased the boots a bit large so he won't out grow them too fast and the straps on the top make it easy for him to put on himself. Now he can walk in all the puddles he can find!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.24270123", "2": "0.107383005", "3": "0.31822512", "4": "0.2468864", "5": "0.047088485", "6": "0.03403981"}}
