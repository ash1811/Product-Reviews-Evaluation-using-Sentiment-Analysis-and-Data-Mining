{"text": "One piece of plastic broke off right away. But I am using them by 2's, not all 4 open. What is nice is that you can fold up and stick in jewlery box. Just have to be careful when opening it up, if earring gets tangled with another, it will come off the rack. I use them as 2 seperate racks with certain earrings on ea, not all mixed together. I have Sweet Romance Jewlrey and I put all the earrings on one and use the other for non matching sets (with necklaces).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.3664535", "1": "0.17174424", "2": "0.082110606", "3": "0.13471967", "4": "0.09676142", "5": "0.07891884", "6": "0.06929174"}}
