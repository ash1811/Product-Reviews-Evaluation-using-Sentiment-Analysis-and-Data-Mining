{"text": "Fits my big ol' head and keeps my ears warm. You guys out there with huge, planetoid-like heads have no fear! This hat will fit you. One reviewer said to put it on your head wet and let it dry for a more custom fit. I'm sure this works but i prefer to let my goopy head oils shape the hat like an snakey second skin to my head.Also, if you engage in ninja-like action packed hikes with your dog like I do, this hat fits tight enough that it wont come off your head! Even when doing back flips!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09686485", "1": "0.31871822", "2": "0.074181885", "3": "0.2524509", "4": "0.09823465", "5": "0.097185634", "6": "0.062363803"}}
