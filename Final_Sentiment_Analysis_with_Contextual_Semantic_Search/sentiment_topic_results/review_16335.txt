{"text": "I work with a friend who is the biggest Chuck Taylor fan of all time.  She has who knows how many pairs of Chucks (over 20), and always seems to wear a different color every day.  So to be a good friend, I had to get a pair.  Red, being one of my favorite colors, seemed the right choice.  I bought size 6.5 Men's, which translates to 8.5 Women's.  The fit is good!  These are heavier than I would have expected, but they aren't uncomfortably so.  They are very sturdy considering so much of them is made from canvas.  My feet feel well supported.  While I probably won't go bonkers over them, I might have to invest in a second pair.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.052749045", "1": "0.30075765", "2": "0.13785344", "3": "0.06759609", "4": "0.10349398", "5": "0.26340127", "6": "0.07414851"}}
