{"text": "Great fit, extremely comfy and no laces to deal with.  The elastic is strong and never gives out or gets loose.  I have had this same pair split once...but I've purchased this shoe 4 times now and only one split in the seam.  They wear well.  They generally last me a year or more.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.37944433", "2": "0.26688337", "3": "0.2951889", "6": "0.04455214"}}
