{"text": "i am really happy with this jacket, i read the reviews and ordered a size smaller than normal and it fits great. its not fitted or snug in any way its a little roomy but i feel if i went down even another size it would be too small. the material is great and its put together very well. this can definitely take a beating and keep going. i even have my friends asking where i got it !!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.26769474", "1": "0.23674543", "2": "0.04490894", "3": "0.23780978", "5": "0.12895568", "6": "0.08011586"}}
