{"text": "Good to wear these gardening or mowing or any other out door activity where you just can't do the sun screen and want an option.  I keep a couple on hand.  One goes in sail bag and other here for landscape/garden activity.  Silk is pretty good, but you will get rips in crotch after a year or so, depending on how often worn and washed.  I'm bad about throwing in washer and dryer - when I hang dry they last longer.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10053208", "1": "0.48976716", "2": "0.11766874", "3": "0.12123073", "5": "0.06975362", "6": "0.09762972"}}
