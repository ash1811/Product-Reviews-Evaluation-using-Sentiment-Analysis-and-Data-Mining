{"text": "I have no problems with the cup shape.  I like the wide part of the straps.  I was surprised that a 38F would have only three hooks in the back, but it seems like it will be okay--mind you, I haven't worn it yet.  What I DON'T like is something I find on most bras these days--elastic straps!  Non-underwired breasts need MORE support, LESS bounce--how can that happen with an elastic strap?  I can't believe there are any women designing bras.  I'll update this after I've worn it a few times, but I know already that I WON'T be wearing this bra in zumba class!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.037164394", "1": "0.11064111", "2": "0.14702094", "3": "0.30861664", "5": "0.20694533", "6": "0.18680508"}}
