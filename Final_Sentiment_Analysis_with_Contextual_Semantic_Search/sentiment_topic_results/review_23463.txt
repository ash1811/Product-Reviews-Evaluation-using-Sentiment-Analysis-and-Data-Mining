{"text": "This watch is outstanding.  I own some nicer pieces along with some affordable watches from Seiko, Timex, Casio, Etc.  This Invicta and outstanding watch for the money, you cannot buy more for less.Positives- Seiko NH35A Automatic Movement.  Which is hackable (meaning the second hand stops when adjusting the time), and can hand wind.  Just unscrew the screw-down crown, and turn clock-wise to hand wind.  Pull one more position to set the date, and one more to set the time.- Crystal back case to view the 24 jewel movement- 200 Meter Rating- Quality feel of rotating bezel, not too easy to turn.- Weighty feel of the watch- Looks like a nice homage to the Rolex Submariner without being a complete fake.- Looks amazing on a Nato strap.Negatives:- The finish on the lug ends isn't the best- First watch sent by Amazon came in a nice large box, packaged perfectly, but the watch itself had some minor cosmetic defects.  The 2nd watch Amazon sent as a replacement came in a smaller box, wasn't packaged well, but the watch itself was nearly flawless.Conclusion:I normally stick with Seiko or Casio in the affordable watch sector, but this Invicta is absolutely wonderful.  Where can you get a NH35A Seiko Automatic Movement, with 200 meter rating, rotating bezel, screw down crown, and crystal case back for less than $90?", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09811273", "1": "0.18828265", "2": "0.22999483", "3": "0.16684513", "4": "0.019729761", "5": "0.098813884", "6": "0.19822103"}}
