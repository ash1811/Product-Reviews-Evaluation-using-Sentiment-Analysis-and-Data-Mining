{"text": "We bought this costume for my 7 year old to wear for Halloween this year.  I researched the sizes based on the product measurements provided on Amazon.  After careful consideration I bought the medium size.  My daughter normally wears size 7 clothing, and size 7-8 shirts, she weight about 45 pounds.  This costume was way too big for her.  In my opinion this would be ideal for a 11-12 year old, weighing about 70 pds.  Luckily I think it will be easy to a home modification for it to work.  The bottom of the garment and the sleeves have no finishing and were just cut with scissors, this will be easy to replicate, and the seems on the shoulders will be the only area to sew with the machine.She loves the look of this costume and the webbing wings that attach using finger loops.  I think she will be happy this year with her first \"spooky\" choice.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17202719", "1": "0.19006582", "2": "0.05178894", "3": "0.21805249", "4": "0.16490054", "5": "0.07522062", "6": "0.12794441"}}
