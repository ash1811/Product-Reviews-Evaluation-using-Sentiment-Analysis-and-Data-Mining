{"text": "I bought this in 2008 directly from Amazon.  It cost $22 back then, and arrived within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping (which is basically standard shipping).  It arrived securely in a cardboard shipping box.  Nothing was damaged during shipping and all materials were new.It does what it's suppose to do, which is hold my clothes while I'm traveling.The material is made out of cheap fabric, but it's durable.  None of the seams are broken, nothing is tearing, there are no holes or anything, zipper works just fine, shoulder straps works.  Shoulder strap is adjustable.  There is a zippered front pocket compartment, and pocket compartments on each side of the duffel.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08835697", "1": "0.16237564", "2": "0.24342534", "3": "0.13003626", "4": "0.19005886", "5": "0.07657337", "6": "0.109173596"}}
