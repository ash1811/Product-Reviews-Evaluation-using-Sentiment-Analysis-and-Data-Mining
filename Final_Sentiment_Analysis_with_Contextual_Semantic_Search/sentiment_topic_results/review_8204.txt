{"text": "My boyfriend and I went to Norway last December for vacation and decided to go snowmobiling at Camp Tamok.Since we're from Alabama, we are not used to snowmobiling, much less on snow covered with a layer of ice!We were supposed to follow in the tracks of the people in front of us, but we accidentally gave them too much room and lost their tracks in the white snow. Cory hit a patch of ice, and our snowmobile drifted left, down the side of a mountain.He instinctively turned the snowmobile towards the right (uphill) like we would do on a four-wheeler.However, that is apparently not what you are supposed to do.The snowmobile flipped, and we fell off, sliding down the side of the mountain.My boots had no grip, and there was nothing for me to grasp on to, but I saw Cory stop easily above me.I yelled, &#34;Cooooooooryyyyyyyyy!&#34; and he unlodged his foot, slid down to me, and grabbed me by the collar of my jacket, before using his boots (yeah, the ones you're thinking about buying) to stop us from sliding farther down.It was just like in some action movie, except my heart has never pounded so fast watching an action movie.The grip on these suckers may have saved my life.True story.Swear to God.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22688064", "1": "0.13476598", "2": "0.10876948", "3": "0.024922678", "5": "0.20188676", "6": "0.30050278"}}
