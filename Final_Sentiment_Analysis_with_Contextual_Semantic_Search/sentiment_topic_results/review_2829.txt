{"text": "If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago. Believe me, they are entirely different.Well, darn. As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles, this pair has none. The sole is stiff and clunky, the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general, junk. No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100% comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks. This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.2873454", "1": "0.15346844", "2": "0.065727174", "3": "0.24648884", "4": "0.07334308", "5": "0.03648321", "6": "0.13714387"}}
