{"text": "Just out of the pkg. it is slightly large, which is a good sign.  Once it goes in the dryer, it will fit perfectly.  Dry on medium temp. only to avoid further shrinkage.  It is a looser fit, so for the guys working outside, it is not uncomfortable or clingy and won't make you look like a sausage.  It is 100 percent cotton, and is plenty long enough for our guys who need to do a lot of bending while working.  Even while bending, this t-shirt delivers and covers what it needs to cover in the backside area.  I wish there were more color choices in the 3XT other than the tan and green.  Both are great colors though.  This is a medium-weight or even a little better quality than medium-weight t-shirt.  Not a heavy-weight t-shirt, which can be too hot in the summer while working outside.  You won't be disappointed with the quality.  And the price point ($13+) was very good for a brand-name product.  Very nice t-shirt.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03953404", "1": "0.48206693", "2": "0.065467946", "3": "0.06360196", "4": "0.1428464", "5": "0.058851823", "6": "0.14763087"}}
