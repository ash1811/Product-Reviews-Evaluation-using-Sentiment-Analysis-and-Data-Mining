{"text": "I HATE when I go to type a review and something goes wrong.  You see, I hate when I press the submit review button and discover that my internet service was down while busy writing a review because it means my review isn't there when I get back online (after hitting the refresh button).  This just happened to me and it really stinks.  It means re-typing the review.  Ugh!!!  This is VERY annoying and occurs frequently.  Anyway this red-colored watch for women is a worthy investment.  The batteries last a really long time, maybe even years, and with the economy jacking up prices left and right for a variety of items these days, you can't go wrong with an affordable and always dependable wrist watch.  It can even get wet and still work perfectly fine.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12224804", "1": "0.16962427", "2": "0.13606097", "3": "0.087904975", "4": "0.1675524", "5": "0.18422349", "6": "0.13238588"}}
