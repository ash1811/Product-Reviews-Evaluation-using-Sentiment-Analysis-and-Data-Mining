{"text": "These are great little shoes, but they run big!  My 22 month old wears a size 4 and these were huge on her; instead of sending them back though we are just going to hold onto them for when her feet grow a bit.  That being said, after we got these I went onto Zappos and got the infant size 2-3 and they fit perfect.  She LOVES her crocs and it is really all she will wear.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09464063", "1": "0.15598114", "2": "0.07112945", "3": "0.51428", "4": "0.070705235", "5": "0.08959165"}}
