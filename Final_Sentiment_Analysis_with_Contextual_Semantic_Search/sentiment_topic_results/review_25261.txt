{"text": "I hate to downgrade Merrell as they make great shoes, this being my 4th pair. Tried these on locally and then ordered through Amazon, the 11.5 D(M), I noticed right away the right shoe was more narrow then the left. When I took the insoles out, the right insole had more of an upward curve where the shoe is more narrow. So now my left foot is comfortable and my right one is hanging off the side...Checked and they're both the same size. Oh well, other than that the shoes are nice. Now I am stuck paying twice the shipping and wondering whether or not to reorder or get something else.I wouldn't care too much about quality assurance either if I was being payed 50 cents an hour.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03611744", "1": "0.29761162", "2": "0.17247126", "3": "0.07940638", "4": "0.21948981", "5": "0.055582803", "6": "0.13932067"}}
