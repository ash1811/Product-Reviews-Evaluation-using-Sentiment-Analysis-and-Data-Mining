{"text": "This shirt is beautiful, it arrived super-quik & if my kid had his way he'd wear it everyday& I'd have to snatch it off him in his sleep to wash it. As it is I have to hide it on him&only bring it out when asked.. He has others so they placate him temporarily which gives me time to wash it(in cold) and dry it (line dry or put it on a plastic hanger somewhere there's good air circulation)but he never completely forgets it. I swear I just get it clean&dry& put away& guess who wants to wear it?? Gotta love it whwn ya do somethin right like get the picky kid a shirt he loves.. So far I'm 5 for 5 with the T's wish me luck@Xmas lol!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21169731", "1": "0.12526399", "2": "0.13343227", "4": "0.20768079", "5": "0.22884287", "6": "0.0909093"}}
