{"text": "Girls will ask you why your watch has a \"keyboard\" on it, a perfect conversation starter where you can begin to correct them that this is indeed a genuine calculator watch. My girl actually hates this watch but I love showing it off when it's time to calculate exactly 15% for my tip at the restaurant. I figure it will easily pay for itself after the couple of meals I would have over-tipped had I not had this exceptional timepiece. True, it has no backlight, but how often do you really check the time in a cave? It is water resistant enough to keep out sweat and sink water from hand washing (if you're into that sort of thing). It has dual time and an alarm but I never use those functions. I synced it with my DW-5600E G shock that keeps perfect time and after 3-4 weeks this calculator watch is running about 5 seconds slower, which is common for this watch and not too bad as far as accuracy goes. The only real con is since I started wearing it people keep asking if I can fix their computer? Weird. Otherwise I think it's a nice classic watch for the price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13595292", "1": "0.1777133", "2": "0.3863831", "4": "0.19897072", "5": "0.0957437"}}
