{"text": "I have never spent this much money on a pair of sunglasses before, usually content with the $10 variety but I decided that my eyes were worth the splurge and I'm so glad I did!  These fit me extremely well and they are very comfortable.  I was worried that the glass lenses would make them feel too heavy but I haven't found that to be the case at all.  Everything appears crystal clear through the lenses and it was like seeing clearly for the first time!  As an added bonus, the hard case that came with them is wonderful and a great place to keep them protected when I'm not wearing them.  I'm looking forward to enjoying these sunglasses for many years to come, unlike the cheap ones that I replace yearly, if not more often,  If you are at all on the fence about these sunglasses I recommend you give them a try, you won't be sorry!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20530277", "1": "0.22574109", "2": "0.20355633", "3": "0.18116315", "4": "0.032308042", "5": "0.06681789", "6": "0.08511071"}}
