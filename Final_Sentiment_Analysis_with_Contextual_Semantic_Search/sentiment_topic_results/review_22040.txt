{"text": "They are good sunglasses, don't get me wrong but seriously they aren't worth the price I paid. Sorry, but sunglasses over $100 should not squeak and make noises like they are breaking when you open the sides out to put them on. Sounds like the plastic frame is rubbing somehow but I can't tell if these are defective because they look straight and well built. Another issue I find somewhat annoying is the logo they put on the lens that says 'polarized\".  When you wear them you can notice that with your left eye and even though it's not the worst thing it does look like a scratch or smudge. I have gotten used to it though. Still, they shouldn't put that on the lens itself but maybe a stamp or engraved part on the inside of the frame. They do work well in the sun and provide a clear view, so other than the fact that they should be around $80 and not sound like they are breaking I would have given them a better review. (Oh.. forgot about the word POLARIZED).... Glad they were made in the U.S.  Sorry if my opinion isn't the same as yours.  Just stating my views on this product and give them an average rating. I've actually purchase sunglasses in the past years that were only $20 to $30 and noticed very little difference.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.20398147", "1": "0.20457174", "2": "0.16282034", "3": "0.062210176", "4": "0.14849429", "5": "0.080323614", "6": "0.13759837"}}
