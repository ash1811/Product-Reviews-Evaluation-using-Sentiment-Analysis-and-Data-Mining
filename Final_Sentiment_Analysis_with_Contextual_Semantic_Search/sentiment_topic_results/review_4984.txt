{"text": "I ruptured a disk several years ago and have worn sandals around the house (hardwood floors) since then.  I read the rave reviews on Birkenstock sandals, so decided to give them a try.  After wearing them for a couple of days, they actually caused my lower back to start hurting and pain down my right leg.  Stopped wearing them for a day and pain went away.  Returned for a refund.  The sole also has very little traction.  When sitting down in a chair and trying to push back, the sandals would slide before I would.  Ordered a pair of CROC sandals and they are way more comfortable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19576183", "1": "0.14174302", "2": "0.19961686", "3": "0.21945894", "4": "0.12641582", "6": "0.11465249"}}
