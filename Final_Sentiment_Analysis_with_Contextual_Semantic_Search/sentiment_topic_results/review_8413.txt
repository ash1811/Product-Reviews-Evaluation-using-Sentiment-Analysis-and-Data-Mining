{"text": "Compared to other jean makers I've tried, this brand beats them hands-down.  I like the feel of these jeans because the cloth is thick not thin or flimsy.  They are comfortable in the seat and crotch.... they fit nicely.  Great pair of jeans for a casual night out and they look great with a sports coat.  These jeans are top-draw! Well worth the price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.44455877", "3": "0.101749964", "4": "0.09932506", "5": "0.2207743", "6": "0.12541161"}}
