{"text": "I wanted a watch that has a clear and easy to read face, with a second hand and it had to glow. I would have preferred to have the 1-12 digits printed on the outer circle rather than the 60 second digits. I also appreciate the day of the week as well as the number day. I do like the color of both the watch face and the band. The band however gets a big ding for being terribly scratchy. I actually had to use a nail file to smooth some particularly bothersome areas. This made it more comfortable, but left it frayed. The scratchy band made me re-position it frequently. I like the brushed stainless steel case; I think it is very attractive and will not show wear. Price was a big factor in choosing this watch as I plan to wear it for work only.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07726271", "1": "0.22410859", "2": "0.21452089", "3": "0.07740372", "4": "0.12592256", "5": "0.03508844", "6": "0.24569312"}}
