Not noticeable under a loose-fitting top. Again, I am not sure if they would be noticeable under a tight top, but that's not what I needed them for. I am amazed at their staying power, though. I put them on and was sure I'd end up having them fall out the bottom of my shirt before the end of the night but they were still exactly where they were supposed to be when I got home.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1536731", "1": "0.3290956", "2": "0.129502", "3": "0.2227297", "5": "0.06355118", "6": "0.09851383"}}
