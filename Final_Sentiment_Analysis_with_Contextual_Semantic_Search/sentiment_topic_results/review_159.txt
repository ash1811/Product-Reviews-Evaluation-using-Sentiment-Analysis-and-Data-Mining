{"text": "I L-O-V-E (LOVE) these briefs.  I sometimes have a hard time finding them in department stores so was very glad to be able to buy them on the Internet.  They are comfortable.  They allow a little forgiveness when you gain a bit here and there without stretching out if you lose a bit (I wish more often).  They also wash and wear very easily and simply.  I can even throw them in the dryer.  What's not to love?  :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11618955", "1": "0.34336004", "2": "0.20115267", "3": "0.12055977", "4": "0.21098001"}}
