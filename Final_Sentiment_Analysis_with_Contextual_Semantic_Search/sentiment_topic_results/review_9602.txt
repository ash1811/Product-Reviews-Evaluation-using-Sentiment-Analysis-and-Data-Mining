{"text": "I bought this Texsport bag to store myGuide Gear Double Wigwam Tent.  This bag is huge and is big enough for my 8-man tent with room to spare.  The only thing I don't like is it doesn't come with a strap.  There are plastic loops where we can attach a strap, but we must supply our own straps.  It does come with carry handles and a zipper down the middle, which I like more than the ones that open on the end.This is one tough bag.  Great for camping.  I'm glad I found it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03945029", "1": "0.28924036", "2": "0.24750035", "3": "0.12769428", "4": "0.13231461", "5": "0.09068057", "6": "0.07311956"}}
