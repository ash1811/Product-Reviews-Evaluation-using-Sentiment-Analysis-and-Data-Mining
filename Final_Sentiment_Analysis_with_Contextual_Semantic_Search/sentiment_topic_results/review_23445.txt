{"text": "***Updated August 13, 2013... after 3.5 months of wearing these flip flopsBottom line... These shoes are a huge disappointment.  They took too long to break in.  Once they did, they were comfortable, for a while.  Then, after about 6 weeks or so, the first layer on the top began to wear through... That's the end of the \"lifetime\" warranty, according to the manufacturer.  After 8 weeks, the minor wear had become a huge hole, right in the middle of the foot bed, effectively ending any possible use for the shoes.  I should have simply gone with my gut and never bought these shoes.  I've always had good luck with Tevas and Columbias... so back to the tried and true.These thong sandals were somewhat of a gamble for me to buy.  I'm accustomed to Teva or Columbia thongs with heavy-duty arch supports and all terrain lug soles and these have neither.  I live in south Florida where flip flops are good year round, so comfort and durability, even on long walks, is very important.  So far, after about six weeks of daily wear, these flip flops seem to be performing well.  The double arch support provides the comfort I need, even though they don't look like they will.  The color is attractive and the shoes are well constructed.  Also, even with daily wear and lots of foot sweat, there is no odor... yet.  The one thing I suggest people know before buying these is that they require a serious break-in period... a week or more.  The first time I wore them was awful!  I made it only about an hour before my feet and legs hurt so bad I thought I would collapse.  Also, the thong rubbed a blister on top of my foot.  Gradually, I wore them more and more, until, after a week or so, they fit like a glove and are a pleasure to wear all day.  I do recommend them, as long as you are willing to be patient and give them time to break-in.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.025161015", "1": "0.1764942", "2": "0.27176782", "3": "0.22860914", "4": "0.10191191", "5": "0.10185689", "6": "0.09419904"}}
