{"text": "In a growing collection of dress, casual, diving, smart and other watches, I've found it hard to cycle to my next watch as usual... I've worn this one since I received it. It looks great and IMO is one of the best bang-for-buck watches you can get without stepping up to the next bracket in watch budgets.
