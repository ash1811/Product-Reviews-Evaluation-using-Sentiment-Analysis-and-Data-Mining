{"text": "I have definitely loved the drive that Citizen has made into their watches, time and time again. While they haven't actually shown it to the fullest extent with their Drive 3.0 line, they have continued to mainly show it with their classics. This Mens' Eco-Drive timepiece is definitely one for the trendy, and the timeless. It is a class and sporty watch that is easy to setup and tell the time. I also like the features on the watch from the perpetual motion, to the easy to setup date and time and chronograph. My only grip about the watch is that I wish that it could've had a bit more from the illumination of the hands. I also had wished that the leather strap wouldn't wear down so easily. But nevertheless, despite a few flaws. You really do get a good watch from Citizen worth its dollar.Price: BSetup & Comfort: B 1/2+Overall: B", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05665611", "1": "0.12188105", "2": "0.24621975", "3": "0.18932973", "4": "0.2566899", "5": "0.048698917", "6": "0.0805245"}}
