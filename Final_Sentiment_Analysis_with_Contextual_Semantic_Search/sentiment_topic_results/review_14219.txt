{"text": "I haven't been a fan of flip flops since 2003 when I wore some on vacation and developed plantar fasciatis and suffered with it for 4 yrs.  My feet are finally better, but I haven't found flip flops that feel comfortable enough to wear for extended periods.  These are great.  Some features I love:  soft feeling of the foot bed, a decent amount of arch support, thong that doesn't rub toes, the cute strappy style.  I imagine they will become even more comfortable with time as my foot molds to the shoe.  They come in a huge variety of colors, and priced at $15 to $20, they are definitely worth it.  I may invest in a few more colors.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15613735", "1": "0.2331676", "2": "0.13354495", "3": "0.22971228", "4": "0.14913541", "5": "0.09606703"}}
