{"text": "The only Spanx product that does not provide extra extra tucking in, slimming down or support.  They are just pretty.  These are durable knee-hi sheer stockings that will last longer than other brands.  The top part comes up to right under my knee (I'm about 5'11\").  The top band is not binding but also remains hugging the calf.  The toe area is nude with reinforced stitching.  It is the only sheer stocking I purchase, both in light brown and black.  With free shipping this is competitively priced with Nordstroms.  Highly recommend.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.39387843", "3": "0.24725375", "4": "0.14938116", "5": "0.14474964", "6": "0.05900633"}}
