{"text": "This is a hand-wind watch. It is rare to find a wrist watch with this mechanism that is not an antique. The nylon band absorbed a lot of water during a morning run. Othewise, it is a good fit. The arms, especially the second hand is easily visable for those of use with failing eyesight.Based on a limited measurement, 3 points, the watch is running fast by an average of 39 seconds per week (2 min. 36 seconds per month). The students t for a 95% confidence interval is 68 seconds maximum and 10 seconds minimum. All of these values are positive. The watch runs fast. This is an error which is probably unusual for those familar with quartz technology (+/- 2-4 seconds per month)All in all, this is an excellent watch for working outside, hunting, even running.The next tests will be time to unwind. It is performed by winding the watch, carefully, to maximum and then allowing it to wind down. With one sample point: 51 hours to unwind from maximum at 74 F.If this review was helpful, please add your vote.Thanks.PS:For accurate time-keeping, wind the watch in the morning and at night. Otherwise, it will lose time if wound once a day.After 18 months of use the nylon band is wearing at the edges. Otherwise, as time piece the watch works well.After about 30 months of severe use, the first watch is done. Stick a fork in it!Winding the watch has always been a little tricky. The main shaft grinds a lot, especially if you turn it full stroke. It works best if you gently roll it, moving it less than an 1/8th of an inch with every turn.I wore it as my work watch every day for 3 months in the tropics. Tough watch. It was constantly wet from sweat or rain. The crown is not very resistant to scratches so it was in pretty bad shape after a few weeks. The accuracy severely declined during this duty. The watch band is noticably lighter than the new watch I purchased as a comparison. The accuracy is now so bad that after wearing it everyday for running and biking then everyday for a plant commissioning job, it sits on the shelf waiting for a last trip the the trash bin.All in all, not a bad watch. As with most things, a bit disappointing in the end.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.050639477", "1": "0.3559661", "2": "0.18372841", "3": "0.17375799", "4": "0.08093094", "5": "0.079136476", "6": "0.075840645"}}
