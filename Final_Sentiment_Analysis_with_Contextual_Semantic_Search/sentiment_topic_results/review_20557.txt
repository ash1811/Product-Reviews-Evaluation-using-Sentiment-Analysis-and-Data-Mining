{"text": "These have been a staple in America for decades. They are sturdy canvas that wears extremely well over time. The soles are rubber and glued. After extreme wear, some parts that are glued can get loosened. Shoe goo can be used to make most if not all repairs on these. So they can last longer than nearly any shoe. They make them exactly like they did decades ago, with the same quality, with one caveat, Converse, the iconic American shoes, are now made in China. This may or may not matter to you. It does matter to me, due to labor practices, and environmental standards, which is why I typically buy New Balance shoes, still made in the USA as of 2013. I've worn made in USA converse in the past, but never the new China-made ones. On arrival I couldn't tell any difference in the shoe itself, just as sturdy as ever.On a side note: This particular style is pretty trendy among celebrities. My wife saw this color/style on some female singer and had to have them. Lots of female celebrities buy these \"male\" high-tops. Which I find interesting, it doesn't look bad at all, but it definitely screams trendiness to me. You can google \"celebrity Converse\" to find pictures of the myriad of celebs who don Converse. If you do or do not want to be trendy, is your call, but these are definitely being revived in current \"pop culture\". To my wife, that is great, emulating her favorite artist, to me, I wouldn't be caught dead in them due to that reason alone. Although I thought about buying a matching pair just to confuse her, and be \"that\" weird matching couple, since pop culture has made them unisex lol.Hope that helps!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12035537", "1": "0.17325892", "2": "0.18575618", "3": "0.16115636", "4": "0.09024698", "5": "0.120920815", "6": "0.1483054"}}
