{"text": "I had to have these shoes as I wore them back in the early 70's and loved them.  These seem to run narrow and will need to be 'worn in'.  My biggest disappointment is that they are made in Viet Nam.  The Clark's Wallabee's that I just bought are made in China (yeah, I know, not in the UK like they used to be) and seem to be of higher quality.  Even the shoe laces are chintzy on these.  I'll keep them as they should be OK once they're broken in and better laces are easy to come by.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1561624", "1": "0.289495", "2": "0.13327207", "3": "0.072619", "5": "0.24908729", "6": "0.09638216"}}
