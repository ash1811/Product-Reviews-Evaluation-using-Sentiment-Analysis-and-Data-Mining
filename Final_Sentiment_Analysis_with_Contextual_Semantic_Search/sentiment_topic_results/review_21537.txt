{"text": "These shoes are gorgeous!!! They are sexy and unique. I was so excited to wear them out, but I ended up changing my shoes before I even left the house. They are so uncomfortable!!! They are very narrow and the trim is scratchy. I don't think these would work if you ever had to stand in them, let alone dance. Too bad, I really am disappointed, but alas they are just eye candy.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11659777", "1": "0.27707303", "2": "0.13196123", "3": "0.14756694", "4": "0.048667595", "5": "0.07015503", "6": "0.20797844"}}
