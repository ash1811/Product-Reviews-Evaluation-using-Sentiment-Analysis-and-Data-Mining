{"text": "Keds products are reliable and affordable, unfortunately for me, I have swollen feet 90% of the time.  The &#34;tongue&#34; part of this particular shoe was too tight, I could not even get my foot in, so I think for the size, the wide is narrower than other shoe brands.  The rating I gave is completely my fault.  I rarely can find shoes with the kind of top of the foot coverage that I can fit into.  I may have to try a slip on variety with less over the toe coverage, but Keds is a great show brand.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.072707236", "1": "0.20017125", "2": "0.20677531", "3": "0.21913534", "4": "0.14201747", "5": "0.08900349", "6": "0.07018994"}}
