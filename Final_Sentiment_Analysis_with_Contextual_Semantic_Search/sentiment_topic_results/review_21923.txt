{"text": "What else can I say?The Yogasoxs really fit like a glove, even though they are not for hands. Actually I was wearing them since last December! So, I kept in mind that I had to buy new pairs of yogasox. The size I am curently wearing really fits my toes and foot as it was a second skin. I can wear them by themselves and it is a softly condition to walk with them all around the house, or I can wear them with my sandals. They keep my feet warm from the weather conditions in Winter time.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.5396947", "2": "0.15924446", "3": "0.18285795", "4": "0.084145375", "6": "0.027951205"}}
