{"text": "We just got back from an Alaskan cruise and I used these shoes a lot on board. I took them because they did not take up a lot of room and thought they would be good to use just to walk around ship.  Boy, was I ever right about them. And they looked good with my dressy pants or my jeans.  I highly recommend them and suggest you buy them through Amazon because I paid about a 1/3 of their retail price here.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12286783", "1": "0.43629625", "2": "0.07413465", "3": "0.14081118", "4": "0.073764294", "6": "0.14844705"}}
