{"text": "I bought 1 pair to try.  I have plantar faciitis and can't walk barefoot more than a few feet without discomfort.  They were wonderful.  Even the thong didn't bother me.  So I bought 2 more pair for myself and a pair each for my 3 daughters.  Then while a son in law was visiting (with sore feet) I let him wear my black pair.  I don't have small feet and his aren't huge.  He found them comfortable so I bought him a pair of black ones.  I hope they don't stop making them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10366561", "1": "0.26851538", "3": "0.25450674", "4": "0.1901837", "5": "0.0963483", "6": "0.08373265"}}
