{"text": "Looking for a messenger bag, we chose this one based on our previous positive experience with a High Sierra backpack that's withstood a ton of abuse and still looks great. Although larger than I had expected, it's sturdily constructed and brightly colored. It fits a ton of stuff with no pulling at the seams or straps. Very pleased, would definitely recommend.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08918905", "1": "0.25474232", "2": "0.26570392", "3": "0.2940662", "5": "0.050609346", "6": "0.04178572"}}
