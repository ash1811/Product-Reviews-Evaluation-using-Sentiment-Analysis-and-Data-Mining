{"text": "I have been having bad luck with certain Casio watches.  This one broke after only a few months of use.  It broke right in the area where the watch band pins are inserted so now it is a pocket watch.  I have 3 other Casio watches that broke in this same area.  It was also hard to get the analog time in sync with the digital time.  It might be a good casual watch for people if they are careful with it and the green color is pretty cool.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.21711427", "1": "0.26286227", "2": "0.23635557", "3": "0.12849018", "4": "0.04193663", "6": "0.1098125"}}
