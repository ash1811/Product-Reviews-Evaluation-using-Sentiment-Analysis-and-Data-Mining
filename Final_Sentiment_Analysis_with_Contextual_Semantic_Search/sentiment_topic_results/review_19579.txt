{"text": "I have been searching for the right size bra for myself because i had gotten breast enhancement surgery a while back. I saw this bra and thought it would be perfect because in the picture it doesnt look as if it is complete coverage and cute enough to wear out. wrong. this bra (in a 34 G) is full coverage. im taking even when i wear a tank top (thick strapped) it is sticking out over my shirt. keep in mind that i dont dress trampy in anyway at all. there is o way i can wear this bra out and can only wear it to work when i have a shirt that goes all the way up to my neck.. V necks, forget about it. i am so disappointed. very very bad purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1154787", "1": "0.0615443", "2": "0.08354084", "3": "0.42989373", "4": "0.138253", "5": "0.08842326", "6": "0.08286612"}}
