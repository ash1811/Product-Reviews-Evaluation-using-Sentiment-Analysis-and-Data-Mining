{"text": "Sloggers 260KW08 Women's Premium Clogs are a fantastic pair of shoes for my feet not only for gardening, but for walking in many conditions.  I usually wear a size 7.5 shoe, wear a 37 medium in Birkenstocks and the size 8 Sloggers are very fine for me.  I likely could also fit into a 7, but because I'd like to wear socks if I desire, I followed the recommendations of others and moved up a size rather than down.  Another consideration I had when ordering was that when I work, particularly in the summertime, my feet swell, so I sized up.  An advantage of these clogs over many others is that their insoles make for a softer, more cushioned feel and they are removable for cleaning or airing out.  I find that wearing these requires no socks in the garden, a huge pro for me since my socks become filthy when I wear Crocs clogs.  The Sloggers put the Crocs to shame even though they are heavier.  I much prefer the feel and appearance of their real sole rather than a self molded one piece shoe.  The black sole is a nice contrast, as is the black interior and the bottom of the sole has a lovely swoosh type design in the Kiwi color.  Walking in dirt or mud is not an issue because these shoes can be hosed off.  The design of the clogs has a rear which is a bit elevated, so your heel is a little more protected than in other clogs.  I've worn Birkenstock shoes for many, many years and now that I've discovered Sloggers, I have an alternate manufacturer to choose from, and these are made in the USA!  These are great gardening shoes which are nice enough to wear all day inside or out.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09328675", "1": "0.17416202", "2": "0.10811589", "3": "0.24483274", "4": "0.1776621", "5": "0.10637072", "6": "0.09556976"}}
