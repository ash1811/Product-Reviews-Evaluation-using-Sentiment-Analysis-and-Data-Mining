{"text": "Isotoner distributes excellent quality in their bedroom slipper products and this one does not disappoint.  I am on disability so I am home most days and I live in my bedroom slippers and pajamas.  With daily back pain, I need a shoe that is supportive and comfortable.  I am very pleased with this clog.  Since I live in my slippers a great deal of the time, it is necessary that I replace them every 3 to 6 months and I know I can count on Isotoner to deliver a comfortable and quality shoe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12451473", "1": "0.23838001", "2": "0.23633866", "3": "0.0639132", "4": "0.09169239", "5": "0.07225925", "6": "0.17290173"}}
