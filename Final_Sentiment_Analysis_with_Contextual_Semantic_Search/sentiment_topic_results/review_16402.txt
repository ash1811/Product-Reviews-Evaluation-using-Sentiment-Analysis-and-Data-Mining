{"text": "I purchased these shoes for my husband who was opposed to wearing them initially.  After some coaxing, he raved about the comfort and is a Sperry convert.  Unfortunately, after wearing less than a week, they began to fall apart.  I returned them and ordered a new pair which were a size larger than they should have been despite being marked a 9.5.  Sooo, I returned them again.  This time, we'll buy in person as Amazon cannot be trusted to deliver a quality product that is sized correctly.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12717424", "1": "0.22444779", "2": "0.065049574", "3": "0.12670995", "4": "0.16872747", "5": "0.14582951", "6": "0.14206143"}}
