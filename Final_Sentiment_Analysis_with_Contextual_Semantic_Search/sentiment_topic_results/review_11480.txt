{"text": "These shirts shrink very little the first wash then none after that. They are not the softest shirts on record but they are pretty true to size. A large fits as should. But the great thing Is these shirts come In around 30 colors to choose from! It a dream to get colors to match your outerware. And at less than $5 for a large they are a great deal even with a small shipping fee. I received some sand and some chestnut which Is a nice color besides the black shown.For the fit, and value they are 5 star shirts. Hope you enjoy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.041371778", "1": "0.36613038", "2": "0.15258333", "3": "0.14649904", "4": "0.091298744", "5": "0.08669112", "6": "0.115425594"}}
