{"text": "This watch is very eye catching. It looks like a Rolex Submariner and that is part of the reason I bought it. The other reason I bought it was to try out an automatic watch (which do not use a battery). I have discovered that it is not very effective at keeping the correct time. After around a month of ownership, I noticed it was loosing more and more time each day. Currently, I have a watch winding case whose purpose it is to prevent time loss. When I leave it running all day with the Invicta inside, it looses 5-10 seconds a day. For timekeeping purposes, this is not up to par. Most good automatics should loose that amount in one week.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07619499", "1": "0.19815047", "2": "0.19310588", "3": "0.12692903", "4": "0.12061849", "5": "0.25795686", "6": "0.027044255"}}
