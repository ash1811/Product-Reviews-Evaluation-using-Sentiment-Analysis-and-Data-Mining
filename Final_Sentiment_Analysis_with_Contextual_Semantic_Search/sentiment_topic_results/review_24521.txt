{"text": "I hadn't owned hush puppies in years and in so stating didn't know how they ran size wise.I ordered a half siz larger. Needless to say they were a little loose as Hush Puppies run true to size. In fact I ordered a different style a few days ago and in the size I wear. Wasn't surprised that they were perfect! I love both pairs and can't say enough about Amazon prime. Simply amazing. Great shoe at an awsome price. I am very fussy about shoes and i go more for comfort than style. Will definetley buy more!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10988435", "1": "0.1659694", "2": "0.06750065", "3": "0.32016838", "4": "0.19031996", "6": "0.14350426"}}
