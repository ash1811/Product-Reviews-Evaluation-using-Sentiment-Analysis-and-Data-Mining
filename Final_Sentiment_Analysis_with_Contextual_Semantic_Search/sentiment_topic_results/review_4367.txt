{"text": "We found these inexpensive khakis at Amazon.  They were exactly what we were looking for.  The good news, the khakis were great.  The bad news, because they ran a little small, we had to return them for the next larger size.  Amazon penalized us by making us pay the return shipping, even though we reordered the same items in a larger size.  Most on line clothing purchases offer free shipping for a size exchange.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14797035", "1": "0.07530952", "2": "0.097117476", "3": "0.08957212", "4": "0.26440006", "5": "0.099544704", "6": "0.22608577"}}
