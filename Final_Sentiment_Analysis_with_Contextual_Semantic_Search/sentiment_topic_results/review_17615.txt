{"text": "If you need an accurate, simple, and reasonably sturdy watch, this is a good option.  This is one of my backup watches, which I keep in my day pack, which I tend to loan out for friends.  This is a unisex watch, with a short strap.  I'm not particularly beastly, and this watch just fits on my wrist, on the very last hole.  It fits my smaller friends much better, including two petite ladies' wrists.  It's easy to set, and has been accurate within 1/10th of a second (as close as I can perceive) for over a month.  Very no-frills, but it's excellent for what it is.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07656298", "1": "0.1644835", "2": "0.26215187", "3": "0.08169293", "4": "0.11904124", "5": "0.16224621", "6": "0.1338213"}}
