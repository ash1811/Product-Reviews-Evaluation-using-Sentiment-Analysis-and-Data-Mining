{"text": "I bought this with an ultrasonic machine and have been using it with the machine since the beginning. Everything looks great after using it. In my second batch, I only used half of the amount they recommended because the earlier batch seemed unnecessarily soapy. Still seems to work well with half the amount. The only caveat is that I have been thoroughly rinsing everything after using this product. It seems to leave surfaces a bit tacky if you don't fully rinse them. I wonder if this can lead to jewelry actually getting dirtier more quickly? Still, the stuff I cleaned was pretty filthy. Maybe testing the machine without the cleaner would make it more clear.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.22402161", "1": "0.22014633", "2": "0.18741728", "3": "0.19948623", "4": "0.03717404", "5": "0.090974025", "6": "0.04078048"}}
