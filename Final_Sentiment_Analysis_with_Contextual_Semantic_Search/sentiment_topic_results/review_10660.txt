{"text": "Not by a long shot.  The big date is nice by doesn't really belong on this watch.  I had a real expensive A. Lange (Datograph in platinum) which worked with the big date but this does not look right.  A nice watch for the money but it doesn't look good enough on the wrist.  Great value but the SNAE67 (on a gorgeous strap) or SNAE 69 (nice bracelet) look better and are definitely more striking.  And changing the battery is cheaper than changing this battery or capacitor when the time is up.  I do appreciate the large date but the watch hands are not prominent enough  (I looked at almost every Sekio and Citizen).  The Seiko SNAE67 or SNAE69 (bracelet) are cheaper and better looking.  Replacing the battery is cheap.  Citizen also has better looking watches ---the limited edition Eli Manning (1,000 pieces --- not so limited or it's just a cheaper AT perpetual chronograph(  I got this for $100 less than the Manning.)Take a look at both on your wrist.  Moreover, the capacitor/battery does wear out and costs much more than a battery.  $1-$2 per battery is good.  Probably at least $1000 if Swiss made.Two nice watches but the SNAE 67 or 69 is cheaper, simpler (and more reliable) and better looking.  The Snea 67 looks even better but lacks a bracelet (it has arabic numbers which look really.  Like a $1,000+ watch.  It also has less to break and is wonderfully priced,I don't know why so many of these have sold but so few SNAE's (except because the SNAE's are newer) and have fewer high-tech capabilities (capabilities which are not that important, expensive to repair --- the SNAE battery is $1 while kinetic capacitor replacement is probably $100, and so on).You, your frends, and women will be impressed by the SNAE 67 or 69 looks, not this.And Amazon sells them, too.  (For less.)Good luck.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.34042943", "2": "0.1606243", "3": "0.14934656", "4": "0.046079572", "5": "0.13582046", "6": "0.16552782"}}
