{"text": "Purchased at Bagram Afghanistan PX in 2007 and this watch is a must-have for anyone treking into the mountains (of which I did, alot).  Over the years the watch has taken a beating - the bezel is scratched up but, I still get a lot of comments about the watch.  The altimeter (incl the memory function) worked very well.  Battery replacement is easy (and has to occur about once a year).  The watch is a typical ABC watch, that looks good and does the job.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12778029", "1": "0.26057452", "2": "0.38502926", "5": "0.14108521", "6": "0.07915074"}}
