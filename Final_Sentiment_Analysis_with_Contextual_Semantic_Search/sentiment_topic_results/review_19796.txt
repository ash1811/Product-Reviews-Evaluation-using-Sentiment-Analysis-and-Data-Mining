{"text": "This watch is very nice for the price.  It is was just what I was looking for.  The size is perfect for my wrist (my wrists are small), the band is smooth and it is very light.  The color is nice as well.  It says black but I think it is more of a darker gray, which I was hoping for.  I did have a problem setting the minutes, I can not set them exactly but maybe that is operator error.  I wanted a watch and stop watch and this is perfect.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15912162", "1": "0.37557876", "2": "0.21059348", "6": "0.2433699"}}
