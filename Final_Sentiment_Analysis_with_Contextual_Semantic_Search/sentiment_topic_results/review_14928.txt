{"text": "I have a couple of other baggallini's that I've used in the past but I could always find something I wanted that was missing.  One was too small, one too large, one too deep etc.  This one is &#34;THE ONE&#34; for me.  I'm a wheelchair user and I love that I can wear this across body and feel very secure that no one can &#34;snatch&#34; it away.  I can access everything easily, it carries my water mug, my cellphone and if I have my iPad or papers or whatever they fit very well in the larger back area.  It has just the right about of hiding places, the credit card holders, etc.  Everything one could ask for.  This is definitely the one I'm sticking with and I'm so happy I found it!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.022148555", "1": "0.29790452", "2": "0.25754365", "3": "0.074152626", "4": "0.15099674", "5": "0.10101859", "6": "0.09623529"}}
