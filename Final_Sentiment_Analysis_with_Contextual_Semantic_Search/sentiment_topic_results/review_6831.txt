{"text": "This came in really handy on our last trip. We put our Chicco KeyFit 30 in there with no problem (it's one of the larger seats out there) plus we also put a huge bag of diapers, travel cubes of our clothes, and a few other items in there with it. There's no weight limit on carseat bags, and they fly for free, so we stuffed it up to 60+ lbs and it came through with not a problem. One tip is to lash everything together inside the bag, since the zipper could come undone and then your stuff will go flying, we used our Ergo carrier straps to connect everything with the carseat itself and it worked like a charm. The shoulder straps have a good amount of padding on them and are well placed (I'm 5'10&#34; tall, I can imagine if you're 5'6&#34; or shorter this might be an overwhelming bag for you, it is huuuuge). For the money, it seems like a great value.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16876689", "1": "0.1720249", "2": "0.18243386", "3": "0.1224258", "4": "0.16576399", "5": "0.08515794", "6": "0.10342661"}}
