{"text": "These pants have 9 heavy duty belt loops. The size and length are accurate. The material is a little stiff - towards canvas - only washed once tho. Very little shrinkage. Not as soft as old blue jeans, but feels armored. Much more rugged. They look more like Slacks rather than jeans. I am buying a second pair - different color.UPDATE: Its been 3 months since I bought the Jeans and the zipper broke. I wasn't even wearing them at the time. In hand, I tried to unzip all the way down and it was hung-up. Zipper teeth section pulled right out. Very disappointing.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21199302", "1": "0.28691664", "2": "0.03639292", "4": "0.22728337", "6": "0.2325544"}}
