{"text": "My husband can't wear the metal bands because they break him out, so I got him this watch with a replaceable leather band.  He also needs his reading glasses to see small print and numbers, but it's sometimes inconvenient to go looking for glasses just to see what time it is.  I checked out the digital watches with large numbers, and the talking watches, but none of them were satisfactory. This watch, although not very expensive, has the replaceable leather band, large easily read numbers, and even the date.  It seems to work very well and my husband likes it...and that's what counts.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05663634", "1": "0.09664181", "2": "0.28113607", "3": "0.23563904", "4": "0.18403068", "5": "0.06414272", "6": "0.08177338"}}
