{"text": "I took a chance on this pair of pants as I wasn't familiar with them. I was very pleasantly surprised! This is one of the most comfortable pair of pants I have ever had. I intend to get more as needed!! They fit me really well, and that's saying something as I am not easy to fit having a \"jug like\" frame. Also I especially like the stretch panels on the side they help make the pants fit really well. Overall, I very good buy!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.46139345", "3": "0.10971005", "4": "0.04444751", "6": "0.3746627"}}
