{"text": "These are very nice slippers. My last Acorns lasted forever, I hope these will too.  My only complaint is that they've stretched out in the width so I have to wear them with heavy socks to keep them from slipping off. That's ok though, since it's winter and these aren't summer slippers  :-)So far, I'd recommend them since Acorn is the best slipper I've found.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15975946", "1": "0.21125911", "3": "0.33607447", "4": "0.14766636", "6": "0.13725837"}}
