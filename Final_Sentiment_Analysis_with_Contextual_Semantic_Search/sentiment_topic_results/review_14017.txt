{"text": "PURPOSE: This will be my go-to Designated Wet Watch for the twenty times a year I swim and/or snorkel. I need a watch that is better than nominally waterproof and will be ticking when I want to wear it. The 300m depth water resistance rating and the Eco-Drive meet those needs.THE WATCH: This is a very modest-size watch by dive standards and by today's generic standards for sport watches. The 43mm case diameter listed with the specs includes the crown and its surround. Additionally the bezel is quite large, which makes for a relatively small dial. The dial, including the seconds dial, is 27mm wide. The dial, excluding the seconds dial, is 23mm wide. For reference, a U.S. quarter is 23.5mm wide. All measurements are with a metric ruler rather than with a micrometer and, as such, are approximate. The point is that this is a relatively small dive watch. The circular and triangular hour indicators and the hands are large and legible. The lume is on a par with other non-tritium watches. The second hand and the second hand dial are exactly aligned. Although small, the crown is well-protected and works precisely. The 60-stop rotating bezel is perfectly aligned and works smoothly. As others have mentioned, the numbers are painted on the bezel.THE BAND: I have several models of Citizen Eco-Drives and this is the best band of all, taking into consideration an apples-to-apples comparison as to types of watches. The band compares favorably with any of my dive or sport watches with rubber straps, regardless of the brand. Both of the strap-end loop retainers slide rather than having the one closest to the buckle fixed to the strap.IN CONCLUSION: Having checked the specs closely before I ordered, this watch was exactly what I expected. As well as being soggy-sport-enabled, this watch also would be a good everyday wear for persons needing \"beaters\" in tough work environments. Also, this watch can be found at 50%+ discounts. Regards, --RonUPDATE 02-25-2011: I put an Eichmueller solid link, stainless steel bracelet on this watch. Rather than for diving, per se, my aqua antics primarily are saltwater swimming, snorkeling, and freshwater pool activities. Divers might eschew a bracelet, preferring a rubber strap, but for my purposes the bracelet is perfect. It's comfortable to wear and it looks great! --Ron", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0757598", "1": "0.07186479", "2": "0.23009731", "3": "0.16813377", "4": "0.18016511", "5": "0.06347847", "6": "0.21050076"}}
