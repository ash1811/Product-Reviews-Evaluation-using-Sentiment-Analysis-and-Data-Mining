{"text": "Decent and OK pair of polarized sunglasses. Needed a relatively cheap pair of polarized sunglasses for wearing on the water and for camping. These are comfortable to wear, light, and look good to me.  They have been durable and subjected to rough treatment. They have stood up well and perform as you would expect. The lenses have not scratched yet and are great at blocking glare and allowing me to see below the water surface. The price is right too. Especially on sale.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09310683", "1": "0.49749187", "2": "0.24765779", "4": "0.059430715", "5": "0.09593516"}}
