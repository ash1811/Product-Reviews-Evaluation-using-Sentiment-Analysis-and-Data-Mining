{"text": "Just the usual superb Carhartt quality.  This coat is warm, tough, comfortable, and surprisingly good looking.  I wear it on hunting trips AND to go out to nice places in my city.  It looks as good today, many outdoor hiking and hunting trips layer, as the day I bought it a year ago.  Brass hardware both looks good and is really durable.Oh, and as some reviewers are saying, it starts out really stiff.  Trust me, a year later it feels like the most comfortable coat you've ever owned.  Like good boots, you need to break this in.  It's tough as nails, it has to start out stiff.I basically will only buy Carhartt outerwear these days for any serious function.  No one but Dickey comes close on quality.  Highly recommended.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10308709", "1": "0.4467795", "2": "0.05954784", "3": "0.013398633", "4": "0.12409205", "5": "0.065487005", "6": "0.18760793"}}
