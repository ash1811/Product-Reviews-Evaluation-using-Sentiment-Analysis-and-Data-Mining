{"text": "I have many watches. This to me is THE best watch value ever. You can spend $ 4,000 for a Rolex, or $ 100 for this watch, and the quality - at least to me - is nearly the same. This watch in no way feels like a \"cheap watch\". Everything thing about it is heavy and solid. It looks and feels like a Rolex. Sure, the bezel is not as good as a Rolex, and the 21 jewel movement is not on par with a 32 jewel Rolex, but the difference is tiny (the second hand, as it goes around, it slightly less smooth than a Rolex, but so what ?). I can only recommend this watch. Also, unlike a Rolex for $ 4,000, if I bang this watch and scratch it, or lose it, I am not going to cry, but just order another one.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0709661", "1": "0.13997836", "2": "0.30989152", "3": "0.026140662", "4": "0.24145402", "5": "0.056874037", "6": "0.15469527"}}
