{"text": "I loved these boots, they are extremely comfortable and look great. Easy on and off with good support. I don't think they offer enough protection to ride a motorcycle use. The upper section is to soft and pliable to offer any safety. Over all these didn't last very long either as the heel was gone with in two years. I would recommend these for other outside activities as they are a boot you can wear all day every day. I though the value was great as well. Especially for a made in the USA boot, although I think those days might be gone as it was 4 years ago I purchased mine. Over all these are great items but if your a serious motorcyclist pass and look for another pair. If your law enforcement or need a tac-boot these are great.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09423847", "1": "0.34028476", "2": "0.048835658", "3": "0.16964543", "4": "0.11881026", "5": "0.14305954", "6": "0.0851259"}}
