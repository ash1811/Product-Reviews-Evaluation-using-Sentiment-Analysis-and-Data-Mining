{"text": "I wanted a watch that I didn't have to worry about what activities I was doing and be cautious about easily dinging it up. This is a very well built waterproof watch, but beyond basic timekeeping, the other features really seemed like an afterthought. The digital display is small and dim and in moderate to bright light, it is very difficult to read. The recessed buttons were a good idea, but actually using them is difficult (keeping a button pressed down for any length of time kills your fingers). The watch face is small and barely luminous in the dark. I dread having to change the time back an hour for DST or when traveling because you have to hold down the buttons for a looong time until the hands make it all the way around again. It's a decent rugged timepiece, but don't get it for it's bells and whistles.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19427875", "1": "0.08252445", "2": "0.19027275", "3": "0.16270255", "4": "0.17272955", "6": "0.19501844"}}
