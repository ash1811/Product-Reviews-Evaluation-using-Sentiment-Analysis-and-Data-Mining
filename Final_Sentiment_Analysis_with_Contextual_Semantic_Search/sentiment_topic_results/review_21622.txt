{"text": "I still give this coat 5 stars even though it was not manufactured in the U.S.. I think its made in Mexico. As far as the quality its typical Carhartt. Fit, finish & design is excellent. I like the double zipper for convenience in accessing my pockets, * eliminates the occasional binding below the waist. I also like the color. FYI, Canopa did a good job in shipping this item.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3438111", "2": "0.26588935", "3": "0.085915476", "4": "0.13806698", "6": "0.15916005"}}
