{"text": "I have a wide foot, so ordered this shoe in a C/D width.  It's a nice shoe and I really liked it, but even laced as tightly as possible it was way too big.  I don't think this is a flaw with the shoe... I guess maybe my foot isn't as wide as I thought it was.  I have returned these and reordered it in a medium width.  I feel awkward giving it a star rating since I haven't really worn them.  If you have a truly wide foot, the wide width of this shoe will fit you!  I am exchanging for a regular width shoe.UPDATE: I have since received the normal width shoe.  I LOVE THIS SNEAKER!  It was comfortable right out of the box and didn't even require any significant \"breaking in.\"  The back of the heel is exactly at the right height - provides support but doesn't dig into the back of my heel at the same time.  Shoelaces are a tad short.  Buying shoes online is a crapshoot, but these are really awesome.  I thought I had wide feet, but the regular width fits me just fine!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.097038485", "1": "0.22697607", "2": "0.25213233", "4": "0.26303107", "5": "0.09114746", "6": "0.067241035"}}
