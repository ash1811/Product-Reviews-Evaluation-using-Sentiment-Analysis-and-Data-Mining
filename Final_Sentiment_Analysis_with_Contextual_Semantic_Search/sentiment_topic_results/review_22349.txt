{"text": "Too bad they are so expensive. The only flaw is the price. I have bought 3 different brands of 5-finger socks and these are the best. Doublju are nice but not quite as nice as these. If you have reservations about the price, buy the Doublju socks, they are almost as nice as these and are a little cheaper. I bought a couple pair of these (Injinji) here on amazon and got lucky and found a 6-pack deal on groupon for the others.If you don't mind the price, these are the best I have found. I just wish they made some longer ones for winter wear. The only long ones I can find are the compression socks that are SUPER expensive.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.6816394", "2": "0.039772984", "3": "0.10710364", "4": "0.029888427", "5": "0.13629399"}}
