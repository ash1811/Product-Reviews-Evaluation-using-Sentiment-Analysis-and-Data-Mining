{"text": "The last time I was at my mom's she had just bought one of these.  It looked very comfortable and pretty so I ordered one in my size.  I wear a 34D in other brands, but Playtex doesn't carry that size, so I buy a 36D and wear it on the tightest hooks.  This band seems to run small, the 36 fit me like a 34 in other brands, I could wear it on the last hooks.  The cups, on the other hand, run big.  The foam lining also makes them a little stiff and pointy, so under a t-shirt it looked like my breasts were aiming off to each side, really not flattering!  A very odd fit, which is too bad because it seems like a comfortable bra.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.103938185", "1": "0.26908776", "3": "0.28909218", "4": "0.11213821", "5": "0.16480942", "6": "0.058464047"}}
