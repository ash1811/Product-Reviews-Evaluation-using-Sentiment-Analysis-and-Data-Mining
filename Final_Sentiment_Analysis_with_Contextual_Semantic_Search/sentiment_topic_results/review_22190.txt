{"text": "Im usually a xl or xxl. With this jacket Im a large, I think I could of maybe got a medium even. This jacket is very warm and makes a good winter work jacket for me here in connecticut. This is NOT a light spring or fall jacket. 45 degrees and up you sweat. Its very tough and the arms are long enough. The hood is insulated so its very warm. You do not need any kind of winter hat when wearing this jacket with the hood up. My only problem is the zipper is hard to zip for the first couple of inches but its very slowly getting better with time. Im not sure if all the zippers are like this or just mine.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.035631176", "1": "0.33982882", "2": "0.29992157", "3": "0.122138046", "4": "0.034417644", "5": "0.07955445", "6": "0.08850828"}}
