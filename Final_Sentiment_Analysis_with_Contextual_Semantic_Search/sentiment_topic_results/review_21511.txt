{"text": "I have been wearing bloch dance sneakers for 10 years and love them.  I am wearing this pair to teach zumba.  Great pivot to save the knees.  They do have a split sole which is not for everyone if you do not have strong feet. Bloch shoes require you to size up 2 sizes- I wear 7 or 8 regularly but I always order a 9.5 for bloch sneakers.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.21883552", "1": "0.18612294", "2": "0.094449736", "3": "0.23955521", "4": "0.16668874", "6": "0.09047263"}}
