{"text": "I knew going in this was a juniors jean, but 29 should be 29, dangit. I bought a pair of Levis 505 straight leg with these, size 29/8-Long (a women's jean). The 505 fit great, the 524 are too small. I can't even get them over my butt.Despite being 2% Spandex, the denim is thick and sturdy and has the classic denim diagonal line ridges. It's a nicer material than the 505s are.Thought I could get away with it, but I couldn't. Ladies, take note. I would try 2 sizes larger (a 31). I'm still deciding if I should bother with an exchange or just return them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14976443", "1": "0.26132357", "2": "0.09968093", "3": "0.15944998", "4": "0.17579584", "6": "0.15178092"}}
