{"text": "These watches are wonderful for children learning the nuance of time.  There are small numbers at the edges reminding them that if the big hand is at 10, it is 50 minutes after the hour, etc.  They are comfortable, and inexpensive enough that the kids can wear them to school without worry.  They are NOT water proof, so need to be taken off before showering or swimming, but can endure almost all other activities.  My granddaughters wear theirs always and I believe it helped them to learn time quickly and painlessly.  The batteries are long lasting.  They come in a wide variety of patterns and colors for both girls and boys.  You really can't go wrong with these watches.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17196614", "1": "0.2439182", "2": "0.26018274", "3": "0.10879239", "4": "0.053018387", "5": "0.056175336", "6": "0.105946794"}}
