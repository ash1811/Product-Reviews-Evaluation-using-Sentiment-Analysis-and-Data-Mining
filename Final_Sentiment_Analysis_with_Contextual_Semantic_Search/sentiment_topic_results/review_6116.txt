{"text": "I bought these onesies because there is never too much white plain onesies in a baby's closet, right? And my baby needed long sleeved ones.I like them but I don't love them, altough they are worth the price. The cotton is a little flimsy and they fit very weird. The neck is huge, it stays wide open showing much of the chest of my baby (which is not at all proper when you buy something thinking of chiller days). That may seem that they are still too big, but the length is small and if I don't use them now they won't snap closed in a few weeks.Because of this bad fit I can only wear these at home, for they look more like cheap pajamas than outfit clothes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.02701383", "1": "0.4042447", "2": "0.08267971", "3": "0.17039204", "5": "0.20332724", "6": "0.10982574"}}
