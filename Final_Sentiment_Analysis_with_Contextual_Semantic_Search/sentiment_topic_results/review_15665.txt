{"text": "I bought these along with another brand on here to test them out.  These are very soft and comfortable but I found that they were shorter than I originally thought.  They are closer to briefs than boxer briefs I think.  There is also no fly so just FYI for you guys.  All in all I like them but not as much as I like the other pair I got on here that were rated the top on amazon for boxer briefs.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04851958", "1": "0.11053567", "3": "0.16254674", "4": "0.29464617", "5": "0.14449967", "6": "0.23478338"}}
