{"text": "This is a replacement of the same model I had for 10 years. The plastic body of the watch started to break off in chunks and eventually the internals of the watch were exposed and well you guess the rest. I was abusive to the watch, taken it in extreme high and low temperature environments, moist environments, went swimming with it on. It's been hit by walls, doors, the ground, trees (all unintentionally of course) but it withstood all that abuse for 10 years. So I went on Amazon and found it to be very reasonably priced since I don't have the budget for the military models.This watch has the features I need and is of great quality. I recommend it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13486895", "1": "0.1225648", "2": "0.17756115", "3": "0.10619013", "4": "0.17546996", "5": "0.17113657", "6": "0.11220844"}}
