{"text": "Just as beautiful as the photo, and provides great support! I did take the advice of other reviewers, and bought a size down (normally a 34C, and I bought a 32C). It fit great in that sense. However, I am a bit on the petite side (5' 2\") and the bottom of the torsolette kind of juts out--wouldn't look good under my wedding gown. I am returning it, but do recommend it if you have a slightly longer torso. I wish they made a petite size!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14855723", "1": "0.18683904", "2": "0.07529644", "3": "0.1394492", "4": "0.10676618", "5": "0.2531527", "6": "0.08993924"}}
