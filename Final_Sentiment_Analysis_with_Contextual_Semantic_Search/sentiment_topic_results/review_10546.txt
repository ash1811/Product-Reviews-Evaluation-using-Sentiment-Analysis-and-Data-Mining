{"text": "My husband purchased these for me to match a white gold necklace.  I wear them 95% of the time.  I sleep in them.  They are very small, but that's what I like about them.  They're dainty.  The latch is still working well, even though I shower in them and sleep in them.  I change them rarely, as they match the necklace which is sentimental to me.  I had meant to get some more white gold earrings and just haven't.  These have stood the test of time... even though I didn't mean to challenge them that way.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.186052", "1": "0.14971347", "2": "0.0675949", "3": "0.20892894", "4": "0.14441228", "5": "0.13153411", "6": "0.1117643"}}
