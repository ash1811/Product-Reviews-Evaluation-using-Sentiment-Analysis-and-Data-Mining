{"text": "Wow!  I paid $67 for this exact watch on Amazon just a few weeks ago! I was shocked to see that the current price is $112.50.  It's a great watch at $67, not quite as good at the higher price - note that CostCo sells them for $69.95.  The links are truly a bear to remove.  I suspect that the link removal device sold on Amazon may not work due to the particular design of these links.  You have to push the linking device out from inside the band rather than from the outside edge of the band.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12579408", "1": "0.20977475", "2": "0.22166891", "3": "0.060314287", "4": "0.17634569", "5": "0.13301983", "6": "0.073082455"}}
