{"text": "Essential Apparel makes excellent thermal underwear tops for those cold, cold days and nights. The fabric is actually extremely well made and this underwear could easily last years with proper care. It can be worn as underwear under your outdoor clothes or you can wear it in bed with your pajamas on over it. Whatever way you choose you can't go wrong with Essential Apparel thermal underwear.This thermal underwear top helps to keep you much warmer than you think it would. It may look flimsy in the picture above on this website--but when you're wearing it you'll notice a huge difference. You'll be a lot warmer! It also does not bunch or wrinkle easily.In order to get the initial scratchy itch out of these, don't wear them fresh from the store or this website--instead, wash and dry them first using fabric softener if you can. That way they'll be much softer when you wear them the first time. As for maintenance, I just put mine in the clothes washer and dryer and everything always comes out fine. If you have concerns about the color \"bleeding\" onto white colored clothing, just wash this with garments that are not white. You'll be fine. In addition, it shrinks very little.Be sure to check the pricing and availability chart and the merchant sizing chart if you want to order this here.Overall, Essential Apparel makes a terrific thermal underwear top. I highly recommend this product.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03186506", "1": "0.16987841", "2": "0.11518064", "3": "0.24986768", "4": "0.13591106", "5": "0.12615545", "6": "0.1711417"}}
