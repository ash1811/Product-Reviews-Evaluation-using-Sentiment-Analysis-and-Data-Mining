{"text": "I've heard about the Orange Monster for some time now. A famous watch with 21 jewel automatic movement (no batteries to replace) and while my watch collection is mostly watches with huge bezels in the 50-60mm range, I wanted a smaller automatic watch to wear while I jog and workout. I wanted a rugged watch. So with four monsters to choose from (black and orange with rubber and stainless steel bands; the yellow and blue colors are no longer available), I went with the orange and rubber match.I love the fit, feel and sheer substantial weight of what is my smallest watch. The crown is at the 4 number so it doesn't dig into your wrist. Very comfortable. The numbers shine at night or in a dark room. I love that feature (common to dive watches).My only complaint is you can't wind this watch. You have to shake or wear it every day to keep it going. In contrast, my other automatic watch, an Invicta Corduba, has a winding option, which I like since I don't wear the same watch (out of a 10-watch collection) every day.I end up wearing the Seiko Orange Monster around the house when I do my chores, my yoga, walking the dog, jogging, etc. to keep it going so I don't have to reset it. If you want to spend a little more for a bigger bezel (48 without crown; 51 with) and enjoy the convenience of solar power, you might check out the Citizen Eco-Drive Diver BJ8050-08E with rubber strap for $215 or the $270 stainless steel Ecozilla version BJ8050-59E.But if you want the smaller bezel and don't mind the non-winding option on an automatic movement, the Seiko Orange Monster is highly recommended.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14593399", "1": "0.15030256", "2": "0.28842235", "3": "0.1275874", "4": "0.05879212", "5": "0.18430234", "6": "0.04465924"}}
