{"text": "The reviews on these earrings were so mixed that I wasn't sure I was going to be happy when I received them. I'm pleased to say I was not unpleasantly surprised.They are flimsy, they're very light, they don't seem overly trustworthy, but they're very pretty AND under $150. If you're looking for solid heavy gold hoops that will last a lifetime, you need to visit your jeweler and be prepared to invest. If you want a delicate pair of chic hoops that will fill a hole in your jewelry box for less than the cost of a nice dinner out, these are for you.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.053295184", "1": "0.22082554", "2": "0.09493068", "3": "0.13468166", "4": "0.16257112", "5": "0.22850561", "6": "0.10519024"}}
