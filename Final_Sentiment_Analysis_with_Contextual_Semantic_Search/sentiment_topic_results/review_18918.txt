{"text": "Husband's been wearing the 559's for additional room in the seat and thighs but SO baggy and worse after an hour of wearing them.. NOT the case with these 514's - they've held up thru many washes and look great on him without the stretching out/bagging seat. And he likes they're comfort so I don't have to hide his other jeans to get him to wear them!!Hope Levi continues this style as they're his new favorite.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.20611776", "2": "0.17406254", "3": "0.08374066", "4": "0.1747477", "5": "0.1949311", "6": "0.16281016"}}
