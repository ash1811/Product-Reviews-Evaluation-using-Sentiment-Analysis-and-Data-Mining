{"text": "I have bought one in gray for myself and 2 Dark blue for gifts. They are extremely soft and warm as advertised. I have not washed mine yet so have no review on that. I gave a 4 instead of 5 star rating due to blue shaw having a few areas of unevenly woven spots which are more visible with  this color. Still, good product for price", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20425718", "1": "0.33132702", "2": "0.102635525", "4": "0.15836018", "5": "0.12738779", "6": "0.07204809"}}
