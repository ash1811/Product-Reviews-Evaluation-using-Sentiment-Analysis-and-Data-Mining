{"text": "I am very, very happy with this item and wish that I had purchased it long ago.I am not pregnant.  Sadly, I am an obese, middle-aged lady with a panniculus (skin apron) that hangs down, causing me lots of discomfort and back pain.  The mini cradle has worked beautifully for me.  No more skin irritation, and much less pressure on my back.  Stays in place; easy to use.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.28876328", "2": "0.22149545", "3": "0.15277004", "4": "0.21829943", "6": "0.11113193"}}
