{"text": "I have craved for years the Rolex of similar (almost identical) look, but would NEVER spend thousands on a watch. I have owned Rolex watches for many years and they do not keep accurate time, I once lost one off a sailboat when the clasp burst open on mild impact (no safety clasp design) and...servicing the watch costs hundreds of dollars. The Invicta is handsome, looks expensive, keeps time satisfactorily and is a great price.  What a great find!When I broke the crystal (my fault) it was cheaper and faster to take it to a local watch repair than to ship back to Invicta and wait ?months for return.  And, as others have commented, local jeweler will adjust the band for negligible cost.Buy the color/model you like, you won't be sorry.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1877677", "1": "0.14319746", "2": "0.22046024", "3": "0.080845885", "4": "0.1705324", "5": "0.105610415", "6": "0.09158586"}}
