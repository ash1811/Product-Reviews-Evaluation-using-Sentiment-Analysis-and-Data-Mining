{"text": "Chiming in with others about how good looking this is, more so than the picture suggests. It's roomy, lots of interior pockets, the handles are sturdy and feel just right. I do a lot of traveling and this is perfect for laptop, a book, water and those things that won't fit in a purse. Paid $85 for a Baggaliini &#34;Only Bag&#34; a few months back for a three week trip. I thought the three compartments which accordion out would be ideal, but it was all wrong. it was cumbersome and difficult to find things in, and found myself always fumbling in airports looking for items. This is just right- everything organized and easy to see. Bought black and reordered a second in turquoise. Think they'd also make great gifts.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.086081795", "1": "0.16017857", "2": "0.21087594", "3": "0.15825246", "4": "0.112232484", "5": "0.13339324", "6": "0.13898551"}}
