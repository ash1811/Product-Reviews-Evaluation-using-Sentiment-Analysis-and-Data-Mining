{"text": "The colors I received were fine - couple zebra print style and neutral pink, black and whites.  Unfortunately, they don't have the wider waistband at the top as shown in the photo.  It has a narrow waistband that likes to roll down.  They also vary a bit between pairs with some of them being slightly big and others feeling snug around the legs or waist.  Overall good, but not the classic originals I am used to from Hanes.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08048212", "1": "0.23855226", "2": "0.11517436", "3": "0.20123552", "4": "0.09385342", "5": "0.13954043", "6": "0.13116185"}}
