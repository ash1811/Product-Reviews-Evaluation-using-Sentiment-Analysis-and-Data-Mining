{"text": "I bought a pair of shoes that although the right size, still saw my heels lifting in the back as I walked.  Very frustrating since they are exactly the shoes I wanted excepted for the weird heel cup.  After installing these heel cushions, my shoes fit perfectly, my heels never lift as I walk, and  I am a happy camper.  I recommend them highly!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09770033", "1": "0.32568327", "2": "0.28265578", "3": "0.18177462", "4": "0.025835132", "5": "0.08236218"}}
