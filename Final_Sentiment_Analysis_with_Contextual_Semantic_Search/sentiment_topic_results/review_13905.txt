{"text": "This is a great watch for the price, allowing that you won't be replacing batteries. It keeps very accurate time - I've had mine 3 week now and I'm not sure its more that a second off.  The band is short like everyone says. I have a 7 1/2&#34; wrist & wear it closed at  the 3rd hole. It is NOT uncomfortable - but I bought a black leather with red pipe stitching anyway. The watch looks so much better to me.  A good deal all around", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22223556", "1": "0.2558588", "2": "0.19068623", "3": "0.15806559", "5": "0.07431872", "6": "0.0957255"}}
