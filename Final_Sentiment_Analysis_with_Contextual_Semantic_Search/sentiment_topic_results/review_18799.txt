{"text": "I had a pair of these glasses previously and they lasted me about 7 years before scratches on the lenses (from regular use) became too much for me to cope with...that pair is now relegated to bike rides and running. They're lightweight, sturdy, the polarized lenses are a must. I am a big fan as the aviator trend is not for me as they don't fit my face shape. Considering these were roughly a 1/3rd of the cost from the last time I bought them, they're a bargain as well.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2137283", "1": "0.2014644", "2": "0.030003848", "3": "0.28535244", "4": "0.09629423", "5": "0.16997564"}}
