{"text": "Very shiny unlike other sterling silver I own. If the other reviews weren't so good I would worry that it isn't sterling.  Love the ring hate the shipping  but I needed a size 3 and couldn't find one anywhere else.  If the ring holds up I will order another style of size 3 from the seller.  The ring is big enough for any finger in my opinion and larger than I would normally wear on my pinkie but I already got over that! -- Lots of compliments on the ring.  I do love it but on my pinkie that is where the eye goes and the ring outshines anything else on that hand.  The ring is holding up very well.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16245177", "1": "0.34313", "2": "0.119963795", "3": "0.091263145", "4": "0.16470794", "5": "0.05097859", "6": "0.06750476"}}
