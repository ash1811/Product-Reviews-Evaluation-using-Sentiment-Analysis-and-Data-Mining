{"text": "Got these to replace some dockers i ordered where the sizing was off. The sizing on these is perfect, i actually have two pair, black and brown. These are definitely a reddish brown, but that's what i was looking for. They're mostly comfortable to walk in as well. My only minor gripe is that for a lot of walking, i can feel the side rub my ankle a bit. If i go out during lunch for a 30-minute walk or so it's a tag uncomfortable, but only on my ankle and only in the one spot, but no blisters or long-lasting discomfort or anything. Oh, and at the lace holes, there's some slight discoloration on the leather where the holes were punched, it's a little lighter, almost pinkish, but not really noticeable. Overall i really like these shoes and would gladly get them again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.029505964", "1": "0.3049293", "2": "0.19740614", "3": "0.19550861", "4": "0.03826205", "5": "0.107500404", "6": "0.12688756"}}
