{"text": "Bought these for my 15-year-old son for Valentine's Day.  He had been wanting some &#34;cool&#34; shades.  Read the reviews on the Original Wayfarer.  Saw some unhappy reviews.  Decided to go with the &#34;New Wayfarer.&#34;  Good decision.  They fit him perfectly.  Got the 55mm lens.  Would definitely buy again if he ends up losing these or stepping on them which is a high possibility with a teen.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10386226", "1": "0.31170276", "3": "0.17853826", "4": "0.1507932", "5": "0.119934715", "6": "0.13117936"}}
