{"text": "Some men want to see/feel the quality of an item before purchasing, rather than reading about the advertisement, so I was hesitant to order this product, hoping that the description, picture was true to the item receiving.  The feel of the polo, color, size is true to advertising.  The package and packaging was as good as expected.  For men that would like polo shirts, and a company that you can trust, this would be the right polo for you.  When the Men are happy, then the ladies become happy also -- this way all is well.  They are satisfied with the item, and are wearing them with their desired pants style whether with jeans or casual pants.  I would recommend these polo shirts to anyone who is interested in size, quality, color, service and price.  We are all pleased with this product.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1426351", "1": "0.34624374", "2": "0.07253588", "3": "0.04856314", "4": "0.1187904", "5": "0.03427949", "6": "0.23695225"}}
