{"text": "My husband absolutely loves this watch.  It has just what he wanted - time that can easily be read at a glance; day of the week and date of the month; and a comfortable fit.  Less than a year ago I had bought him a more expensive watch which was very attractive, but difficult to read and he constantly complained about it.  We both are very happy with this purchase and worth triple the price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.34754336", "2": "0.16664732", "3": "0.12699123", "4": "0.14832404", "5": "0.047504034", "6": "0.15864748"}}
