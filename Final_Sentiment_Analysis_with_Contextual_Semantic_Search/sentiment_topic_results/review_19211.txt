{"text": "Bought this for an early Mother's Day present for my mother who loves the large wallet clutch.  Loved the calculator and all the slots and compartments.  Thought there could have been more space where you could slide paper but it was sewn down.  Read previous reviews about the product not wearing well but we will wait and see.  What I did notice was a very strong odor of plastic or color dye.  Not sure what it is.  We are hoping the smell will dissipate soon.  Smell is the reason for 4 stars.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.105425276", "1": "0.15574038", "2": "0.20987074", "3": "0.21373524", "4": "0.13724494", "5": "0.10445604", "6": "0.07352734"}}
