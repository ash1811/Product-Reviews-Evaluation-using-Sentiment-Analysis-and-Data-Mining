{"text": "I love this watch. I got it for christmas and it quickly became my favorite watch. It is easy to read and is a good size, not too big (like the recent trend has been in watches for some reason), but still is 'big' enough to not look small. Really, my only complaint is the band - I really didn't like it. I picked up an 18mm leather band for about 12 bucks and it's 100 times better. Swapping out the band took about 5 minutes and no tools (with a little fanangling, I was able to pop the old bars out with my fingernails).Of course, if you are looking for a watch with a bunch of bells and whistles, this isn't for you. It is pretty basic - it just tells time and has the day and date. This is just what I wanted in a watch: simple, clean, easy to read, not too big. Plus, with the 'eco-drive' (solar power), you will never have to worry about batteries. This is definitely a quality time piece and I would highly recommend it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1175609", "1": "0.1952155", "2": "0.22762896", "3": "0.14431046", "5": "0.19211724", "6": "0.12072971"}}
