{"text": "At first, I laughed at all the insanely positive reviews over some socks.  Socks really don't excite me.  In fact, most clothes don't excite me.However, these socks are fantastic.  I got really sick of the traditional crappy \"dress sock\" that is all looks and made of about 1/1000th of an inch of material, providing 0 comfort and 0 warmth.So I bought these.  Wow!  I am not excited over a piece of clothing.  They are soft and thick, but they don't make your feet sweat.  I love them.  I wear them now all the time as long as I'm wearing long pants.  Perfect for jeans or dress pants.Ordered a 2nd 3pack, and I'll probably keep on ordering them.  The price is right!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10974248", "1": "0.24686348", "2": "0.13334712", "3": "0.1620736", "4": "0.07128084", "5": "0.18589807", "6": "0.09079447"}}
