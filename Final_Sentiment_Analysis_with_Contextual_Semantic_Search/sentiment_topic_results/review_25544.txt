{"text": "It was Father's day and I wanted to gift something special for my dad. Watches were always his favorite. He has a good collection of watches and I wanted to add one more to it. This time my choice was Tissot as this brand is not in his collection. This stainless steel Chronograph watch looked great on display and even better when I actually saw it for real. My dad was so impressed that he hugged and thanked me. I learnt the watch is both scratch and water resistant. An ideal gift for your loved ones.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.23778088", "1": "0.21090055", "2": "0.35532203", "3": "0.05738911", "4": "0.04653692", "6": "0.089145206"}}
