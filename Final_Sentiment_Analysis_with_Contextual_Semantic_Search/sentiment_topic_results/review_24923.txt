{"text": "Ive had achilles tendonitis for about a year and getting inserts was one of the things I learned I needed to help support my arch and heel.  Last year, I researched the Superfeet line an ended up getting the berry ones because I thought they were more tailored toward women.  After using them a few months I didnt feel like they were helping so I decided to try Sole inserts.  The Sole inserts you heat up in the oven and they are supposed to mold to the shape of your feet. I liked them at first but the more I wore them the problem I found is that they felt really bulky.  They made my running and workout sneakers tight and uncomfortable. I recently decided to give Superfeet a try again but get the highly rated Green Superfeet after seeing on their website that there actually is a different in the amount of support from Green to Berry. Now I wish I would have gotten Green a year ago.  These inserts have completely extinguished the achilles and heel pain I feel during a workout. I can't even believe it.  They are amazingly supportive but at the same time they do not make my sneakers tight and uncomfortable.  I already ordered a second pair and will probably put them in every shoe that allows for replaceable inserts.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03536317", "1": "0.24425638", "2": "0.14201312", "3": "0.14779054", "4": "0.14609197", "5": "0.21963523", "6": "0.06484956"}}
