{"text": "Buy the Pirate Sword and Pirate Pistol, and Brown Leatherette Tri-fold Pirate hat to complete the look.  You'll have a sweet costume.  Accessories make the costume.  Yes, the boot covers are floppy but it's a costume.  I safety pinned them in place to my pants based on other reviews to hold them in place.  It looked better with them than without.  If you've got boots, perfect.  The jacket (awesome), bandanna - hair (better than expected), and sash are worth it without the boot covers.  I cut out the top of an old undershirt to make a huge v-neck to wear under the pirate shirt for added warmth.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08221459", "1": "0.3524269", "2": "0.05924896", "3": "0.17841282", "4": "0.15040448", "5": "0.09249321", "6": "0.084799066"}}
