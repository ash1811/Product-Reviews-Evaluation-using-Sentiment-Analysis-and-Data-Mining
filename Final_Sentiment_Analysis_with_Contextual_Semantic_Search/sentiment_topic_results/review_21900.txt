{"text": "I received these as a birthday gift this year and thoroughly enjoy them.  Even though I have big toes they slipped on easily and fit snuggly and comfortably.  I love that they grip the mat during my yoga practice.  I do a lot of power yoga and find that if I am barefoot I tend to slip and have a hard time holding a pose.  These completely solved the problem.  I actually like them better than usingGaiam Thirsty Yoga Towel (Smokey Purple)over my mat.  I have not had any issues mentioned by other reviewers of them stretching out or losing their shape when I sweat.  They stay snug to the body and although they get damp, the 'grippies' on the bottom still do their job well.I also appreciate that these wash up beautifully in the washing machine.  I haven't had any problems with loose strings or pilling.  Overall these are a durable and useful product and I highly recommend them.  I just wish these were a little cheaper so I could buy more pairs!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16209729", "1": "0.20019333", "2": "0.21684109", "4": "0.12652998", "5": "0.22038017", "6": "0.07156183"}}
