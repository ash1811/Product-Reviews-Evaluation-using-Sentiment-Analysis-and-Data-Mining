{"text": "Have finally found a bra that:  lifts without pain in the shoulders; the sizing is accurate; is comfortable; and oh so pretty.  I've tried (and purchased four) of another Playtex bra (Playtex Women's 18-Hour Active Lifestyle)  - same size, but has little support.  To its credit, it is good for relaxing around the house or wearing to bed.  I really like Playtex bras, but like kissing some frogs to find the right one, you gotta do this with Playtex.  Oh, and the price is unbelievably low for such a quality undergarment.  I would have given this bra five stars if it lifted a bit more, but I'm very satisfied with it since I refuse to wear underwire.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07631512", "1": "0.33142087", "2": "0.0231382", "3": "0.35449275", "4": "0.11857052", "6": "0.09398758"}}
