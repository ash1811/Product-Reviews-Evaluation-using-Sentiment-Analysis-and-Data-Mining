{"text": "I like the fit (40C). It has held up very well (wash in mesh bag, never dry).Con1:Manufactures went to heat sealing (instead of sewing) the sides of the hook tapes which resulted in sharp edges in the back that actually abrade my skin and annoy me no end. Every bra I buy (even the $60 ones), I take an emery board to lightly sand the edges. No amount of washing helps.Con2:Straps elongate involuntarily - a big let down! Is it possible to fabricate bra strap elastic that is not shiny and will not slip down from its position in the clip? I used to have bras that had clips with edges that would grip the elastic. I have to resort to putting lumpy safety pins on my straps or live with old lady boobs.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17244047", "1": "0.19279934", "2": "0.10525148", "3": "0.0896345", "4": "0.13658668", "5": "0.09017866", "6": "0.21310885"}}
