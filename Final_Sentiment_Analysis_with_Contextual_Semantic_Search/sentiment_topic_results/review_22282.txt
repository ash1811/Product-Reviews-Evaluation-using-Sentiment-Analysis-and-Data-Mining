{"text": "I wear a size 7.5-8 and I own a few pairs of toesocks by this company in the different weight classes. I love ALL off them. The original weight are more thick and sturdier. I wear them with my tennis shoes when I have to do a lot walking. These socks offer GREAT support. I suffer from foot friction and inflamed arches. Traditional socks cause little room in shoes which is why I tend to go up half a size, when wearing these socks my feet fit perfectly in my shoes and I have the freedom to wiggle my toes. I also have no friction discoloration on my feet and the old discoloration is slowly starting to fade.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.030211294", "1": "0.22392827", "2": "0.13789183", "3": "0.2591995", "4": "0.12611815", "5": "0.16699359", "6": "0.05565735"}}
