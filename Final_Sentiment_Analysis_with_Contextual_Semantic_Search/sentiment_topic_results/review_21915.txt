{"text": "These toe socks are okay. I bought these over the Gaiam version because another reviewer said these stay put on your foot better. That may be true because I still haven't tried the Gaiam socks but I wasn't thrilled with the way these stayed on my foot. So I wouldn't give them an A+ on that count. But the big thing I dislike about these is the cut. They're ankle-cut - I wish they were lower than that. I probably will try the Gaiam version eventually because I think they are lower. In terms of staying on your foot, I think the best thing is probably the version with open toes. So if you go to a studio that allows them, that's probably your best bet.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.44130653", "2": "0.04020741", "3": "0.124915384", "4": "0.1840771", "5": "0.053068146", "6": "0.15387057"}}
