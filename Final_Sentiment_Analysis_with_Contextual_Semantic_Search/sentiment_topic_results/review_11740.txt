{"text": "I bought these after I saw the child's version on a friend's kids.  I bought the child size for my daughter, and this for me.  We love them!  This shoe is great for walking around, getting in the water, swimming, walking around after you've been in the water, and just about any other type of before/during/after water-related activity you can think of.  Initially I was surprised at how heavy they felt, but I quickly got used to it.  I think I am just used to swimming barefoot so any weight was noticeable.  After 10-15 minutes, I no longer even thought about having them on.  The traction is great, too, so I am less likely to slip walking around the pool.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09928724", "1": "0.08976669", "2": "0.14157501", "3": "0.14483035", "4": "0.024669081", "5": "0.29307887", "6": "0.20679279"}}
