{"text": "I bought this for myself and think it is just lovely. I get compliments all the time and find it to be the perfect size. Not too small so you can't tell what it is, but not too big that it looks gaudy or tacky. Very nice quality,  not too thin. I thought maybe it'd be so thin I'd accidentally bend it or break it, but no. It's perfect and I highly recommend it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.083974674", "1": "0.4452818", "2": "0.048184145", "3": "0.11442352", "4": "0.2613333", "6": "0.042713244"}}
