{"text": "I ordered an XS. I'm 5'5, 118lbs, 34&#34; bust and this fits pretty perfect. It isn't supposed to be fitted in the waist, so it is still loose just as a classic scrub should be, but the XS fits my shoulders perfectly. The pockets are deep which is handy. As for the material, it is typical Dickies fabric. It is quite stiff, and not soft like Grey's Anatomy, but in all honesty, that is what makes it so durable and long lasting (it gets softer with washes over time). Although I am not a fan of Dickies scrub pants (due to the shape), and traditionally they do size on the larger side - I still love this classic top, and it generally matches with all my other scrub pants.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06967719", "1": "0.34981036", "2": "0.26766443", "3": "0.1582415", "5": "0.08271802", "6": "0.06953909"}}
