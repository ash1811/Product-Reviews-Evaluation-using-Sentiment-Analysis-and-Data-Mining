{"text": "I wear black socks to work everyday but I wear casual type shoes so I don't like dress socks. These socks work great.  The elastic holds well, they are comfortable, and the grey part at the bottom is extra thick so it gives more cushion and is stronger to keep the socks from wearing out.  All in all, a great sock.  I'll buy more when, and if, these wear out.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.23352942", "2": "0.072979264", "3": "0.14475556", "4": "0.105815284", "5": "0.43593645"}}
