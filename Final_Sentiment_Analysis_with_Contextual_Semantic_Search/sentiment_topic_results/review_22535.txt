{"text": "I have an all purpose jewelry cleaner from my local jewelry store, and it just wasn't cutting it for some tarnished silver hoops and my Tiffany silver jewelry. This product had glowing reviews, and the price was right, so I thought I'd give it a go. WOW! Sparkling silver, all the tarnish is gone, and it was super easy. Dunk your silver for a few seconds, wash in wash water, and towel dry. No scrubbing with a toothbrush or annoying process. Give it a go!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10253065", "1": "0.2453004", "2": "0.074201", "3": "0.24139576", "4": "0.0292394", "5": "0.25120652", "6": "0.056126226"}}
