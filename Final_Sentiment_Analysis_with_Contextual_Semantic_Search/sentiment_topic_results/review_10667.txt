{"text": "I have hard feet to fit. I ordered these in my true size. The left boot fit well, but the right was too small. I sent them back, ordered another pair 1/2 size up. They are a bit too large, but with some gel inserts they will be just fine. The price on these boots is really great. I would suggest going 1/2 size up. They are a good looking pair of boots.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.077909745", "1": "0.3614899", "3": "0.30040705", "4": "0.14786261", "6": "0.105129376"}}
