{"text": "I know Dr. Scholl's sandals since I was a child and guess I had 10 - 15 pairs over the years. Lately, after a knee injury, I had troubles wearing sandals or flip-flops and thought I'd try these sandals again.I got a better price on Amazon than from the manufacturer's website, but I HATE this buckle! It took me numerous attempts to change the width and it does require quite some strength to push the pin up while pushing the buckle down at the same time.I wish Dr. Scholl's would have kept the original, easy closure (the ones that are used on regular men's belts). Otherwise, these sandals are wonderful and give your foot much more support than these unhealthy flip-flops. My knee says \"thank you\", my fingers are not too happy :)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.15956633", "2": "0.17309925", "3": "0.27416", "4": "0.22629818", "5": "0.032271776", "6": "0.13245519"}}
