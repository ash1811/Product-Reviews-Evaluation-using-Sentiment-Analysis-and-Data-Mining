{"text": "Let me say from the onset that I love Merrells and will never buy another type of running shoe. Its comfort is unmatched and I have over my seventy-two years, had a lot of running shoes ..... a lot! I admit to always purchasing an insole as I find the additional expense worth it - not as an indictment to the Merrell insole, but just as a matter of practice. I also evidently have a slightly larger left foot insofar as dress shoe and athletic shoe fit is concerned. Size 9 Merrell running shoes have always fit well for me in the past. But this time this Moab Ventilator 9M pair is tight. I simply in the future will go up to a 9 1/2 but please do not construe this to opine that all Merrells run tight.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.053484835", "1": "0.119838245", "2": "0.23220043", "3": "0.059387222", "4": "0.21464238", "5": "0.10823609", "6": "0.2122108"}}
