{"text": "I've owned one of these in black for a couple of years. It comes as close to perfect as I've ever found for carrying the bare essentials, something you can use as a wallet in a larger purse or carry on its own for quick trips to the store.Overall it's pretty good quality except for the fabric loops that the D-rings hook into for the strap clips. I noticed the stitching on one of the top ones was coming out, so I attempted to hand-stitch it back on. Didn't work - eventually the rest of the stitching failed and the bag hit the floor. I attached the clip to on of the d-rings on the back, but of course it doesn't hang right. I don't wear it as a waist bag.I wouldn't say I overloaded it - a few cards (bank, credit, ID, insurance) cell phone, a small note pad and mini pen, lip balm in the loop (which is too big for a pen, another small complaint), cash and a few coins.I'm going back and forth on purchasing another one. I love the design but for the money I'd like to be sure it's going to last longer than the first one did.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2894886", "2": "0.12204924", "3": "0.27219146", "4": "0.20290726", "5": "0.08552002", "6": "0.02541585"}}
