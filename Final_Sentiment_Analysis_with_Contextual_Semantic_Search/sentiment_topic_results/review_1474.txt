{"text": "This backpack works great and it does not hurt my back, the straps are comfortable, almost hug you in a good way. I am able to even fit my laptop with it's case in the smaller front compartment and it does not hurt my back with 3 binders included and sometimes even textbooks. It has plenty of storage space and I believe designed really well. Very happy with my purchase!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06742048", "1": "0.31096116", "2": "0.31799483", "3": "0.0508654", "4": "0.17568858", "6": "0.07319925"}}
