{"text": "I saw the fedex truck drive away and I rushed to the front door and saw the box...I felt the excitement I felt the first time I got a pair of these boots in 1968!  Ahhhh!  Yes these are made in Viet Nam, not England, and everything is made somewhere else now, but I still love these comfort shoes!  I forgot they are British sized, not American so mine are a little on the big side but that's ok with me as it's winter and thicker socks will take care of that.  At my age my feet have gotten a little bigger and roomy shoes are a good thing. If they bother me later there's room for a pair of inner soles and that will take up all the extra room.  Bottom line the feel and quality of Clarks originals Desert Boot are the same now as I remember them 50 years ago. Incredibly comfortable out of the box and long lasting as always. The thing about Clarks, weather Desert Boots, Wallabees, Desert Treks, in a short time they stop being your shoes and become your best friends.  Stay away from the Padmores as they are made differently and DO NOT feel the same and WILL NOT last at all.  ONLY GET ORIGINALS!!!  You won't be disappointed.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.05797465", "1": "0.242892", "2": "0.20336932", "3": "0.1959173", "4": "0.1268634", "5": "0.09152309", "6": "0.081460275"}}
