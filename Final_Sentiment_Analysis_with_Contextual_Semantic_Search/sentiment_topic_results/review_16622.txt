{"text": "Not much else to say about this watch really.  However, one plus that goes over looked is the fact that it has screw bars instead of spring bars.  This is a real plus in my opinion and makes this watch a real keeper.  It actually wears thinner and a tad smaller than the typical 6900s which is odd to me but I've never had one malfunction with it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03447881", "1": "0.1235142", "2": "0.37050125", "3": "0.25986904", "4": "0.08814896", "5": "0.054622978", "6": "0.068864785"}}
