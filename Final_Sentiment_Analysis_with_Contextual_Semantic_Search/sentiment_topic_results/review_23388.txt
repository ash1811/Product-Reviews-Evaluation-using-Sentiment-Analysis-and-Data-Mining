{"text": "These socks are the best.  I put them on and told my girlfriend how wonderful they are...she didn't believe me.  When she tried them on she hated having to admit that I was right.  They are not too bulky, they look nice, and the keep your feet dry and warm.  I wear these with any shoes when needed, but they are particularly handy when wearing my winter boots which have very little insulation.  I would highly recommend them for anyone looking for a nice, sturdy, comfortable wool blend sock.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.099687755", "1": "0.43994287", "2": "0.12191811", "3": "0.040397376", "4": "0.10468694", "5": "0.15113524", "6": "0.042231683"}}
