{"text": "I wanted to review this product simply to pass on a tip - it works great for pumping.  The crossover style allows you to use the elastic on bra part to hold the pumps to your breasts.  You can't walk around the house like this or anything, but you can type, read, or hold your baby (if they are not kicking you).  I would wear a more supportive nursing bra (for better support and coverage).  I would take down the more supportive bra and then use this one to hold on the pump parts.  I did not give it 5 stars because they started to fall apart pretty quickly and required mending.  If they held up better, I would have given it 5 stars.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07924534", "1": "0.1838053", "2": "0.16865453", "3": "0.37330878", "5": "0.12576957", "6": "0.0669675"}}
