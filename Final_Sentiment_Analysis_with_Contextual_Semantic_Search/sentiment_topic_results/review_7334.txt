{"text": "I ordered the wrong size the first time and returned them and was issued a refund. But I liked the way they looked with all the pockets and reinforced panels on the knees and ordered the right size. These are the sort of pants that will look better with each washing and wearing.When I am not wearing shorts here in Houston it's jeans 99% of the time and I liked the idea of something different. And these are nice but still very casual like jeans. They go good with my hiking boots, and Chuck Taylor Hi-Tops too. So if you want something different than the same jeans every day I think you would like these, too.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.20825341", "1": "0.2420485", "2": "0.0729015", "3": "0.09176021", "4": "0.08368807", "5": "0.074330084", "6": "0.22701824"}}
