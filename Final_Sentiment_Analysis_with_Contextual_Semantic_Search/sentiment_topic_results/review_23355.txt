{"text": "This sandal is so pretty. The color is a perfect neutral taupe. Not muddy taupe, but luminous taupe.I like that the sandal covers most of my foot. I wear a size 11 and these sandals looks great on my feet.I have plentyof room in the front. Do not go up a size. There are adjustable straps on top as well as the back. i have calluses on the bottom of my feet, so the rubber insole is a little hard. I have that problem in all the shoes i buy though.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.073457964", "1": "0.3743496", "2": "0.15027241", "3": "0.20389038", "4": "0.15924577", "5": "0.035452824"}}
