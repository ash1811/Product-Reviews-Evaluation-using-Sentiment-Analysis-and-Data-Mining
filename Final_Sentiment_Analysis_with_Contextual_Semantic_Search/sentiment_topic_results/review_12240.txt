{"text": "I was very disappointed as I absolutely adored my old dearfoams-wore them literally until they fell apart (about 4yrs), these are ok but dont match up at all, they got cheaper over the yrs-not BETTER. They're no where near as comfy as my 1st pair. Not sure I'll buy dearfoams again unless they go back to whatever they were doing before.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06102036", "1": "0.24253152", "2": "0.20053025", "3": "0.16282861", "5": "0.15615837", "6": "0.17257339"}}
