{"text": "I bought this watch to take on vacation to have an affordable watch for the beach. I got this for not only a great price, but the design really looks great on my wife's wrist. She tends to like to have a watch to keep track of time rather than carrying her phone around the beach. The watch has stood up great to sand and being tossed around in her bag.Great quality, I highly recommend this watch for anyone looking for a tropical beach style watch and requires the underwater feature.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1821597", "1": "0.32031408", "2": "0.26279154", "4": "0.0798559", "5": "0.14888747"}}
