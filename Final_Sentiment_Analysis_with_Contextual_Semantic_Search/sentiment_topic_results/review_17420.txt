{"text": "These are nicely cushioned, although not as cushioned as one Champion sport sock that seems to be unavailable now. Still, a good all around sock for cooler weather, using as quasi-slippers around the house, and with shoes that are not already a border-line tight fit. I'd guess the cushioning is possibly 5-6 times what you get in so called cushioned dress socks - but these could pass in their place. It's a reasonable price for a good product.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.050478622", "1": "0.31135812", "2": "0.08067309", "3": "0.18583757", "4": "0.09757878", "5": "0.27089077"}}
