{"text": "I'm 6'0\" and 210 pounds, and I ordered an XL like I do with everything else.  I know they make these on the large side to accommodate the extra clothing you might wear underneath, but this thing was huge.  Even wearing a t-shirt, a sweatshirt, and a jacket underneath, I felt I was wearing a tent.I sent back my XL and ordered a Large.  I also switched from the yellow color to the green.  I was originally thinking of also bicycling in the coat, but the bulkiness of it made that impractical, so I went with a color that wouldn't stand out so much watching a sporting event in the rain.The large fits me perfectly, with or without layers underneath it.  It's not a long coat, which means you should look into getting the matching pants:Carhartt Mens Lightweight Pvc Rain Bib.  And this jacket is on the heavy side, which is good for the cold, but you might also want to check out their lightweight version of the coat, sans pockets:Carhartt Mens Lightweight Pvc Rain Coat.I also like the way it looks, as I would feel comfortable wearing this anywhere.The hood is detachable, there are buttons instead of a zipper in the front, the three pockets are Velcro, and there is a liner of sorts on the wrist that prevents water from going up your arm.Overall, for $40, this is one of the best deals out there, once you get the correct size.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20132948", "1": "0.3481109", "2": "0.13400789", "3": "0.11407884", "4": "0.094294064", "6": "0.10590531"}}
