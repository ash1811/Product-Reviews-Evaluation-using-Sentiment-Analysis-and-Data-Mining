{"text": "My husband wanted denim trousers that could also be used for dressier occasions.  Previously, I purchased Dockers version of a dress denim, but was unable to locate it once again.  I saw this particular type of pant at Amazon and with my husband's permission, ordered the Haggar Men's Cool 18 Heather Gabardine Plain Front Pant.  The pants look really good on him and are a nice alternative to your typical denim jeans.  They also are literally wash and wear, which I particularly like.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18414253", "1": "0.45566285", "2": "0.07824304", "4": "0.22313486", "5": "0.053201474"}}
