{"text": "The Superbreak backpack has been my daily companion for the past 2.5 years. It's been through 5 full-time-college semesters, always handling extremely heavy bookloads (think lots of hardcover science, math and english texts) very well.  It's a great fit for someone of small-medium stature ( 5'2\" thin-to-average female).  I've just ordered another one, only because I like my current Superbreak so much that I don't want it to begin to fade or tear---that's right, it hasn't even begun to fade, or wear, or tear, after 5 semesters of heavy daily use! This is a freakin' awesome backpack.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12715712", "1": "0.3829533", "2": "0.20601963", "3": "0.04704646", "4": "0.026093628", "5": "0.058717187", "6": "0.15201266"}}
