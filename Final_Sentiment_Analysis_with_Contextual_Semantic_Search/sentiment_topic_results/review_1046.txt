{"text": "I recently had the displeasure of returning three separate pairs of these, due to poor craftsmanship. The first pair I received, the left boot was about 1/2\" longer. The second pair had a big glob of adhesive all over the suede, which was clearly from someone doing a lazy job of adhering the sole to the upper. The third pair? Same thing, but this time, there was also a nice blob of glue up towards the top of the boot, from someone clearly having stuff on their hands/gloves. If I'm ordering new shoes, and paying close to one hundred and sixty clams for them, they should be just that: new. As usual, Amazon was first-class as far as handing the reships and returns. I used to be a huge fan of Clarks, but after this? I really can't see supporting a company that really doesn't care about the true matter at hand: quality.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.27612674", "2": "0.19250824", "3": "0.31045985", "4": "0.14095068", "5": "0.042001404", "6": "0.035714544"}}
