{"text": "My husband likes this slipper, says it is warm and very comfortable.  That's all I ask.  They were worth it.  They seem to be well made with quality materials and won't fall apart any time soon.UPDATE 11/29/13: nearly one year later; hubby is still wearing his slippers.  He is very hard on slippers and most don't last very long, but these slippers still look nearly new except for some soiling. Its a miracle. I would buy these Acorn Polar slippers again in heartbeat.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.089487515", "1": "0.34412032", "3": "0.106501296", "4": "0.0797441", "5": "0.0913822", "6": "0.28571692"}}
