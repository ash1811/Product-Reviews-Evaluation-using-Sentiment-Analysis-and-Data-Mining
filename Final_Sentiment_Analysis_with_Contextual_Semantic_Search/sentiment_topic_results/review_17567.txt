{"text": "I've had a few F91W series watches, and they've all been reliable.  They're so inexpensive, and run so long on the original batteries, they're pretty much disposable.  I don't wear a watch on my wrist, but strap them to my backpack.  Just to try it out, though, I put my new F91W-1 watch on my wrist...  Or, rather, I ~tried~ to put it onto my wrist, but it didn't fit.  I'm not Lou Ferigno or The Big Show, and I could barely touch the tip of the strap to the very tip of the buckle.  I compared it to my older F91W, and it too had a small strap.  A no-name watch from Hong Kong with another \"standard men's strap\" was a good centimeter longer.  It's not a problem for me, since I don't plan on wearing it, but it's something to keep in mind when purchasing this watch.  As a timepiece, the F91W-1 still great.  Accurate, rugged, water resistant, inexpensive and very plain looking.  I'll trust my life to it as a timepiece, but apparently I won't be wearing it unless I buy a new strap.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15845272", "1": "0.14386046", "2": "0.21855514", "3": "0.12832834", "4": "0.09970488", "5": "0.21458566", "6": "0.036512792"}}
