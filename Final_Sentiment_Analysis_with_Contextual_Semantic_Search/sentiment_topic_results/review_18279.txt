{"text": "I've had the same version of this watch for over 5 years and I cannot get tired of it. It is light and comfortable and still has all the useful features.  I work as a researcher in a science lab and I got rid of my timer for most experiments.  I also use it as an alarm every morning without waking up my husband with a heart attack.  I love this watch and I would hope that you can change the battery when it dies. But as long as they keep making the watch, I guess it's ok that the battery is not replaceable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04586798", "1": "0.34727415", "2": "0.1986106", "3": "0.14517199", "4": "0.1575273", "5": "0.042086106", "6": "0.06346187"}}
