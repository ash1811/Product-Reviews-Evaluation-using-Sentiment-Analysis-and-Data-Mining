{"text": "Very good quality pants.  Well made, well lined and high quality material.  Definitely worth the extra few bucks over the Signature Khaki series.  I have used these pants for office wear since 2006 and plan to continue doing so.  The 2012 D3 fit is more comfortable than the 2011 D3 fit.  I shop Amazon, Dockers and Department stores online.  On Amazon I found a color called 'After Dark' that is not available on the Dockers site or on any Department Store site.  It is a beautiful sleek dark grey/dark charcoal.  I highly recommend these pants.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.028546013", "1": "0.37683412", "2": "0.1157221", "3": "0.0631949", "4": "0.25615197", "5": "0.10628706", "6": "0.05326385"}}
