{"text": "First let me say that this is a very pretty pink shoe.  I just adore the color pink. The problem for me is that the cushioning is very thick.  So much so that it fit too tight on my feet.  Rather than stretch them out or try to deflate the cushioning, I've decided to give them away to my sister.  She wears a size 8 and they will fit her perfectly.  These are very pretty very lady like.  They remind me of the slippers you see the starlets wearing in the 1930's MGM movies.  But you should order a larger size, esp if you foot is tends to be wide.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1567774", "1": "0.31582433", "2": "0.0882994", "3": "0.11170717", "4": "0.15166748", "6": "0.17284544"}}
