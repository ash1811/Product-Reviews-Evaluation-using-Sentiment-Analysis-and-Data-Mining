{"text": "Beautiful deep navy blue with white piping and buttons. A classic pajama set. Size is precise. My only complaint is the top is cut straight from armhole to hem, no flair, no extra room. If you have a tummy :) get the next largest size. Large seems to be made for height of approx. 5'8\", so consider going up a size or to a tall, if you need longer bottoms. All in all, a typically exceptional Izod product from a trustworthy Flordia retailer. Very satisfied!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.062933564", "1": "0.2342773", "2": "0.10922893", "3": "0.18526188", "4": "0.038243007", "5": "0.16107689", "6": "0.20897844"}}
