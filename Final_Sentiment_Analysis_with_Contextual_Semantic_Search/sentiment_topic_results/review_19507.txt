{"text": "I really did like these, but they turned out to be not exactly what I am looking for. If they came up higher in the back (basically if they weren't a clog) it would be more what I am looking for - have a specific intent, not a just because type purchase. If I had the money to keep them I would've and just bought something else too. I only wore them around the house to check fit and comfort - I found them to be comfortable and fit perfect (I'm a solid size 6, ordered a size 6) for the short time I had them on. I love the fuzz and the smooth suede (or suede-like) material. Again, wish I didn't have to return them. May repurchase in the future.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15903434", "1": "0.40548533", "2": "0.047382686", "4": "0.11439971", "5": "0.059468146", "6": "0.21162052"}}
