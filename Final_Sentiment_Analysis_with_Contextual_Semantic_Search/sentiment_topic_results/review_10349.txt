{"text": "Ugh. I bought this and boy was that a mistake on my part. I was pregnant and needed a strapless bra for a wedding I was in. The bra was my size but did not fit as it should have. It was to tight. I could wear it but it was so tight I was relieved to be out of it at the end of the night. If I had to buy it again I would buy a bigger size because it runs small!! The convertible aspect of it was nice though for sure. If not for the size issue it would have been a great bra. But it did hold my breast in place, so that's a plus I suppose.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.269821", "2": "0.09132685", "3": "0.43774045", "5": "0.19153243"}}
