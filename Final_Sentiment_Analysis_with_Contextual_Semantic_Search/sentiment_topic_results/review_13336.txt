{"text": "I wish I had the camera out when our little girl first saw her Backpack. Her face lit up. She was so excited. She also loved 'Map'. Our girl is a small 1yr 9months, so the straps are a little big. Aside from it being a little too big on her back, Backpack keeps our girl entertained. She really likes putting things into it. I'd highly recommend this for every little Dora fan.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1199912", "1": "0.22786175", "2": "0.38483864", "3": "0.04032917", "4": "0.10818759", "5": "0.083573475", "6": "0.03521813"}}
