{"text": "I was initially happy when the shoes arrived. they looked great and had a nice shine to them. they have been very comfortable shoes. I bought these shoes in march of 2013. It is now late June 2013 and while they are still very comfortable, where the crease occurs across the toe from walking, has split and is revealing the man- made materials that are mere millimeters under the paper- thin bonded leather. I was very disappointed, as they have been easy to keep shined and looking good. Kenneth Cole shoes have always suffered long wear issues in the heels and soles, as they are glued and all man- made materials. Sadly, to get a high quality shoe, you really have to pay hundreds and get an Allan Edmunds. which are well- worth the cost, can be resoled as they are true leather soles, and heels, as well as being made of a very high quality of leather and workmanship. It is really a shame that most of the quality shoe brands have been bought out and are made in China at very low standards.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.053854015", "1": "0.30451617", "2": "0.16996695", "3": "0.15290107", "5": "0.19831476", "6": "0.118164785"}}
