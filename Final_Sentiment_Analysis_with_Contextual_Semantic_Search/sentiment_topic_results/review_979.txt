{"text": "A friend of mine has a pair of Clarks boots, different style. He wears them when we travel and the soles look really padded and comfortable. I like this style and wanted a black pair. I have a brown pair made by a cheaper brand (that are actually pretty comfortable, but I've had to glue parts of the shoe back together). These are comfortable, the sole is soft. I haven't worn them on a long day so I can't speak of how comfortable they are when you wear them all day. My only complaint is that the leather in the back that rubs the ankle is pretty stiff. I'm hoping that once I break them in more this problem will be alleviated. I like the look and style, good quality suede.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.038622048", "1": "0.42366216", "2": "0.05360276", "3": "0.23646775", "4": "0.08988381", "5": "0.097966336", "6": "0.05979515"}}
