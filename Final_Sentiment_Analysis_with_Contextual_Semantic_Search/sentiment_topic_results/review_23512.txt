{"text": "Good watch. Fit and finish were very nice. I use it when i go out on occasion. It is similar size, shape to the Rolex with out the price. The blue color of the face is closer to purple in color but it is a nice watch.  I have had it for a few months and wear it about 1 time a week. It has seen some beach duty aswell with no issues. Good buy for the price and to see if you are comfortable with the watch before you buy the more expensive sibling.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03920282", "1": "0.51262647", "2": "0.19059065", "3": "0.06893085", "4": "0.14745252", "6": "0.03768825"}}
