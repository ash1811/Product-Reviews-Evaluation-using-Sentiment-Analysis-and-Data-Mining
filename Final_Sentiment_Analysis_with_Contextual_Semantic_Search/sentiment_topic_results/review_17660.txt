{"text": "I had the F-91W for a few weeks before I decided to try this watch out. I picked it as a &#34;fancier&#34; alternative to the plastic straps that the F-91W had. I was excited to see the shiny polish and clear display but was left a little disappointed in the material that they chose to use for the band. I know, its a sub 15 dollar watch. But I wouldnt count on this watch surviving a tight pocket carry or being at the bottom of my gym bag. I still think its a little better looking than the F-91W due to the nice polish of the enclosure. But wish it had a little more durability.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.118237756", "1": "0.20527731", "2": "0.18281347", "3": "0.15118474", "4": "0.17727427", "5": "0.05261403", "6": "0.11259846"}}
