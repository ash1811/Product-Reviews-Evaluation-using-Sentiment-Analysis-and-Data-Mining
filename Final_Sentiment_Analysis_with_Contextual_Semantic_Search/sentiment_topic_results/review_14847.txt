{"text": "I have tried all types of jeans throughout my years but always go back to 501's. I like the fit, the button fly can't break like a zipper and they have a classic look. One of the things that is different from the ones I wore 30 years ago is all of the colors available now and what seems to me like different types of cotton for each color. Some seem more like a woven cotton and some like a knit. And the more like a knit that they are the more they stretch out when you wear them. You can wash and dry them and they fit fine but after an hour of wear, (sit down stand up bend and kneel) the butt is all baggy and stretched out and the legs as well but I guess this is the case with most jeans. When you wear a belt with them, the belt seems to ride up and cause a weird situation where it is above the waistline of the jeans and into your boxers. This is made worse with thin belts. I think a couple of more belt loops would help with this.. I never liked the big brown &#34;leather?&#34; size tag on the back either. It always looked like something that should be ripped off after purchase but of course it is not meant to be and is stitched on tight. I can live with that and as for the stretching out, I will by a size smaller next time.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.3128775", "2": "0.15810439", "3": "0.14929788", "4": "0.116838865", "5": "0.05899248", "6": "0.20132795"}}
