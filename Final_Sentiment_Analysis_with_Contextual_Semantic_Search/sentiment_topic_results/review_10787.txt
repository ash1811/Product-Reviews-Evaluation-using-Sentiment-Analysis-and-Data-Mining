{"text": "I have wanted a slim bi-fold wallet instead of my tri-fold wallet that I had for years.  I did a lot of research and finally came across this wallet on Amazon that was cheaper than most any other wallet of similar quality, size and style.  This wallet is excellent.  It has a soft but sturdy feel.  Meaning that the leather is soft but it's not so soft that it feels like it will rip easily and feels like it will last for many years to come.  I like how many slots this wallet has to place cards.  It is just the right size, slightly larger than a bill.I do want to mention that the ID flap is sewn in as part of the wallet, as some other reviewers have mentioned.  This is a great wallet that I would recommend to anyone looking for a bi-fold wallet with enough space for cards for most people.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06433625", "1": "0.30059326", "2": "0.2115214", "4": "0.16456285", "5": "0.034958124", "6": "0.2215104"}}
