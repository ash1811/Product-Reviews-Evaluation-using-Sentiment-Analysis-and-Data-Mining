{"text": "I  bought this watch to wear at work. It's stylish and I wanted a band that wasn't plastic, cloth, or leather. I work in the medical field MRI department. We can only wear digital watches because of the magnetic field. My disappointment was that the metal band pulls in the magnetic field so I can't wear it . The band itself tends to not to clasp/lock in well and it falls off my waist. I might try to find a different watchband that is flexible ( metal-elastic type.)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10334405", "1": "0.20755719", "2": "0.28358445", "4": "0.24080794", "5": "0.060906798", "6": "0.100461006"}}
