{"text": "I like the Baggalini brand in general.  I bought this in the chocolate brown for an upcoming trip in an attempt to find a cross between a purse and a backpack.  I do like the idea of the split zipper straps, which worked well and were a good length, although a tad bit stiff.  I'm sure they would soften up.  I also liked the top strap where you can carry it by the handle - very soft and easy to carry that way, seemed very naturalThe problem is it was waaay too small for what intended it for.  I tried to put my compact camera, a pullover top, my wallet, and some sunglasses in and that was stretching it's capabilities.  I think this is more of a purse than a travel piece.  Nicely made though and the brown was a beautiful color.Oh, one other thing that was kind of awkward is that the zippers unzip all the way down on the sides which is nice as you can get to everything a little easier.  The thing I didn't like is that you had to actually hold one corner of the bag at the bottom to get the zipper to go up with out catching.  I kind of wished the bag was a little more stiff on the sides so that you could pull the zipper up with just one hand.  Small thing, but it annoyed me.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.078967944", "1": "0.09790098", "2": "0.25062272", "3": "0.20549294", "4": "0.18023303", "6": "0.1843866"}}
