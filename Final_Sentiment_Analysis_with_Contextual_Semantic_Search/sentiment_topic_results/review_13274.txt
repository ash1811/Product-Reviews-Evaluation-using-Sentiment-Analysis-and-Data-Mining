{"text": "My husband bought these shoes for an upcoming trip, but we're having to return them.He has somewhat large feet at a size 11.5, and usually wears a Wide. These shoes in an 11.5 fit fine and they were not narrow on him at all, but they bothered the inside of his feet near the ankles, like something was rubbing uncomfortably against them. He also says that they're a lot heavier than he's used to on his feet.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.20782791", "2": "0.18932213", "3": "0.06779555", "4": "0.30232918", "5": "0.07387234", "6": "0.15535887"}}
