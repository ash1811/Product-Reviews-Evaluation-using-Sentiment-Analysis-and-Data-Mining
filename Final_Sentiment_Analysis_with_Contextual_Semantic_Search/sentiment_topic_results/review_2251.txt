{"text": "The footbed and insole were noticeably uneven, as you can feel that the heel padding was very pronounced under the foot. The insole is very thin under the ball of the foot without any padding there at all.The heel seems to be way too high, these shoes had a very noticeable 1.5 inches of heel height. As I am 6 foot tall, I don't need any heel lift, I think this may have been a mislabeled production run of the platform shoes version. Actually made me feel self conscious about the extra height since it was so obvious.The sizes are a full size too large, I will try re-ordering a 10.5 and I wear a 11.5 normally. These shoes are also kinda heavy.i put some different insoles from a pair of skate shoes and the ball of the foot felt much better, and the footbed felt more level as if the heel height wasn't so pronounced. For an expensive shoe like this, I shouldn't have to replace the insole to achieve proper cushioning or to make the shoe feel better.The tongue has very little padding and should be 1/2 inch longer. I do like the quality construction and materials and the subtle \"formal skate shoe\" looks though. Would prefer if they changed the D rings to actual eyelets instead, as i like to keep my laces loose, and D rings kinda look cheesy, hopefully my pants will cover them up though.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11567124", "1": "0.14685187", "2": "0.12916967", "3": "0.27611524", "4": "0.12502812", "5": "0.08772408", "6": "0.11943976"}}
