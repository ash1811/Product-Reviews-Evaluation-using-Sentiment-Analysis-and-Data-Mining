{"text": "I purchased this and had it sent to my daughter - way over yonder on the eastern part of our USA.  I'm on the western side.  Anyhoo.......my daughter sent me a list of flip flops she liked and I chose this pair.  I did suggest we get her a size 9 but my daughter insisted an 8 would be perfect.  They barely fit and she'll make due since I'm not getting another pair and she's not sending this pair back.My suggestion is this: order a full size up.  Not rocket science.......My daughter does love them and they are very well made and pretty.  I personally had the same size-up issue with a pair of Crocs (flip-flops) and I ordered a full size up as it was......", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15485638", "1": "0.2504895", "2": "0.12691242", "3": "0.19758816", "5": "0.15031749", "6": "0.117559634"}}
