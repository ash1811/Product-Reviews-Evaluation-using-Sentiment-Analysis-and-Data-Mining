{"text": "Faded Glory Jeans fit me better. It's difficult to find these in the 33 x 33 which is what I wear. This is a great experience I've had buying jeans of ebay. They are in great condition and easier to find on there than in stores. I would like to find darker ones and find ones that fit even better than Faded Glory. The FG fit much better most noticeably in the seat. see my video where i tell more and what I do to prep new jeans before i wear them and b4 and after each wash at youtube b29349 jeans.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.051397216", "1": "0.20576891", "2": "0.20426284", "3": "0.07170355", "4": "0.10309949", "5": "0.25064364", "6": "0.11312433"}}
