{"text": "I work in an office, have to wear a suit a couple days a week, and the rest of the time I am business casual.  These shoes, which I have in black and brown, work perfectly in this environment.  These are not $500 Italian leather shoes, but I don't need shoes like that.  These are leather shoes, extremely comfortable, with rubber soles for grip.  They look fine with a suit, wool dress pants, or pressed khakis.  (I myself do not wear them with jeans.)  They have the added benefit of being waterproof.  In particular, every morning I walk across my front lawn to my car.  The grass is always wet from dew and my shoes normally get wet.  After wearing these shoes, I quickly noticed that my shoes and socks weren't wet when I got in my car to drive to work.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0904863", "1": "0.28897268", "2": "0.2538233", "3": "0.102459215", "4": "0.12621395", "5": "0.10211818", "6": "0.035926405"}}
