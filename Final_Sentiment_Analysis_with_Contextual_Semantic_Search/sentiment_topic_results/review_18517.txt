{"text": "Rockport Ellingwood has proven to be the ideal replacement for a prior Rockport shoe that had all of the same details but a slightly more rounded toe.  The Ellingwood's squarer toe is an attractive update.  The size runs true, the leather is smooth, and the comfort continues to make Rockport first choice.  This shoe looks good with suits and feels great.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.27199516", "2": "0.19711946", "3": "0.048308935", "4": "0.1063033", "5": "0.23862621", "6": "0.13354729"}}
