{"text": "Surprisingly these look finely crafted.  Except the nubs are a bit cheap, similar to eraser heads.  The insole is leather so it can be a bit slippery with socks.  I wear 7 most of the time and can fit into many 6.5 shoes so I ordered 6.5 because of the many reviews which said that they ran big.  Well, they are too small for me.  Don't know why ordering a size down didn't work for me, maybe I got the one pair that was true to size.  The leather is also hard, maybe if it were softer I wouldn't mind.  Blisterland, I'm in.  Too late to return now that they're worn.  I still adore them though.  Will purchase again in true size...", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.103769705", "1": "0.21105103", "2": "0.1327532", "3": "0.15543586", "4": "0.122627944", "5": "0.18602243", "6": "0.08833985"}}
