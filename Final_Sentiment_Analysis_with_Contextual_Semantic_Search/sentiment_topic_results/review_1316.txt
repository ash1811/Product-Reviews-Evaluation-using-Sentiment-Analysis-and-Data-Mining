{"text": "OMG.  These are so comfortable.  Great for hiking, walking, and soon will test out at festival-going!  They do not seem to need ANY break-in.  Nice wide toe box.  As all the reviews state, go up by half size.  I wear a 9 and got a 9.5.  I have a little extra room at both front and back but the extra room allows for foot swelling. I may have been able to get by with a 9, but I'm very happy.Yay for upcoming Bonnaroo 2014!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06595357", "1": "0.29776865", "2": "0.05611448", "3": "0.12317597", "4": "0.15074117", "5": "0.16376837", "6": "0.14247777"}}
