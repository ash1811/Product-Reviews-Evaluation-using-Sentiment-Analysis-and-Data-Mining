{"text": "I really like this product. It's smooth and seamless under my clothing. And its long enough to fit from under my breasts to my lower stomach. The boning is flexible enough that I can sit and even eat comfortably. I'm definitely going to buy another one. However, it does run small. So don't go by your clothing size, go by your waist size. I'm 5'9\", 180 lbs, all of my weight is on my belly. I wear a size 14 - 16 pant to accomodate my waist (otherwise I would wear a 10). I bought a XXL and it fits perfectly. My pants are now looser at the waist.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.27740082", "2": "0.13737239", "3": "0.2147176", "4": "0.0688304", "5": "0.14408626", "6": "0.15515202"}}
