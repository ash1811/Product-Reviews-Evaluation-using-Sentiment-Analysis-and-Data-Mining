{"text": "I originally bought these socks for hiking, however I found them too hot for summer hiking in California - my feet got all sweaty.  Well, come winter & a trip to Colorado for skiing and I was so glad to have them.  I wore these socks w/ hiking shoes walking around in temps below zero and my feet were comfortable as could be.  While others in my group were starting to complain about cold feet I was just fine.These socks have a lot of cushion on the bottom, too much to be comfortable with my regular sneakers.  The fit was true to size, and these are my go to for cold weather now.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1512441", "1": "0.2559287", "2": "0.09614528", "3": "0.13536252", "5": "0.35628602"}}
