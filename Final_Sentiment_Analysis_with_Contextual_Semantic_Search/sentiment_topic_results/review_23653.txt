{"text": "Due to a very bad haircut, I have been wearing hats in public for about 2 months and was tired of my black one. I ordered this after looking in tons of stores, and I could not be happier. It looks great on, fits my small head and is comfortable. I will be ordering more in other colors. I will wear them on \"bad hair days\" after my hair grows out. This style is a godsend for me.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.044812124", "1": "0.5199056", "2": "0.10595082", "3": "0.062398214", "5": "0.21390326", "6": "0.049156018"}}
