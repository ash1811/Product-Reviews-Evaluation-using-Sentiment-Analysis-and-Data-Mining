{"text": "A money belt is really a necessity for travelers.  This one wore OK on me and I really like the separate zipper sections.  However, the plastic inside is both necessary and annoying.  It was hard to deal with getting cash, etc. out of and the plastic would fold at the most inopportune times.  You need the plastic inside it, however because the fabric is so thin that you end up sweating right through into it so that's the only thing protecting the cash from getting really messy.Long story short, you MUST have one of these for foreign travel but if you are going on more than one trip every few years, invest in a better one.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13353662", "1": "0.10436039", "2": "0.24321838", "3": "0.22337772", "4": "0.1727652", "5": "0.089712575", "6": "0.033029135"}}
