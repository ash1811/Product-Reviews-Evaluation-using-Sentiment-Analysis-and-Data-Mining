{"text": "This is a good quality garment. But the sizes are off. I wear an X-large in most of my clothes. I ordered an XX large of this slimmer and found it is toooo small. It cuts into my thighs and is very difficult to get on and off. It is very tight but I find it does not roll down so that is a plus. It also has an open crotch so you don't have to pull it down to go potty (#1). Many other slimmers have this also but they are NOT usable. This one is actually a good size opening and I had no trouble using it to use the bathroom. You would have to be willing to either wear panties over it or go with what feels like crotchless panties. If it was the proper size I would definitely recommend it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09407205", "1": "0.1643799", "2": "0.18771856", "3": "0.27999488", "4": "0.13887538", "5": "0.051923607", "6": "0.083035685"}}
