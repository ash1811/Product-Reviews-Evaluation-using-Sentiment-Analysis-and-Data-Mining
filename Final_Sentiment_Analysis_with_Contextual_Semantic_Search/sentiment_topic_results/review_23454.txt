{"text": "A lot of quality for little money.I have had this model for over two years now and it looks and runs very well. It's not a Omega, Rolex, or Tag Heuer, but it fills the bill of a having a  decent &#34;Homage&#34; watch.Accuracy isn't anything to write home about, mines 25 seconds slow in 24 hours.Have had no problems with the water proofing, have taken in the pool many times.Bottom line is, it's a dependable, inexpensive, nice looking watch. At the price point, if you lose it, break it, it is no big deal, it is a quality &#34;Throw Away&#34;, just buy another one!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.046648048", "1": "0.23995072", "2": "0.29363158", "3": "0.21600094", "4": "0.077565126", "5": "0.056506548", "6": "0.06969703"}}
