{"text": "Bought them, had no break in time, wore them on trip walked miles in them and nothing happened. Amazed. No sores, no terrible aching feet. I read the reviews before I bought them and I thought well if they are half as good as people say they are then I'll be fine after first few days. They are better than most reviews say they are. It was as if I had owned them for years and was just pulling on an old well loved pair of boots. I will definitely be buying a pair for my daughter who is a stylist in a salon and on her feet all day.
