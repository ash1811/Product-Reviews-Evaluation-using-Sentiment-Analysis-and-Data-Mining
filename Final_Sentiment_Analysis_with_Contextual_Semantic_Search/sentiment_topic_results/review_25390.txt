{"text": "This bag is a shockingly good surprise. It is very well made for the bargain price. This bag is made of heavy reinforced nylon, and lined literally everywhere. And pockets, lots of pockets, also everywhere.First of all, the bag is a burgundy red, not a cherry red, thank goodness, although the lining is a red red. The top with the zipper and the straps are black.The straps are adjustable to the point that they can be adjusted to carry the bag on your shoulder under your arm. I have my own cross body strap in black which I have attached to the bag, and it works great.I wanted a bag big enough to carry papers to the courthouse to file. This bag fills the bill. On the back there is a pocket big enough to hold a letter size file folder with papers. On each end, there is a tall thin pocket which might hold a water bottle if it is not too big around. The front flap pocket has a kind of built in wallet and coin purse with pen and credit card holders.Inside the main bag, there is a large zippered pocket and a funny little hanging pocket that I suspect is a cell phone pocket.There is a lot of bag here for the money and I am very happy that I ordered it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.18082774", "1": "0.2530035", "2": "0.23136275", "3": "0.02912778", "4": "0.13393508", "5": "0.08517865", "6": "0.08656448"}}
