{"text": "I want to say that this is NOT a poor quality watch. I don't get all the complaints of poor quality with Invicta watches. I have several of them and haven't had the least problem with any of them. This watch is only $64 and while it certainly isn't on the level of a Tag or Rolex it is far above the quality of anything else out there in this price range. My only complaint about this watch is the size of the face. While I don't like the 'Mega face' trend watch makers are tending towards these days, this one is goes a little too far in the other direction. In fact when I opened the box I have to say I was a little shocked and thought I had ordered a women's watch by mistake. But if you can live with that this is a really great looking and well made watch for well under $100.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.079996385", "1": "0.22226124", "2": "0.3322332", "3": "0.062328", "4": "0.09755294", "5": "0.16507362", "6": "0.040554646"}}
