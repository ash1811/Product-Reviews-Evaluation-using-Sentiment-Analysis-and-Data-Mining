{"text": "I liked the support of this bra when I first wore it.  The girls were lifted nicely (34F) and I didn't feel giggly.  The multiple clasps in the back were a bit of a worry at first, but it went on pretty easy.  This is not an attractive bra on, but it does the job.  I decided to wear it for a whole day and found that the support didn't last that long.  The seam under the bust started to roll and it loosened up a bit.  I would definitely wear this to the gym or for a half day.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06336757", "1": "0.24321397", "2": "0.02222862", "3": "0.31185034", "5": "0.1534728", "6": "0.2027449"}}
