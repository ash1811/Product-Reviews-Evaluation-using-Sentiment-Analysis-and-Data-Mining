{"text": "This arrived at my door on the coldest day of the year so far (-13F) and I could not believe UPS was even delivering. I got them, put them on and they warmed up (despite being really freezing from being outside in the box) and my feet have been toasty ever since.They run a bit big but they will be perfect with socks.I am SOOO happy with these.The bottom is so soft that it is a bit like walking on memory foam as well. All around a GREAT sipper and a SUPER GREAT slipper for the price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21254563", "1": "0.309229", "2": "0.02795133", "3": "0.123748615", "4": "0.1375856", "5": "0.1593347", "6": "0.029605152"}}
