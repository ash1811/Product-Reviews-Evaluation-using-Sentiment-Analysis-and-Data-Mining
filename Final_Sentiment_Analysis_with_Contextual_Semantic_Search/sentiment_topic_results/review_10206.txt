{"text": "I have moderate metal allergies, and had a reaction to a &#34;sterling silver&#34; chain that was given to me. I wanted a delicate chain for my silver pendant that would not cause my skin to breakout, and this was a good contestant to the price. Having done some research on jewelry chains, I found that the wheat and box chains are the most durable chains for their size, and this one fit the bill (delicate and not too flashy, strong so I don't lose my pendant).The chain arrived quickly, and I was amazed at its high quality and how sparkly it is. It's very pretty and shiny, but not too bling-y due to its thin diameter, and complemented my pendant perfectly. Best of all, I wore it for a few days in a row, one of which my neck got slightly sweaty from bicycling, and it did not irritate my skin. Would definitely buy again from this seller if I need another silver chain.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14021297", "1": "0.124271505", "2": "0.11771264", "3": "0.18904926", "4": "0.23830232", "5": "0.115831554", "6": "0.07461977"}}
