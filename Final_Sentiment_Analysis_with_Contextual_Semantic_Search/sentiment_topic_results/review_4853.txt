{"text": "Well they are definitely cute - and definitely great for the price.  When it comes to the product itself - very happy.  But the Amazon labels with the colors - it's a bit confusing (since the pics don't match the colors for all of them - and there are so many option).  I ordered the \"Black\" option - since I wanted simply black.  I didn't get black...I got black with Pink Bows...but I'm keeping them anyway.They stay up just fine for me - but my thighs aren't what they were before pregnancy - well, I guess to be accurate they're that and then some.  I doubt they'd stay up quite as good if my legs looked like the models!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07378523", "1": "0.22252569", "3": "0.2884809", "4": "0.21156706", "5": "0.091040514", "6": "0.10998164"}}
