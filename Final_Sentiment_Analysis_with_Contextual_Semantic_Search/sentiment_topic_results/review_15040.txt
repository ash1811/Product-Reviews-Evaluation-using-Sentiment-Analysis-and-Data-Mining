{"text": "I bought this watch to replace one I have had for a couple of years and broke. I was so happy to find the very same watch here on Amazon.  This watch was and is just perfect for my needs as I wear both silver and gold jewelry.  The size is just right...not too big or too small.  Looks great with jeans or dressing up a bit.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.049317647", "1": "0.41368538", "2": "0.1889839", "3": "0.15519571", "4": "0.13287488", "6": "0.054818556"}}
