{"text": "I just received these rain pants in a xxl size.Based on earlier reviews I ordered the xxl size instead of an xl size that I'd normally wear in a sweat pant.It was the right choice.I'm approximately a 46\" waist and thick body build and these wereat the maximum limit on the waist for me. I believe these would be finefor a 44\" waist which I wear in Cartherett.I ride an electric bike at around 30mph and the weather has been in the 40s-50s.I put these on top of my normal thin dress pants and they 100% blocked out the wind andkept me warm.There is enough room that they'd fit over jeans.They are a little long at the bottom (for my 30\" inseam)but still wearable without alteration because of the button snap at the bottom, which also keeps them tight enough that I don't need to put a Elastic around the bottom (Bike riding) and they were roomy enough to pedal in without feeling confined.The nylon is neither ultra thin or very thick but somewhere in the middle, you can see the extra waterproofing at the seams, so I'd say that the quality ismiddle of the road as is the price.I have yet to experience conditions allowing me to rate whether they breathe sweat outward or the waterproofing so I'll come back in a month or so to update the review.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1344551", "1": "0.32899874", "3": "0.13512415", "4": "0.15933938", "5": "0.0704253", "6": "0.16948162"}}
