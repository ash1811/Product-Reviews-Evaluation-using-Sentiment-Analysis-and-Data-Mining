{"text": "I love this chest.  I use it for cosmetics and it's helped keep my vanity much tidier.  The drawers are quite shallow, but I think that helps keeps things organized since you can't layer stuff.  I have found that all my makeup will fit into it.  I use a lot of benefit brand boxed powders and their bluffdust.  Those items fit nicely.  Also my Tarte amazonian clay bronzer fits as do all my eye crayons and pencils and my various lip stuffs.My eco-tools kabuki brush doesn't fit because the handle is too fat.  I also do not keep my liquid air-brush foundations in it because I am worried the bottles would leak on their sides.  For these things, I useNifty Cosmetic Organizing Carousel, Whitewhich I also really like.The drawers are smooth and don't stick on my unit.  They do come out all the way, which I find helpful because I pull an entire tray out at a time to look at the contents.  It's solidly built and I would buy it again despite the high price as I wasn't able to find a lesser priced alternative to suit my needs.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.061132625", "1": "0.1890218", "2": "0.1890535", "3": "0.18501513", "4": "0.12886111", "5": "0.09720336", "6": "0.14971247"}}
