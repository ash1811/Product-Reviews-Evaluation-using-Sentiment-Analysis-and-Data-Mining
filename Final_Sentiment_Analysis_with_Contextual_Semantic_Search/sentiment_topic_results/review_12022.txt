{"text": "Definitely worth the money as I found that most shoe stores only carry the narrow and medium size shoes.  Having a shoe that is available in both wide and extra wide is very helpful in that I can buy a shoe that doesn't pinch my feet.  I also buy the extra wide so I can wear light socks in the winter time.  Very nice product and I will possibly be purchasing more of them.  I bought the black and light brown and am very satisfied with both.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.39142263", "2": "0.1532536", "3": "0.15019764", "4": "0.11221838", "5": "0.16705741", "6": "0.022442708"}}
