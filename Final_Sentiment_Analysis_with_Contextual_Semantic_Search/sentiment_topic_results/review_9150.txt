{"text": "My wife bought these for me for a present because my office is on the end of the house and doesn't stay warm during our Chicago winters. They are very warm, well made, and comfortable. I have relatively narrow feet, and they are sized for a normal width foot, but even so I don't have any problems with flapping when I walk. I also like that they don't look like old person slippers. They look great with jeans, I suppose you could even wear them outside, as long as you kept them out of snow.The only complaint I have with them is that the rubber sole is not completely flush with the leather. There are small gaps around the edge that lead me to believe that the sole may one day loosen from the leather completely. However that would likely take years of use, and I don't expect slippers to last forever.Overall I am very satisfied with these slippers. They keep my feet plenty warm when I'm working in my office, look nice, and are comfortable to walk in.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21370928", "1": "0.42475942", "2": "0.07963398", "3": "0.05556535", "4": "0.13202173", "6": "0.09165077"}}
