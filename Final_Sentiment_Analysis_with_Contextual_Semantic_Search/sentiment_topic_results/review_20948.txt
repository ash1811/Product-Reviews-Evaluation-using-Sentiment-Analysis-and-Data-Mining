{"text": "I bought this ring for myself in November 2011. (I also bought Husband the 8mm) I can't be happier!! There is not a mark on it yet and I am not gentle on my rings! And how great Husbands still looks truely amazes me! True to size for comfort fit bands. ((A word of caution....There is no way to cut a tungsten ring off! They have to be smashed/cracked off with vise-grips so do NOT try to force one on that is too small!!))  I wish I could give more that 5 stars!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.34378907", "2": "0.16883875", "3": "0.1361098", "4": "0.20783156", "5": "0.040552754", "6": "0.099831775"}}
