{"text": "This product is a nice touch of class for this new retiree who is learning how to take life a little easier.  The design is tasteful and elegant and the concept very practical.  No more bending down or even sitting on the side of the bed to put shoes on.  It has become so useful that I barely notice that I'm using it anymore.  Sort of like scratching an itch--it just happens, effortlessly, and my shoes are on.  Well done.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17173263", "1": "0.09066043", "2": "0.1828158", "3": "0.21280393", "4": "0.08902048", "5": "0.08733307", "6": "0.16563365"}}
