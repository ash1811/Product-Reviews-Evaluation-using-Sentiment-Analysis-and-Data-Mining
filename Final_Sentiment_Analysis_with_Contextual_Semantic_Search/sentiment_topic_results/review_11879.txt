{"text": "As advised by Wrangler, I ordered a size smaller than I usually take.  They fit great everywhere except the waist, it is about1 to 2 inches too small, however, with a waist stretcher I think I can make them work as the next size larger will be too large in all the other places.  I like the fabric and other than the waist, they look great.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.053868797", "1": "0.36701", "2": "0.25528976", "3": "0.22613032", "6": "0.089002885"}}
