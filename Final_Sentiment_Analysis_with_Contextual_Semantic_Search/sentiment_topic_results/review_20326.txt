{"text": "Love Keen, the boots are all they claim they are and more. Comfortable right out of the box, no break in required. The toebox is roomy so you can wear heavy socks which I love. They are well made, sturdy, and last a long time. I have many pairs of their hikers and I'm sure I will be back for more, they are my go to shoe for everything. I have slightly wide feet and the fit is always perfect for me. If you have a narrow foot you might not like them or need heavy socks. I wear them everyday for walking the dog, running errands, etc. Keen are the best I've tried over the years, I can't recommend them highly enough. This particular boot is good looking as well as comfy, with good ankle support also.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.026025144", "1": "0.3365263", "2": "0.10299963", "3": "0.0613776", "4": "0.14740078", "5": "0.21329018", "6": "0.11238036"}}
