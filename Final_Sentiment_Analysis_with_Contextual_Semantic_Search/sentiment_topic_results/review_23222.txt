{"text": "I tried this bra on as soon as I recieved it.. and it  fit perfectly, and was comfortable. Well, a few days later I said, let me wear this bra today.. and it was very uncomfortable. I had the bra on for about 10 hrs, and when I took it off it I noticed a rip in the fabric in the seam. Not sure if that happened while I had it on.. or if it was already there. I cant send this back because i have technically worn it, even though it was just around the house... I have large breast, but a small frame, and initially thought this was the perfect bra.. glad I didnt order several.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15621768", "1": "0.26469067", "2": "0.04375458", "3": "0.3069686", "4": "0.10295604", "6": "0.122699745"}}
