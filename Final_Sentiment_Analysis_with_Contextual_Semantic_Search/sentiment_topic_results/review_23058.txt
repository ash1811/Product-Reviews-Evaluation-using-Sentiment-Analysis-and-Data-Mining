{"text": "I have to wear black or khaki pants to work, and being a cat owner I can't really go with black. Despite the dress code I handle some pretty gross stuff, and I've ruined almost every pair of khakis I own. These work pants are the answer. They look just like &#34;real&#34; dress pants, but they're heavy material and they've got some sort of anti-liquid/anti-stain treatment on them. Water just beads off, solid stuff just wipes off or washes out without staining.My only gripes, and both minor:1: The fly isn't a button, it's a sort of tab/loop thing. Sometimes it comes unhooked. I always wear a belt anyway, so this isn't a huge problem.2: The side pockets could be a lot deeper. There is a shower of change whenever I sit down, but so far I haven't managed to lose my car keys.I think I'm going to end up buying a ton of these.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07450013", "1": "0.2065708", "2": "0.24024926", "3": "0.15243123", "4": "0.09220239", "5": "0.061597604", "6": "0.17244862"}}
