{"text": "Buying things like this is sometimes difficult online since I have larger breasts than average. I ordered XXXL since I wasn't sure if it was going to fit up there or not. Maybe I should have ordered XXL. It was definitely roomy, but I expect things like this to shrink. The sizing chart is not right so don't go by that. I have a 50 inch chest and XXL would have fit me perfect. This will do though. The quality and fabric is very nice and in a great color. Just order down one size.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.091213524", "1": "0.33344442", "2": "0.0837408", "3": "0.12613907", "4": "0.13198814", "5": "0.073518515", "6": "0.1599555"}}
