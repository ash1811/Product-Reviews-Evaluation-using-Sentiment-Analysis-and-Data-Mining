{"text": "My son goes to college at University of Maine where there is SNOW, and previously he, would NOT wear boots, until this year.  He asked for these boots specifically. I did my homework, and got the waterproof Timberlands.  I also purchased a size smaller than his usual 12, because other reviews of the boot, said that they run a size bigger.  My son says the boots fit and he is very pleased.  I love Amazon.  I was able to shop, right here in my warm home, and have the boots shipped directly to his college.  Easy breezy.  Done. Happy Mom, happy son, warm feet, warm heart.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.029091077", "1": "0.26015413", "2": "0.07896365", "3": "0.24156943", "4": "0.26710707", "5": "0.06686959", "6": "0.056245055"}}
