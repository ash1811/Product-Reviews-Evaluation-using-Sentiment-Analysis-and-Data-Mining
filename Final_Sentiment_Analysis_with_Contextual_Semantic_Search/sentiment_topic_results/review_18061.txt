{"text": "I bought this watch and worked through the instructions on how to set all the wonderful features.  It was a bit complex but doable.Then I tried to put it on and of course it was too big.  The clasp was a bit weird but I figured that out. Then I tried to shorten the band by sliding the clasp up an inch or so. There were no instructions for how to do it.  I even emailed Casio and asked but then I tried to do it myself. After an hour of fussing: my eyes hurt, my finger was bleeding and the watch band clasp had disintergrated into two separate pieces that slid ever so easily on the band - there was no hope.I suspect I would have liked the watch, it's pretty and extremely useful, but if I can't wear it, it has no function.  I'll be returning it if Casio does not answer my email by tomorrow night with instructions I can follow.I am very sad indeed.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06966409", "1": "0.3059407", "2": "0.15445265", "3": "0.060115915", "4": "0.29586193", "6": "0.11119861"}}
