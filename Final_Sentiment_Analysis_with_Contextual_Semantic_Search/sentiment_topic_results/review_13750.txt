{"text": "I got a pair of Ginger Reef sandals on a trip to California Adventure once upon a time. I wasn't used to sandals but in no time I had broken them in and they were so cushy and comfortable, they conformed to my feet. I wore them just about every day and they lasted me literally about 4 years. They were still wearable when I finally retired them, but they wouldn't have lasted too much longer. These sandals are the most durable articles of footwear I've ever owned, about 10 times over. They're great, though they do tend to get dirty over time... but they last.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07600208", "1": "0.26413226", "2": "0.09518624", "3": "0.1869348", "4": "0.20283692", "5": "0.087556854", "6": "0.087350875"}}
