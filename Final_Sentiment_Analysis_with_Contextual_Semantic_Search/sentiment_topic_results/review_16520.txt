{"text": "Bates, Bates, Bates, being former military this is a very common shoe, this particular model not so much, but needed for my new civilian job I went right for them. Hoping to get the quality that comes with the Bates name I got these. They worked great when I got them and now about 8 months later they are falling apart. Not even the common part like the sole, zipper, or laces but the \"leather\" or whatever on the back over the heel just ripped in two. The big issue I have is this new job is security, I don't have to run at all, barely walk, these boots probably have about 30 miles on them total so this happening is just a shame. Just be careful with what you get.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13428782", "1": "0.3469695", "2": "0.093322806", "3": "0.10279282", "4": "0.112022154", "5": "0.07847476", "6": "0.13213013"}}
