{"text": "The deerskin moccasins are glove soft, and fit perfectly on my averaged size feet.  The nubby bottom gives you a good grip, and is very flexible.  I put them on the first day and they are so comfortable, there is no break-in time needed. I don't care for the bows, so I tie the lace into a knot on the front, then cut the laces off so they are just short of hitting the ground.  Gives a simple look and you don't have to keep retying the bow.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12732533", "1": "0.23264201", "2": "0.059913088", "3": "0.12842008", "4": "0.043939833", "5": "0.3124192", "6": "0.09534047"}}
