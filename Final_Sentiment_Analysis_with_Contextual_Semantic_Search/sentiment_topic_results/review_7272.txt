{"text": "I bought this pair impressed by the fit and finish of my last purchase, a Riggs Ranger/Cargo Pant which incidentally has become my workhorse because of all the pockets and how they look on me (Wife says I look good in them, so I guess I must!). Same size and fabric as the last one just a different style but is around an inch and a half too tight on my waist. Fits as expected and just right everywhere else. Looks great so I think I will wear them some and see if they don't loosen up on me.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.355541", "2": "0.096880704", "3": "0.16792537", "4": "0.22873774", "6": "0.14467296"}}
