{"text": "Having opened many, MANY tins of Kiwi polish while in the Army, I soon learned that the easiest way to tell a good, fresh can of polish is whether or not the polish is  cracked when you open it. If it's cracked it's old and drying out. These weren't cracked.Kiwi, as always, delivers a high quality product that's fresh and full of wax. Fast shipping from the retailer and a consistent shine across all my brown boots and shoes. This is a darker brown that will definitely recolor your boots/shoes if they are of a lighter tan. So look for a tan color if your boots/shoes are lighter than medium brown.No complaints here and the price is right.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06668626", "1": "0.23281793", "2": "0.15637454", "3": "0.105763644", "4": "0.15297672", "5": "0.12525934", "6": "0.16012157"}}
