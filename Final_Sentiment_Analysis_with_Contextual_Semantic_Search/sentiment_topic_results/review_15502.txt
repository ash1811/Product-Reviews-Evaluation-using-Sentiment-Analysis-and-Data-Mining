{"text": "I wanted a good looking mesh band watch with a slim head to fit under dress shirts or just be wrist candy that you can forget about. Perfect match!! The blue is brilliant and the face is simple which lets the simplicity speak for itself. Price is great for a slim titanium face of good quality (as opposed to something like a Movado). The clasp is easily adjustable. THE ONLY DRAW is that the joints where the band meet the face are stiff - meaning they don't flex to fit your wrist like most watches. This is only a problem if you have skinny wrists but even then its only a minor flaw. Great watch. Happy I got to add Skagen to my collection.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.103162624", "1": "0.24835251", "2": "0.24520311", "3": "0.10364421", "4": "0.14545347", "5": "0.08182589", "6": "0.07235818"}}
