{"text": "I absolutely love these clogs! They are so comfortable and easy to clean I wear them daily to walk the animals and do yard work. Just hose off and you are ready to go again! They are the most comfy gardening clog I have ever owned, and I had to come back and get another pair! I wear them for many other occasions than yard work. like quick trips to the store or walking to the mailbox, etc. The insole is removable, too, with antimicrobial coating. I can't recommend these highly enough.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1660101", "1": "0.44943163", "2": "0.07221676", "4": "0.2343889", "6": "0.07197877"}}
