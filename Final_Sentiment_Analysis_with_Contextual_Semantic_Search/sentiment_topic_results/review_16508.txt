{"text": "My husband bought this beautiful locket for me. The area for the pictures is large enough to see the details of the picture, but not too large. You can put a picture on both sides. The chain and clasp are strong and a good length 18\". My husband cropped the pictures and had them printed at costco. The quality is amazing much better than using our home printer. The pictures could be easily changed, though I will keep the ones he put in it. I highly recommend this great quality, beautiful, silver locket. I love the satin finish!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.19993535", "1": "0.36717978", "2": "0.046768267", "4": "0.30207622", "6": "0.07873092"}}
