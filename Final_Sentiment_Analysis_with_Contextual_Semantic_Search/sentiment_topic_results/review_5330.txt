{"text": "My sister normally wears an 8, but was having orthopedic problems and needed a larger (temporary) shoe to go on over bandages.  I ordered these for her in the largest size, and she loves them.  They have enough cushion to wear for hours--the elastic doesn't bind, either--and they're washable.  Also sturdy enough for her to use them for shopping and &#34;running&#34; (not right now) around.  They won't last forever with hard outdoor use, but at the very low price, these are a darling solution to her problem.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.035628673", "1": "0.23400168", "2": "0.10440342", "4": "0.23597512", "5": "0.2706137", "6": "0.11631947"}}
