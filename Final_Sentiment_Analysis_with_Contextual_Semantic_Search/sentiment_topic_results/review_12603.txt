{"text": "I bought these New Balance mules for around-the-house wear because they slip off easily when I need to go outside to work in the garden, however, they are so comfortable I find myself wearing them for shopping and other social activities as well.They are attractive--look great with jeans and cutoffs--and most important, my heel stays in the shoe. They run true to size. I wear a 9 medium and these in that size fit perfectly. I wish I had them in several colors. I may never go back to lace-up shoes again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.061597534", "1": "0.2509289", "2": "0.11567399", "3": "0.23099276", "4": "0.10916061", "5": "0.15826063", "6": "0.07338557"}}
