{"text": "A very comfortable bra in pretty much every way, and unlike many bras for bigger women (or bigger-chested women), so pretty! Comfortable straps, no slip-down of straps, comfortable band.  Cups in this bra and other similar ones by Playtex are generously sized, so order one size down.  One downside is that the lace on the bottom edge of the bra starts to be a little uncomfortable by the end of the day, but I consider that to be part-and-parcel of wearing a lace-edged bra.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04152792", "1": "0.29172125", "2": "0.13367152", "3": "0.22720484", "4": "0.20391387", "5": "0.053996447", "6": "0.0479641"}}
