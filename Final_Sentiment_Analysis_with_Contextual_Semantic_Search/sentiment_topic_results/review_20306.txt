{"text": "I tried on 26 different hiking shoes, boots, and even trail running shoes at REI.The sales guy even had me try on some men's boots!The ball of my foot is wide and the heel is narrow.Also I have really thin ankles, which can be trouble.FINALLY I tried these on and they fit like a dream.Enough ankle support, but not too heavy.My heel doesn't slide around, ample room in the toe box.My toe doesn't rub against the front side (I have callouses on my big toesbecause they hit every shoe I have ever owned)I am not backpacking or anything so weight isn't an issue for me.But they seem light for a mid.  I haven't tried the waterproof aspect yet.They seem sturdy and I am hoping they last a long time.  It seemslike they will.  I like the look of the boot too, it's nice.I have worn them every single day since I got them.I am a jeans and Tshirt kind of girl, and I wear these everywhere.Errands, around the neighborhood, dinner, everywhere. I live in Colorado, sono one looks at me crosswise.And they do well on the trail too! So far so good. No breaking in time needed.No blisters, no discomfort when I get back home, my feet don't feel tired after hiking in them.So I am really, very happy with this purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.29788184", "1": "0.24149306", "2": "0.15992644", "3": "0.09823078", "4": "0.1144945", "5": "0.08585355"}}
