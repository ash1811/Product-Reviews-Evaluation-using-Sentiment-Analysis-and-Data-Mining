{"text": "I have had two pairs of this style prior. One brown suede, which I wore out after 5 or 6 years, then black leather.  I was so glad to see these in red.BUT, the upper is made of some plastic-y stuff that is stiff & makes my feet sweat.  I have had such a hard time finding red casual shoes, I'm torn whether to return them or not.  But if I had known the quality has taken such a nosedive, I wouldn't have bought them in the first place.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.109934926", "1": "0.2375195", "2": "0.1048645", "3": "0.16291335", "4": "0.24132529", "6": "0.14009054"}}
