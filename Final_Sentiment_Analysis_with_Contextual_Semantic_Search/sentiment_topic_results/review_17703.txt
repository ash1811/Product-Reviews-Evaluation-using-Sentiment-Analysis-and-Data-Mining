{"text": "This is a very nice looking watch and very affordable. It is great to have the looks of the analog watch with the features of a digital. However, there are just a few drawbacks:1) The light is awful. Pressing the button provides light around the perimeter, but it barely penetrates into the center. In a dark room you have to look closely to see the time. It doesn't light up the LED portion at all, so forget about setting an alarm or checking the date or a timer. In a dark room the LED display is unavailable.2) It should be a good thing that it has this memo feature, but I would have liked to have thought it would be out of the way if not used. As it is, it is one of the things you cycle through.3) The base is plastic. The band and top of the water are metal, but the base, including where the watch band pins go into, are plastic. This is OK, although I did manage to pull one of the pins out when I hit the watch on a doorknob by accident. I needed some epoxy and a small drill to fix, but it was, again, my fault.4) The band is a little hard to resize. See others who gave instructins. I bent a pin when putting it back together but, fortunately could use one from part I had removed.5) Slightly convex crystal, so a little easier to scratch than ideal (more often, with me, is getting white streaks from brushing up against the wall.)I don't mean to say it is a bad watch, just to point out a few small things that might be important to people. Again, it is inexpesnive, good looking, and keeps time well, so very good.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18911313", "1": "0.25927436", "2": "0.15382716", "4": "0.19794661", "5": "0.12831873", "6": "0.06881224"}}
