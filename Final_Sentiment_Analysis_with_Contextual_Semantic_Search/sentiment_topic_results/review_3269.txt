{"text": "If you are looking for a supportive, comfortable slip-on for work or for casual wear, you may want to consider \"Merrell Jungle Moc\" slip-ons.  These shoes are not light in weight; the pair (size 10 1/2D) weighs approximately 1 lb. 12 5/8 oz.  The suede is a good quality and finish on these slip-ons is clean and well done.  Interior seams are clean and the lining is soft and cushioned.  The soles are rubber and, if wearing these on wet surfaces, help prevent slipping.Because \"Merrell Jungle Moc\" are not flexible but are somewhat wide, you may find it necessary to order a smaller size than you normally wear.  My spouse wears an 11 D in Brooks running shoes and an 11D in most conventional shoes.  The \"Merrell Jungle Moc\" slip-ons that fit comfortably and did not gap or slide were a size 10 1/2D.  From the middle of the front to the center of the heel, the interior measurement on a 10 1/2D is approximately 11 \".  At the ball of the foot, the interior width is approximately 3 \"; at the heel, approximately the interior width is approximately 2\".Individuals having more sensitive feet may find the point at which the sole joins to the shoe, near the ball of the foot, somewhat irritating.  It was for this reason that my spouse purchased \"Skechers GoWalk2\" shoes and returned the \"Merrell Jungle Moc\" slip-ons.  Overall had his right foot not been so sensitive, he would have kept them as he did like these shoes.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.18579695", "1": "0.2867333", "2": "0.12319929", "3": "0.3059553", "4": "0.05422773", "5": "0.02720118", "6": "0.016886223"}}
