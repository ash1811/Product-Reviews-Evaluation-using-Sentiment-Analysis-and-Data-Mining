{"text": "As a 6 ' 1 '' and 250 Ib this size fit me very well and the color was excellent though I thought it will be lighter but it is very good, and also the price, I remember last time I wear Lee Jeans It was really very long time, may be more than 30 Years and I was teen age and my Dad was working in Saudi Arabia and it was available there that time and I Used to wear size 36 but now with getting old as you see increasing two sizes, I will decrease my weight I hope. The reason for not wearing Lee for this long time as that it is not always available here and even if available it is high price so Thanks Lee, and Thanks Amazon", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.47425562", "2": "0.07215804", "3": "0.14705889", "4": "0.22754061", "6": "0.0738637"}}
