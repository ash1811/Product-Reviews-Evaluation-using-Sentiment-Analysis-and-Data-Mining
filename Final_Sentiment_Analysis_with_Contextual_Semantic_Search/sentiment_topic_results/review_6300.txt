{"text": "I am a huge fan of SmartWool hiking socks as they are very soft and was hoping these would feel softer than normal liner socks. However, they feel scratchy like all other liner socks I've tried. That said, they were still warmer than most and they stay up.For those who need more info on sizing, SmartWool adult socks seem to be larger. I wear size 5 women's shoe/kids 3 and the adult smalls, which I'd be in the middle, are always too large. Kids large works perfect even though according to their size chart, I'd be at the low end.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14272085", "1": "0.25956643", "2": "0.059863675", "3": "0.18309598", "5": "0.16090761", "6": "0.19141363"}}
