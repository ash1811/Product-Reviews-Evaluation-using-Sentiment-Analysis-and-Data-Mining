{"text": "I bought this tool in order to adjust a few watch bands.  Most of my bands are average width and are made by Seiko, Bulova, Citizen, etc.The tool is largely plastic with a metal knob which moves the tray where you lay the band.  This helps you better align the band with the removal pin.  I didn't use the knob - more on that later.The tool includes 6 pusher-pins which screw onto a rod which is in a plastic handle.  The rod has a lot of play in it, but that seems to be intended.With some practice, this tool does work.  I would recommend practicing on a band you do not necessarily care about, preferably a narrower one.  You possibly will bend/break the first pinhead as you practice.If you have an average to wide band it is more difficult to see if the pusher-pin and the pin in your band are aligned.  In fact, on my bands, I didn't use the tray knob at all because the band fit into the tray with very little room left, making it impossible to see the alignment, so I had to adjust the band back and forth by hand to \"feel\" and make sure the pins aligned.  I found it worked best with some help, so my son looked down on the tool and lined up the pins and I held the tool in place while turning the handle and he would tell me whether to keep going/back up....and we are both pretty mechanically inclined.The tool does work though once you get the hang of aligning the pins.I am not sure about the advertisement of two extra spare pins.  I didn't get any band pins at all, but got six pusher-pins.I would suggest this if you already know how to use one, or are willing to practice a little with it. I am going to try another tool, a set that comes with a small hammer and some punches to see if that is easier to use.In the end I was able to resize my bands, but I'd say this tool was just so-so as far as ease of use.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.21567088", "1": "0.13008364", "2": "0.15016863", "3": "0.13338198", "4": "0.20209025", "5": "0.063773744", "6": "0.104830906"}}
