{"text": "These are great--warm, and with a little more padding than the insoles that come standard in new Uggs (or at least these are better/thicker than the ones that came in the brand new Uggs boots I bought recently!).  I use them to replace the old insoles in old Uggs, but I liked them so much, I ordered another pair to fit into a pair of Bogs rain boots, and then yet another pair for another pair of shoes.They have no arch to speak of, but I didn't want that anyway.  I do like how thick they are, and pretty comfortable.  Far superior to cheaper insoles!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09796714", "1": "0.22705624", "2": "0.1231965", "3": "0.16699645", "4": "0.20006453", "5": "0.115853935", "6": "0.068865195"}}
