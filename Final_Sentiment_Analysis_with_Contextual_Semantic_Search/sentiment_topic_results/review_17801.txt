{"text": "I reviewed another G-shock because my cousin in the Army used it and loves it. This one is the quintessential tough watch. They're sold at PXs, cheap, yet durable and very accurate while providing some great other functions while leaving a few off that are also great but not really needed. I've had mine for only a year now but I'm kicking its butt working around my house doing upkeep, updates, and throwing in camping every now and then. Get this watch, it's a bit clunky but not meant to be a dress watch. You won't regret it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06384431", "1": "0.24477264", "2": "0.2127181", "3": "0.08697857", "4": "0.09646808", "5": "0.1334334", "6": "0.16178492"}}
