{"text": "So far, I have to say I'm impressed with this product.  When compared to the Dr. Scholl's inserts which are also quite good and the high cost of having inserts professionally made, these are an excellent value.  I had a pair of Solo's made by a pediatrist that cost me over $400 dollars.  Live and learn.  They work great but, give me a break!  $400?  Never again.  I have two identical pairs of dress shoes with the Solo's in one pair and the Superfeet in the other.  The true test of how well they work is that I can't tell the difference.  What more can I say?", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.105025604", "1": "0.20296435", "2": "0.13432303", "3": "0.04832553", "4": "0.15306468", "5": "0.27832726", "6": "0.07796953"}}
