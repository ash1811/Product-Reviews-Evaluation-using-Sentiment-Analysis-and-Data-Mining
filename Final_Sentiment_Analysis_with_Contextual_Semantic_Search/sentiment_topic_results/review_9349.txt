{"text": "Our 3 & 6 year olds love this chest!  What you see is what you get.  It's smallish(by adult standards) made of lightweight wood, but appropriate for this age group and little hands.  There's a skull lock with jeweled colored eyes that capture the light; the lock swings to the side to open the top.  Inside, one of the small planks, which has a small curved finger insert, removes to expose the secret compartment below the false bottom.The coins are plastic with a red pouch; the patch has a velcro attachment on a stretchable band, and finally, there's a cool, pirate bandana, or I guess you could make it into a flag.When the kids discovered the chest in their playhouse, I was surprised how quickly they knew how to open the latch and what to do with everything.  Kids are smart, and boy, do they know how to play!  Especially, our two little girls.The toy appears durable enough.  I suppose if one stomped on it, jumped on it, threw it down on the concrete there'd be walk-the-plank trouble.  The top hinge is on the thin side, but so far so good with two very active kiddoes.  Some might want a more realistic pirate chest, but for this age group, it's perfect.  In general, we enjoy Melissa and Doug's stuff. Ay, Matey!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12959363", "1": "0.14486039", "2": "0.08040261", "3": "0.18953803", "4": "0.10924605", "5": "0.14173883", "6": "0.20462045"}}
