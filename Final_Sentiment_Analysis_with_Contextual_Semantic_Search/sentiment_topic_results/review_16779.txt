{"text": "I really like this Invicta chronograph watch.  It has a very attractive dial, and nice band and it is big.  The face of this watch, while advertised as white, looks like a pale yellow to me.  Nevertheless, whatever the color, the face does stand out, not only because of its color but because it is so big - about 2 1/8 inches both height and width.This watch is a chronograph, and there are two sub dials on the face.  I like the position of these dials, with the seconds dial being on the top and the minutes being on the bottom of the dial. However, whenever the second, and to a lesser degree the hour hand are anywhere from the 53 minute mark to the 8 minute mark, the second hand for the chronograph is obscured.  I really do not find it that annoying, but they do obstruct the view.  This happens, to a lesser degree on the bottom dial because the minutes do not move, or are needed as much, as the second hand.  The face also has a date window at the 3 o'clock position, and it is oversized so I can see both the date before and the date after.  Convenient for someone like me that can never remember what the date is on any given day.This black leather band is nice, and is has white stitching going along each edge.  I think this really helps bring out the color (whatever it might be) of the face.  The case is all brushed metal and I like how it complements the entire watch.This watch has a Japanese quartz movement, so I was curious as to how accurate it was, so I tested it against the Atomic Clock in Colorado over a period of 24 hours.  I found that this watch was fast by 2 seconds over this time period, which means for each month, I have to set my watch back by a minute.  I do not think that is bad for this Japanese movement, but I am not sure how it would hold up against a precise Swiss movement.This watch kind of overpowers my wrist, but I like it nonetheless.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.104262546", "1": "0.2750595", "2": "0.19553639", "3": "0.055952366", "4": "0.024774937", "5": "0.068972185", "6": "0.27544206"}}
