{"text": "I ordered this one for my daughter and the hot pink one for her friend. Unfortunately they did not arrive on time (and I paid extra for expedited shipping in anticipation of predicted snow storm, this was the first problem I've had with things not arriving on time but I had another problem with another order yesterday, contacted Amazon about yesterday's problem and they handled it) and the girls did not get to use them until about a month later when we had our next snow storm here in NC. the girls reported they were great and really helped to keep them warm. Highly recommend!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17889977", "1": "0.20355192", "3": "0.19284081", "4": "0.16218334", "5": "0.181989", "6": "0.07792492"}}
