{"text": "I bought this leotard for my teenage dancing daughter. She's tall: 5'8\", 122 lbs. It fits her perfectly. She usually takes a leotard in long torso but this one fits great. We got a size large just in case. It is a little loose in the waist area but it looks fine. Sleeves were plenty long enough. It is so soft and she says it's very comfy. She wears it underneath her colorguard costume for marching band. It keeps her warm enough and fits so well can't even tell it's under her costume. We are going to order it in black for her dance classes. Highly recommend this one. It's also lined in the front for added coverage. Wonderful product. Washes well in our front loader on delicate cycle and I hang it to dry. Would not recommend washing it in a top loader since it could get damaged by agitater. Also wouldn't wring it dry.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14563015", "1": "0.2928576", "2": "0.0698121", "3": "0.19350253", "4": "0.13804615", "5": "0.11211758", "6": "0.04803388"}}
