{"text": "Bought this as a gift for a friend who is not really into watches, I figured I'd get him an eco-drive so he wouldn't have to worry about battery changes/handwinding/watch box etc. This watch is perfect for him; it's easy to read, good-looking, low maintenance, and it was a great deal for me (I got myself the BM6400, another fantastic watch).Bottom line, you can't go wrong if you like the looks, the only complaint I have is that the band isn't really that great, I feel like the holes are too far apart to allow you to get a good fit (either slightly too loose or slightly too tight). That's an easy fix though... 10 bucks on NatoStrapCo or CrownandBuckle and you've got the solution :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06213245", "1": "0.2949764", "2": "0.11459868", "3": "0.106148906", "4": "0.15111461", "5": "0.1858302", "6": "0.085198715"}}
