{"text": "I just wanted a fun pair of argyle knee high sock and i ordered these in the ivory color that comes with pink and they are so cute! i was skeptical of the one size because of course sometimes the one size does not fit all, I wear a size 9 1/2 and Im 5'9 but these fit perfect. they come up right  at my knee and stay there the whole day. love these socks!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.28185198", "2": "0.14842792", "3": "0.09805499", "4": "0.08171706", "5": "0.14592968", "6": "0.24034786"}}
