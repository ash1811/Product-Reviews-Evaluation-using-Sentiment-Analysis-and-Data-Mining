{"text": "I'm a clothing snob and I admit it.  I am.  There's something about being able to buy the best and have a model who will always look great in it.  So I buy my daughter higher quality stuff.  Some people have a drinking habit or a coffee habit.  I put my daughter in expensive baby clothes.So when I realized that I actually did want some plain white sleeveless onesies for this hot summer (they look so much cuter than you'd think), I was actually frustrated to not find them in any higher end brands.  But these spasilk ones had good reviews, so I went for it.Punchline is that they are soft and silky and feel very high quality.  Don't let the price fool you - these are really nice.  No cheap or rough feeling cotton here. Just smooth and soft against my skin and hers.  I plan on looking at other things made by spasilk.Also - I found the sizing to be consistent with other brands.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19168682", "1": "0.35247", "2": "0.07814259", "3": "0.18535072", "5": "0.13567129", "6": "0.054430712"}}
