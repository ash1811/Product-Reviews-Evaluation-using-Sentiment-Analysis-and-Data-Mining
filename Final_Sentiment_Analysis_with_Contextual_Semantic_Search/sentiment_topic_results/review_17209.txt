{"text": "My husband is frugal and fussy.  He's had a pair of these shoes for a few years; they were purchased secondhand in Medium width.  (We didn't know they were available in Wide.)  He's very happy with the way these fit, and he was happy with the price, too.  The older pair lasted as long as similar-style boat shoes that cost almost twice as much; he'll probably keep these new ones for the rest of his life.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07307541", "1": "0.37572458", "2": "0.26707518", "3": "0.13913806", "4": "0.13799079"}}
