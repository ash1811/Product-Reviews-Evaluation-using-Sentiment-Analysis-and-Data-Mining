{"text": "We have had many of these watches over the course of the last 13 years and 4 kidsI LOVE the following :-if they loose it, Timex will replace it-it is analog....kids need to learn this before going digital..it's vital!-it's sooo cute-the price...quality,  and it is able  get wet so the child does not have to take on and off constantlyMy only gripe on this watch is the band mechanism to secure the length of the strap. It seems to wiggle over time, or come loose. I wish it was able to hold it a bit &#34; tighter&#34; . We graduate our kids to a Timex Ironman digital once this has ran it's course.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.24940076", "1": "0.06546803", "2": "0.18404959", "3": "0.17983107", "4": "0.09751982", "5": "0.08651654", "6": "0.13721418"}}
