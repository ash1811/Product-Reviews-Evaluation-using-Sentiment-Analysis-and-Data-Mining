{"text": "Bought these along with Men's Touareg Oxford,Brown Leather,11.5 M slip lace-up's. Love old style leather shoes & my Thom McCans had seen better days. Tried to purchase the same style again but couldn't track them down so opted for good old Clarks! I thought they looked nice from the pics but these babies are really great up close - Thankfully they were a perfect fit, the leather is beautiful & soft......both pairs are great shoes......great decision - I'm a happy camper!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.093815036", "1": "0.41260707", "2": "0.17545731", "4": "0.12422713", "5": "0.12552918", "6": "0.06537913"}}
