{"text": "Very fast shipping! Great price! This petticoat got the job done for my sub ball dress. However, same as some of the other reviews, after hanging this thing up for 2 weeks in my bathroom before use (hoping the steam from the shower would help even things out) it still seemed much more bunchy at the bottom which made my dress look lumpy :(  It wasn't HORRIFIC but I would have liked to have gotten a smoother finish", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12649384", "1": "0.15050812", "2": "0.17903458", "3": "0.15631416", "4": "0.19033512", "5": "0.09040564", "6": "0.10690853"}}
