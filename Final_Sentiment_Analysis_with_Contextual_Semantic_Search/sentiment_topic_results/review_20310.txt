{"text": "Ok, this is how I operate when it comes to shopping items or brands I've never purchased.  I go to the stores and try on all different brands to get the feel and know my size, then shop online to see who has the best price. I needed new hiking boots and I'm fussy, I want comfort, good looks and a reasonable price. Tough to find these days but these are just that. This is the most comfortable boot I've ever worn, I put them on the first day, wore them all day and from the minute I put them on they felt like I'd always worn them, light weight, cool, great gripping sole, nice fit at the heal and around the ankle. Absolutely no rubbing or bunching. The tongue is constructed as part of the collar and never bunches or slides. The hooks at the top &#34;lock&#34; the shoestring in place so if your shoe comes untied, it still fits snuggly. I've had alot of boots but this is the best, I won't buy anything but KEEN in the future and Amazon has the best price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.084108196", "1": "0.23819911", "3": "0.18243654", "4": "0.15048492", "5": "0.18777733", "6": "0.15485345"}}
