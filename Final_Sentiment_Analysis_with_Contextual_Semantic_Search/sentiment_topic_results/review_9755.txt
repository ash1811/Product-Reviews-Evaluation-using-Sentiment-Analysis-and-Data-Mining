{"text": "Love these leather oxfords !  I have worn them continually every day since I got them 3 months ago and they show no wear and tear even gardening,  no dirt sticks to the leather although I washed the laces.  They have no insoles but are comfy as is, flat shoes as what was described.  I cant find them locally so viola here on Amazon !  Keds company is perfect if the shoe is the wrong size or color re: an exchange.  I will buy again from them as I also bought the eyelet oxfords as well many times5 stars on this item,  will DEFINITELY buy this one again.  Great shoePS this picture shows a black or navy canvas shoe NOT the awesome white leather ones i bought", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.250414", "2": "0.3053149", "3": "0.0674982", "4": "0.14790079", "5": "0.098540395", "6": "0.12815884"}}
