{"text": "I have so many watches that become dust collectors once they need a battery replacement. I won't have that problem with the Eco-drive watch. I keep it on my kitchen windowsill to charge. I was able to take out a few links on the band easily for a perfect fit on my wrist. The numbers are very hard to discern in a dark room even when fully charged, however, it does emit a nice glow. I haven't had any skin sensitivities like I usually do with cheap watches.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.048814543", "1": "0.112635225", "2": "0.293831", "3": "0.14591882", "4": "0.12696077", "5": "0.2344764", "6": "0.037363198"}}
