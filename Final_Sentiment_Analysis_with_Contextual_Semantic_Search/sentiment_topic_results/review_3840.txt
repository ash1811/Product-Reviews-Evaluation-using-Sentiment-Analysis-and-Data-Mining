{"text": "This may be the perfect 3/4 pant. This is not a capri pant in the way women have capri pants. They are looser and shorter than most women's styles. They have an adjustable waist that will get smaller a few inches from its maximum size by gathering up the waist in the back left and right sides, but not larger. They will look fine on any man. In fact the \"street wear\" long shorts that are popular in big cities are longer than these are. For me the problem is I am a true 31\" waist and these are made in China, probably by people who don't get paid to care and be consistent. Within the same color, style and size there can be up to two inches of waist difference between two pair (eg. Some size small had at 32\" waist and some had a 30\" waist; Some medium would not go down to a 31\" waist). That left me constantly returning and re-ordering sizes medium and small to finally find the color and quantity I wanted. When it was all said and done, of the pants that fit me some were size small, and some were size medium, but all were about the same fit. That is very poor quality control in a pant that fits with sizing like XS 23\"-27\", S 27'-31\", M 31\"-35\", L 35\"-39\", XL 39\"-43\". If you are a waist size in in the middle of a given size range, I would expect these pants would be perfect. If you are on the line between two sizes, I wish you luck and watch the sellers return policy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.090273805", "1": "0.36938792", "2": "0.13182138", "3": "0.12785827", "5": "0.10353435", "6": "0.17459877"}}
