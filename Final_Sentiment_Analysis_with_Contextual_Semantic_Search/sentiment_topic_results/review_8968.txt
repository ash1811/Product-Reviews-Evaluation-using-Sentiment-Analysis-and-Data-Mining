{"text": "Okay first of all these shoes look great.  Sketchers have always been one of my favorite brands and it's because they actually are able to make sneakers that look classy.  The stitching and styling are A+ in my book on this pair.  They fit true to size so my normal size 8 worked fine.  They breath well and the padding inside is great on my heel and the ball of my foot.So why not 5 stars?  Because I have high arches and there is almost no arch support beyond the external molding of the shoe.  The inside is completely flat, no nice thick bump where my arch is.  Now I'm not mad at them because apparently having arch support is out of fashion (the only pair of shoes I was able to find it in is a pair of New Balance that were over a hundred dollars and were ugly as sin) I mean sure I can buy some inserts, but I really don't want to have to do that.Sketchers hear my plea, add arch support to your sneakers!But other than that minor quibble I'm considering buying a second pair of these with the darker blue coloring.  Just for contrast... because a girl can never have enough shoes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07525372", "1": "0.16134144", "2": "0.24858618", "3": "0.34386432", "4": "0.026666265", "5": "0.14197662"}}
