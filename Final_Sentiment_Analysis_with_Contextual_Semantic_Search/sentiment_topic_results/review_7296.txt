{"text": "This is my second pair of Riggs Workwear Jeans within the last year. The first pair were very comfortable (as are these), but for some strange reason the bottom of the pant legs started to shred, after just a few months of wear. I took pictures, but can't post them evidently. Hopefully, the first pair were part of a bad batch.
