{"text": "I was a little hesitant to buy jeans on the internet without trying them on first. Finally, when they appeared on sale at Amazon I decided to give them a try. Upon arrival I was pleasantly surprised that they were the same quality Levi jeans I normally buy in department stores for a lot more money.  Through and through they are Leve's and fit perfectly. These are not seconds or knock off but great jeans especially for the money. Packaging and shipping was outstanding and I will buy them again without reservation.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16008021", "1": "0.39982197", "2": "0.04657967", "3": "0.12193863", "4": "0.09991546", "5": "0.1015878", "6": "0.07007622"}}
