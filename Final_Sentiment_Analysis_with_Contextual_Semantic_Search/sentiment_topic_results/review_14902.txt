{"text": "I love Baggallini.  It stays looking good forever.  I have a small tan bag that I use for shopping and it still looks good after about four years.  I love the light blue interior of this bag as it makes it easier to find items.  The only thing is that I wish it had more inside pockets with zippers or velcro closures.  I have only used the bag once but plan to use it for arts and crafts shows and travel.  It is as advertised so I wasn't disappointed.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11041543", "1": "0.2969267", "2": "0.12558", "3": "0.15230459", "4": "0.17228764", "5": "0.053791333", "6": "0.08869431"}}
