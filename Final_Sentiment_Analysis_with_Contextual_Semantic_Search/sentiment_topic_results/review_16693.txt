{"text": "These boots are great! I received them on a Friday and wore them immediately. I wore them all weekend and received multiple complements on them each day. They are very comfortable and look great. After reading other reviews, I decided to get them in 7.5 (I usually wear a 7). They were a perfect fit. Of course, leather is always better quality but these are a great humane alternative. I am definitely getting others in this brand. Also, I walked in them all day on Friday and they were quite comfy. Sunday night I had a migraine and went to the hospital in them and I felt they were still super comfortable.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.049681712", "1": "0.34267935", "2": "0.047045518", "3": "0.08656964", "4": "0.050226137", "5": "0.2169654", "6": "0.20683224"}}
