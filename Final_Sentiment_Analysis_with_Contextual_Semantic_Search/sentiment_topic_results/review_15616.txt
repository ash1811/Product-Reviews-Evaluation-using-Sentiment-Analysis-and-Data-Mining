{"text": "I bought this item for my son. It basically looked just like the description shows. He seemed to enjoy wearing this costume. He commented that the mask should have been larger because in the photo it covers the whole face and head, but in reality it does not. Also, at the bottom of the feet it did not cover the whole foot as shown in the picture. It was poorly made. Somewhat like a piece of material with a strap of Velcro. He said that besides these two minor mishaps, he would still recommend this costume to others.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14086168", "1": "0.14510354", "2": "0.2732232", "4": "0.14424379", "5": "0.13342589", "6": "0.16020988"}}
