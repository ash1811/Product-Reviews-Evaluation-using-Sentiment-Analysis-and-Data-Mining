{"text": "Lol I bought 3 different pairs of crotchless fishnets (one size) and none of them fit and I'm only 10 pounds over the recommended weight.  So I decided to buy the plus size and they stretch really well.  They go back to their original shape when you take them off.  They are a little big on me (by length) but I'm able to make due lol.  I highly recommend these.  Even if you weigh 300lbs I know you can wear these.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.072242655", "1": "0.44705233", "2": "0.10460954", "3": "0.20750035", "4": "0.09167686", "5": "0.073930696"}}
