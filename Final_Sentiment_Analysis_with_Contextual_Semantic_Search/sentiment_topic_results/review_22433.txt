{"text": "I bought these for my wife, she loves flip flops but they rub the top of her feet raw.  These worked perfectly for her, I did have to trim them to fit her flip flops so they weren't obvious.  So far so good she has had them on for a couple of hours and no pain at all.  They are very soft and smooth so there is almost no friction on her feet.
