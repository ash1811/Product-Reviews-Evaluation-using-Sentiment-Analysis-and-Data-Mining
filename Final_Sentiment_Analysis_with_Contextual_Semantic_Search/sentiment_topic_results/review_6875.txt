{"text": "I purchased these for my hospital bag. The hospital gives boy short like underwear that are very comfy, but after awhile the pads dont really stay in place because they are so loose and it can get messy.No one wants to do dirty laundry in the weeks recovering and coming home with a little one  - this is a great value. I wear size small/4-6 and I decided to order up to a medium since I was pregnant with more cushion for the pushin' -- the size up fit perfect. Its nice to just take off the whole panty that is soiled from fluids, etc. and throw away discreetly in the trash. Especially if you have visitors coming to help with laundry after baby is born.FYI, I ended up having a c-section, so there were sutures placed right at the panty line. I didn't wear them right away because I didn't want to put pressure there, but 2 weeks post and I still like them they are not uncomfortable at all and the healing process is going very well.Also they are breathable so no material that promotes yeast infections (e.g. polyester)Highly recommended", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.075507104", "1": "0.3312187", "2": "0.17598933", "3": "0.08263008", "4": "0.031863283", "5": "0.10670907", "6": "0.19608241"}}
