{"text": "The more I wear it, the more I love it.  It's so comfortable.  I'm not constantly messing with the straps and tugging on it because I'm about to fall out of it.  This bra fits really well.  The minute I put it on, I can stop thinking about it for the rest of the day.  The straps stay put and don't dig in to my shoulders.  Plus, I love not having to worry about the straps showing.  Fits true to size and fits well.  Good support.  Have all three colors now.  :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.048366833", "1": "0.41934165", "2": "0.11738721", "3": "0.14439112", "4": "0.14608414", "5": "0.05905894", "6": "0.06537008"}}
