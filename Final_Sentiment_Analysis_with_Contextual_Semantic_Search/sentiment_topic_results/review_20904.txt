{"text": "This jeans are straight indeed and it has a nice cut through out. The fabric is just stretchy enough to give the jean a comfy feeling without making it hug into you like a skinny jean would. However, they are indeed VERY LOW, sitting under your belly button and they are slightly higher on the back. So, if like me, you have a bit of a tummy (left over from 2 pregnancies and the last 2 years) you might not find them very faltering. You can, however, wear them with the proper shape wear underneath and keep them as an ultimate goal! They are definitely worth it!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.2020117", "1": "0.26259542", "3": "0.14955758", "5": "0.21913628", "6": "0.16166036"}}
