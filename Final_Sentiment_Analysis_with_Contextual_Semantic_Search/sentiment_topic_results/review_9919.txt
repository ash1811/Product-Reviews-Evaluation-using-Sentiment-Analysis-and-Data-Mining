{"text": "I gave this watch to my husband as a Christmas gift. At first he really loved the watch. It looks sharp, is comfortable, and it looked like it would put up with years of use and abuse. Unfortunately, it stopped working 1.5 weeks after he took the watch out of the package. We hoped that it stopped working because the battery died, but no such luck. We replaced the battery and the watch still does not work. We are returning it to Amazon.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.23387113", "1": "0.25140554", "2": "0.2061929", "3": "0.17841473", "4": "0.123109095"}}
