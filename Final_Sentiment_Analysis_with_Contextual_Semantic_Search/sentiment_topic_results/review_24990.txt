{"text": "Obviously feet and fit are a subjective thing.  I have high arches so I find most shoes that I want to wear to play tennis or workout just don't have enough support so I spend a lot of time brand shopping to find a shoe that feels like it has some extra cushioning.  Oddly enough my husband has flat feet and there are many more options for someone with little arch as opposed to someone with a high arch without going into custom orthotics.I actually don't have any problems with my feet, I am just looking for a little extra support.  These were so highly rated I decided to try them.  I wear a 8.0 in a tennis shoe and a 7.5 street shoes.  Like regular cut down orthotics, I found these TTS.I put them in 2 pairs of nike tennis shoes and the orthotics brought my foot too high up in the shoe.  Not even close.  They were slightly closer in an older pair of adidas barricades but frankly both of the original insoles that came with them felt better.  I finally put them in a new pair of babolat propulse 4 and for some reason those were low enough to accommodate this orthotic.  It took me a couple of wearings to get used to them.  As for the actual comfortability I would rate it as average as well.  My foot doesn't feel cradled and it's not super comfortable where I think I would put them in every shoe.I'm going to continue to wear them and see what happens but no magic high arch support for me.  I ended up buying a cheap 5 dollar pair from a 'mart store and those fit in my nikes.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.061917234", "1": "0.14841531", "2": "0.11491587", "3": "0.34317112", "4": "0.13615808", "5": "0.16478883", "6": "0.030633565"}}
