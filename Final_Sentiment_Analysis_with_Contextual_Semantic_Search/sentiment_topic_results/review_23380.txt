{"text": "On a very cold day, I wore these Wigwam socks in my Ariat Fatbaby boots for 13+ hours straight! The socks were incredibly A++ comfortable!  And despite keeping my feet warm, they never felt sweaty or hot. The socks were perfect at the end of the day.  My only con I could say is the top was a tiny bit thick as I have a high arch and I could feel it pressing slightly against the top of my boot.  Excellent sock.  The Columbia Falmouth light merino hikers I tried the next day bunched up in my boot on the bottom of my foot in front of my heel and were not as comfortable as the Wigwams.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10761478", "1": "0.14345202", "2": "0.092974655", "3": "0.17023264", "4": "0.10594072", "5": "0.2090426", "6": "0.17074259"}}
