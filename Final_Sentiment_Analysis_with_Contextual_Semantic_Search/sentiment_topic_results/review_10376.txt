{"text": "I was very skeptic about paying $85 for a pair of house slippers.  But, on the other hand, I was very curious about how much better a slipper for $85 would be compared to a slipper that cost $20.00.  So, I ordered the UGG Australia Women's Scuffette Slippers and I have to admit that I'm blown away by how good they feel.  The lamb's fur is so comfortable to my feet that I look forward to putting them on!!  Now, the next test (and the real test) will be how long this comfort lasts.  I've bought so many pair of $20 house slippers that were comfortable for about a month and then stretched out 2 sizes and the faux fur inside flattened so badly that I had to get another pair.  So, I've probably spent a lot more than $85 in the past year on slippers.  I will update this review in a couple of months and let you know if these slippers are still as comfortable as they are today!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.122671574", "1": "0.24073614", "2": "0.046216197", "3": "0.11397459", "4": "0.16446546", "5": "0.094966516", "6": "0.21696955"}}
