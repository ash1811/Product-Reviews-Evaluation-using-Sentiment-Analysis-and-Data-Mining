{"text": "I've had this bag for several months now and overall it's okay nothing extravagant nor amazing. The bag is also made up of mostly canvas with leather bottom and some leather connected the end of the straps to the bag itself.Pros:+Spacious+durable+heavy duty+adjustable shoulder strap+interior and exterior pocketsCons:-The heavy belt clips on front have no function (they are simply there for design)- velcro (the bag is closed by velcro)-it would be nice if the belt clips were used in closing the bag shut-Over pricedOverall, it's a decent bag but over priced.Update: April 30, 2012I want to make it clear, this bag DOES fall in itself, meaning the front flap is weighed down by the metal hooks and that droops over the bag itself. This bag works and looks best when at high or maximum capacity, so use it for that purpose. Otherwise, bag won't work well nor look good half-empty.I still give this product a 3 out of 5, it's simply a okay product. Though price may not be worth it for an \"okay\" product, that's something to consider...", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1455953", "1": "0.20622906", "2": "0.21670286", "3": "0.032687057", "4": "0.06241248", "5": "0.1518263", "6": "0.18454695"}}
