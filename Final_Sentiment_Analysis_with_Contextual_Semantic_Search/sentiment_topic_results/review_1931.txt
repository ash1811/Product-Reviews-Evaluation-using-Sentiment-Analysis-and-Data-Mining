{"text": "These shoes are 100% leather, without that nasty fabric or (worse yet) plastic lining that so many companies put into their products. They're called &#34;Soft-T&#34; for a reason: they adapt instantly to your foot. But for that reason, you can't expect a lot of wear out of them.Their other drawback is the composition of the sole. I wore them for the first time on a three-block walk to and from the market, and it had begun to rain by the time I left the market. These soles are very slick on wet surfaces, and down I went, opening up both knees. The shoes will therefore be usable in the Pacific Northwest, where I live, only in the non-rainy half of the year.Too bad. I like the look and the feel, but they aren't safe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06079082", "1": "0.13381673", "2": "0.22175895", "4": "0.12660505", "5": "0.40475416", "6": "0.04974384"}}
