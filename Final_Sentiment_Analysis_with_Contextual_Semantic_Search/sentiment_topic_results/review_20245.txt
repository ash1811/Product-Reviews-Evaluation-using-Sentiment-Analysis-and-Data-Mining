{"text": "I have several sets of Allen Edmonds shoe trees and use them in all my shoes ranging from Allen Edmonds oxfords to Boss Orange and Puma sneakers. AE makes several different styles of shoe trees in different sizes. The combination style has a split toe that uses a metal sliding plate to adjust the main part to the proper width. Make sure to get the proper size for your shoes using the chart. I wear 12/13 US 46 Euro and get the XL trees. They help keep shoes in shape and the cedar absorbs moisture. I never have odor issues either. My first set of trees is close to a decade old and they work like new. These are quality trees made in Wisconsin. Highly recommended.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11885282", "1": "0.1434885", "2": "0.24519408", "3": "0.15171482", "4": "0.03494506", "5": "0.060753573", "6": "0.24505116"}}
