{"text": "I have four other pair of Jambu shoes and I love them.  This is also comfortable for me to wear but buyer be aware that the front of the shoe is quite large. What I mean is...when you put the shoe on the ankle and instep fit really well and then the front and toes sort of just flare out. It feels as if the front of my feet just sort of slide around in the front.  I have not worn them for long walks or in the summer and am hoping that will make them more comfortable.  I could easily take an inch off the first three cross straps in the front.  I do have a wide foot, so I can not imagine anyone with a narrow foot would like these.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.18127273", "1": "0.2706389", "2": "0.22459814", "3": "0.12626487", "4": "0.122543454", "6": "0.07207554"}}
