{"text": "Levi's 550's are the best pair of jean's ever! I've always had a problem with regular/slim fitting jeans because I have big thighs due to rigorous exercising for the last 36 years (since I was 10) When I wear regular jeans the waist would fit but the thigh area would be tight and cramped. When I discovered 550's I loved them so much for their relaxed fit that I decided to get them in light and medium stonewash, dust storm and black. I am still contemplating which color I will get next. Thank you Levi's 550's.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.059646945", "1": "0.2969437", "2": "0.0843062", "3": "0.19173215", "4": "0.05422214", "5": "0.20114002", "6": "0.112008855"}}
