{"text": "It is a very decent dive watch. while not in the same league movement wise with my Longines and Omega watches, it is a superb for the money watch, with limitations(non hacking), but I truly enjoy it, I have the black Monster and the Orange Monster, and they are reliable and very sturdy and precise, but not as a chronometer watch would be. ALL mechanical watches get magnetized over time(a few years), and they run fast. Invest in a demagnetizer and learn to use it or take it to a watch repair shop periodically.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20245129", "1": "0.142595", "2": "0.3022973", "3": "0.115345635", "4": "0.1707264", "6": "0.06344646"}}
