{"text": "We got our daughter a lab coat to match her Doc McStuffins doctor kit. This coat is good quality and exactly how I expected it. Some of the other reviews said it has long sleeves. And it does. But no big deal. We roll them up. Would also be very easy to hem them. This was a great buy for the money. Coat would also be good for protecting clothes during arts and crafts.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0926135", "1": "0.37340644", "2": "0.11178624", "3": "0.16398272", "4": "0.13009751", "5": "0.12461923"}}
