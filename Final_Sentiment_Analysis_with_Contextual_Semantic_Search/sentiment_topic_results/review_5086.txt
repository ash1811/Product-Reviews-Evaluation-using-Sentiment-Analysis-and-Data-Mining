{"text": "I ordered these shoes as I love Birkenstocks and wanted a closed toe shoe.  I did order a size up from my usual size, because I intended to wear heavier socks with these shoes.  They are a little wide and a little long.  At the same time, the area by the toes seems a little tight.  Maybe it's my feet or maybe that's how they are supposed to fit.  I find the sizing to be confusing, and some of the pages to be even more confusing.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10029193", "1": "0.35635242", "2": "0.15949093", "3": "0.13603339", "4": "0.10811208", "5": "0.13613656"}}
