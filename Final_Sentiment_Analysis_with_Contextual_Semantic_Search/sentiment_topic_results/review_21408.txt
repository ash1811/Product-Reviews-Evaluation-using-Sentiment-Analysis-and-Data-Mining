{"text": "FOR ALL MY LIFE I HAVE WORN LEVI JEANS UNTIL I PURCHASED THESE MADE BY IZOD. THEY ARE LESS EXPENSIVE AND MADE BETTER THAN LEVI 505'S. (AS WELL AS MORE COMFORTABLE AND NICER LOOKING). I OWN SEVERAL PAIR OF IZODS AND WEAR THEM FOR DRESS DOWN DAYS AT WORK AND TO CASUAL EVENTS AND I RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE THAT WEARS LEVIS. IT MAY JUST BE ME, BUT IN THE PAST FEW YEARS LEVI JEANS ONLY LAST A COUPLE OF YEARS OR EVEN LESS. I AM IN MY FORTY'S, AND WHEN I WAS YOUNGER A PAIR OF LEVIS WOULD LAST ME FOR 4 OR 5 YEARS WITHOUT TEARING OR FALLING APART. THE IZODS SEEM TO BE MADE BETTER THAN THE \"NEW\" LEVIS... ALSO THEY DO NOT SHRINK AND TRUE TO SIZE.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.38943726", "2": "0.06114949", "3": "0.09214199", "5": "0.18790928", "6": "0.2645865"}}
