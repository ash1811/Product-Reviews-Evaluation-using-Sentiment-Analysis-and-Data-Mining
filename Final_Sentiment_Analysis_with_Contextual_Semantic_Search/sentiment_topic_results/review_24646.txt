{"text": "I am so glad I ordered 2 sizes (4-6 and 6-8) and didn't just assume it runs small like other reviews said. It doesn't run small, it runs true to size for a leotard if you use the measurements. My daughter is a size 5-6 (6 mostly for length only, they are huge on her waist, she is tall and skinny) the size 4-6 fit her perfectly. Her girth was 42. I bought the next size up, since that has a girth of 43, just in case other reviews where right, and it was too big in her butt and under her arms and her shoulders. It had a \"wing\" of extra material under her arm and the butt area was loose (giving her a wedgie went she bent over) If you buy the size measured correctly, the butt stays in place.I like the material, it is nice and smooth, not rough like I remember my old leotards being. I wish it was more cotton, but this is nice and has a nice finished look. Her ballet class requires blue, and I couldn't find blue in any store near us, especially in long sleeved, without having to special order it. This was far cheaper and came faster. And I can return the too big one for free.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14870879", "1": "0.22291361", "2": "0.13245614", "3": "0.32585993", "4": "0.098939545", "6": "0.06864686"}}
