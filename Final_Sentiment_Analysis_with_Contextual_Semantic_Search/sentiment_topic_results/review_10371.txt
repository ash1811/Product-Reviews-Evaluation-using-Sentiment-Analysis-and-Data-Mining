{"text": "I am normally a big fan of the UGGs product but this one didnt work. I bought this one for my mother for a Christmas gift but she said the soles of these slippers are too flat and gives her a leg ache. I have a pair of Ugg slippers but they are thicker soles. When I tried on hers, she was right that they didn't feel as comfortable. We ended up returning them. I would recommend the same design with thicker soles.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15962616", "1": "0.51030195", "3": "0.19645496", "5": "0.04396939", "6": "0.08228266"}}
