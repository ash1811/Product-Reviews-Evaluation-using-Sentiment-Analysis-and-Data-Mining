{"text": "I hate spending a lot of money on shoes,  because my son seems to grow out of them every 4 months.  So I can't really comment on how they wear,  because he never has them for long,  but these look just as described,  are comfortable and he's happy with them.  They are styllish enough for formal events but he can wear them to the movies as well (though he considers them too good for school) and the price was reasonable,  so I was happy too.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06526314", "1": "0.29016146", "2": "0.118573666", "3": "0.19060472", "4": "0.16927332", "5": "0.16245347"}}
