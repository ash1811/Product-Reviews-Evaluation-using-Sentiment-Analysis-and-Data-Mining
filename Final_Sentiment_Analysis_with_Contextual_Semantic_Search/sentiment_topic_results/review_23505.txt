{"text": "I bought this watch for my father in law this past christmas. It looks great on the wrist and he loves it. even with not wearing it for a day it still keeps time. He especially enjoyed the jeweler where he took it to be sized telling him it was the nicest watch he had seen come in in a month. Some may complain about Invicta on here, but I have bought 4 of them, including gifts to others, all of them flawless...Invicta is the working mans Rolex and allows those of us on a tight budget to still enjoy collecting nice watches.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.19827548", "1": "0.27613804", "2": "0.2412017", "4": "0.11883828", "5": "0.11395602", "6": "0.04882795"}}
