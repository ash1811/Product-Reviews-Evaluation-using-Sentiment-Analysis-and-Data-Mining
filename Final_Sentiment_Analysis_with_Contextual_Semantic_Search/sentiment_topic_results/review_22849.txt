{"text": "These boots are awesome. Read many reviews prior to purchase and they were right on the mark about the comfort of these &#34;babys&#34;. The round toe box is excellent, being roomy enough for thick socks.  There seems to be very good arch support and stability as well.  Wore them out of the box for 9 hours and no complaints. I like the look of the newer sole design...(missing the heavy lugs). They are not as &#34;work boot&#34; looking that allows them to be more dressy/casual and not track half of the yard into the house! They are a little chunky in design, but cute and what do you expect from a boot called &#34;fatbaby&#34;! Would highly recommend these boots.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.049673278", "1": "0.29548845", "2": "0.10503789", "3": "0.16824558", "4": "0.12750801", "5": "0.18199837", "6": "0.07204839"}}
