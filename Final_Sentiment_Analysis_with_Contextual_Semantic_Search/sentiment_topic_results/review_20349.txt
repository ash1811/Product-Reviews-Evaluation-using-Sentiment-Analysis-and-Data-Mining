{"text": "These tanks are great!  They are a little pricey but they are great quality, nice and thick. . . I love to wear them as an under shirt, I don't think it would work well as a stand alone tank outside of the house. . . or atleast it doesn't work for me and my cleavage.  But I love this tank, and plan on ordering more.  I love the hooks too, they are easy to get on and off and work well for nursing.  I was even able to wear the tank during my last trimester, so the tank works pre and post partum.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0425142", "1": "0.14380239", "2": "0.03432832", "3": "0.24420114", "4": "0.04408304", "5": "0.2837976", "6": "0.2072733"}}
