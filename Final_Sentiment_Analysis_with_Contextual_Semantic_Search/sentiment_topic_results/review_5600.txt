{"text": "These are good sleeping shorts (not for the gym!) in Oxford Gray.  I have a 36\" waist, but I order these in XXL! They still fit well and are very comfortable for sleeping and lounging around the house. I like them over boxers/pajama sleeping shorts (hate the front drawstrings on pajama shorts), because I could go outside to mailbox, etc.  Also no opening in front, so no accidently flashing someone!  The more you wash the softer, they get too.  Also, here is another good brand I use for sleeping shorts in black (they are a little heavier and have pockets) >Soffe Men's Classic Cotton Pocket Short", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21451972", "1": "0.21219769", "2": "0.06086506", "3": "0.21458298", "4": "0.047612336", "5": "0.11420906", "6": "0.13601317"}}
