{"text": "I've been wearing this particular model work bib for well over three years now and have been nothing short of satisfied. They are extremely durable, and even more comfortable.I would recommend these bibs to anyone who is sick and tired of having to constantly pull their pants up at work. To me, they are much more versatile than the lined versions, as I buy them a size big and add long underwear in cold weather. You really can't go wrong with these.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15451014", "1": "0.32374972", "2": "0.0965495", "3": "0.2134516", "5": "0.11335613", "6": "0.09519963"}}
