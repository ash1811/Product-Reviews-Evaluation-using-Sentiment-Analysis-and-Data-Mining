{"text": "I bought these for my son's scout campout where they went caving. The caves they were exploring had water wells that they had to walk through and my son said these pants were comfortable even wet. They dried quickly and were comfortable the entire caving tour. He asked for a couple more pair in different colors. He also had enough storage in the pants to keeps waterproof bags of items in them. They wash well & seem very sturdy. The boys that wore jeans are now asking for bdu's for future events. These pants run true to size and my ex-Marine hubby said they seem well constructed. We will be getting more for our son AND a couple pair for my husband.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10775769", "1": "0.3678224", "2": "0.16328017", "3": "0.15067329", "4": "0.043086562", "5": "0.10242506", "6": "0.06495483"}}
