{"text": "I ordered this hat at the perfect time, during a very cold season this year. The hat is warm, looks good, and the sides can be turned down, to keep your ears warm. I usually wear L/XL, and I found this hat a little big, which really made no difference. The price was also reasonable, making this a very good buy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.088677324", "1": "0.43332902", "3": "0.2140723", "4": "0.12835555", "6": "0.12714528"}}
