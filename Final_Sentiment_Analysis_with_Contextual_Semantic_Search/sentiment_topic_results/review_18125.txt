{"text": "It is difficult to find a good, vegan walking shoe so I jumped on these when I saw them.  I didn't have high hopes.  I am very rough on shoes (brisk two mile walk with the dogs every day) and normally need a lot of padding and support (torn meniscus).  When these arrived I didn't expect there to be enough of either.  Wrong.  I can't say that I wear them every day but at least 4 times a week for walks and a few other times each week for general running around.  After ten months, these look like new and are still very comfortable.  My original pair is gray with orange (very cute) and I just ordered the navy.Update:  The blue and white shoes are nothing like my original pair!!  If you look closely at the pictures you will see the difference.  Instead of shoe laces, they have sewn in elastic.  And rather than sturdy construction, they are flimsy with no reinforced padding at the heel.  They would not be at all comfortable.  It appears that the beige/brown choice is the same.  These should not be sold along side the others.  Wish I could do a separate one star review on the blue.  These are going back.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.18952753", "2": "0.20715375", "3": "0.23185374", "5": "0.27242222", "6": "0.09447575"}}
