{"text": "Based on the original design of the very first Casio G Shock engineered back in 1983...  We have the royal king of all G Shocks...  The model 5600 Casio G Shock.  From Police officers, to firemen and women, soldiers, first responders, mechanics, explorers, and just good old fashioned hard working men and women...  We have all come to understand, demand, and depend on the Casio G Shock family of watches to take a massive beating right alongside us since 1983.  You simply can't go wrong buying this classic testament of a watch that can take a beating and keep on ticking.  Try doing a YouTube Search on all the stress tests that many have placed G Shocks under and you will be amazed.  You may never put your watch through the limits of abuse that it can take.  But the watch will certainly last you so long that it will become a part of you.  A part of who you are as a tough full of potential and dedication individual that can withstand the test of time.  Cheers Casio!!  Great job as always!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14128742", "1": "0.12831748", "2": "0.1536566", "3": "0.04540057", "4": "0.3095661", "5": "0.0919138", "6": "0.12985808"}}
