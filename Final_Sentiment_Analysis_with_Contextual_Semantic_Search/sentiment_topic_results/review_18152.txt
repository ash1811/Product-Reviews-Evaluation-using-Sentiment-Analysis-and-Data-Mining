{"text": "Laugh all you want but this is my favorite watch. I have about 15 watches ranging from $65 - $150. This watch is actually my favorite and it was $5-$8. I can take it swimming, wear it to the gym, the beach, i can mow the lawn with it, or i can wear it on a plane or a business trip. Its a casual looking watch, its SUPER thin, and seemingly weighs nothing. You wont even know it is there and the band does not pull on my arm hair.The battery also outlasted my other watches.Its a great watch and I would care less if It smashed into pieces, that's the beauty of it. Its cheap and its amazing, you could buy a few of them just in case you lose or break one.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.19715385", "1": "0.07530715", "2": "0.20104282", "3": "0.17324394", "4": "0.13239679", "5": "0.1268372", "6": "0.094018266"}}
