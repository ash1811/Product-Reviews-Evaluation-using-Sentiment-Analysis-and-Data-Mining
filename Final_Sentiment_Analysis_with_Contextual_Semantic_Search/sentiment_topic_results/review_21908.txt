{"text": "We moved into a house with mostly wood floors, and in the winter, they get COLD and regular socks just slip like crazy--and with a baby that I carry around all the time, slipping is NOT an option. I've tried many different type of grippy socks and slippers, and haven't loved any of them--the gripper dots usually come off within one or two washings or trips around the house. So when someone recommended these yoga socks, I had to give them a try.Unfortunately, I don't really like them. The grippy knobs are nice--they've stayed on through a few washings already and they're small enough that you can't feel them when walking on them (a problem with some other grippy socks). But the actual toe part of the socks? Egads. It's hard to get your toes in the holes and takes some finessing (something I don't feel you should have to do with something as basic as socks). Then, once you have them on, the socks feel SO thick they are almost uncomfortable (I now know I can't stand to have things between my toes).As far as sizing, I wear a 10-11 and I ordered the Large and they fit just right. They do help with not slipping on the wood floors, but the irritation they cause when wearing them push them to the back of my drawer.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11194221", "1": "0.23528591", "2": "0.057843715", "3": "0.19822267", "4": "0.1328776", "5": "0.23221117", "6": "0.03161668"}}
