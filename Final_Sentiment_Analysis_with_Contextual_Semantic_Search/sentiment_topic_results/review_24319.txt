{"text": "I recommend this style (opaque) for colors and style 5700 for nude panythose.  These are slightly thicker and softer and feel like tights that you'd wear in the winter (though as with almost all tights, they're not actually warm).  Very high quality for the price and fit well.  Maternity tights are a must, MUCH more comfortable than when you have that elastic line under your bellybutton from your old pantyhose.The seller is very good, there was a mixup with colors and they sent me a replacement right away free of charge.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11950058", "1": "0.3452288", "2": "0.09339081", "3": "0.123977266", "4": "0.07997463", "5": "0.19303934", "6": "0.044888556"}}
