{"text": "Other reviewers have remarked that these run small. When you first put them on, yes, they run small, but stretch out in no time. Get a size smaller, if even by a half.  Very comfy and cushy.  I haven't washed mine, yet, but I hear it shouldn't be an issue.  I love that the bottoms are pretty sturdy, so once in a while, I can walk out my door with them to grab something from the car. Highly recommended and not too dorky.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09686532", "1": "0.21803875", "2": "0.1354164", "3": "0.21453542", "5": "0.29342055", "6": "0.037947994"}}
