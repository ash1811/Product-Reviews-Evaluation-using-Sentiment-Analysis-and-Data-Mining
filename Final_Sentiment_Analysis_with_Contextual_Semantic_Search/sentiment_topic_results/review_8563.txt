{"text": "I did buy another pair on here that I have reviewed because these Reeboks are hard to find anymore in stores.  ANYWAY, I buy a pair of these every 12-18 months and keep the old ones for gardening, etc.  I wear them 18 hours a day and wash them in the washing machine and let them air dry near heating vent.  They last and last and the sole has just enough soft support that it is like wearing slippers from day 1 until I am walking with holes in the bottom as I mow the lawn.  A++++  Great value in casual shoes!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10906978", "1": "0.22258194", "2": "0.11114876", "3": "0.04338035", "4": "0.16016603", "5": "0.24454837", "6": "0.109104775"}}
