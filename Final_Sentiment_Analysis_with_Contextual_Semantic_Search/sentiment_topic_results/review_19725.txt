{"text": "I needed a watch for running and didn't know where to start. I've always been a Timex fan since my youth and decided to check them out. I liked this watch and decided to go for it. It's only 15.00.It looks great and you cannot even feel it on your arm while running. It keeps great time and the functions/features are easy to understand and use. I use the stopwatch feature to time my runs and everything has worked out great so far. You can \"freeze\" your time at a particular spot in your run, so you can take the time to look at it and evaluate your pace, but the actual stopwatch is still running in the background, so you just click back over and keep on goin'.It has two time zone features and the stop watch, both of which come in handy. The light works very well and cuts off automatically after a short while.It's the best 15.00 I've ever spent, no need to pay 60.00 for a simple watch to run with. I'm sure I'll upgrade one day to a GPS watch with all the bells and whistles but this one is great. I even find myself wearing it to work during the week.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14746684", "1": "0.13802205", "2": "0.12254302", "3": "0.13538545", "4": "0.14431833", "5": "0.16884631", "6": "0.14341804"}}
