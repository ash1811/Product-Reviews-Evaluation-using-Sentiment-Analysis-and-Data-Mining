{"text": "I liked these at first as they were inexpensive, fit well, are comfortable, and are thick enough to look and feel substantial.  Unfortunately, after about 5 or 6 hourlong rides and two washes, tiny holes developed along and next to the seams in the seat.  I have to throw these out since the holes will only get worse with wear or washes and since they're not repairable due to the fabric and fit of the tights.  I have a 25\" waist and my tights were slightly large in a size 26\", so the issue was not that they were too small. Just a lack of quality, I guess.  I'm disappointed and am returning the second pair I bought.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.027927175", "1": "0.23737246", "2": "0.12886718", "3": "0.111483894", "4": "0.09669028", "5": "0.26558837", "6": "0.1320706"}}
