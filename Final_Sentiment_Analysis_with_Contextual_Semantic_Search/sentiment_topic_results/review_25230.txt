{"text": "Superfeet were recommended by a podiatrist and they don't disappoint. The price on Amazon is consistent with the pricing at running shoe stores in our area. They are spendy but worth it. They helped my plantar fasciitis and extended the life of shoes that are loved but over-worn. The only drawback is that they aren't interchangeable between shoes.
