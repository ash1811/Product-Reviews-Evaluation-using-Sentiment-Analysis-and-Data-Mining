{"text": "It's a Casio, so it should hold up well (til the battery goes out, then sometimes it is almost cheaper to buy another one).  This one is somewhat different in appearance than my others; yes it is a chrome silver with a cheap wristband, and, yes, the buttons are in the same place as all the other Casios I have purchased (they usually last me a couple of years); the difference is in the more rectangular appearance of the face of the unit.  My other units are somewhat more square (but rounded of course), and to me they are slightly more attractive.  Other than the slight aesthetic differences  this watch appears to have the same &#34;guts&#34; as my others.  It is relatively easy to set the watch to the right time, to use the timer, and to set the alarm should you so choose (same as all the others). It is a good watch for the money.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09226272", "1": "0.19677912", "2": "0.31210524", "3": "0.06233417", "5": "0.22329278", "6": "0.11062379"}}
