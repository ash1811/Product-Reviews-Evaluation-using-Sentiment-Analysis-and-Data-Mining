{"text": "The words \"comfortable\" and \"bra\" cannot possibly go together, can they?I think most women just 'hope' for the least negative-ness; the least of the evils, along with something flattering, hopefully, and at the same time not look like a School Marm or Attila the Hun in some sort of breast plate!I needed a new bra, and I-do-not-shop. Even in the best of moods, I am certainly not going to go out to the stores and try on bras - not unless I WANT to deliberately ruin my day and have every last nerve jangled with the sounds of screaming kids, phones ringing and doors to dressing rooms slamming to make the experience even more enjoyable.Naw..I'll take my chances on guessing my size and 'trying on' the reviews.I saw an informercial for the \"Genie Bra\" and that began my search online. What started as a search for that particular bra and it's reviews (which were not good) ended up with me just looking at bras in general. As I am about to be putting in 15 hour days again, I knew I had to do something quick to survive the 'bondage' - LOL.Then I found this bra and the reviews were great! So, I thought I'd try. Wow. My guess was a good one and it fits per-fect-ly.I absolutely love it. I can honestly say I've never had a more comfortable bra, better fit, more natural look, comfortable support, and the back closure is ingenious - so soft.I even kept mine on all the way up until bedtime and that's very rare! Usually, it's the first thing I RIP off when I get home!So, I sent my sisters the Amazon link to it, and one of them responded \"I'm ahead of you on this one - been wearin' it for four years now!\".Note: After wearing it for a few weeks now, I can honestly say I've never been more comfortable in a bra, ever, and I wish I had ordered several more. So, if you do order it, I definitely recommend you order a few and save.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1758803", "1": "0.12888192", "2": "0.25597847", "3": "0.1690853", "4": "0.0693603", "5": "0.09767004", "6": "0.10314371"}}
