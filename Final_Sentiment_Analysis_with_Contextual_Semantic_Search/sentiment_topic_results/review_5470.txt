{"text": "Don't get me wrong, Fruit of the Loom makes good t-shirts. I bought some undershirt Ts and they were great, and ALL COTTON. These are advertized as \"100% cotton.\" Last I checked, that meant ALL cotton, nothing else. These are, according to the label on the shirts themselves, \"90% cotton, 10% polyester.\" I specifically do not want any polyester in a cotton t-shirt. While it makes them more durable, it also makes them warmer. One wears t-shirts when? In warm to hot weather, when one does not need something warmer.Any seller that falsely advertises their products should not be in business, period, and does not deserve yours.Fruit of the Loom's website states that the material content of the shirts may vary with color, though they do not provide information on what color is what composition. At least they warn you that not all the shirts are all cotton.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1258536", "1": "0.21430926", "2": "0.121064045", "3": "0.19182901", "4": "0.15548296", "5": "0.08982283", "6": "0.101638265"}}
