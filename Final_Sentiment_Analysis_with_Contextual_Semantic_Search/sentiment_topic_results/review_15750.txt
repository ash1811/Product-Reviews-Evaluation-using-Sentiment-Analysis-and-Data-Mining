{"text": "I was so pleased to find these slipperson Amazon in lilac and in my size (8.5 medium). But, before they could be shipped Amazon ran out of this size. I searched all over the web, including the Daniel Green site and learned that the lilac has been discontinued and Amazon seems to be the only site that still carries them. I ended up ordering the 9 narrow which proved too narrow. They were not available in a 9 medium so I ordered and received the 9 wide. As of today, these are no longer avalable so I'm glad I got them in time. These are great slippers, exactly what I wanted, lilac, terry cloth & cozy & washable and good for warmer months. The size 9 wides are a bit too large when I wear them barefoot but they are adjustable which helps and with socks they are fine. I wish I could have gotten these in my size but I am glad to have gotten them at all. If you want great lilac spa style slippers go quick to Amazon & see if they have your size. If you don't mind pink, white or blue you can get those in pretty much any size. I do recommend them highly.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.060844894", "1": "0.15642416", "2": "0.08861468", "3": "0.15658717", "4": "0.17720664", "5": "0.21246691", "6": "0.14785558"}}
