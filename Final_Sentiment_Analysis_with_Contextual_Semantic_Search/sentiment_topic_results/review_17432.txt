{"text": "Let me be clear; i'm a 2m guy, having no problems to wear american XL sizes.  Own a Champion 1780 XL Sweat Ash and 3 other colors XL's too, i like and use Ash so much that i ordered one more, at under moments.  To order only one more was the only luck at this purchase. Got a clear oversized like-item as i compared the size and the (at this item) very weak unelastic head opening. This is like a sloppy copy, additional the weak fit on the shoulders is not usable or look acceptable and cuffs are to turn out. To control if the manufacturer had made a hidden upsizing i ordered from another seller deal rack a same style L size sweat and did'nt got my accustomated XL cause i got an accurate L size which i can't wear like this oversized too. For living in Germany return is impossible i avoid the first mentioned seller furthermore.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.079717726", "1": "0.19197825", "2": "0.28214094", "3": "0.20338699", "4": "0.054761216", "6": "0.18587752"}}
