{"text": "I love this sweatshirt.  The midweight fabric is just right for moderate activity on cooler days in Fall (or in Winter for me, but then I overheat very easily).  The LT fits me well at 6'2\" 180#.  I only wish Carhartt made a MT size - I wouldn't mind it being a little more fitted.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04070392", "1": "0.5134786", "3": "0.16672127", "4": "0.115183935", "5": "0.15403788"}}
