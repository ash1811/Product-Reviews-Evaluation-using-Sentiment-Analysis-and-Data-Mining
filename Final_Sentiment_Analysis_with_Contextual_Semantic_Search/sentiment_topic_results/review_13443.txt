{"text": "I usually wear a 7.5 or 8 medium, ordered the 8 and it fit perfectly.  It holds on my heel enough to walk like a shoe and stays on my foot.  It is extremely comfortable and works well when I am going to be on my feet alot walking around on tours.  I have worn with both with light socks and without socks and it still hugs my heel.  I am very happy with this purchase and recommend the shoe.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.44608545", "2": "0.111388095", "3": "0.07241028", "4": "0.10630302", "5": "0.22321941", "6": "0.037013054"}}
