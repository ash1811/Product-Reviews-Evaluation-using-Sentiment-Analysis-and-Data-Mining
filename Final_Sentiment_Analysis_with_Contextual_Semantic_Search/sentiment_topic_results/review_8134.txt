{"text": "I really like these flip flops.  They have great support, they conform to the wearers foot.  I also like the Teva Mush.  But the Reef's are much longer lasting.  The fit is good, I like that one doesn't have to break them in.  They fit great from the 1st wear.  Love them!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.38938996", "2": "0.11562049", "3": "0.15252557", "4": "0.106044464", "5": "0.22687197"}}
