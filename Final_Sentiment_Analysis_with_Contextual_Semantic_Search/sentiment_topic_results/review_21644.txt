{"text": "I wanted this bag 2 years ago and never bought it. I saw it once again on amazon and am glad I bought it. Looks professional enough for the hospital with enough character to make you stand out. It is tiny which I like- could probably fit two first aid books for a size visual. I have only had it 2 months so I can't comment on the quality of the leather straps which shut the bag however the bag itself is durable. I really really love this bag. FYI: no pockets on the inside.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.24809378", "1": "0.30156407", "2": "0.10254132", "3": "0.15143354", "4": "0.12250509", "6": "0.071157016"}}
