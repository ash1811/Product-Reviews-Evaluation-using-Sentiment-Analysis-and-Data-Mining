{"text": "If you are looking for a robe to wear while doing your hair and makeup, look no further.  This is a soft, silky, lightweight robe that's comfortable under a hair dryer.It's full length on me, 5'1\" with a petite frame, maybe a littlle longer than I like, and the cut appears to be full.  I usually buy a Small instead of an X-Small because I like things a little loose, but this is a little looser than I prefer.  My next one will be an X-Small.It came from the washer/dryer unshrunken and unwrinkled.  It's a good travel weight in that it takes up very little room when folded or rolled.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.29716748", "1": "0.3909367", "2": "0.07014225", "3": "0.054564945", "4": "0.018937996", "5": "0.041473124", "6": "0.12677751"}}
