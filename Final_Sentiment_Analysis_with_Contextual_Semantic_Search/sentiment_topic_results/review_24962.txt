{"text": "I was told to get orthotics, so I did.  They just about crippled me...ugh.  My massage therapist recommended these and she hit the nail on the head.  They are firm enough, but not so hard as to feel like you have no circulation in your feet, like the orthotics.  Flexable enough in the toe area to be able to mold to your foot.  I'm going to buy more of these for sure.  What else can you say about an arch support??", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.21590365", "1": "0.20244583", "2": "0.097133785", "3": "0.14922671", "4": "0.12014643", "5": "0.04494644", "6": "0.17019714"}}
