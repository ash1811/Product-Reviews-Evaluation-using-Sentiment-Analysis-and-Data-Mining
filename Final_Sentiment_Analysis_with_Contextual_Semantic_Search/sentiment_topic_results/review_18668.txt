{"text": "Got these for my son, as he is a fan of Daniel Tiger, and I thought they could match.  He has had them for 6 months, and has worn them constantly - they are still in great shape, and he gets really good traction.  He climbs a lot and runs, and is very confident in these shoes. It appears he gets good support too, so he looks forward to wearing them.  Great product.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06640352", "1": "0.33996573", "2": "0.14523545", "3": "0.32652658", "5": "0.07081726", "6": "0.047067992"}}
