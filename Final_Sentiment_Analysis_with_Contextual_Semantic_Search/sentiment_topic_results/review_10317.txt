{"text": "I tried a ton of shoes to find a lightweight one with support, wide sizing, and stiff sole. This one fits the bill. I would like more support from this shoe, but it is the only one I tried that offers all the things I need and that fits my foot. I'd say these run  a bit small- I usually wear 13, but the 14 fits me.  I have tried shoes I like better (oboz firebrand II), but they didn't fit quite right and don't come in a Wide size, so I ended up with these.If you need a lot of cushion or arch support these may not work for you.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09209441", "1": "0.31243798", "2": "0.1773643", "3": "0.19530478", "5": "0.1137818", "6": "0.10662729"}}
