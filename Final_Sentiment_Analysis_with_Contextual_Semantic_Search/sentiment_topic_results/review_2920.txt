{"text": "I am not a watch wearer, but my dad bought me this watch and I absolutely love it.  It is more beautiful in person than one can appreciate online.  My wrist is small.  The jeweler removed six links and now it looks made for my wrist.  It's elegant and not too large.  It fits comfortably and it's easy to latch and unlatch.  I like the date feature, because I can never remember the date.  It's lovely.  I wear it every day.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2210869", "2": "0.15159205", "3": "0.08341382", "4": "0.26270565", "5": "0.23328426", "6": "0.044336326"}}
