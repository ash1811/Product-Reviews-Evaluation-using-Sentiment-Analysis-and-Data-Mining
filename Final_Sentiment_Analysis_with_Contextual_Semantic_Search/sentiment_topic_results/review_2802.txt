{"text": "I wasn't looking for a good walking shoe, just a specific look;  (surprisingly hard to find simple plain blue sneakers).  Since newer reviews seemed generally positive, I thought I would take a shot.  Unfortunately, these aren't acceptable even for light use.  Very tight and feel like cardboard.  Note:  I purchased the navy.  The description says \"soft terry lining\" which these don't have.  BUT if you look at the different colors shown you will see that some colors DO have a terry lining (red for example) while others (navy, black, denim) clearly don't.  I am assuming that the positive reviews are for those colors constructed as described.  Sending these back.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.26258972", "1": "0.25498015", "2": "0.06702373", "3": "0.10481603", "4": "0.057737965", "5": "0.04272808", "6": "0.21012436"}}
