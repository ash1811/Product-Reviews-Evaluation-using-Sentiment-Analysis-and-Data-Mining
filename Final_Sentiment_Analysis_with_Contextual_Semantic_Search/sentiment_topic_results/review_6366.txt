{"text": "Spent more on these shoes than I generally like to spend, but I am happy with the purchase. This is a shoe you can dress up or down, skirts or slacks, nice heel but comfortable. I bought a half size up and put a comfort liner from the drugstore inside and they fit perfectly, comfortable for long walking or standing. A very simple and elegant shoe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.051381227", "1": "0.35472202", "2": "0.17999896", "5": "0.11254368", "6": "0.29263583"}}
