{"text": "I was debating between a 1 and 2 star rating.  These Jockey briefs are good quality, but Jockey has a sizing problem between sizes 7 and 8.  I first ordered 3 size 8s and they are somewhat large so went back on Amazon, checked the sizing charts then ordered 3 size 7s.  There is at least 2 or more inches difference in the width of these two sizes and the 7 is more than an inch shorter.  I can't complain about the quality of Jockey, but sizing is a totally separate issue.  The size 7s will be donated to Goodwill ASAP.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.2348576", "1": "0.28615704", "2": "0.1352996", "3": "0.22227028", "4": "0.07627034", "6": "0.04257276"}}
