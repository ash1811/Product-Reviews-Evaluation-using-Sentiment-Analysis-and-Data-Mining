{"text": "I bought this style in a dark teal color two years ago, and it was one of the most comfortable bras I've ever owned.It runs true to size, doesn't dig in, and creates a smooth/no-show line under T-shirts and knits.It also doesn't stretch out after repeated wearing.Also, here are some tips that I picked up from my sister-in-law, who worked in the Nordstrom lingerie department for over ten years.  Don't wear the same bra two days in a row and usingForever New Fabric Care Wash 32 oz.to wash your bras. (Woolite will cause the fibers in elastic to wear down, but Forever New doesn't do that.) I wash mine on delicate in a lingerie bag and lay them flat to dry, and they last at least two years before they start stretching out.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.069841176", "1": "0.30467087", "2": "0.06065591", "3": "0.19748218", "4": "0.16155584", "5": "0.12565637", "6": "0.08013769"}}
