{"text": "It's Carhart, dudes. It is made sturdy and looks awesome. The design and material gives good protection from the elements with the adjustable cuffs, draw string hood, with a neck/chin protector flap and invisible central snap/zipper closure. It's a trim design so no bulky material flapping in the wind. Looks too good to just use for biking.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22473298", "1": "0.2466058", "2": "0.39830014", "5": "0.084647626", "6": "0.037510876"}}
