{"text": "I purchased this for my youngest granddaughter. I had one of these with the ballerina when I was a child and thought she would love it, which she did. She continually opens the box to see the ballerina turn and the music play. I also purchased a necklace for her which she securely places in this jewelry box. This was a great choice.  Shipping was quick and received it very quickly. Packaging was good and there were no problems with the shipping box or the jewelry box.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04805977", "1": "0.33691162", "2": "0.08413279", "3": "0.10704543", "4": "0.27018908", "5": "0.0413179", "6": "0.112343445"}}
