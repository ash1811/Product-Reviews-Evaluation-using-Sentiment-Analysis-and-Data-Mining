{"text": "Amazon - SCREW U for recommending this piece of s***. This was an Amazon add-on. Explanation: You cannot buy this alone; this item can be purchased for like $4 only when you already have some other stuff in your cart.I needed a bandanna because i sweat like a man when i'm working on my sick kung fu skills. This bandanna, forever referred to now as piece o' s***, came in the mail separately from the other item i purchased which doesn't make sense when you can only buy this as part of another purchase.I broke this POS out of the package it came in and it almost cut me it was so hard. I punched it until it softened up and then when i tried to put this guy on i realized that amazon had mistakenly sent me the BABY SIZE. seriously this thing won't fit anyone.
