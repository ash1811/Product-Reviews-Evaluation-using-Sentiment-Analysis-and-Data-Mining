{"text": "I followed others' advice and sized up (two band sizes, since I vary by brand).  This bra still barely fit on the last hook.  And, it was so scratchy and uncomfortable.  It feels like it was knitted from fishing line.I bought these as a possible daily wear bra, but the \"v\" came up almost to my collarbone, even with the straps let out and the band pulled down.  Unless I wear a turtle neck or crew neck the bra would show.I'm giving it three stars, since it probably would hold everything in place for working out, if I could stand to have it on that long.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16161887", "1": "0.20220283", "2": "0.13565934", "3": "0.30492225", "4": "0.031436034", "5": "0.050625242", "6": "0.11353544"}}
