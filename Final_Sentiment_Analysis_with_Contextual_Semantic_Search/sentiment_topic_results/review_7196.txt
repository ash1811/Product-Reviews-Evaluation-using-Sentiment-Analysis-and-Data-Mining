{"text": "I just bought the 3rd pair of bates side zip 8 inch boots. They first of all look neat and can be worn as a professional dress black shoe,I was a security guard and these did just fine, they kept a shine.But I walk alot and I want a shoe that is all round rugged. The stitching and construction of the uppers is just fine, never had a problem with the first 2 pairs of Bates that way, I got about 1 year of good wear out of each pair of Bates side zip boots. I hike many miles and walk plenty on concrete. That brings me to the reason I do not give the boots a  5 star perfect, yes these boots have that utilitarian classic style of tactical boot but the soles wear waaaaaay to easy. Also since the price was right I ordered another pair of Bates this time the SageGreen 8 inch Sidezips. Green soles and a light almost grey suede.For me these wearing these boots=no foot pain.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06945021", "1": "0.2736102", "2": "0.14791933", "3": "0.11556968", "4": "0.25792208", "6": "0.13325557"}}
