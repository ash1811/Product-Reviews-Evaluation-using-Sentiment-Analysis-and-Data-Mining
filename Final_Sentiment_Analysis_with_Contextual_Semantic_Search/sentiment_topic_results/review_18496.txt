{"text": "This is my second pair of \"Whiskers\" sunglasses from Oakley.  My first pair gave me 4 years of year round, hard usage, had been sent back for a bent frame (my fault) once and several pairs of new lenses.  Finally lost the original pair in the Atlantic Ocean ......  I ordered these from Amazon after calling and consulting with Oakley directly.  I was advised by the salesperson @ Oakley that as long as the Whiskers were \"fulfilled by Amazon\" (and \"not some mom & pop store\") that they should be legit.  So, I went ahead and ordered them.  Upon arrival, I too found that the inside temple was marked \"CHINA\".  So, again I called Oakley.  I was advised by the salesperson @ Oakley that they do indeed have some of their products made outside of the USA, and Whiskers are made in China.  He stated that it was a misconception that all Oakley products are USA made. I was able to register my Whiskers on Oakley.com, and now the warranty is extended to 2 years.Going back to the sunglasses themselves, these are a low profile pair of sunglasses.  They sit close to the face with a slight \"wrap\" design to the lenses, allowing for a close fit, decreasing sun \"leaking\" in around the edges.  I purchased the black frames with the black \"iridium\" lenses.  I personally do not like polarized lenses because of the effect polarization has on the true color of things (especially the blue/green spectrum - seems to make things appear unnaturally bright to me, and definitely changes the color saturation).  So, since I prefer a very dark lens which does NOT alter the reality of the colors in nature, these are perfect for me.  These lenses are great for anywhere where light reflection/glare is an issue (water, snow, etc.).  I get headaches from too much glare, and these glasses with the iridium lenses never let me down.  I find them very comfortable, allowing me to wear them for many hours at a time.  The only \"negative\" might be, that I personally would not wear these for any kind of sport; while they have high quality, impact resistant lenses, the frames are not designed to take a beating.  As a parting comment, I am a woman, and I prefer the style of these glasses over the huge, \"Jackie O\", rhinestone encrusted style sunglasses that are so common for women.  These fit my angular face very well, and they fit like a glove, never slipping off of my nose.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.20896907", "1": "0.08099809", "2": "0.17085771", "3": "0.2834183", "4": "0.09896635", "5": "0.035744812", "6": "0.1210457"}}
