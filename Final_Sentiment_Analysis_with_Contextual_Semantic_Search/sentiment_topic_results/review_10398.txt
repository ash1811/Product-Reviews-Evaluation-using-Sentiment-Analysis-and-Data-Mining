{"text": "Did not get these from Amazon but found out that Amazon has the most colors of Ugg boots and slippers than any other company.  I always search different outlets for sales on the Uggs that I want to purchase.  I already found slippers and boots for all my children and grandchildren for next Christmas.  Am so delighted with Ugg and the Pineneedle is an amazing color of forest green. I already have a great collection of colors and styles of Ugg.  I only order the Classic Short or Bailey Button in the boots but have about 5 styles of slippers in Ugg.  The Classic Short is my favorite.  Also, the older boots ran about a size larger but now run true to size.  Walmart has three types of silicon spray for abut $8 and before I wear them; I spray with the strongest spray to waterproof and also preserve the color.  Thanks for looking at my review! I'm an Ugg Aholic!  Amd I'm going broke buying them!  Thanks for looking! p.s. the silicon spray never changes the color!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13403454", "1": "0.15582162", "2": "0.15268447", "3": "0.0778294", "4": "0.29489434", "5": "0.04792126", "6": "0.13681439"}}
