{"text": "My 11-year old daughter is 5' 2&#34; and weighs 103 lbs.  She's straight as a board and doesn't have much of a butt.  However, these size 4 fit her very well.  I was concerned, since I ordered online and couldn't hold them up to put my eyes on them before I bought them.  She really likes the prints and when she tried them on she said they felt more like a bathing suit bottom.  That's good, since bathing suits need to fit your body kind of tight.  They're Jockey, so they're made of great quality!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19607064", "1": "0.2483044", "2": "0.13053048", "3": "0.06531417", "5": "0.246889", "6": "0.1101831"}}
