{"text": "I bought two of these for our recent trip to Europe.  They were comfortable to wear and the compartments are the perfect size.  After a month of basic use, however, both wallets began to show some minor wear and tear.  Small holes developed in the two lower compartments (where the corner of the credit cards stowed in the compartment rubbed against the fabric).  They are still usable but I am a bit disappointed by the quality of the fabric.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.057142664", "1": "0.17149392", "2": "0.45363963", "3": "0.12729886", "4": "0.062897205", "5": "0.09041702", "6": "0.037110683"}}
