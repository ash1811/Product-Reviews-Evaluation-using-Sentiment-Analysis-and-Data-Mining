{"text": "My usual 34b fits in this bra. Can wear it all day long while working and forget that it's there.  (not literally, not as good as braless for me). I've had it over a year now and it's still holding up. The only con would be that the foam padding has become slightly dimpled after washing and yes I throw it in the washing machine and hang dry it. I've occasionlly forgot it in the dryer. The dimpling doesn't show through your shirt though so no big deal. Soft material, gentle straps that don't dig in. Overall I would purchase again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.033626843", "1": "0.26357648", "2": "0.0736851", "3": "0.23757078", "4": "0.16183662", "5": "0.12141199", "6": "0.10829218"}}
