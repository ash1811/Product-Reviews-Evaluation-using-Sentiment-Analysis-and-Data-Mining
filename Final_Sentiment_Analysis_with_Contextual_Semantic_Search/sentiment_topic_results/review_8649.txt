{"text": "The watch has been great. Good looking. Not oversized. Anti-Shock.Water-proof is not very good. Sometimes I find there is water inside the glass.The battery died after 3 years. It doesn't justify the use of solar power if it lasts this short, since ordinary watch would have lasted almost about the same time.Need to get a new one. Probably still G-Shock but not solar-powered.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.040883314", "1": "0.14571661", "2": "0.25761873", "3": "0.18346708", "4": "0.14737535", "5": "0.2210758"}}
