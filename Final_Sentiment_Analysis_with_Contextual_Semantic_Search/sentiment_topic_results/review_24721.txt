{"text": "No side pockets or inserts to get to my pants/shorts pockets.  I'm using these for golf.  Have been pounded three times in the past few months.  Am going to be better prepared now.  I have the jackets and they do a good job.  Have golf clubs in several locations so I have a jacket for each set.  Am not lugging extra luggage around.  These pants are included in my inventory now.  I expect nothing less than what I get from the jackets.  Am having some thoughts about getting the full side zip version but I think these will be fine.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11643081", "1": "0.19648169", "2": "0.1722681", "3": "0.09941899", "4": "0.06840215", "5": "0.17376167", "6": "0.17323664"}}
