{"text": "I wore these to my first Spartan Sprint race in Montana and they worked great.  I had never worn socks like this before, so they felt a little funny when I first put them on, but after a couple minutes I never noticed they were on.  I think they really helped my feel stay comfortable during the race, which included a ton of hills where my feet were slipping around in my shoes a little bit.  I would recommend these to other Spartan or obstacles course racers.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.30695018", "1": "0.15432046", "2": "0.108590566", "3": "0.053466436", "4": "0.09939435", "5": "0.15939727", "6": "0.11788071"}}
