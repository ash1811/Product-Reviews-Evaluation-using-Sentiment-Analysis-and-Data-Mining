{"text": "This is my 2nd pair of Minnetonka shoes.  The others were the tall fringed boots which fit perfectly in size 8.  These run slightly longer so I reordered  a size 7.  This works for me since the shoe stretches a little with wear.  All of the Minnetonka shoes and boots seem to run narrow so those keep that in mind  when ordering.  The pink is really pretty and I get compliments on them.  They have some padding and are pretty soft underfoot.  Great for knocking around.  I wish I could get all  the colors!!!  No hassle return and quick shipping got me set in no time.  Amazon is easy to work with.  We keep the UPS guys hopping at my house!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.4151716", "2": "0.109919496", "3": "0.11081625", "4": "0.20336837", "5": "0.07235654", "6": "0.08619421"}}
