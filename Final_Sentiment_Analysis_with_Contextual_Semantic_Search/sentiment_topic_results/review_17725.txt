{"text": "the purist cry that the original g-shock was metal and way better. it was tough but heavy. this newer one is lighter and yes, cheaper to make but still tough as nails. you don't see many broken ones.look at the price-for that money its hard to get a tougher,more functional watch, in my opinion. great lay-out, bright light (the light on the original stinks compared to this one),ect. this watch has been copied so many times,many may associate it with the cheap clones that resemble it. it may not cost much but it aint cheap.it has everything you need and nothing you dont. its a good dive watch and easy to use.i still love the original but this one is a very good timepiece.if people scoff at your \"cheap plastic watch\" just laugh at them like youre crazy. mean people leave crazy people alone. try it. it works!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1880236", "1": "0.10801328", "2": "0.20126656", "3": "0.1056108", "4": "0.1927125", "5": "0.060655504", "6": "0.14371774"}}
