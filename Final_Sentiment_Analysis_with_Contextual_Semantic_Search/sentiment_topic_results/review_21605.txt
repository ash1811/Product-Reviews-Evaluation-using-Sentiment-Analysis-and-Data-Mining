{"text": "I think these laces are great.  This is the second batch I bought and unfortunately I did not confirm the length so these are long enough for my running shoes but just long enough.  I would like to have a bit more lace so I probably should have purchased the 46 inch laces.  That being said I have had no trouble tying these laces and they have never even so much as loosened.  They have maybe 5 inches coming out of the top eye which as I said is more than enough to tie a knot but I just would like more.  Not a negative on the product as I chose the length and did not compare to my other laces. So they work and it is not that big a deal that I went and ordered the longer size.  My other pair that I bought a while ago is holding up well and so far shows no signs of wear so I think these laces are built to be used for a significant amount of time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12794466", "1": "0.22359437", "2": "0.08386843", "3": "0.2425038", "5": "0.2416368", "6": "0.07764251"}}
