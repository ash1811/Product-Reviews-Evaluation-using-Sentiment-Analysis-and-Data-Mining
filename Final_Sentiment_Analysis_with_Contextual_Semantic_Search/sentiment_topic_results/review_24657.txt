{"text": "Ok so I live in California in a beach town and wear sandals most of the year. I bought these as my last leather pair are falling apart.I usually wear a size 11 and don't think I have a particularly wide foot.The Size 11 were very tight in the straps and my heel was almost hanging off the back so I ordered the next size.12's came in and the length was ok but still very tight.Looking at this sandal and my last pair (which I thought was Reef) this one is way more narrow than my last pair.Decided these and the other pair of Reef's I got are going back and I am going to a retail to figure out which ones are wider", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.42389226", "2": "0.10211469", "4": "0.15801573", "5": "0.1816763", "6": "0.12935564"}}
