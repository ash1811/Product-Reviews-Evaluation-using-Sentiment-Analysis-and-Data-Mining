{"text": "This bag exceeds my expectations. I ordered it in black on Amazon primarily because of the pockets and their locations. When it arrived, I wondered if all my stuff would truly fit inside nicely. It most certainly did. Aside from the usual \"lady stuff\", I can also fit my leather-bound Kindle in it.
