{"text": "I love walking - my usual day begins with 4 miles or so and being outdoors is my natural tranquilizer. On occasion I walk more - and it might be on cobblestones, pavement, whatever. For a living I am a presenter - I am on my feet quite a lot. I developed plantar fasciitis - ouch! I tried several different solutions, but was recommended these by my health clinic perhaps 3 years ago. I was a bit skeptical by now - I had tried other things and it seemed counterintuitive a hard plastic aftsole would do much for me - not to mention these are not cheap!Soon enough, I was walking more comfortably and my fasciitis was diminishing rapidly. I now have Superfeet Greens in all my shoes from my Ecco and New Balance walking shoes to my Mephisto and Ecco traveling and presenting shoes. I can remember what plantar fasciitis felt like, but it's just a distant memory. I recommend these highly - and they are quite durable to boot. I do suggest looking over the various Superfeet products - it's not a one fits all product, and your feet might require a different Superfeet product.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12814148", "1": "0.30218986", "2": "0.10900484", "3": "0.0441189", "4": "0.23766537", "5": "0.11440091", "6": "0.06447869"}}
