{"text": "This bra is perfect.  I have the confidence to wear anything I want with this bra.  It works for everything from hiking and teaching preschool to evening wear.  It has great support, does not show under any of my clothing, and feels \"invisible\".  The stretch lace with no padding is hot-flash proof.  I have a hard time finding bras, especially unpadded bras, that fit in the middle of the cup area, but the stretch lace in this bra smooths over everything with no gapping or puckering.  I look smooth and natural, even in clingy knits, with this bra.  I have had several reconstructive surgeries and the underwire in most bras irritates the scars under my bustline. This underwire is well-cushioned with a soft, slightly napped material and I really don't know that it is there.I fasten the closures before washing this bra in a zippered lingerie bag on a regular cold water wash cycle and line dry.  I have had no problem after 6 months of regular wear and washing.This bra is even pretty!  I am replacing all of my bras with this one.UPDATE:  I still love the comfort of this bra.  However, the underwire poked through just after I wrote the review despite very careful laundering.  I sewed a piece of fleece fabric over the ends of the underwire casing and am back in business. In all other aspects, I am pleased with how well this bra has held up.  Even with this problem, I will buy more of these.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24538718", "1": "0.19529688", "2": "0.12693375", "3": "0.23453356", "4": "0.091698095", "5": "0.037294246", "6": "0.068856254"}}
