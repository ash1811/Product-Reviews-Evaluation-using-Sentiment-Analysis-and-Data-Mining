{"text": "Bought this for my 4yo for halloween. He wears a 5 pant and 5 shirt and this was perfect (This would not have fit a child that wears size 6&#8230;I don't think).  It comes in &#34;garment bag&#34; which is super cute.  It was worth the money.  The holster was horrible but he had another so it worked out.  It is now late December and he and his brothers have used this to play quite a bit, the hat needed some hot glue but other than that it is holding up well.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.2971446", "2": "0.1070558", "3": "0.16604199", "4": "0.04519374", "5": "0.18428692", "6": "0.19694729"}}
