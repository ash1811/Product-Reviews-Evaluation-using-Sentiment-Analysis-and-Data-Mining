{"text": "My JanSport Driver 8 is a USED one I got on Amazon. I suppose you could say it's been around the block... I fumigated it.Mine seems to be well made. Fairly good materials. The handle is intact and extends/retracts as it should. It is long enough when extended. It seems to be well anchored to the pack! The pack is light weight. It has good wheels that spin freely but they show signs of wear. They appear to be replaceable. The pack is just about the right size too.The shoulder straps store in a pouch until needed. Mine will see action on a trip across Southern Europe in 2012. We travel as cheaply as possible!I give it 5 stars because though it is used it is still in good shape!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.028272728", "1": "0.3027985", "2": "0.122870006", "3": "0.24464326", "4": "0.08054058", "5": "0.11565053", "6": "0.10522438"}}
