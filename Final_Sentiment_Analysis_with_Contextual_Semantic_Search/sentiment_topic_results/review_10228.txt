{"text": "I bought several Sabrina Silver rings, and this chain to replace another.  Although the rings were pretty and bejeweled, this simple box chain is by far my favorite purchase. It may be important to note that I have a young daughter and a baby boy both of whom pull at, borrow and occasionally try to eat my jewelry.  My kids have broken far more expensive chains and necklaces, so I need a fairly sturdy chain.  I'm delighted to say this is a tough chain--and a bargain.  And still it is very pretty, delicate looking, and sparkles in light.  Since I won't have to replace this chain anytime soon, I am considering purchasing a few of the other lengths for a layered look.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.085489094", "1": "0.44903812", "2": "0.034824025", "4": "0.18023527", "5": "0.10180058", "6": "0.14633532"}}
