{"text": "I've been buying Reebok Club C shoes for about 10 years now. I switched which my regular tennis shoes wore out and I couldn't find a pair to replace them. I've never been sorry switching to this product line. Reebock is the only shoe I buy of this style. They last long, wear hard, support and give surpassing comfort if you have to wear them all day or at work. I don't own any other type of tennis shoe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06852236", "1": "0.059175443", "2": "0.22840841", "3": "0.21019495", "4": "0.11351569", "5": "0.2583423", "6": "0.061840896"}}
