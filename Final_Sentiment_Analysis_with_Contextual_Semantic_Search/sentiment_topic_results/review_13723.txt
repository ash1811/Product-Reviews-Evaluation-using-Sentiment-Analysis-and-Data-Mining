{"text": "I LOVE the way these sandals feel, they also look nice, and I can walk for miles in them no problem -- the best thing since sliced bread, and they are all I wear all summer long -- only small problem is the dye rubs off a bit, and, so, I have black bottoms of feet all summer as well!  Oh well, I guess we can never \"have it all!\".  But I'll take the comfort, simplicity, and supportive arches over clean looking bottoms of feet any day!  They're still well worth it!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.31367204", "2": "0.10164698", "3": "0.2644236", "4": "0.1378515", "5": "0.10657412", "6": "0.07312677"}}
