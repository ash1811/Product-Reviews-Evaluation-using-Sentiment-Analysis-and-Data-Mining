{"text": "I am a busty women size 40-42 DD i have ordered about 20 strapless bra's and bought a ton also this one for me has been the best fit and overall look and comfort so far to me no strapless is gonna be perfect comfort but this one is not bad. i needed one to wear in summer with sun dresses and strapless tops, so i don't want somthing to be so uncomfortable you don't want to wear the tops. been on the hunt for a while i would pay a ton if i could find a good one. this one is preety good. it fits nice comes with straps they are color of bra but i have clear ones you could also get those cute ones. one thing is the back of this bra is a little different from a reg bra as that it has a ( hard to explain) kinda like a extra strap built in but not extra fabric making it bulky i had ordered that butterfly strapless on amazon and for me it was a good bra but to bulky and to many hooks in back this one is kinda like the back of that but smaller and only one set of hooks best i can explain it but helps hold you up better then just a plain ol reg strapless bra the picture is showing a very small bust because larger busts also push up more so more cleavage look, if the butterfly strapless was to much for you in the way of hooks and material this is a simular bra without as much hooks and material it is less padded and smaller wires, if you like a bra with alot of padding and hooks the butterfly strapless may work better i have tryed both i prefer this one but the other one is good just not for me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.39870748", "2": "0.19309427", "3": "0.10918382", "4": "0.06461354", "5": "0.10540947", "6": "0.12656303"}}
