{"text": "this is a nice ammo pouch, for &#34;bullits&#34;.  but i was looking for a &#34;slingshot&#34; ammo pouch which the amazon search results keep displaying.  i bought it to hold 1/4&#34; and 3/8&#34; slingshot steel bearings ammo.  would have been nice for BB's too.  unfortunately the canvas just flips over and secures loosely.  not a problem for &#34;bullits&#34;.  but &#34;slingshot&#34; ammo is small, and rolls out right away every time you lean over.  this is not a product problem.  it only needs to be flagged differently in the amazon search results.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.33722776", "1": "0.08673881", "2": "0.21101032", "3": "0.056785755", "4": "0.10668436", "5": "0.111456074", "6": "0.09009694"}}
