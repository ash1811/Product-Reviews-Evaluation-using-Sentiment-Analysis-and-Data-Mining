{"text": "Since this hiking shoe has a good reputation, I decided to give them a try. (Always a gamble buying shoes without the benefit of trying them on in person). I ordered a half size larger than I normally wear as was recommended, and I am glad I did. Itried hiking in them with just my normal athletic socks on and they felt okay (no exceptional pain), but with my awful feet, I bought some insoles for additional support, and now they feel much better. They are keepers and I can recommend them to anyone. Especially those ladies with normal feet!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2169084", "1": "0.16525589", "2": "0.2079275", "3": "0.117604", "4": "0.18481897", "5": "0.1047287"}}
