{"text": "This watch I bought for a gift for my wife.  She will love the face of this watch - it is very nice indeed! :-)  They might have had a slightly better wrist band, not that it is bad mind you, but it could have, maybe.... I might say that it should have had a slightly better quality leather band thus only 4 stars.... this band will work great for some time to come though, and the watch will please her I know.  It is that nice.... the face is classier than the band, but for daily and on the job use, this is VERY nice.  For the money paid, you really can't go wrong.... but if you do, there is obviously no worry with Amazon!  Enjoy.Update:  I bought this for my wife for Christmas (to wwear to work).... she loves to coordinate colors with cloths etc.  My wife absolutely loved this fine looking watch!  It is actually a much prettier watch than the photo/picture does justice to.  The bevel cut crytal and the little diamond/crystal at the 12 o'clock positon looks really classy on her arm.  The band will last a long time in her work use at her desk.... not for heavy duty service of course.  If you buy this and use a dressy watch for dressy puposes I am certian you will get long time good service from this nice watch.  Not too big, not too small to see and read well, has a second hand, and there is nothing negative about this watch in any way! I hope you enjoy it as much as my wife does! This is the third Armitron I have bought, and I have had zero disappoinment or problems with any of them!  Buy in confidence..... anything less, and Amazon will make it right. :-)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2173126", "1": "0.2770548", "2": "0.20940146", "3": "0.0964074", "4": "0.08422053", "5": "0.11297744"}}
