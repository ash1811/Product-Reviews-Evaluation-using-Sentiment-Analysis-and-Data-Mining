{"text": "The color (red) is wonderful.  The fit is great; I ordered a half size larger as suggested by other reviews.  This a very comfortable shoe and I wear them a lot. They are holding up very well. I even wore them with socks - once, just to see what it was like; socks are so not needed with that removable insole. I love these shoes!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2965185", "2": "0.13794033", "4": "0.17118783", "5": "0.2341004", "6": "0.14585932"}}
