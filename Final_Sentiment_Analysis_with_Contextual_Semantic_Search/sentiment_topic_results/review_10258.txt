{"text": "I like the color and shape of the earring.  They're very light and you hardly notice you're wearing them. I thought they'd be slightly thicker, but they're fine.  The main gripe I have is that the clasp is a little flimsy.  Be careful if you wear them daily (as do I), for they can easily come off while changing clothes or taking off a scarf.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07893922", "1": "0.23138006", "2": "0.05911489", "3": "0.16677104", "5": "0.25965577", "6": "0.19978108"}}
