{"text": "My 4 year old grandson was so happy to open his package and find the costume.  He loves to dess up as one of the Super Heroes.  I made a costume box for him at Christmas last year and I just keep adding to it.  When his friends come over they all pick a costume.  Most of the costumes have come from Amazon and have lasted very well through lots of little boys putting them on and taking them off.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.30015734", "1": "0.097439185", "3": "0.30294463", "4": "0.18918318", "5": "0.102928504"}}
