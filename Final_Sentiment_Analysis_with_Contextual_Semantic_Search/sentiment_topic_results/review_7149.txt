{"text": "This has 3 pockets, which is nice.  The front pocket which is perfect for a cell phone also has a clip for keys which is good except if you put your smart phone in there, the clip or keys could damage the screen, rubbing on it.  I won't use the clip; it's removable, still leaving a ring inside that pocket.The other two pockets have zippers which are too short.  My 7-3/8\" wallet fits inside the middle pocket, but the zipper is so short it's difficult to get the wallet in and out easily. If you were shopping around, for example, at a farmers' market, you would not want to be repeatedly struggling the wallet in and out of the pocket. As for the zipper in the pocket closest to the body, it is only about 6\" long.  Both pockets are roomy inside, but it's not easy to get some items in and out.I'm not a big person, and when I cinch it up to fit around my waist, there is 16\" of extra strap.  Not a complaint, just a comment.  It can easily be cut off, or not.  The quality is very good, and it will last a long time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09326192", "1": "0.36763147", "2": "0.256071", "4": "0.104048446", "5": "0.051858976", "6": "0.12474026"}}
