{"text": "I only had problems with two pair of these jeans where in the stitching came out around the fly button hole. I was able to sew them up again on one pair; but not on the other pair. The other pairs of jeans worked fine. These are thin light weight jeans not soft like the \"Seven\" (7 of Mankind ) jeans (Cairo) and they are not form fitting like the AG or \"Seven\" jeans; but for their low cost they are a good buy. They worked fine for me. I liked wearing the lands end and eddie bauer more for their thicker fabric; but the AG and \"Seven\" jeans fit better and look better; but they cost much more too.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13095301", "1": "0.3690482", "2": "0.19170949", "3": "0.0718755", "5": "0.12011668", "6": "0.1139753"}}
