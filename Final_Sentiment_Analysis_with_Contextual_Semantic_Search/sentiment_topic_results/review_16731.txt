{"text": "my husbands has a lot of Lucky brand jeans so last time they were for sale I decided to buy a pair of myself. I'm 5f 7i and size 8. I ordered a 29x34 because i like the extra length with heels and wasn't fully sure of the waist fit (size 8 should be 28). well, the pants say it is still a size 8 but I could have gone with the 28 (although I don't mind the little extra room) and the length is perfect for my ankle boots. the quality is very good and so far the color hasn't washed off. will buy more next time they go at 50% sale", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3885367", "2": "0.04581044", "3": "0.26520595", "4": "0.15828098", "5": "0.045669213", "6": "0.09414763"}}
