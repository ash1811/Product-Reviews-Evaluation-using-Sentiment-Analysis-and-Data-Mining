{"text": "They weren't kidding when they said world's softest sock.  Sheesh, it really is.  I was looking for a sock that wasn't too tight at the top.  I hate those women's socks that have a band at the top that cuts off our circulation...it seems the size they make that band would just fit my 6 ear old grandson's leg.  So this is not only soft beyond belief but it stays up completely without a cut-off-your-circulation band.  I will say they were a bit thicker than I had in my head when I ordered them, but it wasn't a problem.  They were soooooooooo warm and since we have 1 degree weather right now, I really loved them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13960327", "1": "0.3040834", "2": "0.028253242", "3": "0.23660253", "4": "0.07439859", "5": "0.13101973", "6": "0.08603922"}}
