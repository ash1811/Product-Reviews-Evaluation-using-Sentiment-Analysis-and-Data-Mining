{"text": "I bought my size in lace dot. They come up past my navel, and almost have boy-short legs. I think it makes them look cute. They are silky and comfortable too (not too tight and not too loose- they stay in place). Washing and treating like a normal delicate: wash cold, hang dry. I don't pull them up with sharp nails or snag them with zippers and they have not fallen apart. A go-to pair so far, if they hold up I will order more.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06426695", "1": "0.14052694", "2": "0.18563174", "3": "0.3248557", "4": "0.09650442", "5": "0.12612985", "6": "0.06208446"}}
