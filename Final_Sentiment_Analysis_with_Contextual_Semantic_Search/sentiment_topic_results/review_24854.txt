{"text": "I'm wearing these slippers right now! I love everything about them, although they seem to run a size small. I ordered the the size 11-12 M to treat myself and wear in the hospital after giving birth. People keep asking me if they are Uggs but in my opinion the quality is better than the two pairs of Uggs that I own(although one pair is knit and not sheepskin). Very comfy, just be sure to order one size up from what you normally wear. I want another pair!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1672438", "1": "0.12347249", "2": "0.15581876", "3": "0.40656918", "5": "0.043394297", "6": "0.10045049"}}
