{"text": "UPDATED REVIEWAfter about 8 months of use these boots started to fall apart.  First one of the laces broke.  It was minor so I replaced it myself.  Later, one of the eyelets broke and the mesh start tearing on the boot.  I emailed Merrell and they replaced the boots but I did have to pay for shipping when sending my old boots back.  Also, I was without boots for several weeks.  These boots are comfortable but because of the lack of durability I probably won't buy Merrell again.ORIGINAL REVIEWBought these to replace heavy desert tan combat boots and I'm very pleased with my purchase.  My feet where killing me in the big combats boots I use to wear but once these arrived my life improved.  These boots are very light and comfortable.  I've splashed through some puddles without getting wet socks but I'm careful not to step in too much water based on other reviews. My only minor issue is that even when using my usual Dr Scholl's arch supports, it still feels like I need a little more arch support.  Overall these boots are great for the price and I would buy them again.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06973589", "1": "0.24251968", "2": "0.0532788", "3": "0.10034135", "4": "0.34927294", "5": "0.0762187", "6": "0.108632684"}}
