{"text": "I bought this backpack for my third grader, it was our first grown up backpack purchase {one that doesn't have some kind of character on it}.  I had some concerns that the bag would be too large for my little guy because he is on the smaller side of the growth chart but it fit him great, even fits me good so it would be great for adults too.Pros-great make, very good materials.  We have been using the bag for 3 months and it still looks as good as the day I bought it-Lots of pockets and compartments for carrying even a laptop.  My son doesn't need all the pockets because he's in elementary school but I still like all the room and organizational aspects that the multi compartments bring.-cool headphone compartment that allows you to feed your headphones through the bag so they aren't swinging everywhere-built to last, I can say with confidence that this bag will last us the whole school year and probably be a long lasting vacation bag after thatCons-the bag is a bit pricey I paid $40 but I personally don't mind because its a good make-I also noticed there are way more girl styles than there are boy styles which is disappointing but its not that big of a deal", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07937922", "1": "0.40170506", "2": "0.14076467", "3": "0.082576655", "4": "0.09935138", "5": "0.07637661", "6": "0.119846426"}}
