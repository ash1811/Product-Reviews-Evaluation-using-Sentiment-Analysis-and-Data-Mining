{"text": "I bought this for my 10 year old son as a backpack for school.  The only thing he keeps in his backpack is a small 3 ring binder and occasionally he'll shove his sweatshirt in it.  There are 2 zippers on the big main pocket and within the first 3 weeks of school the zipper broke.  I don't have much use for a backpack that won't close.  Won't be buying another K-Cliffs backpack.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08502796", "1": "0.37132403", "2": "0.30024368", "3": "0.0916243", "4": "0.09095859", "5": "0.05723267"}}
