{"text": "This bra fits perfect--cup size and band--but the straps continually slide off my shoulders. Very frustrating because, outside of that, I love everything else about this bra. I even tried sewing the strap slide in place so it would stay at the right adjustment and not slide up giving too much slack. That did not work--even at the right adjustment, they still slide off my shoulders.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09786036", "1": "0.10109548", "2": "0.18667664", "3": "0.25377607", "4": "0.2486682", "5": "0.046368867", "6": "0.06555442"}}
