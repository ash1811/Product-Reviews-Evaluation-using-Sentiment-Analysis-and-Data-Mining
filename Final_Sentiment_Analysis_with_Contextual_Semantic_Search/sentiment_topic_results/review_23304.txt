{"text": "Love this shoe.  I have been a fan since the beginning.  This is a performance neutral shoe with plenty of stability and cushion for my runs.  I typically run on paved and dirt roads in the country and this shoe is perfect.  The color is sort of that neon green you see in highly visible clothes and it also has some &#34;reflection&#34; type detail that glows when the car lights shine on it and the trim is a bright pink.  My husband thinks the color is ugly but they are definitely eye catching which is what I want when I'm running on the road and don't want to get hit!  I always buy a 1/2 size larger in my Saucony than I would in a normal walking/casual shoe...I would typically wear a 7 in a Born for example but in this shoe, I get a 7 1/2.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1503557", "1": "0.15524504", "2": "0.25128195", "3": "0.15526192", "4": "0.18081483", "5": "0.057684693", "6": "0.049355857"}}
