{"text": "My head is absurdly wide (~7&#34;). So, buying sunglasses is a pain. Most sunglasses pinch my head far too much to be comfortable. These sunglasses stretch to accommodate my head perfectly without pain. That alone makes them worth it.The polarized lenses is also useful. When I'm driving at 60ish miles per hour, I would like to be able to focus as much as possible. Since the lenses are curved, you get (effectively) all-around protection from the sun. Traditional sunglasses are worthless if the sun is to your left or right since the sunlight can easily reflect off of the inside of the lens.I'll admit I've accidentally sat on these sunglasses a couple times. They came perfectly fine, which proves their durability.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.23875655", "1": "0.15698232", "2": "0.20747145", "3": "0.11282628", "4": "0.0826198", "5": "0.09882651", "6": "0.10251712"}}
