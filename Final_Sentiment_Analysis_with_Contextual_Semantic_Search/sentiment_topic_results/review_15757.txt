{"text": "Purchased these for my son for swim team based on the reviews.  Yes, the fabric is nice and it fit him perfectly, but after one wearing and swim meet the hole where the tie goes has already started to rip.  Not a small rip but at least an inch.  I am going to try and sew as he needs it on a daily basis.  I am not sure if it was a defective suit to begin with, but I will tell you, when we received it the box was crushed.  It may have been returned and re-sold.  From now on this is something i will go to a store to purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0730527", "1": "0.3159468", "2": "0.16124173", "3": "0.15202354", "4": "0.14883997", "5": "0.12366437", "6": "0.025230901"}}
