{"text": "The only reason I gave these 4 instead of 5 stars is because they fit perfect out of the box. I am a broad man, with a regular waist, and large thighs and butt. My waist is true 34\", but I normally buy pants that are 35-36 waist, with a 29-30 inseam. I am 5'11\". I ordered the medium because is had the correct chest and waist measurements for me. Out of the package the size was perfect, nice and snug, absolutely no bunching. Inseam, waist, chest, arms, shoulders, everything was nice. So the reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because they will undoubtedly be too small after a few washings. I have ordered a large so that I can do a comparison, maybe the large will be okay and shrink down to perfect. I am very worried that the large will bunch a lot, which will make it unwearable to me. The only thing less comfortable than bunching underwear is riding a camel through 115F with 15MpH wind.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16102518", "1": "0.30250978", "2": "0.22140174", "3": "0.19032368", "6": "0.119953476"}}
