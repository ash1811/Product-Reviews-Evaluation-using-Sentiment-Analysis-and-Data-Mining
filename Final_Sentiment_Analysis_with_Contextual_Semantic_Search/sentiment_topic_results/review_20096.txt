{"text": "I bought this backpack for college and it has been great! Fantastic quality, plenty of room, pockets and clip in the front for gym shoes, water bottle or whatever else you can think of. Fits very comfortably, I even like the thumb-holes on the adjusting straps since I'm like many people who tend to like to hold them when I walk. However, I don't think the thumb-holes are talked about in the description. I got the red line/charcoal color and absolutely love the colors. Nice and bright so people can see me when walking home. Shipped on time, came in perfect shape, no problems what so ever. I would buy another one of these backpacks, I love it that much.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06560166", "1": "0.41120496", "2": "0.2694569", "3": "0.032627657", "4": "0.04629637", "5": "0.117289945", "6": "0.05752251"}}
