{"text": "My sister introduced me to Sanuk flip flops, and I have since bought three pair.  I love them and wear them every day.  I would love to eventually have them in most all colors.  I have neuropathy in my feet (as does my sis) and these shoes help the hyper-sensitivity in my feet, and make it possible to walk comfortably wherever I go.  Don't go another day without them.  You too will be amazed.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.045708902", "1": "0.16048463", "2": "0.21536317", "3": "0.20721526", "4": "0.08380585", "5": "0.22465615", "6": "0.06276601"}}
