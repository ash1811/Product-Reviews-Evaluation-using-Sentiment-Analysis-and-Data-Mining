{"text": "Because of frequent Migraines, I was unable to wear many sun hats (vital in the south) without inciting an attack. This hat saved me. It is lightweight and can be worn fairly loosely due to string. I am a bird watcher and I like the brim can easily be folded back to reduce reduction in visual field. In fact, I fold mine in quarters for travel, creasing the brim down the middle, which reduces the times I need to fold the brim up.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12638809", "1": "0.18533158", "2": "0.09067353", "3": "0.13274236", "4": "0.11460416", "5": "0.20473795", "6": "0.14552237"}}
