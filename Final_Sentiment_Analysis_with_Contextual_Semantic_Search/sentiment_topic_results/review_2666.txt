{"text": "Very cheap, inferior material. Like a $5 scrub top. Very disappointed. I'm definitely sending this back and will never buy from National. Sorry, but this is pathetic. The picture looks like it has some body to it. Like it kinda flows, but really it is just lifeless and really ugly. The worst purchase I have made with Amazon and I have made many. The price is low but ugly is ugly. I hate to be negative and I feel bad for my bluntness but I can't believe they send this out.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10940814", "1": "0.27109674", "2": "0.06504827", "3": "0.34776822", "4": "0.09304567", "6": "0.1107028"}}
