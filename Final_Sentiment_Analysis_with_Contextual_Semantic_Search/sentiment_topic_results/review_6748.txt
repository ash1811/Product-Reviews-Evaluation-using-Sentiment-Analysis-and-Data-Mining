{"text": "I own several watches, two of them Invicta's one a Black Face Professional Diver and the other a model that looks like a Rolex Yacht Master with rose gold face and bezel. Both to these are automatics and have been running well for over two years now.I recently splurged ($2K) and purchased a Tag Heuer Aquaracer Calibre 5 automatic that looks almost identical to this Invicta.I proudly wear the Tag daily, but if I am going some where a little gamey, I wear an Invicta, looks just as nice to the unknowning and if lost, stolen, broken, or taken in a robbery, it is no great loss.The only problem with the Invicta is the bracelet isn't 1/10th as nice as the real McCoy, and the power reserve is limited, I have to re-set and re-wind almost daily when waking up if I am wearing one, while the Tag will stay running for a day and a half when fully wound.Invictas are truly the King of the Throw Away watches!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.064001106", "1": "0.26331663", "2": "0.10700953", "3": "0.055940926", "4": "0.039417822", "5": "0.3877831", "6": "0.08253088"}}
