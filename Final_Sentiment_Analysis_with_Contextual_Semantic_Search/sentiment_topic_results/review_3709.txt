{"text": "A couple of reviewers have said the watch stopped working after a while.  Mine is only a week old, so it's shown no problems so far.  I will try and amend or comment on my review if something bad happens.FIT-- This is a bangle/bracelet style band, so it may not fit some wrists that well, due to the shape of the fixed sections.  I have a 6.25&#34; wrist.  I took one segment off and the fit is snug.  The fit is a bit loose with it on, even though the removable segment isn't very big--so there is not much leeway here to make it even smaller, unless you have access to the jeweler's tools to take off one of the 5 little links.  It will be impossible to adjust to a very large wrist.  There is just one easily removable clasp-style link,  I'm guessing that with that link still on, the band is still only about 6.75&#34;... so a 7&#34; wrist may either just fit snugly or be too tight.  Anything above that would be definitely too big.Of course, it's not like this is the most expensive watch around, so I'm not surprised that the fit range is tight.  It is a very nice looking watch.  Light and streamlined, with a low profile.  For me, the fit is a little on the tight side, but I'm not sure I want to use the link I took off... so it's not perfect... but it feels OK and I like the look and feel of it.If it manages to keep going for more than a month, that'll be good.I usually like to pay a little more for a longer-lasting watch.  I've had a Fossil that has worked for 10 years--and the date-thing was damaged during a battery-change once and Fossil repaired it for free, as they have a super-long warranty.  This watch is less than half the price, more a bit of inexpensive jewelry that can tell time... so it's fair enough that it won't last forever, I think.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12446045", "1": "0.21675064", "2": "0.0704998", "3": "0.26014626", "4": "0.207933", "5": "0.06988269", "6": "0.050327152"}}
