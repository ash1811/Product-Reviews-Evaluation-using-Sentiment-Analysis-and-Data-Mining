{"text": "The reasons I like these socks: 1) they come in a a women's L, which fits those of us with shoe sizes 10 and above 2) they fit like a glove (pun) (no bunching, wrinkling) 3) they are very comfortable and a great alternative to wool socks for hiking in warm temps 4) they wash well 5) they're a good height above the ankle 5) the blue (the only color available in L) is attractive.  I bought one pair to try them out and liked them so well that I purchased another 2 pair.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10759482", "1": "0.45878595", "2": "0.107140206", "3": "0.12220047", "4": "0.13707308", "5": "0.027786372", "6": "0.039419122"}}
