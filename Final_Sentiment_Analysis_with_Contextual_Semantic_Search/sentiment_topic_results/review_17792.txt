{"text": "This product has made me very happy, although at first impressions, it looks too thin and sheer to be true. I replaced all my merino long johns with this as I developed an allergy from wearing too much merino too frequently, and now I can't touch them at all. Anyway, this brand is great, and I have also bought the equivalent tops as my base layer as well, they are warm and really light. My husband has heaps of these too and he really likes the range (long johns, long sleeve and short sleeve silk base layers). As the fabric is delicate, a little care during washing would be good. Otherwise, it washes well and dries very quickly unlike wool products.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.124849245", "1": "0.3528257", "2": "0.13474356", "3": "0.081075124", "4": "0.09640927", "5": "0.1171676", "6": "0.09292952"}}
