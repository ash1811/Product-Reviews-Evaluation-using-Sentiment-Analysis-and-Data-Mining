{"text": "These shoes shipped fast and fit perfect. I needed work shoes to wear during 12 hour shifts in an ER. These are awesome for that. They support my feet and they do not rub my toes raw. They are also easy to put on and pull off. They are not the best looking shoes though. My wife makes fun of them all the time on me but I don't care. They feel amazing. Perfect shoes for work but I would not wear them out in town or on date night.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.34523377", "2": "0.1900716", "3": "0.11033538", "4": "0.2382534", "5": "0.10973092"}}
