{"text": "These buttons were super easy to apply - I did it. I was afraid my husband might not realize his own strength and might ruin them. It might take a few trys to figure out how hard to pound so the buttons penetrated the denim but didn't bend out of shape at any time in the application of the buttons.We hooked my husband's suspenders to the buttons and pulled and it feels like they will stay in place during normal outdoor work/activities.These made it so we didn't waste the jeans because my husband wears Carhartt Logger jeans to work in but wouldn't wear these until he could use his suspenders with them. Very happy so far. If they tend to come loose or issues come up, then I'll return and update this review.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.141761", "1": "0.17344163", "2": "0.048167743", "3": "0.14762096", "4": "0.24389398", "5": "0.17743272", "6": "0.06768198"}}
