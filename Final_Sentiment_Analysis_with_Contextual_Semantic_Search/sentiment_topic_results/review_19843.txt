{"text": "I like the relatively large face on this watch and the pink accents on the silver face, which add a touch of femininity to the watch.  It is easy to set, especially if you've had another digital watch.  The stopwatch works well, and I really like the Indiglo light.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the timer is useless.  There is no \"reset\" button for the timer so you have to cycle through the minutes and seconds back to zero to reset.  This is very annoying.  However, I don't use a timer very often so it really doesn't affect the functionality of the watch for me.  For the price, and if you don't use a timer, this is a good choice.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13110892", "1": "0.33043003", "2": "0.33434397", "4": "0.024453295", "6": "0.17434722"}}
