{"text": "These boots had a definite smell right out of the box, and a plastic feel too.  Quality seems to be lower than what I had expected.  Size W is a must for wider feet, since you got to wear socks too.  Not too impressed, but only $56, I wouldnt recommend paying more than that for this boot, for sure.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17323436", "1": "0.25027722", "2": "0.11342489", "3": "0.20744559", "4": "0.24603131"}}
