{"text": "I'm a minimalist wallet kind of guy. I was looking for something to hold about ten cards (credit/ID/medical) and a few bills. And I wanted them all to be easy to access. The wallets I've found so far are either too bulky or require bills to be carefully folded. I love the feel of this wallet, but the extra pocket &#34;flap&#34; defeats the purpose of the slim profile.I designed and made my own duct-tape wallet which works perfectly and which will have to suffice until I can find a more durable (and classy...) leather equivalent.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.16761951", "2": "0.19948576", "3": "0.21511394", "4": "0.2410494", "5": "0.08060035", "6": "0.09319864"}}
