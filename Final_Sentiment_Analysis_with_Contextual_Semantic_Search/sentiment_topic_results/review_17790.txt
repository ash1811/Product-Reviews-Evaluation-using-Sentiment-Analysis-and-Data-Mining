{"text": "Ok people....lookee here...watch arrived in two days . Prime has it's priviledges. It was factory packed . no hand me down no returned item pawned off on me... brand spanking new. I have used this watch for diving up to 100 feet for years. It never leaked. If you have the battery changed though and submerge it into the ole H2O it's toast. Henceforth which is how the previous one met it's demise. I decided to get the same model and paid less for it then I paid 10 years ago. One more thing , I heard if you let casio change the battery they claim it will once again be 200 meter water-resistant . I like this watch because of the little wheel gizmo's. I don't know exactly what they do but it is impressive. I mainly use the timer when diving and it is easy to read and when engaged a nice light blue back light called the \"illuminator\"  comes on and will light up your life.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24479523", "1": "0.15963931", "2": "0.1792895", "3": "0.09418418", "4": "0.11319255", "5": "0.07632889", "6": "0.13257034"}}
