{"text": "The description on this says it is a 4-3/4\" brim. I measure 5-1/4\" from the band to the longest point on the brim. Other reviewers talked about it blowing off in the wind, and with a sail like that, no wonder. Even if it was 2\" shorter, it would still shade my whole face. I guess it is made to shade your chest as well.I am looking for a straw visor that is a good bit shorter for a trip where I will be doing a lot of walking outside and don't want \"hat hair\". I found the clip on on this visor to be very comfortable, so I stared at this one for a long time, trying to figure out how bad it would look if I cut the straw back a few inches. Bad, is what I decided. My guess is that the reviewers who got a headache from this visor had a larger melon. On me (average size head)the velvet band hugs all the way past my ears and does not dig in anywhere. Just wish there was a shorter brim version.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09538219", "1": "0.23913132", "2": "0.12609234", "3": "0.16426766", "4": "0.1442143", "5": "0.10109048", "6": "0.12982167"}}
