{"text": "I am not a sneaker conneisseur. In fact, I have been buying my sneakers for 12 dollars at a big box store for several years now -- but this year, I decided to take a step up and get these shoes. The difference is amazing! These are nice and cushioned, lightweight but sturdy, and somehow they manage to be partially water-resistant while still being breathable and cool! My standards are pretty basic, when it comes to this sort of shoe, but the Saucony Jazz exceeded all of my expectations in terms of comfort.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2721852", "2": "0.09594941", "3": "0.10316386", "4": "0.14705573", "5": "0.19712792", "6": "0.18124312"}}
