{"text": "I really like these pajamas.  I have two sets.  They are well made.  The material is very lightweight, so you can forget you have them on.  Yet, since they are polyester satin, they are also quite warm.  I am 5' 6\" tall and the pants are a perfect length.  They have short sleeves so I can do housework in them easily.  They are not tight in the neck.  They don't stick to the cotton sheets when I toss and turn in bed.  I could live in these.  I think I am going to order another set right now.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12217734", "1": "0.42715833", "2": "0.043015353", "3": "0.09546078", "4": "0.085059114", "6": "0.22407773"}}
