{"text": "This is a great watch at a great price. I'm on my third one in 20 years. True it doesn't last forever, but what do you want at this price?I love the easy-to-use digital features, especially the countdown timer. I use it all the time for cooking or time-outs for the kids, or to remind myself that I really need to leave in 5 minutes!Last time my hubby changed the battery he messed up the water-proof gasket so now I need a new one.I agree with others that the included watchband isn't the greatest. That's why I only gave 4 stars. Long ago I bought a stretch band and now just swap it out.Casio, please never stop making this watch. But consider changing the band to a stretch one. That would make this watch truly perfect.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.082166635", "1": "0.24098144", "2": "0.15114644", "3": "0.12788858", "4": "0.13203703", "5": "0.13036998", "6": "0.13540992"}}
