{"text": "I bought this for my husband for his birthday, and he loves it. He has a slimmer wrist, and all the watches I looked at were so BIG that I didn't even try them. Then I found this one and it is a great size, both in diameter and thickness. It's very good looking - can be worn for both dress-up and casual.  I highly recommend, especially if you want a watch that is smaller in size.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.14369231", "2": "0.20854059", "3": "0.20569764", "4": "0.18306546", "5": "0.11332487", "6": "0.14119801"}}
