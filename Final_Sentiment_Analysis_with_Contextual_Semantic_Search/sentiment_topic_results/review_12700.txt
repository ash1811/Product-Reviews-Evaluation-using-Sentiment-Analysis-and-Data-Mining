{"text": "We just received this bag a few days ago, and I already have good and bad to report. We bought it specifically to use to gate check our stroller. We have a Heidi Klum Truly Scrumptious umbrella stroller. While this is technically an umbrella stroller, it is much larger than the standard umbrella stroller, so I was worried that we would have trouble fitting it into a regular umbrella stroller bag. I am pleased to report that it fits just fine and closes completely with no problem. The bag material and straps are both made of very sturdy nylon, and I am sure it will do the job of protecting our stroller when we gate check it for an upcoming trip. The unfortunate thing is that the stitching which secures one of the handles to the side of the bag already pulled out! It seems like they used very thin thread for that particular stitching, and it pulled right out one time when I made the mistake of pulling on the bag by one handle. I just hope the rest of the stitching is done with a more sturdy thread because I don't want to waste a bunch of time repairing sewing mistakes in what would otherwise be a great bag. If no other stitching comes loose, I will leave this review at three stars, otherwise I will come back and downgrade it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14674836", "1": "0.16483712", "2": "0.075827755", "3": "0.109051354", "4": "0.11877626", "5": "0.33764347", "6": "0.047115676"}}
