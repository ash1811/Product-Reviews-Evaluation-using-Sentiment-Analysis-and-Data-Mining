{"text": "I've purchased robeez for my older child when he was learning to walk. So it was obvious I would buy them for my second child. Love the soft bottom. Helps with learning to walk. Strengthens the toes. The color is soft so it's wearable with anything. The soft lining is good against the skin. And the elastic is good so I don't have to tie anything and they stay on. I even bought a second pair and I was happy to receive a third pair as a gift :-)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.070405535", "1": "0.4620291", "2": "0.13477647", "3": "0.11681381", "4": "0.12412491", "5": "0.06616778", "6": "0.025682373"}}
