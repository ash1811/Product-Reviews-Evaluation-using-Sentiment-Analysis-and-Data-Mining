{"text": "We got several of these before our overseas (by plane) trip.  They came in very handy for stacking the bags and luggage we had to manhandle through customs, airports, into taxis & B & Bs, etc.  They were very easy to use & sturdy, and I recommend every traveler carry a couple for unexpected needs (to bind more than one thing together for easy carrying).  I used one every day in the rental car to hang my bags on (hung it from the head rest) so items didn't get tossed and lost.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08452456", "1": "0.11819668", "2": "0.36504707", "3": "0.04967788", "4": "0.07458379", "5": "0.08894335", "6": "0.21902663"}}
