{"text": "I really should have listened to the other negative reviews - unfortunately these were so cute I had to give them a try.I purchased an 8.5 which is the size I wear in most shoes of this type (Dansko, ECCO, ABEO).  These would have been the perfect size, but the way the straps are laid out makes the fit very awkward.  The large strap over the top of the foot forces my foot to the very back of the shoe making the front seem both too long and too loose.  Add to this the lack of any arch support and the odd sensation of the heel being lower than the toe and it's one of the most awkward shoes I've ever tried to walk in.It's a pity they don't fit, they're super cute, but not being able to walk in them defeats the purpose.
