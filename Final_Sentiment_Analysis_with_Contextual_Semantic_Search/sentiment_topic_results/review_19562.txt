{"text": "My wife always says you can save money on a lot of things, but when it comes to shoes, don't skimp. With shoes, you generally get what you pay for. Very true in this case. The first day I ever wore these I had to spend a marathon workday in our state capital during the state legislative session. Most of the day I was on my feet. I put these shoes on in the morning, wore them for 13 hours straight, up and down stairs, to and from a lunch meeting and other meetings, on city sidewalks, to and from and through an evening reception, etc., and I never once thought of my feet (other than looking down to admire how damn nice these shoes looked). I can't believe how comfortable they are. If you have to look nice for work or throw on a suite every now and again, I can't recommend these shoes highly enough.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.24065414", "2": "0.17132035", "4": "0.123427324", "5": "0.20156486", "6": "0.25772473"}}
