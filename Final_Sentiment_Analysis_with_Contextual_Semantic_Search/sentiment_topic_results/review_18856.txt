{"text": "I bought a pair of these last year, wore them for a year, wore them out, and loved 'em.Ordered a new pair this spring.  Two days later, split the seam from crotch to knee when I squatted down to pick something up.  A wee bit embarrassing and a lot of hilarity later, I got home.  About a month ago, I ordered another pair; I figured it was just a defect in the first ones, and c'est la vie.This pair is less than a month old, and split a hole in the crotch.  I'm exactly the same weight I was last year and the year before; I'm a pretty thin dude.  This is ridiculous, and I'm not exactly happy with burning money buying 'em.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10155307", "1": "0.34516436", "2": "0.03311667", "3": "0.12191599", "5": "0.18658642", "6": "0.20955326"}}
