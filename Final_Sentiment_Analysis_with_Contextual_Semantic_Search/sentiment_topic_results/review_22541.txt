{"text": "This stuff is awesome.  I just cleaned a whole bunch of my silver jewelry and it was a breeze.  Drop it into the basket, wait a few seconds, and rinse.  It all looks so clean and shiny!  I might wear gloves the next time I use it though, I really tried not to touch it but you can't help but get some on your hands, and it's very drying.  I can't imagine it's good for you.  Works fantastic though!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09065295", "1": "0.29139346", "2": "0.05740943", "3": "0.25803003", "4": "0.113726385", "5": "0.048271365", "6": "0.14051639"}}
