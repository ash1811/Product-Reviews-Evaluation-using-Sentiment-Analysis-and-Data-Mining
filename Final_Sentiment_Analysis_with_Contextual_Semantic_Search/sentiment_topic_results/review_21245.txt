{"text": "I have a wide foot, with a very narrow heel. Wore Rykas for years, but they've changed their shoes, so I'm now hunting (unsuccessfully) to find something to replace them. I was very disappointed that this shoe was not a good fit for me. It is extremely well made and there wasn't anything I didn't like about it. Unfortunately, it was too wide in the heel and it slid up and down on my foot. If you have a &#34;normal&#34; foot, this would be a great shoe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08167537", "1": "0.27650115", "2": "0.2824763", "3": "0.09662457", "4": "0.09790324", "5": "0.1302293", "6": "0.034590065"}}
