{"text": "It turns out that these are just right when out of the dryer but after an hour my husband must wear a belt with them.  I found a pair of 36x32s (that actually fit perfectly!) Wrangler's in his drawer under a stack of 34x32s that are too small.  I'm ready to make a donation to a church thrift store with his old pants and shirts that are too small, and face it, we don't ever lose that weight we say we're going to, and if we do, then we can buy some NEW stuff.I bought these to replace an old raggedy pair of jeans that I believe are Dickies that he likes because they have a lower pocket on the right leg that holds his cell phone.  I believe they must be painters pants.  Well too bad, out they go into the trash.  I will have to find out the size and style of those and order them.  Meantime, these jeans are fine and look good on him.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.31298852", "2": "0.2106254", "3": "0.13804673", "4": "0.1826793", "5": "0.069330856", "6": "0.083814606"}}
