{"text": "These socks are very soft which makes them very comfortable to wear, especially on long days.  They are made of good quality, so you will get more than a couple of wears out of it.  They are somewhat thick, so I do not recommend them for wearing with dress shoes.  Good calf support, so there is little hassle of having to pull your socks all day long.  I recommend buying a pair if you want comfortable feet for a day.  You will notice the difference.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07854779", "1": "0.48287663", "2": "0.15158682", "3": "0.09250206", "5": "0.1873175"}}
