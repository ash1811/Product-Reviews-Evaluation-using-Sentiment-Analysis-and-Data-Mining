{"text": "It is very difficult to find large women's boots, so I have always worn men.  However, men's boots are very wide on my feet.  I was very excited to find these.  I normally wear an 11, but attempted the 10 because that is what the size chart said I needed and they fit perfectly.  Didn't require any breaking in period, but since I work on an island I did buy leather waterproofing cream to extend the life of my boots.  The leather is very flexible allowing me to accomplish anything and everything my job requires (squatting, climbing, balancing, running, walking, etc).  I wear them all year long in every weather condition and they are very comfortable.  My feet are plenty warm, but they don't breath quite as well as I would have liked.  The zipper is super handy, I just slip my shoes on in the morning and off when I get home.  No more sitting there for 5 minutes trying to relace my boots.  The shoe laces that came with the boots were terrible.  They were too short and the plastic ends looked like they were chewed up.  So, I bought new 72\" laces so I can tuck in the extra.  Would definitely recommend for any woman on her feet for extended periods.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.34774673", "2": "0.13535579", "4": "0.24602856", "5": "0.1367963", "6": "0.12958872"}}
