{"text": "First my normal shoe size is women's US 8.5, I needed a 9 in these to have a little extra room/comfort for the toes.This style of Keens is all I've worn for years. If gets cold I add socks.I walked around Rome, Florence and Paris for a month. Took my Keens and a super expensive pair of Finn Comfort shoes. I worn the Keens the whole time.They take a good while to wear out. This is my 3rd pair and is a good price for them.I don't know what I will do if they stop making them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07509178", "1": "0.22798334", "2": "0.15185803", "3": "0.11453491", "5": "0.10980773", "6": "0.31806087"}}
