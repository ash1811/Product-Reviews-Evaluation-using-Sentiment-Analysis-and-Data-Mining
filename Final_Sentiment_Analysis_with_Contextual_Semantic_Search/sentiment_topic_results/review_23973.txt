{"text": "These are well stitched, confy socks. I like the elastic, which is not too tight or too loose, they have the right amount of hold and I have not experienced any discomfort so far. I've been wearing them for about 2 weeks now and so far, the socks have held strong even after numerous washes. The elastic does hold the sock up all day long. They have an extra layer of cushion at the heel & toes, which makes them great for everyday and all day use.Just as some reviewers mentioned, these will leave a bit of lint on your toes at first, but that was gone afte the first wash.Shipping was fast. They arrived in a short few days. They do not come packed in a box, they come in a large, thick envelope, but it did  hold the socks (2 packs)without a single issue.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.24552217", "1": "0.18385181", "2": "0.06581826", "3": "0.25323236", "4": "0.082763195", "5": "0.16625552"}}
