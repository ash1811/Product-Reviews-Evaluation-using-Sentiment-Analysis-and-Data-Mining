{"text": "Fit - Great around the band, cups run a bit small when using the company's sizing chart. I'd go up at least one cup size.Support - Excellent! Very little bounce with big boobs!Comfort - A little tight but it's supposed to be. Fabric is soft & comfortable & all straps & bands stay in place.Quality - Questionable. After maybe 5 wears, the front center at the top, where the cups meet at cleavage has begun to pull apart, I'm guessing under the strain of large breasts in cups a bit too small. Perhaps if I order a bigger size this won't be a problem. It could also just be a factory boo-boo. Or it could simply be of shoddy quality. Further research needed on my part! :)Overall - I will buy this product again in a bigger size to see if this eliminates my issues. I'll get back to you then!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14631833", "1": "0.3794522", "2": "0.063190885", "3": "0.16639507", "4": "0.13902792", "5": "0.045456354", "6": "0.060159165"}}
