{"text": "This pair of shoes replaces the same style shoes that I wore out while hiking.  The fit is great and the traction is really good.  These are great for easy or moderate trails while hiking in warmer weather. The only problem I've had is with the flap at the front of the shoe.  It sometimes gets caught on rocks and tree roots on trails and then comes apart from the body of the shoe.  A little Shoe Goo fixed the resulting flap. I wouldn't have this problem if I didn't hike where rocks and roots are a problem.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16991407", "1": "0.18386374", "2": "0.215359", "3": "0.13185996", "5": "0.041125417", "6": "0.25483182"}}
