{"text": "I have been trying to get a few pairs of 501 Originals (which is not the shrink to fit variety) that fit me, and have found the sizing of 501 Originals to be all over the map for jeans that all were labled 32w x 36L or 38L. In varying degrees, all--ALL--had waists that were bigger than 32. And in varying degrees all but one pair out of eight were too baggy overall (one pair was so baggy with a waist so oversize, that I could pull them off me even though they were all buttoned up).Some were a little longer than specified, some were a lot longer than specified (far as I'm concerned, that's a good thing: I'd rather have a tailor shorten them after a few washings, than find that after a few washings they are too short).Most had strange front rises that caused, in varying degrees, the dreaded codpiece bulge (which can be simulated by grabbing from behind the upmost part of one or both--the bulge is not always symmetrical--inseam areas at the crotch and pulling strongly backward and upward); the worst offender in this regard was the Timberwolf color, which I ordered twice in the hope that the first pair was a manufacturing mistake, but the second pair was just as bad: the Timberwolf's codpiece bulge was even worse when viewed from the side: hideous!As for the button fly--that turned out to be the best thing. I've found the button fly to be very comfortable, more comfortable than a zipper. The buttons are no problem once you get the knack of them and once the jeans are broken in.My dimensions are 73.5\" tall and 160lbs.  And of all the 501 Originals I've ordered, the best fitting is the Dark Stonewash in 32x36.  But fearing when I wash it the length might shrink too much, I ordered another pair of the stonewash in 32w x 38L--and guess what: that longer pair had the codpiece bulge even though the shorter dark stonewash pair fit perfectly.  I give up.ADDITIONAL INFO: the different colors the 501 Originals come in, are not all made from the same denim weight.  If you go to Levi's website, you can readily learn the weight of most of the colors there.  Some times a light weight is a good thing for casual wear on a hot summer day.  It's only a bad if you didn't realize you were ordering it.ONE MORE THING: 501 Shrink to Fit is NOT the same as these jeans, which are 501 Original Fit.  The 501 Original fit will behave pretty much like all other Levis that are not Shrink to Fit jeans.  Many people reviewing these Original Fit 501s didn't realize they were ordering the wrong jeans.  Again, Levi's website explains the distinction.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08904898", "1": "0.27498683", "2": "0.22647166", "3": "0.1620931", "4": "0.12166516", "5": "0.09853527", "6": "0.027198963"}}
