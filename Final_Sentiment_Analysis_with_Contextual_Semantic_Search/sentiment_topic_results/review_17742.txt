{"text": "I have owned other Casio watches and they are very accurate, with a great battery life.  The only problem I had with a less expensive Casio was the watch was great, but the band was junk.  And to replace the band cost more that to replace the watch.  This watch has a much better band and I expect to have a better chance of wearing it many years longer.  This watch is very well built and I expect to get several years of excellent service.  I use the stop watch functions a lot to time my rest intervals while weight training.  The only negative is the print of the watch face is almost too small to read.  Good thing the positions can be easily memorized.  Also, the &#34;adjust&#34; button is very hard to use, but the other three buttons work much better.  Time will tell but Casio is a good bet.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.28004295", "2": "0.27439377", "3": "0.07376144", "4": "0.062774055", "5": "0.13886079", "6": "0.1677749"}}
