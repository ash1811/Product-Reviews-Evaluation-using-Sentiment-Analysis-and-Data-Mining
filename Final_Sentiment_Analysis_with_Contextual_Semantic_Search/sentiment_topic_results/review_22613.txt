{"text": "This is the softest and most comfortable Hanes panty made in my opinion! And I have been wearing these for years as they are my favorite panty. So 2 weeks ago, while out shopping at a local store, I happily discovered these panties and bought three of the packages! This is why I buy these Hanes Panties over and over again:1) They are soft and comfortable and fit well, not loose but too tight either.2) They keep in place and do not ride up or ride down.3) When I wear jeans or dresses, these panties are perfect for under panties for any style of clothing.4) Best thing ever: They last so so long and the waistband stays true to form and does not stretch or break for a very long time.5) These panties do not shrink in the dryer.Highly recommend!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17380105", "1": "0.46473697", "3": "0.13935904", "5": "0.16749072", "6": "0.049478706"}}
