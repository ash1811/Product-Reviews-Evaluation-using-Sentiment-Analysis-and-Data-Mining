{"text": "got this watch on sale at sears for around 25$ i needed an alarm but hate the all digital watches and couldn't afford an all analog watch with alarm and chrono so i got this. casio makes way more analog/digital combo watches that any other maker. this watch is fantastic, large buttons, simple digital functions, you got the time on top then month,day and day of week on bottom. then alarm, stopwatch and a second timezone if you need that on bottom instead of the date..illuminator blue light lights up analog and digital display.. if i could change one thing i would give this watch a glass crystal because after a while you get scratches because its a plastic face. But all you need is to buff it with 'white paste style toothpaste' and it looks brand new again. Some people might have trouble reading the digital display, its not very big.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11451438", "1": "0.043404233", "2": "0.27482623", "3": "0.10924127", "4": "0.13271672", "5": "0.11976097", "6": "0.20553625"}}
