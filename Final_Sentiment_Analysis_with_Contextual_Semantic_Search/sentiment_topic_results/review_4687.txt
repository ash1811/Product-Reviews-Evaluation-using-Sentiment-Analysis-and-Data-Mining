{"text": "I bought these shoes for an airline trip this summer, and wore them to the airport and throughout the trip and back through the airport again..as you must remove your shoes for security.  The shoes are comfortable (wearing them right now) and slip off and back on easily at airport, look good enough to wear with shirt and tie, or casual with jeans or khakis.  My favorite pair of shoes right now!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06699763", "1": "0.4308432", "2": "0.2220269", "3": "0.04980634", "4": "0.05344621", "5": "0.17329994"}}
