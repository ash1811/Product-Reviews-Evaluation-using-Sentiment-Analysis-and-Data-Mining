{"text": "The only complaint I have is the lace part at the top sort of rolls under and sticks to the stay put silicone stuff. It like rolls inward towards my thighs. Also I did not think ahead before buying these but lucily I realized anyhow - you need to check a mirror and make sure these are even on both of your thighs so that one isn't higher than the other. But they are really nice looking. My husband likes them, of course! Just expect them to take a few extra minutes to put on for the 2 forementioned reasons I listed. I loved the quality. I only have worn them 1x so far but they seem durable and they are relatively comfortable. I'm 5'10\" tall I cannot wear shorter than a 34\" inseam pant but I buy pants up to a 38\" inseam... these fit a little long even on me! So someone 5'0\" may have to pull these clear up to the tops of her legs! As a tall woman, I love these and may buy more pairs later.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13734904", "1": "0.1996072", "2": "0.094046086", "3": "0.13152835", "4": "0.09736311", "5": "0.13793139", "6": "0.20217486"}}
