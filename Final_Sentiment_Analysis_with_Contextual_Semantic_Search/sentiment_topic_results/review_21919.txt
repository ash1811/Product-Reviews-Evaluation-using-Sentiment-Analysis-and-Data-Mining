{"text": "I actually love these socks, and they're great for gentle yoga, hatha yoga, and general wear.  My feet feel really good in them.  They are helping my tendonitis.  But for vinyasa/flow yoga they're no good.  Anything involving sliding the toes causes the socks to come off the toes, or twist up around the toes, and then you have to stop and wiggle the toes back into their sleeves and pull up the socks.  Very distracting!  But I gotta tell you, I love them anyway and am buying more.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06204787", "1": "0.37651184", "2": "0.1183902", "3": "0.13647409", "4": "0.10253908", "5": "0.1470407", "6": "0.05699619"}}
