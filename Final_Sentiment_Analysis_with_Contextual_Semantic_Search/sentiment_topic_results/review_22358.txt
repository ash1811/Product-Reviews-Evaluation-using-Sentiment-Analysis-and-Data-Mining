{"text": "I've tried 2 other, cheaper toe-sock options on Amazon, and came back to Injinji, since the custom-fit  Injinjis offer, esp. in the toe area is way more comfortable. The cheaper alternatives I've tried can't get the toe-length and width distribution right, as a result you frequently get extra space on toes that get folded over and cause discomfort on long-runs.Injinjis do a better job of not moving around/slipping in the heel area as well.As for durability, having owned almost a dozen Injinji socks in the past, I can attest to the 'Original Weight' ones' durability, with 20-30 miles of running per pair/ per week, they always last me over 6 months. (Lightweight ones are not as sturdy, but that's to be expected).If you have budget constraints, you can do like I do , and wear cheaper ones for lighter practice runs and  Injinjis for serious drills", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.084758066", "1": "0.39566717", "2": "0.18785901", "3": "0.16689397", "4": "0.08258427", "5": "0.080351986"}}
