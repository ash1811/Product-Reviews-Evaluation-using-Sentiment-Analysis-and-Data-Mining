{"text": "I originally purchased the Beeswax version over 10 years ago in NYC. I dragged them through the rain, snow, slush, and sun; and they were great (minus wet and cold feet). I joined the military, and these sat in storage for 8 years. Pulled them out and slipped them on, and they felt just like the last time. Ditched those, and purchased a brand new pair. Needless to say, I'm still in love. They are stylish, comfortable, and excellent for long walks immediately out of the box.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1324143", "1": "0.27227014", "2": "0.11653184", "3": "0.17668934", "4": "0.12634258", "5": "0.061085805", "6": "0.11466598"}}
