{"text": "I finally broke down and bought the slippers of my dreams - Clarks suede ones with soft fuzzy lining ($55!) and loved them for a little while.  Then they got filthy, the lining became packed down and uncomfortable and they stretched til they were falling off my feet.  Decided to return to Isotoners and now I remember why I used to love them.  Soft, comfortable, WASHABLE!!  Good solid footbed gives great support, sole makes going out for the morning paper easy.  The only thing slightly wrong is that the medium (6.5-7) is a little but shorter than I am used to. (I wear a 7 shoe.)  However it is not enough of a problem to make the slippers uncomfortable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.165992", "1": "0.33657113", "2": "0.101838656", "3": "0.08997493", "4": "0.07206027", "5": "0.11484804", "6": "0.11871502"}}
