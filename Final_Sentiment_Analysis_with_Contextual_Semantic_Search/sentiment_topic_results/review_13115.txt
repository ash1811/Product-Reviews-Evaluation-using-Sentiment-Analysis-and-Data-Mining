{"text": "I bought this because I don't like to walk carrying a purse in the winter.  I live in the city, and it's dark and dreary wanted something a little safer to carry.  I love the size of the bag, my long wallet, my kindle fire and assorted junk fits in fine without being too snug and without flying all over the place.  However, the claspy thing that closes the bag could be so much better, it should be a clicky thing instead because strap completely broke off.  So now I'm once again searching for another bag, wish they could change this bag.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.35475028", "2": "0.20356637", "3": "0.07364367", "4": "0.038451962", "5": "0.16482043", "6": "0.16215037"}}
