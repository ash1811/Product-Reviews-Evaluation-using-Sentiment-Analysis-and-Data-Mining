{"text": "Great color to add to the collection. Own roughly 15 different pairs of New Balance 574s, currently. Have received many comments on the color from people. Make sure to spray with water proof/stain resistance before wearing to ensure long dirt free life. Would recommend to anyone looking for a colorful sneaker. Order a half size larger than you would normally wear as the shoe seems to run small.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15657635", "1": "0.21138543", "2": "0.14962243", "3": "0.3400609", "5": "0.13624479"}}
