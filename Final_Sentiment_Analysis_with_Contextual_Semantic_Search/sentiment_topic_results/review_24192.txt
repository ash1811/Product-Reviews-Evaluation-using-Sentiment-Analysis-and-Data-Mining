{"text": "The reviews seemed to indicate to size up and normally in sports bras sizing up in the band won't hurt you and sizing down in the cup size is common.  I wear a normal 38D bra size and I ordered a 40C.  I usually wear Champion bras but lately I cannot find a good sports bra and then one I liked has been discontinued.  For the first time ever, I did not fill out the cup.  I have the bra hooked on the smallest setting so while I fit into it, I could have easily ordered my normal 38 band.  So for me I should have ordered a 38B.  At least if I reordered this that's what I would order.Things that I like?  Color, light, kind of a meshy fabric that looks like it will breathe and wash well.  I'm hoping that since I'm using this as a sports bra it has some anti stink properties.  It also has a nice amount of adjustability in the straps.  The price is great.Things that are meh so far?  Weird cup sizing.  I fill out the bottom of the cup but the top is wrinkling and gapping.  Technically I am held in and am not bouncing around so unless I wear a skin tight top this won't matter.  For the pricing I won't bother to return it.  I hope this washes up well and if it does this is a really nice buy.  I go thru a lot of sports bras!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12848245", "1": "0.32904875", "3": "0.31674916", "4": "0.11500055", "5": "0.044419345", "6": "0.06387167"}}
