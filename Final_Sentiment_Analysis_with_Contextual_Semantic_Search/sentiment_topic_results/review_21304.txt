{"text": "This is the second pack of Heavenly Heelz I've bought.  I find they're perfect if shoes are slightly large, heels are a little wide or the tops of the shoes have rough edges. They are very smooth without about 1/8&#34; of cushion.  Unlike other heel adhesives I've tried, these stick on the shoes forever.  Well worth the money.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.35062602", "2": "0.27757323", "3": "0.18269682", "4": "0.060027245", "5": "0.08716452", "6": "0.037814666"}}
