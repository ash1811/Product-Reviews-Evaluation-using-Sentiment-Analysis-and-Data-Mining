{"text": "FYI for Carhartt sweatshirts: if you like your shirts to go a little ways past your waist, then order the tall size. I am only 5'10\" and the regular sizes are too short for me. They come exactly to your waist and will bunch up when you sit down or stand up.This is a perfect sweatshirt. These are super thick. They are thicker than the Nike and Adidas hoodies that I have. They are extremely warm and durable. I imagine that these will last for years and years to come. Very high quality.I totally recommend these especially for big and tall men. These are worth every penny. I have no complaints.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.108334646", "1": "0.3039748", "2": "0.13089608", "3": "0.14766766", "4": "0.069395185", "5": "0.120338894", "6": "0.11939269"}}
