{"text": "The kids just love this. Why---no clue. I ordered it because my friend asked me to order it for her daughter, so I ordered 2---one for my daughter as well. We live in the caribbean, where it's hot, so a thick plush backpack is something you don't want to have on your back. The color is cute too, but I can see it easily getting soiled. I didn't let this backpack out of the house, and ended up giving it to another child.I liked the pull-out map feature that comes attached to it though. The flap stays closed with a magnetic closure. Good size.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19984417", "1": "0.27806637", "2": "0.18437096", "3": "0.091021754", "4": "0.16617288", "5": "0.077765204"}}
