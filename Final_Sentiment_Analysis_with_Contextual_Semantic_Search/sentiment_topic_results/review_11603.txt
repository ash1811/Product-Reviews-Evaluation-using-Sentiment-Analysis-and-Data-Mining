{"text": "These were the perfect size for me for everyday wear, very comfortable, too.  I was worried they might be too small, but they were actually a little bigger than I thought they would be. I'm used to 6mm which is also a good size. I've worn them every day since I received them.  So far they seem pretty durable and nice and shiny.  Really glad I purchased these.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15962282", "1": "0.27821377", "3": "0.33198678", "4": "0.07955733", "5": "0.0680866", "6": "0.07885686"}}
