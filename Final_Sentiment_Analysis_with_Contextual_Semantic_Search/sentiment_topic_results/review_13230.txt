{"text": "I ordered the 24 month size for my 18 month old son who is 26 pounds (35th percentile for weight).  I was never able to snap all of the snaps on the side and the legs openings cut into him.  After a few short months, my son would pull at the leg openings while he was wearing it and whine.  I could tell they were too tight on him.  So, I ordered the size 3 (he is still not even 2 years old and he's not a big boy) and it fits well.  Overall, I love not having to buy disposable swim diapers.  These are convenient and do the job.  Order up a size and you should be happy with them!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1398798", "1": "0.3379325", "2": "0.050349817", "3": "0.12602739", "4": "0.10749564", "5": "0.09697077", "6": "0.14134412"}}
