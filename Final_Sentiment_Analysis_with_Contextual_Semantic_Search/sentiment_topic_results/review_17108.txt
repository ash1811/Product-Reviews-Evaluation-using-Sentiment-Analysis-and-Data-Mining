{"text": "I purchased this for my 17 month old.  It is the perfect shoe for him- easy to take off and on, light, washable (with just a hose) and cute.  He loves the soft soled shoes, but these are easy for him to wear also.  And they are just so much easier to get off and on than tennis shoes or even the leather soft shoes.  I highly recommend this for small children.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.2085614", "1": "0.29691675", "2": "0.21078904", "3": "0.080495685", "4": "0.070185706", "6": "0.1290708"}}
