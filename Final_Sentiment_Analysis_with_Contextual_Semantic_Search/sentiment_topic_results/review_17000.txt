{"text": "Have bought this ring twice, the first time it was too small. It is very pretty. The heart and knots are not chunky looking, but instead are very feminine. I use it as a toe ring. It has bent out of the round, but this was a plus for me because now the decoration stays on the top of my toe instead of sliding to the underside. I never take it off.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.42482975", "3": "0.17741388", "4": "0.07049347", "5": "0.22484256", "6": "0.09287491"}}
