{"text": "I want to get a review right up although I can't yet report on wear, to give others an answer to a specific fit question I had:My foot is 10 1/8\" with the second toe 1/8\" longer than the big toe. That would normally be a woman 9.5 or man 8 in US sizing and falls between small and medium in these, on the sizing chart. I read other reviews that suggested these may run just a tad small, and ordered the medium. It is a great fit. Perfect, in fact.I have had other toe socks and am delighted with the superior quality of these, which are 70% Coolmax, 25% Nylon and 10% Lycra. I normally like the moisture absorption of cotton, but over the years have come to be even more fond of the wickingness of Coolmax, and definitely like the durability of Nylon and the lovely caress of Lycra.This isn't quite the right place to report this, but I also want to say that they got here faster than they had any right to! I was reluctant to spend $79 on an Amazon Prime membership but am delighted with it as it is producing not just 2-day shipping but 1-day at times, especially at times when it just so happens that I have a reason for hoping the item will get here really fast.I immediately ordered three more pairs of these socks. Now gotta get some of those fascinating toe shoes...", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14093894", "1": "0.47980344", "2": "0.023173276", "3": "0.09894032", "4": "0.06983573", "5": "0.08808304", "6": "0.099225216"}}
