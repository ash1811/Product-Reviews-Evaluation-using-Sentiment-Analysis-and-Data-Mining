{"text": "I bought these shoes to replace my worn out work shoes. I own a bakery and am on my feet 12 hours a day. These shoes were put to the test the other night when I started work at 2:30 a.m. decorating cakes ,then worked a farmer's market until 1:00 p.m. standing on concrete. Before wrapping up the day, l went shopping for supplies in one of the big box stores - again  on concrete. Finally got to bed at 10:00 p.m. Of course I was tired, but my feet didn't hurt, my legs felt great and no hip or back pain.I love these shoes. My advice? Go for it you weekend hikers!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05035492", "1": "0.16588956", "2": "0.29325515", "3": "0.051199857", "4": "0.09954608", "5": "0.24929546", "6": "0.09045895"}}
