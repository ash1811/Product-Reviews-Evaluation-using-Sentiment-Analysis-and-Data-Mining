{"text": "They arrived a day after the expected date, there was a mishap with the carrier. When I took them out of the bag, they look to be too small, however when I put them on they actually fit. There was a small defect with the plug thingie that holds the sandal straps in place.  It is secure so I decided to keep them. I wish the straps across my feet were a little bit wider because my feet swell. Overall, very cute flopflops. Sturdy and soft. Nice logo on the strap.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.036354423", "1": "0.31367815", "2": "0.19311363", "3": "0.17603591", "4": "0.06817799", "5": "0.12423613", "6": "0.08840381"}}
