{"text": "I bought two of these to wear while I needed to leave my back free to heal from something; they adhere quite well to my skin and fit comfortably; I like that the material is thin (as opposed to the thicker silicone version some other strapless/backless use) and is easy to apply. I am usually a 34C, and run a bit smaller in that cup but not small enough for a 34B; I bought the B here, based on reviews, and am glad I did - those fit just about right. Really smooth under clothing and super comfortable to wear.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10820301", "1": "0.446137", "2": "0.027318329", "3": "0.15374736", "4": "0.021297889", "5": "0.13547316", "6": "0.10782324"}}
