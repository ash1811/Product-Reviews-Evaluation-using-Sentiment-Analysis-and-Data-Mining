{"text": "I purchased four of these yesterday locally and apparently any quality issues that were cited in reviews here have been resolved. The ones I purchased were comfortable, well made and sized correctly.What I love is the feel of real cotton. There is nothing quite like it in my opinion, and Hanes is one of the few brands that still offer underwear in that material. The cotton itself has a weave that is elastic (not just the waistband, but the overall fabric), which adds to the comfort. The stitching is heavy duty, and the seams for the fly front are very well made. These briefs appear to be made to last many wash cycles.I mentioned correct sizing. What I mean by that is some brands claim Medium (my size), but they are either too tight or slightly loose. These briefs fit exactly the way the chart on the packaging claimed.Since the ones I purchased were solid black and solid gray I cannot speak to how well the colors hold up, but mine have already been through one wash cycle and they look brand new. More importantly, there is no premature fraying that plague other brands that I have tried.Bottom line: no complaints about quality from me.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09078737", "1": "0.21807858", "2": "0.04962968", "3": "0.23452348", "4": "0.1832564", "5": "0.08052148", "6": "0.14320303"}}
