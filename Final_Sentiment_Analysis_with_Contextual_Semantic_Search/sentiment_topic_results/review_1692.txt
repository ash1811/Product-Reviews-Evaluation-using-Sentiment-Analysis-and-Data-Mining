{"text": "I wanted a black bra that would still provide lift but made it possible to wear button downs. This bra fits the bill. I will say that it does not look as good with looser (re: no delineation of form), sleeveless tops that have a high neckline because while this bra provides separation and lift, it my breasts are positioned farther apart than I normally prefer. It still keeps them within the frame of my body, which is what you want in a bra, but I do feel wider up top if I wear the above-mentioned tops. I could be having this issue because I decided to try a 30G instead of my normal 32F since whenever I check a calculator, it recommends the former size. The band feels good at a 30, but the cup might not be quite right. This is probably good evidence that you should always try on bras or their brands in-store before ordering online with a vendor that doesn't have the best return policy. If I had ordered this bra strictly through Amazon with Prime shipping, I might have returned it for a different size just to check if it was the bra itself or the fit. Overall though, great bra, well-made, and attractive. I will buy Fantasie bras in the future.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07533499", "1": "0.16591069", "2": "0.04511499", "3": "0.39883664", "4": "0.03703861", "5": "0.13462977", "6": "0.14313431"}}
