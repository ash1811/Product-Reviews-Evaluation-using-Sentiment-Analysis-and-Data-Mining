{"text": "My mother likes her new vest.  It fits her perfectly with a little room for thicker tops, shirts or sweaters.  The fabric is warm, soft, plush, and the zipper zips smoothly. There is a flap (under) on one side of the zipper so that when you zip the vest up, the wind cannot get in.The 2 pockets have zipper closures.  These pockets are great and inside there are 2 pockets made from the outside pockets.We have not wash the vest so I don't know how it will hold up to washings.  Some fleece balls up after a few washings.  We hope that this vest will keep its shape and look.  Thank U.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13152054", "1": "0.24275982", "2": "0.14628498", "3": "0.2956241", "4": "0.08591597", "6": "0.095460996"}}
