{"text": "I have had a terrible problem with most all my previously bought underwear lately and that is they all CRAWL UP MY BUTT!!!  I HATE it!!!  I carefully read a lot of women's underwear reviews and chose these since many said they didn't creep up.  Well, I've been wearing them for for a couple of weeks now and have NOT noticed them inching up.  They seem to stay pretty much in place.  My backside is normal, not large not small.......I guess my choice in drawers in the past has been awful.  I'm 5' 10\"\", and weigh around 150 lbs so you can see that I don't have an unusually large derriere. I bought size 8 and though they remind me a bit of \"granny bloomers\", they fit good enough and I'm not  reaching behind me anymore to pull them out of my crack.I don't care what colors the underwear are or even what they're made out of as long as they aren't made out of Mexican rat hair.  As long as they don't creep up they are fine with me.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16242522", "1": "0.2724149", "2": "0.027879598", "3": "0.2536832", "4": "0.23696366", "5": "0.044287212"}}
