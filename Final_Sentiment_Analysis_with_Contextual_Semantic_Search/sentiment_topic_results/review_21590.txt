{"text": "It's interesting that the chest is not shown from different angles because from the back, you see everything so clearly.  From the front, the pretty inset of the drawers makes the contents a little less obvious but you'll quickly remember what items you have in each drawer by placing pieces in the front.  Unusual flexibility in being able to remove any or all of the black cushiony inserts.  You can see down into more drawers if you remove some but they add clarity if you use them.  Eye-level or a little lower provides the best view of all contents.  I love how compact and shallow the drawers are.  I have several other clear plastic drawers for jewelry but they're so deep, it's a jumble in there unless you waste a lot of space.  With 7 drawers you can fit all but the most chunky necklaces.  Best jewelry box design and material I've seen.  Highly recommend.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.070605576", "1": "0.2616546", "2": "0.25392172", "3": "0.08691161", "4": "0.12983051", "5": "0.052916788", "6": "0.14415923"}}
