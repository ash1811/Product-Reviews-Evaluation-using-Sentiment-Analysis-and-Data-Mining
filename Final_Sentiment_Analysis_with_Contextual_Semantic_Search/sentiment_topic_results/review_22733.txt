{"text": "I love the idea of this hat, but it took me a while to figure out the difference between the Infant vs Baby vs Child vs Youth sizes.  Here is what I have learned:Infant - does NOT have the mesh on the sides or the sizing adjuster on the back - 18-20\"Baby - does NOT have the mesh on the sides or the sizing adjuster on the back - 19.75-21.75\"Child - does have the mesh on the sides and sizing adjuster on the back - 20.5-22.5\"Youth - does have the mesh on the sides and sizing adjuster on the back - 21.75-23\"I have 18 month old twins.  I have read from other posts that the infant and baby sizes are too big.  Therefore even though the Child size is supposed to be for 2-5 years, I bought the Child size.  When I adjust the Child hat to make it as small as possible, it is 19.5\".  Given the sizes of the Infant and Baby hats - 19.5 works!  I want to be able to adjust the hat, and the 2 inch margin is just too large on the Infant/Baby hats without the adjustment!Therefore, if your child's head is anywhere around 19\" or bigger, I would get the Child size and pass on the Infant/Baby sizes.  It will be big, but at least there is an adjustment to grow into it.  And if you are worried about the break-away strap, the strap on the Child size IS a break-away strap.Update: So I used these hats on a 2 week vacation at the beach.  My kids will fight any hat.  When I first put them on, they fight me, but then they forget they are wearing it.  I was worried that the break-away strap would be too 'flimsy' but it wasn't.  It stayed secure when the kids tried to pull their hat off.  Just like the kids initially fight the hat, they also fight sunscreen.  And I really appreciated that they didn't get their face/head/neck burnt at all during that 2 week period - even when the kids 'won' and weren't wearing sunscreen.Now, having said all that - I received a 'defective' hat.  I might not have even known it was defective, except for the fact that I bought two.  On the 'good hat' the strap does not have any loose ends.  On the defective hat, the strap end is not sewed up and away.  The impact: in order to adjust the size of the strap I have to take the hat off and play with the straps to tighten or loosen the strap; and the strap just dangles and hangs under the chin.  Versus on the, good hat there is no dangling and I can adjust the strap while it is on their head.  Can I live with it because I don't want to deal with sending it back?  Yes.  But I am slightly irked...  I bought the defective one for around $14, and I am wondering if that was the reason for the price difference?UPDATE:  Just a quick FYI, another person put a 'comment' on my review (dated May 28, 2014) that REI has an updated version of the infant hat with the adjustment on the back.  I thought this might be helpful, so I am including this on my review.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.19637765", "1": "0.1445883", "2": "0.11488036", "3": "0.15446138", "4": "0.20817114", "5": "0.041711472", "6": "0.13980971"}}
