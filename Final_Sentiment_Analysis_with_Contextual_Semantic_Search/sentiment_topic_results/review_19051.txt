{"text": "I initially wrote a review where I stated that this bra ran a little small, but actually it doesn't.  I guess I thought I wore a 36C but actually I wear a 38C and had ordered the wrong size (after looking at my other bra labels which were 38C).  I plan on keeping these bras as I'm ,in the process of losing weight anyway, so they will fit even better then.  But, this bra feels just marvelous and soft. I will be wearing these under sun dresses that I plan to wear while in Europe this summer, and I don't want to have to worry about straps falling or the underwires binding my ribcage. 5 stars from me!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.053361055", "1": "0.17610042", "2": "0.23777382", "3": "0.19541363", "4": "0.057507854", "5": "0.18146032", "6": "0.09838293"}}
