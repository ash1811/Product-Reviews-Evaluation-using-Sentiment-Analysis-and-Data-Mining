{"text": "The only boot that will do in serious snow and real cold!  Clunky, yes!  Heavy, yes!  WARM feet, YES!  Wish these were still made in Canada; quality has gone down some.  But, still better than anything else I've tried.  Good in snow and cold.  (I live in the upper Midwest!)  Run just a little on the big side to accommodate liner socks with thick wool socks and/or additional insoles.  After a winter season or so, of use, they soften up/loosen up some, mold to your feet a bit and are a little easier to put on/walk in.  Tread is very good for snow, fair on ice. Since, in my opinion, common sense and warm feet ARE fashionable, I like the way they look.  There is a comforting feeling wearing these boots.  They are too expensive, especially since they are made in China/Vietnam, now.  The Canadian-made versions I have were about half the cost and of better quality.  Extra boot liners are available, if you can find them; also, too expensive now.  But, nice to have, so one pair can air out, while you wear the other pair.  Good for everyday, general use and most outdoor/work applications.  (Sorel Glaciers are still better for extreme cold, sedentary conditions, such as ice fishing/snowmobiling.)  Will buy again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06449636", "1": "0.23551112", "2": "0.16115062", "3": "0.18732522", "4": "0.07203009", "5": "0.24851188", "6": "0.030974748"}}
