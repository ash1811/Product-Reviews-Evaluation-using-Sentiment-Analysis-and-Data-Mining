{"text": "These slippers are very nice looking.  They also help keep my feet warm.  Paying a little extra pays off.  The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 stars was because the size was off.  My slippers are marked what I ordered but must be at least one size too big.  On occasion one of the slippers come off my foot while going up the steps.  I can do an adjustment with the raw hide laces. Overall I would buy them again and recommend them to my friends.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3662498", "3": "0.13449651", "4": "0.20686346", "5": "0.12281822", "6": "0.16344535"}}
