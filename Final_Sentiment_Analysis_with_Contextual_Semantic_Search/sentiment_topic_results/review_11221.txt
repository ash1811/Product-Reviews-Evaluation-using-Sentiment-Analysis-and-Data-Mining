{"text": "Mine are different than what the picture shows. The primary differences are:1) there is a seam straight up the middle of the boots, from toe to the cuff...the picture appears to be a single, unseamed mold.2) the outer sides of the boots are embossed with \"Made in Mexico\"...it is part of the mold.I believe that the above are simply aesthetic, and will not affect the function.Mine were a bit snug, since I ordered Men's Size 11 (I usually take a 11.5 to 12 Men's) based on most reviews saying they came a little big. If I were in a shoe store, I'd try on the 12's...but it's not worth a return, since I can live with it for the work I plan to do.Mine were also missing one (yes, just one) of the innersoles, so I bought a new pair to insert myself.Overall, at this price, you can't go wrong...just keep in mind that yours may not be as finished looking as they appear in the current photo.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.28407544", "2": "0.12914374", "3": "0.09514543", "4": "0.229989", "6": "0.25694013"}}
