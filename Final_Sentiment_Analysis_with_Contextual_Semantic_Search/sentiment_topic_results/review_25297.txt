{"text": "I bought these to replace a similar but not identical Merrill product I bought a number of years ago that had worn out.  The earlier shoe's liner in the heel area had worn out, exposing my heel to something that was stiff and had an edge and would have caused a blister with continued use.  These new shoes are quite comfortable.  The one difference I noticed is the box for the toes is a little wider.  So far, in about 1.5 months of use, the new shoes have been fine. I would say that these are not a good choice for carrying a heavy backpack on a rough trail.  They are more for walking and groomed trails.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.042971388", "1": "0.21394859", "2": "0.32621285", "3": "0.15034817", "4": "0.06518273", "5": "0.08226742", "6": "0.119068846"}}
