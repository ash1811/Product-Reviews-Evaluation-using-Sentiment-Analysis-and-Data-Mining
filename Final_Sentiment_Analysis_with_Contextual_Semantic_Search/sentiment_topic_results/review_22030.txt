{"text": "I was so excited when my Gascan sunglasses showed up, then it all went down hill.  They have the worst fit of any pair of sunglasses I have ever owned.  I am a regular size guy, but these fit so loose and they slide down my nose and will not stay up and stay put.  If you're an athletic person, you are going to spend a lot of time pushing these glasses back up on your face.  For the money these are a \"joke.\"  My advice would be to go try these own some place, don't buy them from the Internet.  If you try them on and they fit, then you can go back to the Internet and find a decent price.  This was my second pair of Oakley's and I probably will not buy this brand again.  The only positive is that optically, the lenses are flawless.  However, the fit has a lot to do with a pair of sunglasses.  I now use them as safety glasses when I am sharpening a lawn mower blade on the grinder.  That's it!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08702647", "1": "0.30065197", "2": "0.086191505", "3": "0.32096174", "4": "0.17252873", "6": "0.029712535"}}
