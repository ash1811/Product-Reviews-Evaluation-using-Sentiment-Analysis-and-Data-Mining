{"text": "My mother is almost 100 years old and practically lives in these slippers, which I have purchased in three colors.  They are comfortable, sturdy, non-slip (now, the first pair a few years ago wasn't non-slip), and attractive.  The toe is deep enough for older, thicker toenails, and the Velcro closure suits days when feet are swollen.  This is a well-made slipper and wears well.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.037346363", "1": "0.41883877", "2": "0.13307272", "3": "0.055796318", "4": "0.1794753", "6": "0.17169937"}}
