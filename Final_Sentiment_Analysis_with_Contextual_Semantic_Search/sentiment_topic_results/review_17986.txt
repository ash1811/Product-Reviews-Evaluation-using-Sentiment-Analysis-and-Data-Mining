{"text": "The Casio Men's World Time Watch (Model AW80-7AV) has a couple of compelling good points: first, it is very cheap and does have numerous features (though many of them are of questionable value); second, it seems to be reasonably accurate. If this is all you care about, this could be a good watch for you.The watch has several cons to be wary of, however. It is very light (which is actually a plus) but the band is extremely thin and flimsy. In other words, it is cheap and looks it. More annoying though is the very dim light for use in low light: it is completely inadequate and makes the functionality in the inset digital portion of the face next to worthless; the lack of contrast between the hands and watch face also contribute to the legibility issue. Most irritatingly, though, is that it doesn't have a set knob, even for the analog hands. I fly for a living and frequently cross back and forth between time zones. I had read that the watch could only be set in a forward direction, which was annoying but not a deal breaker. What is not evident is the lack of a setting knob, which means that each time you need to change the time (or do anything else, for that matter) you have to use an array of complex inputs with the four buttons which is not only very time consuming (the watch advances in 20 second increments), but also requires consultation with the ridiculously complex and thick instruction manual.While this watch may be suitable for people who don't cross time zones frequently, use it in daylight, and don't mind referring to the manual frequently (or memorizing a huge quantity of mundane, unintuitive minutiae), for anyone else, and especially for frequent travelers, I recommend finding another watch.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1444402", "1": "0.12732281", "2": "0.27557367", "3": "0.05989753", "4": "0.2460981", "6": "0.14443086"}}
