{"text": "These boots are not only great looking they are the most comfortable boots I own. Wore them in this last blizzard when it was well below 0 degrees and I did feel a little cold in the toes but hey, it was exceptionally cold. I do have one fear and that is seeing the video and other ratings about the rubber splitting from the leather. If this doesn't happen the boots deserve the 5 star. If they split I'll be very disappointed to say the least..", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2843504", "2": "0.16172421", "3": "0.15978698", "4": "0.23146461", "6": "0.15512824"}}
