{"text": "Bought these for my 13 year old niece...she asked for nice casual kicks and she already has a bunch of TOMS shoes, so I figured these would fit the bill.  Easy on, easy off, pretty classy.  The color is great because it goes with everything.  The fit was perfect and she said they are super comfy.  She was happy so I am happy....what more can you say when you're shopping for a 13 year old?", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.33262715", "2": "0.1568976", "3": "0.17202291", "5": "0.16574718", "6": "0.16552418"}}
