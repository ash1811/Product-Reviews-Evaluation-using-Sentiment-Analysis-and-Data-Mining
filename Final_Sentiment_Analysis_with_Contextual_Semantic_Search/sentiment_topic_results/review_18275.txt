{"text": "I have gotten this model of Casio for years. It is inexpensive and has some nice features. I like the alarm that you can set for 1,3,5,10,15,20 and 30 minutes. And it has a timer that I use on my walks that has a stop-start feature, so I can keep track of actual walking time. I originally got it because I am allergic to nickel alloys and this watch has no metal except the stainless steel backing. The appearance is certainly acceptable as well.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16145435", "1": "0.18044847", "2": "0.11376986", "3": "0.13524938", "4": "0.20989853", "5": "0.032771245", "6": "0.16640817"}}
