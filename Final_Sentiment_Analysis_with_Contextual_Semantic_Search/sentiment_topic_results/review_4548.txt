{"text": "These pants feel comfortable, but the pockets are very short.  How short?  My keys tend to sit right at the bend in  my upper legs when I sit and my legs go numb.  The pockets are about 3/4 the size of other jean pockets.  This is a show stopper for me, because I always have to carry two sets of keys with me.  Other than that, the pants are comfortable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.093604", "1": "0.44338015", "2": "0.11214105", "4": "0.122236416", "5": "0.06622388", "6": "0.15831923"}}
