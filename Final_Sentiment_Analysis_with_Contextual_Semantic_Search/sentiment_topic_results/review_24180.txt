{"text": "I originally reviewed this bra with somewhat optimistic undertones, stating that maybe it would stretch over time, or I would get used to it. But after owning it for six months, I grimly see it for what it is.-About 2 sizes too small-Unpadded-Utterly uncomfortable-A waste of money.This is mostly on me, because I didn't read the comments first. Other users have warned about these things, and if I'd read them, I would've skipped this one over. I was really looking forward to using this thing, because it's so much easier to buckle from the front. But every time I wore it, I was squirming, and tugging at it to try to get some slack, and it left squeeze marks under the bustline each time. Not to mention that the complete lack of padding made for no protection, and therefore no comfort. Also, the lines that go up the breasts show through certain shirts. If you're looking for a front buckling bra, keep looking because there are far better ones out there, and this one is NO GOOD!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2374923", "1": "0.110106446", "2": "0.07832733", "3": "0.25896204", "4": "0.12552781", "5": "0.103106156", "6": "0.0864779"}}
