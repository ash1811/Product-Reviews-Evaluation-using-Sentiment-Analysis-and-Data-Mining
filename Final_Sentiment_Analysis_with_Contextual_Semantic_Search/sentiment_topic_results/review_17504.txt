{"text": "Purchased this watch to replace two broken resin case wrist watches that broke with a few weeks of light use.  Took a bit of time to learn how to use the clasp on the watch band (last stainless steel band watch was purchased in early 1970's and had different type of fastening feature -- subsequent watches had buckle).  Have very small wrist and the band adjustment is convenient.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18499741", "1": "0.15174186", "2": "0.2578469", "3": "0.093848094", "4": "0.16900209", "5": "0.08230841", "6": "0.060255237"}}
