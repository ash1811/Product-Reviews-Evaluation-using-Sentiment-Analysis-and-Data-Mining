{"text": "I purchased this item and never before did I have muffin top thighs. So, I cut the tops off and because the length was a little long they still worked with my garters. I'm a bit weird about things and really don't like to throw away things, so I sewed the two tops I cut off together so the rubber touched and used that as a choker and added some detail. sounds strange, but I got plenty of praise from my girls and it looked great with a low cut top.After a few uses of these, I can tell I will be recycling them for some other weird use I can find online. Other than that, my man loved the fishnet look and so my search for the right brand continues.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16824788", "1": "0.28147766", "2": "0.046775937", "3": "0.2820092", "4": "0.053763464", "5": "0.098403275", "6": "0.06932257"}}
