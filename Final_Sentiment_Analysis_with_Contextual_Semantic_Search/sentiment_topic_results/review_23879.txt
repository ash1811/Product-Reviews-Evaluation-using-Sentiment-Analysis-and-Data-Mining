{"text": "I've gained a bit of weight since breaking my back, and since I am 5'8&#34; tall, it's always been a struggle to find jeans that fit and were long enough. I've never bought jeans without trying them on either, so this was a first for me.These jeans fit perfect! It's like they were made just for me, and I love the partial elastic waist. I don't have anything bad to say, can't find anything that would need improvement. They fit me perfectly, even after washing them. I will absolutely buy more soon!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.3907351", "2": "0.17980273", "3": "0.09254819", "5": "0.27168268", "6": "0.059920475"}}
