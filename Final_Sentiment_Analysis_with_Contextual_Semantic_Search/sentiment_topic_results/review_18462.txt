{"text": "Let me preface my review with my story. I've had plantar fascititis for several months now ... it's getting better, but my feet still hurt from time to time. I've spent a fortune trying to find a comfortable shoe I can wear for hours. I've bought two pairs of Chaco's, two pairs of Tevas, a pair of Jambu,Merrills, Clarks ... you get the picture. Nothing really worked for me.After reading the reviews for the Montrail Molokini, I decided to take the plung and order a pair. I am so glad I did! These are the most comfortable shoes I've found in a long time. I haven't baked and shaped them, but plan to do that soon. Even without the custom fit, they are awesome. I highly recommend these to anyone in need of comfy summer sandals. I did have to order up a size (thanks to the reviews I knew I needed to) ... I usually wear an 8 or 8 1/2 and purchased the 9. They fit great!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.025002867", "1": "0.30840018", "2": "0.071861975", "3": "0.27697375", "4": "0.07796976", "5": "0.06595495", "6": "0.17383651"}}
