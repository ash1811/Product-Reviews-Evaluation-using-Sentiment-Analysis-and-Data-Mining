{"text": "The fit on these t-shirts are ludicrous. I ordered a small and what I received would be considered a large had I ordered it from Gap or Land's End. While I am by no means tiny, Carhartt's version of the venerable t-shirt is only a couple notches shy of a gown on my frame. You gotta be a big corn-fed American boy to sport one of these.Running it through the dryer made it worse; the neck hole shrank but the other dimensions remained almost unchanged. Even the pocket sits forlornly off to the side, as if seeking the shelter of my armpit. This is possibly the most awkward t-shirt I've ever bought.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.062601656", "1": "0.2870331", "2": "0.28461882", "3": "0.11817791", "4": "0.105573654", "5": "0.025838008", "6": "0.11615684"}}
