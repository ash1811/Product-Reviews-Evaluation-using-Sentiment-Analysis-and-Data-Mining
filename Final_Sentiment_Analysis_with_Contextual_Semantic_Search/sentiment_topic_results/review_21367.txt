{"text": "According to sizing I should order size Small and I think it would fit, but I have a Medium and it works on the lowest setting. I am 32 weeks pregnant and weight 160 lb right now (5'6\") and the measurement under my belly (where the belt suppose to be) is about 38 inches. The lowest setting on medium belt is 34\", second one is at 37.5\" and last one is at 41\". The belt is very good quality, firm and stretches a bit for a great support. It doesn't cause any pain. I think I won't grow under my belly much and might use this setting till the end. But if I would put more fat and the second setting will be too lose, than I might use those bra extenders. I actually have 2 of them from maternity store, they're not perfect fit with the belt hooks, but it will do, I tried-it took some force to fit (the hooks on belt are tough). So in between sizes won't be a big deal, especially that not too much time left:)I don't have much pain in my back when I move, still working out at the gym and walk a lot-which helps tremendously with joint pain. My problem with lower back pain starts when I lie in bed and get up in the morning or to use bathroom at night, sometimes I need few seconds to stay stable on my legs. I will sleep tonight in my belt and see if it'll help. But just wearing belt during the day makes walking more comfortable, I can see the difference when I take the belt off, so that was great purchase overall. Although I try to wear it as little as possible as muscles get use to relief and might become weaker.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11153769", "1": "0.2959661", "2": "0.22800712", "3": "0.27115875", "5": "0.047748137", "6": "0.04329632"}}
