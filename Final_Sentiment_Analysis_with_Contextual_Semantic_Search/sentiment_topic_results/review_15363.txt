{"text": "This was my first pair of \"expensive\" sunglasses. Totally worth it, make sure you take care of them.These were recommended to me by a lady friend and they look great. Make sure they compliment the shape of your face before buying, not everyone can pull off every style of sunglasses.I went car shopping and the salesmen looked at them and said \"you look like you have good credit.\" Ha! There is something to be said about the Ray-Ban name. Once you buy these you'll notice how bad some of the knockoff wayfarers look.Unfortunately I lost my pair in the Pacific ocean :-( and I'm probably going to buy another pair! There are lots of other colors and styles of Ray-Ban wayfarer so don't limit yourself to black!.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.056980915", "1": "0.2851325", "2": "0.23571162", "3": "0.116046265", "4": "0.14599866", "5": "0.12236738", "6": "0.03776269"}}
