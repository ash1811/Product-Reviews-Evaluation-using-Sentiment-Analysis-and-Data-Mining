{"text": "These shoes are cool. They look cool, feel cool , and any one who wheres them is cool just by association . I normally where an 11.5 athletic shoes , and for that matter in all shoes, so I ordered an 11.5 and guess what ? They fit. They have a little bit of heft to them , but that is in part due to the gum rubber soles which hold tight in anything I have walked on. It took a couple days to where them in but it was worth the wait for one of the most comfortable shoes in the universe . So, in summation , they are cool.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09620107", "1": "0.20892107", "2": "0.23705965", "3": "0.043466117", "4": "0.14467908", "5": "0.21724336", "6": "0.052429665"}}
