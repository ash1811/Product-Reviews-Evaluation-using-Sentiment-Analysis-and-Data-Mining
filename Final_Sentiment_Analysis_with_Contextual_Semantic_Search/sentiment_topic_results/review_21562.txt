{"text": "I bought this because I found myself wearing the same 10 pairs of earrings and I was tired of it. I had no idea I had almost 100 pairs of earrings and when I found this organizer I knew that it would work for me. I spent quite a while organizing all of my earrings in some kind of pattern to make it easier to find them but frankly because I leave the stand on display on my vanity I can quickly find what I am looking for especially if I'm trying to match a necklace. The organizer also folds completely with my earrings on it if at some point I decide to put it in a drawer. I look forward to using this for many years to come.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16533266", "1": "0.3207559", "2": "0.12815553", "3": "0.19003637", "4": "0.12613276", "6": "0.06682199"}}
