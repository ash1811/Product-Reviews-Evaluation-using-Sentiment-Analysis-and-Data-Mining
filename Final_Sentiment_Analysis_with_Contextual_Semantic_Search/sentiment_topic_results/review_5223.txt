{"text": "The Isotoner Ballerina Slipper is beyond a doubt, the best slipper I have ever worn. I like the satin slipper the best and just bought a pair in ruby red, love the color.  They fit my feet like a dream, stay on my foot and are like a second skin.  I wear a size 10W shoe and I buy the XL slipper and it fits perfectly.  No complaints at all.  I hope they always have this slipper available.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.37976253", "2": "0.109887354", "4": "0.14561902", "6": "0.35496688"}}
