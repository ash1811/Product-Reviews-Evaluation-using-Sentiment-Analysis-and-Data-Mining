The thick sturdy sole offers good traction, and the padded collar is easy on the ankles.  If I were to offer any complain, it would be that the thicker sole takes away a little bit from the sophisticated, leather-soled look that you might get in a traditionally made dress shoe.  The sole is by no means 'clunky'... simply thicker than a leather sole.  They look great when worn with dress pants, and that was all I needed them to be!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09199908", "1": "0.39422882", "2": "0.11255416", "3": "0.23827961", "6": "0.15771006"}}
