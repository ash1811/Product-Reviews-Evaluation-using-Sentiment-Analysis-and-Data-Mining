{"text": "This is a perfect tub toy for young kids.  My daughter is 6.  I can see where if you bought this for a 3 year old it may or may not hold her attention, but my 6 year old loves them.  She can play the songs and she learns about music theory while having fun.  It's a great toy and well made!!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.22495921", "1": "0.41065866", "2": "0.05287288", "3": "0.13125128", "4": "0.11003502", "5": "0.0657532"}}
