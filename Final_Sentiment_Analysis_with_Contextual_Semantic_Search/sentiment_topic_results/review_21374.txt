{"text": "There seems to be some size discrepancy among posters, I was worried about getting a small. Im 32 weeks, have a modest baby bump, not huge, not small.SIZE:Im 5,6&#34;, pregnant weight ~ 155 *or so* (prepreg 118 so Ive gained a good amount already) and SMALL fits PERFECT. Im on 2nd hooks, belt will work till Im done. I would say it is exactly in given range.REASON/NEED: I got it for support and hopefully reducing further diastasis recti. It at least feels like its meeting my needs. I feel support, I like it.Only issue: It gives me support when walking around, but do know it is just a piece of wide elastic with hooks. I sew and at first I was irritated, knowing I could have made it for $4. Then I remembered I didnt want to make it, so I dont care how simple--it helps and meets my need.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.058305983", "1": "0.12601957", "2": "0.0958664", "3": "0.21930343", "4": "0.20168675", "5": "0.14580643", "6": "0.1530114"}}
