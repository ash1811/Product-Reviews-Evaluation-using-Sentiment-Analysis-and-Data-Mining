{"text": "This is my first time purchasing Dickies brand blue jeans. I purchased the regular fit 5 pocket rigid jean. I selected them, because they seem to get good reviews and they were very inexpensive and still NOT made in China. The 38&#34; waist was true to size even after washing. The 30 inch length was also fine, even after washing. They seem to be a good thick denim and well made with large pockets. The golden yellow thread is a little bright and over pronounced for my taste, but not too bad. When I first got them, they were very stiff. Maybe this is the &#34;Rigid&#34; part. Since I am new to Dickie, I just don't know. The one thing I would say is they seem to be very baggy or roomy everywhere else. I don't like a tight jean fit, but this is a little too baggy for me. They say they will fit over a boot, but these were soo loose, I could where the boot to my crotch and have room to spare. I didn't want to give them an unfair review because they seem like a good Jean, just too loose for my taste and maybe its because of the style I purchased. Feedback is appreciated for those more experienced in purchasing Dickies brand blue jeans.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04289165", "1": "0.22588089", "2": "0.24251829", "3": "0.24573298", "4": "0.05933794", "5": "0.1631484", "6": "0.020489829"}}
