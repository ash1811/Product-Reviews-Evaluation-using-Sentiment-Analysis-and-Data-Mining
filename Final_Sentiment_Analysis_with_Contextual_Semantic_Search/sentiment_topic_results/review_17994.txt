{"text": "I am glad that this watch doesn't look like a $20 cheap watch.The metal band is one of the key reason for me to choose this watch. I don't want watches with plastic or leather band. I know metal band is a little bit tricky to resize. The manual does not mention about how to resize the band. I am a handy person with some precision tools around. Even so, it still took me about half hour to resize the metal band. I can  imagine that some people will need a trip to a watch store to resize the band. I don't count this as a negative point. But people need to know this ahead.  The setting procedures are very similar to other electronic watches. It should be very straightforward for people that had prior electronic watch experience.The 10 year battery life is definitely a plus.In summary, for around $20, this is definitely a great buy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17981015", "1": "0.11731546", "2": "0.2664511", "3": "0.04337977", "4": "0.25463668", "5": "0.04696937", "6": "0.09143749"}}
