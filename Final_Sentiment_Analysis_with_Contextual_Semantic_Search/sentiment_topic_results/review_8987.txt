{"text": "Love this bra. It indeed is made for shallow breasts/small cups. I ordered this in a 38b and c. I've gotten and tried on the 38b. It's a tiny bit snug around the band like I expected it to be because of the reviews and other comments but it was super comfortable. It lies flat against my ski slope shaped boobs and although the cup stays in place no matter if I'm bending over or moving, my areoles slightly pop out, not enough to be an issue, however, if am going to try the 38c when it arrives and see if the cup fits better because if it does, I'll exchange the 38b for a c. I love this bra though!!! Finally a hang cup made for my type of breast that doesn't wrinkle or pop out anywhere. We need more of theses I'm buying one in every color!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07161856", "1": "0.2312843", "2": "0.06910218", "3": "0.22564948", "4": "0.19780761", "5": "0.100580744", "6": "0.10395713"}}
