{"text": "While there is always some minor variations as the years have turned, I have been a fan of Rocport shoes for the past 20 years now.  I often wear them into the ground (probably for longer than I should) and they always have been a stylish, comfortable shoe.  Great when you have to put a lot of milage on in a day, as these shoes are just about as good to wear as my running shoes, yet be acceptable for less dressy days at the office.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16434336", "1": "0.20189506", "2": "0.23145284", "3": "0.07486353", "4": "0.040134404", "5": "0.1027961", "6": "0.18451472"}}
