{"text": "Even though my feet aren't wide (that's what shoe salespeople tell me), I bought the 'W' size and I'm very pleased with the fit.The shoes are very comfortable and I didn't have to break them in.I bought the Nubuck (looks like brushed leather) which gives them a more casual look and the shoes can be worn with jeans, khakis or just about anything but a 3 piece suit.  Sometimes I want to go out with jeans but don't want to look like a slob with sneakers and these shoes are perfect.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07276801", "1": "0.18036886", "2": "0.3323762", "4": "0.0789954", "5": "0.23562443", "6": "0.096871756"}}
