{"text": "My son (3yrs) had the Thomas Boots (\"Choo Choo boots\") last year and has worn them out completely! The Fireman boots will be a Christmas present this year and will replace his old Choo Choo boots. Once he figured out he could get in and out of them himself - he slips them on all the time and wears them year-round! They did not do well when he went puddle jumping - \"note to self - put rain pants over boots\" - they filled with water from him splashing it in from the tops!!! Simple rookie parenting mistake!!! After one year they still fit - upsized them on purchase - larger didn't matter to him he could kick them off real easy! The backs split recently - but these were heavily used - I just taped them up and they are good as new! He will love the Fireman Boots!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.120126426", "1": "0.15447254", "2": "0.08979949", "3": "0.13274941", "4": "0.24914706", "6": "0.25119144"}}
