{"text": "I received my FIRST pair of Skechers and tried them on. They fit great! Not a complaint to be found on this product. Size is great, maybe a smidge on the wide side and I ordered the regular size M size. They are very comfortable and I always can tell immediately after putting on a pair of new shoes. These are a great pair of shoes. Glad I purchased them and at a good price as well.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.052191693", "1": "0.42560095", "2": "0.105461545", "3": "0.31193465", "5": "0.07318139", "6": "0.027852228"}}
