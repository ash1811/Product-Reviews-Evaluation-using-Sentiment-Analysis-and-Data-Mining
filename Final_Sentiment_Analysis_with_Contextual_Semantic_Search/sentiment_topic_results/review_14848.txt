{"text": "Finally! A comfortable strapless bra! I am a 40C and ordered the xlarge and it was perfect for me. No sagging, no muffin underarms. The modesty pads are separate from each other so you can adjust to each girl. Very comfortable material, breathes with you. Hate the handwashing but its worth it for this bra. You wont be dissapointed. AND it comes with tiny little straps you could use if you needed but why bother? This is the first bra that hasnt rode up in the back. Everything stays where it should. AWESOME!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13002251", "1": "0.18680592", "2": "0.12584348", "3": "0.13672929", "4": "0.11727895", "5": "0.0765285", "6": "0.22679138"}}
