{"text": "I mostly wear Levi's 501 Shrink-to-Fit jeans nowadays and have for years, but I purchased a pair of pre-shrunk 501's because I liked the wash. The color/wash I purchased was called \"Aged Perfect\", which looked like an indigo jean worn for about a year in the pictures. The actual color/wash was close this time, but it looked more contrived then in the pictures. This is fairly typical and it wasn't that far off, this time, but it would have been better if it didn't look like someone had accidentally left a belt sander on them.Another reason I purchased them was because this particular color/wash offered a heavy fabric weight of 12.5 ounces, which doesn't compare to Levi's of the past, but is heavier then many offered today. This is the same fabric weight offered for most shrink-to-fit models, but even though I knew it would seem less heavy due to all the distressing and washing, I'm still amazed by how much lighter they seem compared to my STF's, even after my STF's are well worn and have no starch left in them. And yet, they're still heavier then most colors/washes of pre-washed 501's, and better too, in my opinion.The fit is quite good, although they seem a little roomier then in the past. Unfortunately, I'm so used to buying my STF size that I forgot the sizing is different with pre-washed 501's. This isn't a problem for the waist, but unlike washed STF's, the inseam is about 2\" too long. This isn't a huge deal, because I like the idea of having them tailored to fit better, anyway.Overall, I'm mostly pleased with them, but I still prefer STF's and probably won't be buying another pair of these anytime soon.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22280765", "1": "0.34211585", "4": "0.12510526", "5": "0.11355129", "6": "0.19178358"}}
