{"text": "I can totally attest to the fact that these shoes are outstanding.  I bought these shoes as an light hiking shoe option for an Italy trip a few weeks ago.  They were pressed into heavy duty service however when DELTA AIRLINES LOST MY LUGGAGE.  No, I'm not bitter.  In the BAG THAT  DELTA AIRLINES LOST  were the hiking boots that I intended to use for a 4 day hiking trip in the Italian Alps.  Since I could either use these light hikers or skip the trip, I decided to take a chance use these.  Imagine my surprise when I was able to travel comfortably and blister-free over several miles and a few thousand feet of elevation gain/loss per day.  They provided good support and ventilation.  I can honestly say that these hiking shoes are the most comfortable hiking shoes I have owned.  I would highly recommend them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19147192", "1": "0.091524996", "2": "0.12163372", "3": "0.1418639", "4": "0.24454369", "5": "0.062156353", "6": "0.14680539"}}
