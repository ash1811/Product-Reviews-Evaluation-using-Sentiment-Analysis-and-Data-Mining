{"text": "Nothing negative to say about the glasses.The construction seems to be durable since the frames rack very little under stress and the hinges have a solid feel instead of being flimsy. They sit very comfortably on the nose and aren't too tight behind the ear.All of the designators of authenticity are there, as is to be expected with a pair or Ray-Ban's sold by Amazon.Overall, I would suggest to a friend and would have no issue with buying another pair again in the future.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06404666", "1": "0.11244979", "2": "0.025509175", "3": "0.16801561", "4": "0.2606684", "5": "0.2566574", "6": "0.11265295"}}
