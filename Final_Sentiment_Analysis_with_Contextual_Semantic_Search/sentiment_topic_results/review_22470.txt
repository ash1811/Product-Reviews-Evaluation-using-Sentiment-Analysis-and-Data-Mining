{"text": "Its hard to find regular Dickies work pants these days and if you do find them, they seem to only have 2 maybe 3 colors available if youre lucky. So I was pleased to find these Dickies in Olive green. It is a great color. Not like a Christmas green, and not an army-like green like the normal \"olive green\"  seems to come out to look like in other clothing. These are typical Dickies quality work wear. However these pants are worn for regular every day use pants and not \"just\" working... but they hold up great to both. Thanks Dickies. Please keep making lots of colors and this style! Some guys like normal pants fit and not the leg hugging modern style today.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17783967", "1": "0.36672184", "2": "0.17685941", "3": "0.11472553", "4": "0.022526026", "5": "0.081102334", "6": "0.060225185"}}
