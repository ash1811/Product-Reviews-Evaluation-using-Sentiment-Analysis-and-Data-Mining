{"text": "These run to the large end of the size scale but I had read previous reviews and bought accordingly. The construction is good, the pattern is crisp and neat and the fabric does well in a wash and dry cycle. Pockets are roomy and practical. Can't expect much more from a cargo short. Great buy.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10220737", "1": "0.34278086", "2": "0.102184206", "3": "0.13393843", "4": "0.1119459", "5": "0.15695202", "6": "0.049991243"}}
