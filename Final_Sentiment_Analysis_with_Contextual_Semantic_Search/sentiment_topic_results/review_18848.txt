{"text": "With no reviews, I was skeptical. Also, I didn't know what effect a little polyester might have on the jeans. The answer to the last question is NONE; they feel and act exactly like 100% cotton jeans.  I own a lot of Levis 514s--regular and in colors. These by far are the best fitting. I don't have the greatest tush (in fact very little at all), yet these fit nicely, not sagging back there where I have very little. Highly recommended.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.20128845", "2": "0.10453347", "3": "0.14988348", "4": "0.047771472", "5": "0.18957695", "6": "0.3035182"}}
