{"text": "I bought these for my grandson.  I like to have an extra pair of shoes at home for him in case he gets the shoes he's wearing muddy or wet.  The only problem is he loves these shoes and ends up taking them home  :)  This is the second pair I've purchased this spring and I think they are truly worth the money I paid.  They fit well, the shoes stay on, my grandson can put them on by himself and the shoes are well made. I'll be back to purchase more next year in a different size.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.3617968", "2": "0.25614905", "3": "0.15173689", "4": "0.15574701", "5": "0.068599276"}}
