{"text": "I got these boots 1 months ago and refused to wear them due to them being so hard. These boots are literally harming my feet. I am hurting every night when I come home and you can see where they are harming my feet,they won't bend at all. Breaking them in isn't the answer, I have tried everything. If the seller could have stated if these boots had any give to them would have been helpful. Really wish they had been like the old ones.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.048306964", "1": "0.2490491", "2": "0.1542231", "4": "0.2066935", "5": "0.28731596", "6": "0.050830357"}}
