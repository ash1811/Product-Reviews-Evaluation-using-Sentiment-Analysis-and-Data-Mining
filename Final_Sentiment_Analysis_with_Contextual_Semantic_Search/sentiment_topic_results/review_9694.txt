{"text": "This was a very dissapointing purchase. This bra is not at all what it is glammed up to be. Material is cheap and the bra is not well constructed to support the full figured woman. Bought my usual size but it was a bit large. If  you want a well constructed bra, good fit, lift and support buyer beware this bra won't do it. Don't buy.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14511824", "1": "0.4366923", "3": "0.25371218", "5": "0.07776554", "6": "0.07804322"}}
