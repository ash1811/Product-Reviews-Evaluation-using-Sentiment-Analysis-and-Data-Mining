{"text": "MY HUSBAND FARMS, WELDS, CLEARS FENCE LINES, CUTS TIMBER, ETC AND ALWAYS WEARS OUT OR RIPS  THE DENIM JEANS DOWN THE THIGHS WHILE THE REST OF THE FABRIC LOOKS LIKE NEW. GOT 2 PAIR (ONE ON AND ONE IN THE WASH) JUST TO SEE HOW THEY'D WEAR. AT LAST A PAIR OF JEANS EVEN HE COULDN'T RUIN. TIGHTLY WOVEN DUCK MATERIAL WITH DOUBLE THIGH FABRIC WON'T GET RIPPED UP BY BRIARS AND UNDERBRUSH. WON'T FRAY FROM 80# HAY BALES RUBBING AGAINST HIM AS HE CARRIES THEM. DIESEL FUEL ROLLS OFF THE TIGHTLY WOVEN FABRIC AND BACKHOE GREASE SCRAPES RIGHT OFF. REAR POCKETS ARE TACKED ON SO TIGHT EVEN GETTING CAUGHT ON TREE BRANCHES AS HE'S RUNNING THE BACKHOE WONT TEAR THEM. THESE JEANS WEAR LIKE IRON AND LAST LONGER THAN 4-6 PAIRS OF HIS DENIM ONES. YOU'LL PAY MORE FOR THEM BUT STILL SAVE MONEY SINCE THEY LAST SO LONG.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18616238", "1": "0.19801818", "2": "0.078140154", "3": "0.14562985", "4": "0.14548966", "5": "0.14505263", "6": "0.10150717"}}
