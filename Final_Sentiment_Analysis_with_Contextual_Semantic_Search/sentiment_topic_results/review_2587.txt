{"text": "Everytime I wear these I get a countless number of compliments. Everyone always comments on these shoes! They are durable and comfy! They truly are an eyecatcher and so much fun! Personally I wear a size 10 and I have narrow feet. They fit perfectly. I owned another pair of minnetonka flats before these, so I was lucky and knew which size to order. I ordered mine in Black and they match everything! If you want a comfy, warm, and stylish pair of boots this winter (I'll prob wear these in summer too) These are PERFECT for you =-)Other Notes:--My order came super fast and on time!--If you have a cat BEWARE! My cat constantly attacks these shoes because of all the strings. But They are so well made, that I dont mind. No string has budged. =-)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09721688", "1": "0.26967627", "2": "0.1408444", "3": "0.22655937", "4": "0.13433684", "5": "0.042178363", "6": "0.089187875"}}
