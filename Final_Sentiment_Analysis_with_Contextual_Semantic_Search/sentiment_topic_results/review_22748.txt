{"text": "I bought this hat too large for my infant son so as expected it is a bit too big.  BUT even with that fact there is a cinching strap in the back of the hat that allows a bigger size to (mostly) fit my infant!  I love the back flap that keeps all the sun off his neck and the back of his head.  For total coverage the front has more than the average sunhat so that I have less sunscreen to apply.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09151089", "1": "0.3423894", "2": "0.10524195", "3": "0.2734037", "4": "0.049818657", "5": "0.031108243", "6": "0.10652713"}}
