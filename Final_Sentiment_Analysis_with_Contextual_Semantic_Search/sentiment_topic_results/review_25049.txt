{"text": "I know this product is boxer, but we've had a horrible experience with the boxer briefs, same material & same manufacturer.  This is what happened.Do not buy these, I wish I had not thrown the money away on these.  Originally when I bought these for my husband he really enjoyed them.  I even went so far as to order a second package of 4, especially when I saw the price decrease.  SO SORRY I DID.  Original purchases early 2012 - it is now August.  He absolutely cannot (not to be confused with will not) wear these any more.  The first 2 months were fine - he really liked them a lot; very comfortable and glad he changed from the regular briefs he had been wearing for years, usually Hanes brand.  I followed washing instructions to the letter.  He said after a couple months the elastic was no longer holding up.  First: around the waistband was no longer holding up - no weight change, actually I purchased because he had lost weight but now has maintained.  Second: the worst part - he says the elastic around the legs is completely non-existant.  In other words does not hold him at all.  We have thrown them all out.  This is the first time he has insisted I go on Amazon & warn other people like we've relied on reviewers before us.  Thanks to the reviewer who gave me a place to start to purchase different brands (2xist, C-in2, Calvin Klein, Puma) to see what he likes.  So disappointed in the Hanes brand overall will not consider any more of their products for men or women ever.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.19655265", "1": "0.12678035", "2": "0.12238857", "3": "0.115974605", "4": "0.0864892", "5": "0.18978006", "6": "0.16203454"}}
