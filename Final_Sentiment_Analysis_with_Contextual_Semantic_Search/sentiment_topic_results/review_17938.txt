{"text": "Just received my Casio MQ24-7B today. All I can say is that for the price I paid, it is simply awesome, simple and slick.Believe me, people really stop to notice how simplistic but otherwise truly elegant this timepiece is. At a glance you can see clearly the current time without even a struggle.It beats a digital watch hands down if your own choice is to determine the correct time.I had several people within a span of 30 minutes ask me for the correct time while waiting at a bus stop.  The odd thing about it was that each of them also had a wristwatch but yet chose to ask me for the time of day.Truly, the design is very attractive and does garnera lot of attention. Imagine now if this same design can be constructed of higher quality materials, it would probably be ranked among the finest watches available.Anyhow, really marvelous timepiece. Hope it lasts a long time.  Otherwise, I will just get another.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07630346", "1": "0.12771657", "2": "0.110294804", "3": "0.05264419", "4": "0.25552738", "5": "0.21007359", "6": "0.16744004"}}
