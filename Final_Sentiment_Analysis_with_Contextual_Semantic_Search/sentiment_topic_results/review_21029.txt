{"text": "I was hoping to find a pair of opaque leggings that I could wear like yoga pants. These were fairly thick, but are NOT YOGA PANTS. Even if you can't see through them when looking in the mirror at home, if you step into direct sunlight, your underwear will show through. Wear them with a tunic or minidress or whatever-- just make sure your behind is covered. Also, if you're a pet owner, the weave of the fabric is like a magnet for cat/dog hair.Overall, these seemed like high quality leggings, but were not what I was looking for.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.028333781", "1": "0.26772755", "2": "0.116087854", "3": "0.168624", "4": "0.19770129", "6": "0.218704"}}
