{"text": "I bought this for my son who loves to dress up. The pirate hat is very small, it fits perfectly on my 1.5 year old's head but on my 3 year old's head it's way too small. The spy glass broke within 2 weeks, the glass fell out and we couldn't find it. The necklace chain broke after a day and the small gold chest is pointless. But the gold doubloons are holding up as are the rubies. the hook hand, sword and flag. My boys aren't rough with toys and rarely have we had a toy break it's just cheaply made. I wouldn't pay $10 for this set.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21496965", "1": "0.2573842", "2": "0.06764382", "3": "0.24406356", "4": "0.13191094", "5": "0.06471134", "6": "0.01931648"}}
