{"text": "I ordered this boot in Slate Black/Flint Stone in a 6 1/2. My foot is 6 1/2, medium width and I have a good arch. These shoes fit perfect with lots of toe room. They provide good support including the heel and ankle. The color looks good with jeans and athletic wear. They're so comfortable I didn't want to take them off. They are lightweight, not heavy like some boots. I can jog in them. I'm very happy with this purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.113034144", "1": "0.41257435", "2": "0.07571203", "3": "0.19111417", "4": "0.16014212", "6": "0.044371497"}}
