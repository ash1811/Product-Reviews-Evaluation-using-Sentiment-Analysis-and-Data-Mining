{"text": "I really researched this watch and found it on several online sites. I purchased from Amazon.com since I have purchased many items here and have had great satisfaction. As far as this watch, the picture is a bit misleading as the bezel on this watch is more of a grey color than a silver. The watch also is almost all plastic with no weight to it so I am a bit skeptical to its quality. I have always owned Timex so I am willing to give this watch a chance, but I am a bit disappointed. Also the watch band was advertised as a buckle band, but came with a velcro band. I had to purchase another band. I do like the features of this watch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17895876", "1": "0.24848464", "2": "0.22365773", "3": "0.040127482", "4": "0.21279535", "5": "0.03288806", "6": "0.063087985"}}
