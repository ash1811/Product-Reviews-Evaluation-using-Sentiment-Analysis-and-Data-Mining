{"text": "O.M.G!!!I bought a pirate costume for my BF and realized that it needed some sort of accessory. I got on the internet and ordered this. What I was expecting to be a cardboard box with a texture printed on it was in fact REAL WOOD! WITH REAL PAINT! This box is not only well crafted and made of good stuff, it looks great too! The paint is authentic as to look aged, and the METAL braces lend to that feeling. This box is perfect for the costume, but after that it's mine. I'm going to keep this for a long time. If you want a cool pirate chest for a costume, or for home decor, this is the one.
