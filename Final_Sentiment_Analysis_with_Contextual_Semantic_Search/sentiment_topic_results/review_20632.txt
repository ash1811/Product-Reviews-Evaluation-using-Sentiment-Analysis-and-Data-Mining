{"text": "I bought this to help hide scratches in my leather couch.  Despite it being \"dark brown dye\" and my couch being Dark brown/chocolate colored...it BLEACHED the leather of my couch, turning it a very light tan.I did read and follow all directions on the bottle.  I shook the bottle to make sure it was well mixed.  Unfortunately before I could do the patch test on a hidden area I opened it and spilled two drops on the couch..leaving me with two horrific drip spots.  Please see the provided image in the dye's image gallery.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.29425332", "1": "0.04756435", "2": "0.3172813", "3": "0.18464568", "4": "0.0865861", "6": "0.06696176"}}
