{"text": "I'm really pleased with the product. I agree with other reviewers who say this is perfect for a little bedroom action and not so much for an all-day wear. Not that I personally have any reason to wear a garter belt under daywear, so I certainly wasn't shopping for that reason. This is definitely not the height of comfort, but it's still a fun thing to throw into the mix. It's not complicated to use, and mine arrived in perfect condition with no malfunctioning pieces.The best thing about it in my opinion is the look. It's got a lovely, sexy lace detail. It's very delicate. It doesn't resemble anything that could pass for typical everyday undergarments, which is the whole point of my purchasing one. It's not bulky at all. I'm glad I purchased this brand. Ones I've seen in local stores (department, not of the adult variety) were either too stodgy looking or very bulky.Obviously, it has to be laundered as you would any extremely delicate item--hand wash only, and even that should be done very carefully. The delicateness that I love as the look also makes it a bit difficult to wash. So far mine has not torn or worn thin, but it wouldn't take much force to damage it. Then again, with a price like this, one could have tons of fun with the item, wash it as many times as one needs, and not necessarily go into convulsions if the item didn't provide years of often use, if you get my drift. Overall, I'm very happy with this item and have purchased it in different colors.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14833766", "1": "0.13093354", "2": "0.08760434", "3": "0.23355134", "4": "0.08864674", "5": "0.23769253", "6": "0.073233835"}}
