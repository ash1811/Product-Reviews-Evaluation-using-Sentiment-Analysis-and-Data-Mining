{"text": "I bought these plain, white polo shirts for my teenage sons, as they required to wear them for work (retail/food service).  They fit fine, and seem to be good quality.  However, I don't think these are &#34;real&#34; IZOD shirts (i.e., they are knock offs), as they don't have the logo on the front.  Either way, we are satisfied with the purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09691699", "1": "0.41963795", "2": "0.18867208", "3": "0.079229735", "5": "0.16342993", "6": "0.047634263"}}
