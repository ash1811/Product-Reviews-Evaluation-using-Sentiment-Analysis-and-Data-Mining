Soft and supple but holds shape.Shaft is wide enough that jeans could easily be tucked in.Boot is a bit large (I wear an 8.5 an my foot tends towards wide) -- however this is with thin socks.I love the red color...  however my husband says it is too orange -- I don't agree.overall great pair of boots and excellent quality for around $100.(totally off subject but I was inspired to buy these boots due to a song by Lindi Ortega called Little Red Boots that is also the title of her latest album -- great boots for a great album)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04104636", "1": "0.23491514", "2": "0.13455404", "3": "0.12145403", "4": "0.27096933", "5": "0.118514754", "6": "0.07854635"}}
