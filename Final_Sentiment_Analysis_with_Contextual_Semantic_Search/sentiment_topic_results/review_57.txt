{"text": "I bought these for my daughter a couple of years ago, and now my 10yr old niece was asking for danglies, so I got her the same pair.  Both my daughter and my niece need a really good metal, such as gold or silver, to avoid infection. Plus, my daughter has stated that the lever back earrings are so much easier because she doesn't have to try to get a backing on, and they wont slip out without notice. These aren't too long for little girls, and have the color and sparkle they love. A GREAT price for a quality pair of earrings.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.41253272", "1": "0.3649482", "4": "0.05090053", "6": "0.16300644"}}
