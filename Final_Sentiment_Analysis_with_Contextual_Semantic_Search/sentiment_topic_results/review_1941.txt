{"text": "I purchased these slippers for my very picky husband and to my surprise, he loves them!  He has a narrow heel and a wider ball of his foot, so fit is important. These fit well and are very warm and he likes that the shoe is adjustable to some degree with the rawhide tie. He likes them so much he asked me to order another pair for our cabin! If you like a slipper with some structure that you can wear inside or out, you will really love this slipper!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03105005", "1": "0.36197475", "2": "0.22409198", "4": "0.13389358", "5": "0.08237744", "6": "0.16302776"}}
