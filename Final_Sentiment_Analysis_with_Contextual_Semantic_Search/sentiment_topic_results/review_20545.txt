{"text": "Let's face it, if you're looking at this item, you like watches.And there's nothing worse than getting a new watch that doesn't fit. Instead of waiting a day or two to take it to a jeweler, why not do it yourself?With a bit of practice, I was able to resize the bands on a few watches within minutes. It's not the smoothest operation, but I was able to remove and replace links in the steel band of my new Invicta without damage, and without needing to use a punch and small hammer.It's convenient if you're only resizing a watch from time to time, but I'm not confident that it could stand up to the rigors of professional use.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.100094415", "1": "0.15384509", "2": "0.21873033", "3": "0.18990092", "4": "0.0981801", "5": "0.08793323", "6": "0.15131591"}}
