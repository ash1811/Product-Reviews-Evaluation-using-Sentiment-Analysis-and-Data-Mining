{"text": "These slippers were comfortable for about a week.  Then they stretched out about 2 sizes larger, and they would fall off my feet when I walk causing me to trip.  The \"cushiony\" inside, which was the selling point for me, lost its comfort after about a week.  However, I gave it 3 stars because of the price.  They were \"inexpensive\" and you do get what you pay for.  But I will say that cheaper slippers purchased from the dollar store lasted longer and were more comfortable than these.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.22192237", "1": "0.2725895", "2": "0.09199882", "3": "0.183711", "4": "0.016895521", "6": "0.2093874"}}
