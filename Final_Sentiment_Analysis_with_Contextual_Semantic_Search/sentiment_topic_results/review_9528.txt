{"text": "Hope this one lasts as long as my other Timex. That version lasted 8 years and I only paid $20. Nice features but I may have to get a more conventional wristband, if available. Reading the instructions really helped navigate thru the unique niceties. One can't really not like this watch for the price ad quality. Again, I hope this one lasts another 8 years.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06320478", "1": "0.43473104", "2": "0.13925985", "3": "0.043279666", "4": "0.19080779", "5": "0.10704593", "6": "0.021670947"}}
