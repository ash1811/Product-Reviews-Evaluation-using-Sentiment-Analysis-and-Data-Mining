{"text": "I bought this watch storage box for my son and he did like it a lot.  I gave it 5 stars because even though it holds 12 watches the size is perfect it even looks cute, it has a key to lock it up, it is not heavy, the metal is of good quality.  I would recommend this box without any doubt.  Seller did good and I got it on time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.32473978", "1": "0.22842984", "2": "0.22231159", "3": "0.17903139", "6": "0.037727263"}}
