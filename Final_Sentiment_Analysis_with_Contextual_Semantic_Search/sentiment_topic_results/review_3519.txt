{"text": "This is a beautiful bra. I was wearing a 42D but since I've gained weight the 42's are a bit tight so I ordered up a size. On this bra, the cup size is good but the band is just as tight as the 42. There is no 46D so I'm screwed. I just have to wear tight bras until I lose weight I guess.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3058532", "3": "0.2801658", "4": "0.08913745", "5": "0.15194096", "6": "0.16328686"}}
