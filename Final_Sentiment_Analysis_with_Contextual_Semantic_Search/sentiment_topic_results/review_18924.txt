{"text": "I have a couple of slim jeans, but unfortunately I will not classify this as slim. I am 1.78m and 70kg. The W32L32 fits well on the waist and the length is also perfect.The colour of the jeans (Overhaul) does seem to be slightly different from the pictures, but not a big deal. I like the subtle fade without being too \"loud\". Unfortunately, the fit of the jeans is not really that slim for a slim guy like me. Crotch area is pretty tight but from the thigh area all the way down to the calf area, the jeans is pretty much \"normal straight\" to me, much like regular 501s. The ends of the jeans also seem to flare out instead of crumpling neatly into a pile, making the jeans look somewhat \"bootcut\".If you are a person with thicker legs who wants to try going \"slim\", this is probably a good cutting to try out, I guess.However if you are a really slim guy looking for a pair of slim jeans which fits closely to your legs, you may feel slightly disappointed. Try the 511s instead.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22923335", "1": "0.31586364", "3": "0.07829981", "4": "0.21413986", "5": "0.04494865", "6": "0.11522455"}}
