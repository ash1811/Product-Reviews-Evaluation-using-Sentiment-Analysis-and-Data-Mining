{"text": "These were purchased for my daughter who is in school to become a medical tech, and holding down a job at Circle K. Needless to say, she is on her feet for hours every day and needs GOOD shoes to protect and support her feet. These shoes are just what she was looking for! Her feet are size six and narrow, so it is difficult for her to find shoes that fit properly. These shoes fit perfectly and are so comfortable, giving her the support she needs. They are all-leather (no canvas webbing, etc.) which complies with her uniform code. These shoes are highly recommended for women in the nursing field and for those who spend long hours on their feet. May they continue making these shoes forever!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06589325", "1": "0.22266091", "2": "0.20548752", "3": "0.03348533", "4": "0.22259781", "5": "0.091254584", "6": "0.15862063"}}
