{"text": "Yes I remember when all jeans were like this. New meant stiff as a board. Still length is great and just slightly snug in the waist which was no suprise. One wash and a ride in the dryer with some tennis shoes was all it took to break them down a little. Would be a great work jean, tough and well made. Good buy for the money spent!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.28620416", "2": "0.14844283", "3": "0.15600747", "4": "0.027880363", "5": "0.1942197", "6": "0.1833747"}}
