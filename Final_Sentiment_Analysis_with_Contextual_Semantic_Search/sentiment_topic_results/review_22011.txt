{"text": "these coveralls in extra large are not wearable because the crotch of the legs is halfway down to the knees!  Not too small or too large, just  not made correctly.  Seems like there must have been a big mistake made at the factory.  We waited too long to return them so we are stuck with something that would not fit anyone due to mess up in the manufacture. Had an old pair of Dickies coveralls that were made properly, fit great and lasted for years.  Someone screwed up big time with these.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09007547", "1": "0.30413568", "3": "0.25417385", "4": "0.17129548", "5": "0.103534035", "6": "0.07366981"}}
