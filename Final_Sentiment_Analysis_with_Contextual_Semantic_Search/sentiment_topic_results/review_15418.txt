{"text": "Having owned B&L; Ray Ban sunglasses for D E C A D E S (still own them and actually worth crazy dollars) and purchased knock offs at flea markets (BETTER than whatever is passing as $100 sunglasses now) I will tell you that the only other weaker thing is the case they come in. whew what happened to quality. wish I would have thought about weighing them before I sent them back. needless to say, here are MY glasses which have lasted decades, something these would NEVER do.http://www.etsy.com/listing/110895449/vintage-ray-ban-bausch-and-lomb-diamond?ref=similar_items_sashpurchased at a sunglasses hut kiosk in 1991 for $125, and my wayfarer 5024s I purchased in the 90's at drug emporium for $45 which are $100 used today!just watch a few you tube vids on people getting shanked before you buy these.it makes one wonder, if they can actually produce counterfeits so cheaply what are you paying for when you get the original?do your homework or know what you are buying.  they were in a ups drop box the NEXT day.13JUNE13apparently B&L; now make junk.  this have not be confirmed by ME, but my girl (who I purchased these for on amazon) was in a sunglasses store, and while she was speaking with the owner about returning the pair HE had for $180, he confirmed that this is the \"new\" composite materials they NOW use. I will NEVER buy ray ban again, or recommend them.I will however continue to take wonderful care of my existing ones that were made with quality materials over 2 decades ago.if I get in a store and remember I will post my findings.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0843688", "1": "0.23785347", "2": "0.28447944", "3": "0.076380484", "4": "0.2137116", "5": "0.02469044", "6": "0.078515805"}}
