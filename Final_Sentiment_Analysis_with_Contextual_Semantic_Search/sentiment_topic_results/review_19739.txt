{"text": "I bought two pair of these after reading a reviewer's comment for another brand that was a couple of dollars cheaper. In it, she said that the other brand was made of tee shirt thin material. I didn't want that. These are not. They are made of a quality thickness, and at just a couple of dollars more, well worth it. I will say, however, that I made a mistake in ordering Large after someone indicated that these run small. I'm 190 lbs, 5'-11&#34; and usually wear a size 34 waist in jeans. I don't like snug sweats. Still, I should have ordered Mediums. The large are too large (waist and inseam). I'm sure Med would have been fine. But they're comfortable for around the house, and I like that they have pockets. Oh, and for some reason, the grey color shipped free but they wanted I think $7 or $9 to ship blue. Go figure.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.27326384", "2": "0.12177563", "3": "0.24907531", "4": "0.1542064", "5": "0.07673092", "6": "0.12280874"}}
