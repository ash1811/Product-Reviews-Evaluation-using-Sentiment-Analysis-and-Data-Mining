{"text": "I went through so many diaper bags, and they were clunky, big, and poorly organized. I wanted something that can both go cross-body and on your shoulder, and had easy pick up straps. I also wanted great visibility inside the bag and a nice, wide compartment. This bag is awesome! It looks deceivingly small, yet I can throw in all the baby essentials, a couple of diapers, snacks, toys, PLUS my own stuff, and it holds everything. It's super lightweight, and even my husband doesn't mind carrying it. If you're looking for a smaller baby bag or just a roomy, well-organized purse, this bag fits the bill. And it's super cute, too!LOVE.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03575615", "1": "0.37594068", "2": "0.16103162", "3": "0.07397136", "4": "0.14646079", "5": "0.13017866", "6": "0.076660775"}}
