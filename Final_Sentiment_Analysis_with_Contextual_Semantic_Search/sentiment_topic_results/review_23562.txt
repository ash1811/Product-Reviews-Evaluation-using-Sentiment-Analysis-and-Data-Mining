{"text": "Our 3 year loves to play pirate (Jake and the Neverland Pirates) and this set works great! The hat is hard plastic which I thought our son wouldn't like. But I was wrong. He loves it. The hat, sword, and hook are what he plays with. Everything else kinda went in the toy box.Previous reviews said the sword was very cheap and broke easily. It is plastic, it is a toy. So far with daily playing and heavy use by our 3 year old it has been just fine. He even hits stuff with it. The hook is so fun for him. He loves to pretend he is Captain Hook with it. He will hand you the sword and duel with you as hook.This set isn't a high priced high quality pirate set, its a childs set that is worth the money though. I would recommend purchasing this set for the younger pirate.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.23754637", "1": "0.27218157", "2": "0.17091112", "3": "0.12566993", "4": "0.0765288", "5": "0.07696969", "6": "0.040192526"}}
