{"text": "I purchased this watch case for my husband as a Christmas present.  He has several nice watches that typically wind up in random locations around the house.  He had mentioned before that he would like a watch case but I knew this wasn't something he wouldn't buy for himself.  I did a little searching on Amazon and found this reasonably priced display case and decided I would give it a shot.  I couldn't have been more satisfied with the style and quality.  The case itself is very well made and looks elegant on his night stand.  His watches are larger (even for a man's watch) so I originally concerned that they wouldn't fit but they sit comfortably with no problem at all.  My husband was very surprised with his present and loves it.  I love that this holds 10 watches.  He has 6 right now but I know he'll get more so this allows his collection room to grow.  I have quite a few watches myself so I'm tempted to get one for me!  Highly recommend if you're looking for an elegant way to display and protect your watch collection.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08968785", "1": "0.27417666", "2": "0.28496572", "3": "0.057867713", "4": "0.09217109", "5": "0.09717329", "6": "0.10395768"}}
