{"text": "Soooo if you have big tatas and exercise... I feel you sister. I try a lot of sports bras and I kept this one and use it a lot.Pros:- Price, obvs- size availability. I wear a 36G or 36GG in UK bras. Ordered 38G based on a previous Glamorise sports bra purchase with a painfully tight band.- I can run in it without pain, irritation or mega bounceCons:- not HIGH support, more medium support for me- you can totally see my nips. NOT OKAY in gym setting :(- no separation. Smush uni-boob.Even with these cons I would still recommend it if you think it'll fit you. There are so few sport bras in this size!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06268255", "1": "0.26055402", "2": "0.09463895", "3": "0.33167055", "4": "0.07912823", "5": "0.10182228", "6": "0.069503374"}}
