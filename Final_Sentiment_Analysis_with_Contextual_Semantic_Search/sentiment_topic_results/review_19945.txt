{"text": "I want to love this bag but I can't, and I'm surprised nobody else mentioned how painfully stiff and rough the straps are on the women's backpack. I have the lemonad/butterfly bag and the colors are true to color. The bag is huge but does not have extra straps for hips and sternum to help with the weight when the bag is full of stuff. All there are to help are straps on the shoulders, which are VERY rough along the edge and VERY stiff! It's very painful to use the bag and the straps rubbed my neck and top of my shoulders raw. I tried roughing up the straps to make them softer but they still cut in.It was my fault for purchasing a bag to support the weight of my laptop knowing that I would need extra support such as a waist belt, but I got distracting reading up about size and pockets to remember to research that aspect.I used a Dakine bag for years that looked great and was comfortable. I might buy another one because the straps never hurt me so much as the ones from this bag. I will use this as a travel bag for when I spend weekends away from home. But for an every-day bag holding my laptop, this won't do at all.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14325173", "1": "0.18359056", "2": "0.2371331", "3": "0.15963711", "4": "0.053865317", "5": "0.10219772", "6": "0.120324485"}}
