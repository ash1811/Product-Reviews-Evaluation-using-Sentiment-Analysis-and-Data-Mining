{"text": "I'm here to buy my 2nd (replacement) pair. The first wore well for a good 2 years...and I wear them outside 1/3 of the time. Short walks w/the dog(s). Threw in the washer/dryer at least 4 times and they're just recently showing tears at the seams. I'll keep first pair for strickly outdoors and new pair for inside. They are too comfortable to give up or switch to another. I wear 9 - 9-1/2 shoe...get these in Large, 8-9 and they fit just fine. No stretching, fading or flattening. They're the best.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07917165", "1": "0.1545566", "2": "0.12944141", "3": "0.21565637", "4": "0.12905945", "5": "0.19825578", "6": "0.093858756"}}
