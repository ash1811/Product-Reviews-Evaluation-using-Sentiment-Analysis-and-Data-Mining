{"text": "I gave this item four stars because of the stamp on the heart pendant. The inscription did not say anything about the pendant itself being stamped. I like it, it's very pretty, a little smaller than expected, but it's very danty. If I intend to wear it everyday I will probably replace the chain. Otherwise it's just perfect. :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.09590621", "2": "0.32031745", "3": "0.089064404", "4": "0.14570259", "5": "0.13942493", "6": "0.20446464"}}
