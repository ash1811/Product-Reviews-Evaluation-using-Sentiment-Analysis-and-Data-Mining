{"text": "I really liked this garter at first, but it didn't hold up.  first the little thing that allows you to adjust the size broke, and then one of the straps came off, on the day of a photo shoot, and I had to pin it and fake it.  too bad, cuz it was a cute belt.  I guess I'll replace the hardware, but it will cost me more than the garter in the long run.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07245174", "1": "0.17325217", "2": "0.16589299", "3": "0.25785947", "4": "0.106750906", "5": "0.16702422", "6": "0.056768496"}}
