{"text": "My husband and I have purchased Thorlos ever since we started hiking in 2006.  He now uses them for the desert trails as well as on his job site.  These socks are comfortable; stay dry during daily wear and prevent blisters on toes and feet.  The Thorlos have kept their shape, even after multiple washings.  No complaints from us and we will continue to seek out sellers who provide these particular footwear.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24123207", "1": "0.31414434", "2": "0.18985571", "4": "0.15771484", "5": "0.06227486", "6": "0.03109751"}}
