{"text": "I purchased this as a surprise for my husband.  It got great reviews from him.  I am 6ft tall so it is a little on the short side.  I am also a size 16/18 with a fairly large bust - but this was not overly tight it stretches a LONG way and looked nice.  The quality is fair, the material is soft but the construction did not have the attention to detail.  The panties are VERY tiny, and the quality of the elastic was ok.  I hand washed it and laid it flat to dry - turned out just fine.  I would recommend this to a curvy woman as the print was very forgiving for any bumps or buldges you want to hide.  It was comfortable to sleep in.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.053692684", "1": "0.51949906", "2": "0.07371999", "4": "0.16155548", "5": "0.050479915", "6": "0.13834943"}}
