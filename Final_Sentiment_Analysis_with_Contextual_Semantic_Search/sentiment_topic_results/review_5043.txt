{"text": "This is my second pair of Birkenstock sandals. My first pair lasted 7 years before I wore the cork off them. I went a couple years without because of the cost, but none of the cheaper alternatives I tried offered the same level of comfort or fit.The comfort was tough to give up, but the lack of fit was sometimes dangerous when a sandal would leave my foot in the middle of the stairs.So, this year I finally broke down and treated myself to another pair. I think I may have built them up to legendary status in my mind, because I was shocked when they weren't comfortable right out of the box. In fact, they were downright uncomfortable at first and I thought I must have gotten a defective pair.But my friend Google reminded me that it takes a little time for the cork foot bed to mold to your foot and I also experimented with the straps to find the best configuration for my feet.Two weeks later and I'm a happy camper. They never leave my feet when I'm moving around the house and they are now broken in and just as comfortable as I remember. With the straps adjusted for me, I can take the stairs like I'm wearing shoes, without fear of losing a sandal mid step and the resulting tumble.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15903011", "1": "0.37217242", "2": "0.07179667", "3": "0.17787167", "4": "0.06697064", "5": "0.027979372", "6": "0.12417917"}}
