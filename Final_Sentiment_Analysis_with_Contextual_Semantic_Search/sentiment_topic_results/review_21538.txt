{"text": "To me the picture makes the shoes look adorable but when I put them on I saw them in a different light.... they look very sexy! I normally wear an 8 1/2 but so glad they came in only whole sizes because a 9 fits beyond perfect for me. I couldn't decide between the red and black so I ordered the black but I am definately buying the red now! And...... the pink too to match lingerie because YES, they are that HOT!!!Also... Just like the other reviewer mentioned... having an 8 1/2 - 9 size foot I always thought my feet were huge but these shoes really do make your foot look smaller!Thank you Spike Angel for the very fast shipping..... MUCH appreciated! Now I'm off to break in the new shoes. =)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1156012", "1": "0.27455714", "2": "0.07120807", "3": "0.26660985", "5": "0.15181316", "6": "0.1178164"}}
