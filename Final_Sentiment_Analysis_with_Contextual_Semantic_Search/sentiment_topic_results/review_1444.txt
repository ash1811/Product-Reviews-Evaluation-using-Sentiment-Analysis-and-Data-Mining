{"text": "This backpack is huge!!  That was a pleasant surprise.  I wanted to get her something that would last after a Justice bag she just HAD to have fell apart after 6 months of use.  The zebra print is right up her alley and the backpack has LOTS of great pockets & compartments for everything a 4th grader needs for school.  I just hope she doesn't outgrow the cute pattern.. because I think this pack will last her a long time!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.20091811", "2": "0.3279113", "3": "0.081191204", "4": "0.092497945", "5": "0.2598996", "6": "0.03399802"}}
