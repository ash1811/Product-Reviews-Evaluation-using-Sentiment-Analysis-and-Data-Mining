{"text": "I was a bit skeptical when I first saw this adhesive bra, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to try it.  I applied each cup as the directions suggest, turning the cups inside out then applying from outside in, I had to reapply one twice because it is a little tricky making sure the two cups line up with one another.  The manufacturer suggests that you not wear the bra for more than 6hrs at a time, probably to minimize any sort of reaction or possibly the bra becoming less adhesive the longer you wear it, but I tested it for 12 hrs just to see what would happen.  The bra was just as adhesive when I took them off as when I first out them on.  I washed the cups by lightly applying mild soap and wiping the soap off with water on my hand with the cups folded inside out.  I let them air dry over night in the open and the adhesive is deffinitely refreshed.  While the bra was completely comfortable and served my needs if I was hoping for some lift then I probably would have been disappointed.  It gave me cleavage, but it was like cleavage that you can achieve with a really tight sports bra, smashed down cleavage.  So if you are ok with the lack of lift and just want the cleavage, or you need something without back straps then this will deffinitely work for you.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09080742", "1": "0.10069049", "2": "0.25945124", "3": "0.2458368", "5": "0.13691144", "6": "0.16390653"}}
