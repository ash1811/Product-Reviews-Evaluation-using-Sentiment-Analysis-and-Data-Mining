{"text": "I am around 5'1 and 150. ok. honestly, 155. I buy stockings because they usually make me FEEL sexy. They hide bumps and show off my better features.Regarding these stockings:Pros:the pattern on this is beautiful.it is fairly durable for a stocking.price was decentlooks great on the model.cons:its to loose in the back (probably because i'm short)its to tight around my thighs (probably because i'm fat)It shows off my cellulite. (which i already pointed out is usually HIDDEN by this kind of clothing)and downplays any pleasant curve I have. (i feel blah in it.)Overall, i'm disappointed. I will try to dress it up a bit. maybe slip it under a dress (i love the pattern), but i doubt that i will ever like it much. even if hubby does.--- note: At the suggestion of another reviewer, i tried it on backwards. It looks much better. specifically with a bra. Almost like a corset, but not. I think i can wear it this way with a vest or jacket and a short skirt. --- much happier.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.064950645", "1": "0.34955963", "2": "0.07040339", "3": "0.22812767", "4": "0.05399308", "5": "0.17896736", "6": "0.05399821"}}
