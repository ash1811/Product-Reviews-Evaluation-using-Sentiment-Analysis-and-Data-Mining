They are cute on my feet and believe it or not, I have worn them when going to visit family.  They have been so comfortable I just didn't want to put shoes on my feet.

IF I wear them out, I will just get another pair.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.027637351", "1": "0.09730563", "2": "0.11081482", "3": "0.21187258", "4": "0.11047177", "5": "0.14003661", "6": "0.30186126"}}
