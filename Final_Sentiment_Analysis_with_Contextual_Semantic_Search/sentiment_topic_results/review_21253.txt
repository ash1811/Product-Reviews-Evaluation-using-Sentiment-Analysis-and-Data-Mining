{"text": "I've been buying Sauconys for years. They are the only sneaker I wear. From the first pair to these, I have never been disappointed. From the box to the foot, they feel broken in.The Grid Omni Waker is a solid shoe, yet lightweight. The sole is thick and has great treads. They are true to size, and simply one heck of a shoe. I've purchased many hiking boots that have short laces. These sneakers have very generous laces. I honestly can't say one bads thing about these. HIGHLY recommended.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2077686", "1": "0.1702566", "2": "0.09807588", "3": "0.21795946", "4": "0.18419571", "5": "0.09244338", "6": "0.029300397"}}
