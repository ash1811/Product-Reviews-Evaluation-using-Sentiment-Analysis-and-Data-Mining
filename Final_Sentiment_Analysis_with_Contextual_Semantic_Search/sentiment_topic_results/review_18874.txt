{"text": "I purchased these for my husband - they arrived in good shape, well packed and before scheduled delivery. The jeans are a nice color and true Levi's. They are a bit thin though - these are not 501's or the sturdier jean material thus the price, but they are comfortable (per my husband). I say they fit small because after the first wash they shrunk, a lot. Although they still fit, albeit tighter at the waist and across the bum/thigh area, they do not stretch back out to the original unwashed size.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09468251", "1": "0.48498026", "2": "0.08221036", "4": "0.15097131", "5": "0.056269456", "6": "0.12788638"}}
