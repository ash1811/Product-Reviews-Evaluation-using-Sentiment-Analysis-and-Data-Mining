{"text": "I love these boots. They are lightweight, comfortable, look great, seem well-made, and won't break the bank. The leather seems to be high quality and looks beautiful. Once they're broken in, they feel almost like slippers. The crepe sole is super flexible and springy, and very comfortable to walk on. What more could you ask for?I will undoubtedly wear these until they fall apart, then buy another pair, and repeat!That said, here's some sizing advice: I would suggest ordering these one-half size smaller than you usually wear. Some reviewers say to order a full size smaller, but for me, that would be too much. I usually wear a 10.5, and I bought these in a 10; they seemed quite snug at first, but after a few weeks, they fit like a glove! They also seem to be relatively narrow shoes, so if you usually wear wides, you might want to stay away.The only small negatives: They provide almost no arch support; my feet don't mind this, but yours might. Also, the crepe soles turn black and look filthy after just a week. Oh well - people don't see the bottoms of your feet all that often. Finally, they don't seem to breath all that well, but that might just be the way all-leather shoes are.As far as care goes: I have been inserting Woodlore cedar shoe trees immediately after taking my boots off each day, and I think this will help greatly in keeping them looking great for a long time to come. The Clarks site suggests using a conditioner/protector with oils and lanolin, so I applied some Dr. Martens Wonder Balsam (which contains lanolin, oil and beeswax). It darkened the boots a shade or two, which I'm okay with, though I prefer the original color - so be careful. It did provide the conditioning and protection I was looking for, though.So... buy a pair now - you won't regret it!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14213733", "1": "0.2493767", "2": "0.0313951", "3": "0.1970841", "4": "0.046481233", "5": "0.24475592", "6": "0.08876962"}}
