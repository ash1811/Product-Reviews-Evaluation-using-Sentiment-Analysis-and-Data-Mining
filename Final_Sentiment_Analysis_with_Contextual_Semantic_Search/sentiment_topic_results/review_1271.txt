{"text": "I ordered the shoes in a size 8 because I called the adidas company and asked what size shoe I should get in men's since I'm a 8.5 in women's.... well I placed the order and thought that the shoes would be to big so I emailed the company later that night and they changed it! Shoes were shipped the 30th I literally received next day when I got basic shipping,  I'm overly satisfied with my shoes and they fit great especially for skinny feet haha!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08133615", "1": "0.24512133", "2": "0.21843508", "3": "0.07556468", "4": "0.15193836", "5": "0.1018171", "6": "0.12578735"}}
