{"text": "This is my third pair.  I love these boots and Keens in general.  I hike a lot.  These boots have been wet numerous times and keep my feet pretty dry.  I do spray them with waterproof spray first.  I am guessing they last about a 1000-1500 miles.  Each pair has lasted me about 2 years and then they start to break down (support and tread).  I am able to wear these with a pair of insoles inside. Keens usually run a bit small so if you are in-between sizes go larger.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18461087", "1": "0.10739774", "3": "0.3424298", "4": "0.23770861", "6": "0.121758744"}}
