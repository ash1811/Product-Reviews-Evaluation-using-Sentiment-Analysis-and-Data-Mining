{"text": "Several years ago I was having to walk to and from work everyday  And walking a mile to work, standing on your feet for 8-10 hours, then walking a mile home was unpleasant.  I had never put much money into shoes or socks before.  I always bought a $20 or $30 pair of shoes from Walmart, and a usually Hanes or Fruit of the Loom socks.  But my feet were hurting so bad that I couldn't move when I got home and the next morning my feet would still hurt making the walk to work that much more painful.So, I went online to find the most comfortable pair of shoes I could find.  While I was reading reviews of shoes, I come upon these socks and the words \"Thick cushion\" caught my eye.  But $13 a pair?!  I immediately said \" UH, NO!\"  But with a profane word in the middle of the \"UH\" and the \"NO\".But then the next day after I got off work, I needed to pay some bills that were due, and the last thing I wanted to do was walk around paying bills.  So, after running some errands, I got home, and ordered 8 pair.  I found them on another website with a buy 3 get one free deal.They arrived the same day as my new shoes.  I put them both on and I was amazed.  Especially by the socks.  The socks not only cushioned my feet, it was also like a light massage with every step.  I regretted paying $80 for 8 pairs of socks, and $130 for a pair of shoes, but it was totally worth it.There is a downside though.  The cushioning in the socks does wear out.  They can last longer with proper care, but eventually the cushioning will fade away.  And it will fade quickly if you walk around your house dragging your feet all the time like I do.I've attempted to go back to cheaper socks, but I can't.  I'd rather pay twice the price for a single pair of these than a 6 pair-pack of Hanes socks.  I recently bought 5 new pairs of socks, all high quality socks, but they still aren't nears as comfortable as these.I have bought these sock for several people for Christmas and birthdays.  Sometimes people seem disappointed at first, because I mean, who really wants a pair of socks as a present?  But then they try them on and they're okay with them as a gift.The minor complaints I do have about the socks aren't enough to knock off a star.  The complaints I do have are the price, they wear out quickly, and they could have more of a variety of colors and styles.  But they're worth the price.  I am willing to buy 6 pair every 4-6 months, and they style doesn't bother me.  5 stars for the best socks ever!  I will never buy another kind of sock.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.030702181", "1": "0.33973312", "2": "0.15542254", "3": "0.034982845", "4": "0.14088275", "5": "0.21930252", "6": "0.078974016"}}
