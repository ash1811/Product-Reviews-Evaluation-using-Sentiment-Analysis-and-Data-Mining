{"text": "This watch has received many compliments, it looks more expensive than it is.  As watches go, it is the opposite of the Movado, and definitely not of the diver/rolex wannabe crowd- it is unique.  The case is thick, the band is thick.  The face is large but not as large as the latest fashion watch faces.  It is definitely a masculine heavy watch.  The case has been easier to scratch the case than I like, it is a nice looking watch but not for all occasions.  The case design is slightly art deco in my opinion.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11026907", "1": "0.13301559", "2": "0.28327736", "3": "0.2950317", "4": "0.058495812", "5": "0.06383038", "6": "0.056080073"}}
