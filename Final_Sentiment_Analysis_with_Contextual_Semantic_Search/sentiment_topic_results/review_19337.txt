{"text": "There is no question about Invicta, and the class and appeal they have had for years with their watches. They have definitely been the leading guide in ones who want the finest watches on the market. They have shown that nicely with their timepieces for men for years. This Pro Diver Silver-Tone is very easy to fit around the wrist, and tells time nicely. It is a very easy to read watch, and has very good illumination in a blue faced timepiece, with a hint of purple in the light. What I do wish though is that the unidirectional bezel wouldn't actually stick at times, when rotating it for elapsed time. Nevertheless, it is a great piece for anyone who wants their first step into Invicta watches, without spending too much from the wallet. This is a good buy, and well worth the money.Price: BSetup & Comfort: B-Overall: B 1/2-", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2147955", "2": "0.19238387", "3": "0.20217952", "4": "0.110803515", "5": "0.12616853", "6": "0.15106204"}}
