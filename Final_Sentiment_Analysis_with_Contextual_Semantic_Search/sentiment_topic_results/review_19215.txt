{"text": "Love the wallet.  I was misled though because I think they have the chart color mixed up.  Thought I was getting red but got the green.  The apple green is definitely green.  I love the two part compartments; i.e., cash/coins on one side - credit cards on the other.  I've always had purses where I carried the credit cards built within the purse.  Thought I would have trouble converting to this, but so far it's even faster getting my cards out and back very quickly.  Plenty of room for cards and more.  If you are looking for a compact wallet, this is not what you want.  However, it's sleek enough to fit in a medium size purse. I've wasted a lot of money on wallets, so this is the first one that I've been satisfied with.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.20776142", "2": "0.32727084", "3": "0.15059362", "4": "0.06723709", "5": "0.118779965", "6": "0.12624376"}}
