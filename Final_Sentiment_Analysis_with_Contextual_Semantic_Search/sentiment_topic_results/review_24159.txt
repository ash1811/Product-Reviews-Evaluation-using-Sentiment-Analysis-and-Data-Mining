{"text": "I went to Glamorise's website to look up measurement guidelines to help me select the right bra size before ordering. I entered measurements on their website and ordered bra size recommended. When I received the bra, the bra is too tight in the band size. These bras run small and I would recommend ordering a size up in the band size that you normally wear. Also, as soon as I put this bra on the band immediately rolled. I'm hoping a larger band size will correct this problem. Overall, I like the bra but I don't think it will be suitable for high-impact activities.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15241937", "1": "0.13730536", "2": "0.092449404", "3": "0.45605046", "4": "0.05950334", "6": "0.09979269"}}
