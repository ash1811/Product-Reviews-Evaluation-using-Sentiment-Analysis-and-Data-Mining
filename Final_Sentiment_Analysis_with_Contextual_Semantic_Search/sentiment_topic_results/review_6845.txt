{"text": "I love the fit and construction of my Carhartt loose fit jeans. They are made from the thickest/ heaviest denim available, yet they are extremely comfortable. I ride motorcycles and prefer a comfortable jean over a uncomfortable restrictive motorcycle pant. These jeans fit my requirement perfectly. Sure, maybe wearing ATGATT (all the gear all the time) may provide the highest degree of safety, how many people choose to wear a helmet or fire suit while driving their cars around town or cross-country trip. These jeans are very comfortable to wear while riding and provide some protection.I like them better than any other brand, regardless of why or how I wear them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07438004", "1": "0.35810348", "2": "0.17053102", "3": "0.08431104", "4": "0.056783617", "5": "0.2537104"}}
