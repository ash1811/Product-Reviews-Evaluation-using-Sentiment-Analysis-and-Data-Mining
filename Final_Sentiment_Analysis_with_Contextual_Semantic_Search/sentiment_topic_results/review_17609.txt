{"text": "I love watches.. these casio vintage style watches are great beaters for when I don't want to wear my $100+ fashion watches!  Never had a problem with batteries like others have mentioned.. Maybe they ordered old stock.this watch is on the small side.. the dial is tiny compared to the big watches i wear.. Also, the amazon description mentions that this watch has a mineral crystal.. Mine was plastic all around (Except for the back case) so maybe the new versions have a plastic crystal now..Overall, well worth the price!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2576013", "2": "0.22190033", "3": "0.16014919", "4": "0.28339395", "6": "0.0717355"}}
