{"text": "My husband bought this for me when I was 35 weeks pregnant and experiencing some pretty severe pain from pubic symphysis dysfunction.  I am 38 1/2 weeks pregnant now, and I am continuing to wear the belt every day for support and to relieve the deep pelvic pain.  This product worked immediately, and I wish I had purchased it sooner.  It provides a lifting action, which takes the pressure of the baby off the deep pelvic structures (providing pain relief), and it compresses the pelvic bones together (also providing pain relief by preventing the painful symphysis separation).  It also helps to alleviate lower back pain.  I will be keeping it for subsequent pregnancies.The only complaint I have about the Mini Prenatal Cradle is that I wish there were more of the hook and eye closures... there are only three sets, and they are spaced about three inches apart.  So, there aren't many options for sizing.  I was a size 3-4 pre-pregnancy and now weigh 134 lbs, so I was right on the border between ordering the petite or small.  We went with the small because I didn't want to risk cutting off circulation with the petite, and it does fit perfectly with the tightest hook and eye slot.  I love this belt, and I would recommend trying the Mini before purchasing the larger Prenatal Cradle that wraps around the shoulders, but order a size up if you are right on the border between sizes!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1434405", "1": "0.22072941", "2": "0.22518289", "3": "0.20087895", "4": "0.09128883", "5": "0.08857707", "6": "0.029902313"}}
