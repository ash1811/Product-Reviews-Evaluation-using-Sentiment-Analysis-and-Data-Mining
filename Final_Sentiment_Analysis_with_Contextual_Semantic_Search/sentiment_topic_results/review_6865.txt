{"text": "I wear 29 waist, 32 length pants, and this medium Indera fit perfectly before and after washing.  It says not to wash in hot water but I wash and dry them with my whites.  They are very comfortable and remind me of the lower thermals I had decades ago.  They seem thick enough with quality construction that I expect to last many years.I also have a pair of synthetic lower thermals which are now missing the cuff on one leg.  Honestly, they are definitely warmer than these cotton thermals but I prefer the comfort of this cotton pair and the Indera looks like it has higher quality seams.  I only barely need thermals in the winter in Southern Arizona, so I'm very satisfied.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.072450414", "1": "0.2336522", "2": "0.088372886", "3": "0.117865235", "4": "0.1946943", "5": "0.12400187", "6": "0.16896309"}}
