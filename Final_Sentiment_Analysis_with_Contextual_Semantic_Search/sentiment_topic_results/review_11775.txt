{"text": "I bought three pair of these for me and my college age daughters to wear during our water aerobics classes because the bottom of the pool was shredding our feet and causing massive blisters on all of us.These are good shoes, lightweight, perfect treds for pool jogging and jumping.  We all get across the pool much faster than we ever did in our bare feet.  No slips or falls during the more complicated moves and our feet are well protected.  Yes they do run big.  We found this in all three pair and I wish I had gotten a full size smaller for myself.One main problem.... the insoles bunch and come loose from day one.  They are not secured into the shoe in any way and they become uncomfortable if you don't find some way to make them stay in place.  Wearing them without insoles is not an option because of the way inside of the sole is constructed.  We still are hunting what to do about this problem, but it is not a big enough issue to stop wearing them.Give these a try... the price is good and the quality is good.  I expect them to last a long time and give us lots of wear.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10960893", "1": "0.17021891", "2": "0.10965028", "3": "0.16627361", "4": "0.17055143", "5": "0.21131411", "6": "0.062382735"}}
