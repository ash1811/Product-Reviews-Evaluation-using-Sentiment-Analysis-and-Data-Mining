{"text": "I bought this Casio watch to replace another Casio that I bought about 13 years ago.  That watch still has the original battery in it and runs great.  I have had great luck with these watches as long as the band-prongs don't break.  It is very comfortable and will last a long time.  Thanks!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13039461", "1": "0.38124177", "2": "0.2492266", "3": "0.05976552", "6": "0.1691262"}}
