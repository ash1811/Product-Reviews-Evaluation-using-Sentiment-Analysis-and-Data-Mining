{"text": "First off I will try to be real honest here. I have no axe to grind.The fit: Great, pretty much true to size. I have long arms and the XL fit real niceThe neck: The mfg., makes the neck enormous. (Note to Mfg., we do not all have giant pumpkin heads, well.... I don't).Color: Pretty nice looking.Material: Fairly heavy. Heavier than a tee shirt, but not to thick that you get over hot.Not the nicest sweatshirt I have ever bought. If the neck was so ridiculously large I would give this sweatshirt four stars.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3705666", "2": "0.08697051", "3": "0.3214054", "4": "0.037560835", "5": "0.13233532", "6": "0.048557967"}}
