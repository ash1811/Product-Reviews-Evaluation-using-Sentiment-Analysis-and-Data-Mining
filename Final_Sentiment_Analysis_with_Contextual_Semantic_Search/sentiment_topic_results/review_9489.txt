{"text": "I recently received this watch in exchange for a much too large 200m model, which was too big for my wrist.  I've owned Ironman watches over the years, and this one appears to be a good one pending my testing in the water.  I recently bought my fiancee a women's Ironman for her running and swimming workouts and got the \"itch\" to try another one for myself.I own a G-Shock 200m watch and have had great results with it.  The big difference, though, is bulk.  For medium-sized guys like me, the greater water resistance Casios are simply too heavy and bulky for my admittedly smaller wrist.  And since I don't plan on joining the Navy Seals anytime soon (I'm 54) 100 meters is about enough for swimming and snorkeling.Operation is easy, one of the hallmarks of the Ironman. I particularly liked the new ability to easily \"hide\" unwanted functions (in my case, \"occasions\" and two of the three alarms).  Plus, the display is larger than earlier generations, which is a godsend for my age-deteriorated vision.  The new Indiglo operation (illumination of the numerals only, not the whole face) probably will result in a longer battery life as well.My favorite aspect of this watch (as with other Ironmans (Ironmen?;)  is the weight.  These are rugged watches that are as lightweight as a dress watch, which comes in handy when running, cycling, swimming, etc.  I'm looking forward to putting this watch through its paces.  As always, Amazon's customer service was quick and efficient, too!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08617872", "1": "0.1330675", "2": "0.20534734", "3": "0.17109905", "4": "0.06347041", "5": "0.21381417", "6": "0.12702276"}}
