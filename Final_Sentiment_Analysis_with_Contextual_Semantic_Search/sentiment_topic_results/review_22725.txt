{"text": "Be sure to go up in size. Anyone who wears Dickies apparently knows this. I looked at my man's pants to order him new ones, and there was no size that I could find on the old ones. So I ordered his normal pants size. Way too small. So I sent it  back and went up 2 sizes, and that was too big. Should have ordered one size up. Know your Dickies size and write it down!The fabric is stiff and sturdy, almost indestructible, does not lose its color in the wash.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20027058", "1": "0.2733148", "2": "0.20008323", "3": "0.21122302", "6": "0.10936865"}}
