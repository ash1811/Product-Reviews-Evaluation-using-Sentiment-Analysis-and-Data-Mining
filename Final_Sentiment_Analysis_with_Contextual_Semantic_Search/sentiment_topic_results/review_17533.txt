{"text": "This is a nice dress watch at a reasonable price.The band has a nice catch that is secure and easy to release.  It caught a few hairs, and isn't as adjustable for length as some other Casios, but it fits me.The watch is relatively thin, and I think it is attractive.  The face is navy blue instead of black - a feature that sets it off in my small collection of watches.  The date has been moved from 3:00 down to about 4:30 - this seems to work just as well for me.This watch doesn't have a lot of fancy features - it looks nice and tells the time - that is all I was looking for.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15989128", "1": "0.30457923", "2": "0.17446606", "3": "0.08020406", "4": "0.13626952", "6": "0.14183883"}}
