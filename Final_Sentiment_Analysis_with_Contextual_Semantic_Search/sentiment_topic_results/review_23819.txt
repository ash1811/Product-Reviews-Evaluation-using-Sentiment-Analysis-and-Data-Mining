{"text": "My daughter loves Vans. They are simply awesome whenever we order them and always arrive just as described. She wears a women's 9.5 so we ordered Men's 8. They fit perfectly. She'll be getting her Spring pair soon! But Amazon doesn't carry the ones she wants so I'll have to order them directly from Vans.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15690652", "1": "0.37149444", "3": "0.09555754", "4": "0.15929298", "5": "0.11661393", "6": "0.09565185"}}
