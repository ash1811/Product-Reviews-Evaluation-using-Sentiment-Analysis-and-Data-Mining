{"text": "I'm a runner, and a biker, and a teacher, and I needed a watch and timer for all of these things.  This watch does the job very well.  Sure, it's not the most fashionable watch in the world (a nine year old boy once said, \"Cool watch\", and then showed me he had the same one), but I think it's unobtrusive and the grey color is very neutral.  It's about $6 cheaper on Amazon than at Walmart.  I've actually purchased three of these, two I gave to students who needed them for summer camps.  It's durable and reliable.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.24344636", "2": "0.31822407", "3": "0.11317272", "4": "0.21879955", "5": "0.10039189"}}
