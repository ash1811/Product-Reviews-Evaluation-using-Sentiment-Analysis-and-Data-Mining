{"text": "I've purchased my DK Black. I usually coat my shoes with the applicator (doesn't take much) and let them dry (set) for about a minutes. Then I hit them with a horse hair brush and the shine is great!I used Florsheim shoe Creame Black for a few years, they were not as supple and the shine was much more delicate. I have switched to this polish and they are better than ever!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18392998", "1": "0.22151467", "2": "0.106914096", "3": "0.15074502", "5": "0.104884416", "6": "0.2280047"}}
