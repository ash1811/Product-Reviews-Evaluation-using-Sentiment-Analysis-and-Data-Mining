{"text": "Maybe I didn't pay attention to this item when I ordered it but it is really just an 3&#34; elastic band with bra hooks sewn in. When I put it on (and it wasn't tight) my refux started up really strong and my lower back started throbbing. Its happened every time I use it but I guess thats better than my entire back going into spasms which it has been doing every day for a month.  The size seems true to their description and I have plenty of extra inches left for the last two months of my pregnancy. The only thing I am noticing so far is that it does provide a bit of lift for my stomach.  Maybe there is a breaking-in time for this but the two days of use might be the only it gets.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.117827795", "2": "0.13085409", "3": "0.25658682", "4": "0.098363936", "5": "0.34004807", "6": "0.053886984"}}
