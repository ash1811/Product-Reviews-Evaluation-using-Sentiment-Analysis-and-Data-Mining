{"text": "These just don't hold up like they used to. I wish I could recommend these, but in my opinion they have decided to meet a price point at the expense of quality. Wrong choice if you want my business. It's far less expensive to pay a few dollars more to get a product that will hold up. It takes the same amount of time to sew either, so the difference is in the quality of the cotton used. It does not cost that much more to make a quality product, and I am willing to pay for the difference in prise. I have no plans to buy Wranglers again, previously these were my go to brand for some 30 years.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.28456008", "1": "0.33336672", "2": "0.057642434", "3": "0.14529178", "5": "0.15223597", "6": "0.024338327"}}
