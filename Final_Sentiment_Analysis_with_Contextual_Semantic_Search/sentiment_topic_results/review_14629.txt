{"text": "I've worn Birkies for years and these are my favorite summer sandals...Great support and they stay on your feet.  Actually they mold to your feet with wear.  My third pair.  They look great with everything but a suit.  These have a real arch support.  If you're flat footed you'll need to break them in gradually or you'll develop Achilles tendon pain.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.14142944", "2": "0.15225403", "3": "0.2645227", "4": "0.12888357", "5": "0.19579004", "6": "0.1127765"}}
