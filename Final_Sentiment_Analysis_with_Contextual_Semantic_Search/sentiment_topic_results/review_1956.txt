{"text": "I love these shoes.  They come polished well and the are easy to shine up.  Wingtips are pretty much the standard in business attire and these shoes look excellent.  For the going price of these shoes though I am a little upset that the sole is clearly plastic/rubber with a leather print.  With that in mind I could not justify spending another $70 to get a leather bottomed wingtip.  So far in wearing these shoes for around 10 days I have only suffered one crease I each shoe, and I have only had to polish the shoes once.  They still look amazing.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10400101", "1": "0.17712307", "2": "0.3413579", "3": "0.104460366", "4": "0.11709821", "5": "0.08027985", "6": "0.07567961"}}
