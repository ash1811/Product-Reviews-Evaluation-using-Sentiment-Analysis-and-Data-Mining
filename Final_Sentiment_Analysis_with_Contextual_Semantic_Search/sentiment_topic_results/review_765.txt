{"text": "I am tall for a girl at 5'10 and it is hard to find scrub pants that are long enough for me.  Cherokee is the only brand I have found that has a tall pair of scrubs that are actually long!!!  I love the fit.  They do run large.  I wear a size 10 in women's and I am a small in these pants. They are comfy and don't really shrink much with repeated washings and drying.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09461409", "1": "0.28252852", "2": "0.09943323", "3": "0.31449324", "4": "0.20097011"}}
