{"text": "For years I resisted purchasing Keen's shoes because they are expensive and frankly, somewhat ugly. But in the summer when I need to do a bit of walking, I find that flipflops or regular sandals just aren't comfortable enough for me if I have to walk or be on my feet for more than an hour. What I've been doing is to wear a pair of leather Keds which are comfortable but in the Texas heat, I'd really rather not. These sandals are fantastic and very much worth the money to me! I get the benefit of a sandal with the long-term comfort and sturdiness of a more substantial shoe.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06541202", "1": "0.25330514", "2": "0.14317095", "3": "0.215314", "4": "0.10392728", "5": "0.11428582", "6": "0.10458483"}}
