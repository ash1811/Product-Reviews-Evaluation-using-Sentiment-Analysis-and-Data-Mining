{"text": "I had a VERY low pregnancy with my son, and the pain in my stomach and pressure on my lower back was very difficult to handle.  I purchased this band because it was one of the cheaper options for a belly band.  I chose a size small based on the fitting chart, and the small fit me well (I have a very slim waist but bigger hips & legs), and the band helped to alleviate a lot of my lower back and lower stomach pain.  I used it from 2 months (9 weeks) until about 7 months (30 weeks) when the base of my belly was way too big for the band to fit.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.26496598", "1": "0.17968807", "2": "0.102727555", "3": "0.23148793", "4": "0.14564198", "6": "0.07297479"}}
