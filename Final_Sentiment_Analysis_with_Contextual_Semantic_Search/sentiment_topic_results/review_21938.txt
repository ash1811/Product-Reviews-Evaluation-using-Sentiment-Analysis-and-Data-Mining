{"text": "I purchased this bra for running because I get very hot in our California sun and don't like wearing anything on top of them in the summer when it's over 100 degrees here. With that said, my sports bra's have to be very supportive and secure or I will give someone a show! This bra has velcro shoulder strap adjustments but they are very secure. The bra itself is a very strong fabric with full coverage and underwire that doesn't pinch or poke. I fell in love with this style and went back to order more only to find out they are discontinued in almost every size. I even tried eBay but no luck. You know when you can't find things on eBay you are in trouble!Hope Champion will bring this style back but in the mean time I will try their Hanes, Bali, Platex Outlets which are in Outlet Malls. They carry Champion bra's at a discount & may have it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09155532", "1": "0.15433301", "2": "0.15663527", "3": "0.2933623", "4": "0.12362026", "5": "0.10497785", "6": "0.07551599"}}
