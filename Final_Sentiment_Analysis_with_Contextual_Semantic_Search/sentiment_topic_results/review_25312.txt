{"text": "I LOVE my Moabs.  I wear a 13 wide, which is not an easy size to find.  These shoes are extremely comfortable and give my toes plenty of room but still stay secure.  The ventilation works alright, they're as cool as any other shoe I've worn.  The Vibram sole is awesome and seems like it will last quite awhile.  Overall these shoes are a superb value and I think they'll endure a lot of punishment.  Highly recommended.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0683143", "1": "0.2107395", "2": "0.18658422", "3": "0.3022237", "4": "0.13862818", "6": "0.09038866"}}
