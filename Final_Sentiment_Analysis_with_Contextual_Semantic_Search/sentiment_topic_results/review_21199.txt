{"text": "My husband loves these shirts because they are super soft and fit really well, but he can't wear them with most dress shirts because the neckline is SO low that you can see it through the shirt. I had never thought of this being an issue, because I had never seen the neckline on an undershirt through a dress shirt - but it's definitely visible and it looks very odd. He still likes them for sweaters and shirts where the lower neckline is okay, but I wouldn't pay this much for such a limited use undershirt again...", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12881319", "1": "0.4797409", "4": "0.27662113", "5": "0.104806855"}}
