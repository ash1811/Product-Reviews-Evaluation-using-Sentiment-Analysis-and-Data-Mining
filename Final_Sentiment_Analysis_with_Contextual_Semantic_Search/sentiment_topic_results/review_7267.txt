{"text": "I'm quite angry right now, so bare with me. I should know better than to buy jeans online and trust that the sizing is correct. I have to go to truck driving school in 2 days and I was really excited about finally having a decent pair of jeans after doing much research and reading reviews. I only had one other nice comfortable pair of jeans before now and going by the reviews, I was trusting these to be my next reliable pair. Now I can't even return them, because I'm going to be gone for 2 months at school with no breaks. Does anyone outside of America know what our waist sizes are? Seriously!Pros:-Quality: Good or even better when compared with today's standard of internationally outsourced jeans with a seriously declining quality and lack of pride in product. Compared with the original 501 levi's many, many years back, all jeans made today are pretty much garbage. They would last like 50,000 washes or 20 years if taken care of properly. That said, these are a bit better than the new *made in china* levi's that start falling apart after 8 months. These are one step above most jeans I've had lately.-Price: These jeans are WELL worth the money for $30 free shipping.Cons:-Made in Mexico (at least the pair that I bought was, big companies like Wrangler or levis that used to be proud USA brands are now made elsewhere. Fail.)-Size: If you are a 36\" waist like me, order a 38\" size for waist or maybe even 40\"!  Length is correct. With normal 36 size jeans, they fit loose when new, and then once they're washed a few times, they fit just right on me or maybe even a little loose still. These are brand new and they're choking the life out of me. I NEVER need a 38. I'm in good shape. I'm always the same size. Anytime I get pants from Asia or Mexico, they are small on me 95% of the time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24745569", "1": "0.14595008", "2": "0.20605865", "3": "0.22599673", "4": "0.10866535", "6": "0.06366467"}}
