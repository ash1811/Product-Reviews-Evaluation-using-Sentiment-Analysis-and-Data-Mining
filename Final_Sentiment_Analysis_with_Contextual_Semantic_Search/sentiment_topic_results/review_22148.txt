{"text": "I'm not sure why there is such a wide range of opinion about these glove liners, but I love them. They are very, very fine and fit comfortably under any other pair of gloves. I know that some here find sizing problems, but I found them to fit quite well, though I have unusual hands: very broad with somewhat short fingers. They fit my hand perfectly.I normally wear a pair of wool gloves lined with thinsulite. But I found them just a tiny bit too cool for winter in Chicago. These liners to a great job of adding a warming layer beneath the gloves. I walk my dog along the lakefront even during the coldest part of the winter so I have especial need for warmth.Given one or two reviews I want to stress that these are LINERS. They cannot be worn as gloves. You will freeze your hands off if you try to wear these on their own. But worn under regular gloves they will help keep your hands warm and comfortable.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.078218795", "1": "0.30029607", "2": "0.25111172", "3": "0.18064065", "4": "0.08925884", "5": "0.08783428", "6": "0.012639629"}}
