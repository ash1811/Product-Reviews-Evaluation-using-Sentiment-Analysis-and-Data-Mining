{"text": "These are the slippers I've been looking for all my life. They are cozy, warm and so snuggly. Once you put them on, it will be quite the effort to remove your feet as they will object and question your reasons at length.Can these be washed? The care instructions state: Do not immerse in water. The suede leather can be cleaned with a damp cloth but moisture should be immediately removed with a dry cloth. You can also sprinkle baking soda over the fleece and let it stand overnight, then vacuum. I have washed these once with some LUSH shampoo and they came out fairly OK.The box has information about these slippers resisting moisture - rain and wet grass. The skid resistant uppers make them perfect for walking outside. Once you buy one slipper, you may find yourself wishing for two, no wait, three...OK, four or more. These could be considered addictive. One for every room, one for the garage, one for when you go out to get the paper, one for walks. They also sell some jeweled varieties that are especially pretty.With all the varieties of slippers for every member of the family, these would make perfect gifts all year round.~The Rebecca Review", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13415357", "1": "0.24653266", "2": "0.12950073", "3": "0.08547244", "4": "0.19029388", "5": "0.13050461", "6": "0.08354214"}}
