{"text": "I'm a size 10 in most things, and size 12 is the correct size for me.My problem is that I have short legs and a very long torso with an extra large bust. I'm very difficult to dress. I was hoping that this would have a higher neckline to go with the &#34;conservative&#34; cut legs. It does not!. I might be more modest on the bottom, but I'm showing tons of cleavage and my boobs are squished. I can tell it's supposed to fit in a way that would be modest on most women, but because my torso is so long, I can't get this to rise up far enough. This also means the shoulder straps are tight.I am 5'5&#34;, 138 pounds, 36 DDD bra (not by choice, mind you - I was born this way, sigh.)  I'm an odd fit!That said, I don't expect any other swim suit to offer a better fit, and this does cover me.I don't like the &#34;conservative&#34; cut as well as I hoped, as it can get a little restrictive on my motion. That said, I like how it helps hide my over sized bottom well! It holds in my fat in a flattering way. I'm not overweight, but I carry most of my weight around my hips.I'm happy with it, all things considered!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.0880459", "1": "0.14767644", "2": "0.099443965", "3": "0.15237637", "4": "0.30758774", "5": "0.108033925", "6": "0.09683567"}}
