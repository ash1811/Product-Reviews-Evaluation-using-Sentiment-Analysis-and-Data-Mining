{"text": "I needed a long sleeve black leotard for my daughter who wears about a size 16 normally.  I almost bought the XS Women's but after looking at the chart decided to the Small.  So glad I did - it fits great. My daughter does have a bit of a longer torso than perhaps average and would not be considered overweight, but would also not be considered skinny.  She is younger than her height would suggest and still does not have a waist yet so that may play into her sizing.  Hope this helps with fitting!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.023182927", "1": "0.5113314", "2": "0.079666995", "3": "0.27837846", "4": "0.05986391", "6": "0.04459012"}}
