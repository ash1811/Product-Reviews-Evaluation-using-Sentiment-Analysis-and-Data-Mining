{"text": "The band is on the narrow side.  I'm a six foot tall person with average wrist diameter and I'm out on the 2nd to last hole.  Someone with a big wrist might be on the last hole or out of luck.  The band feels more like plastic than like cloth.  At first I wouldn't say it's overly comfortable however I haven't broken it in yet.  Some people might chose to replace the band.Setting the watch was fairly easy however the crown doesn't have a definite two position feel to it (one position to set the time and the other position to set the day and date).The watch face has large hands so it's easy to tell the time. It's hard to see the day and date unless your in pretty good light.The fact that the watch will not need a battery over it's lifetime is going to save the cost of several battery replacements which could justify the cost of the watch alone.All in all it's a good watch for the money (thus four stars) but I would not give the watch five stars because of some of the minor issues listed above.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11158043", "1": "0.23912549", "2": "0.20344955", "4": "0.17654411", "5": "0.16235682", "6": "0.104772516"}}
