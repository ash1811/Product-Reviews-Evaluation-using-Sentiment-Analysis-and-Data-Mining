{"text": "One of the true classic divers at an excellent price point. Great retro style from the 60's and a perfect size. No big clunky stupid looking quartz  handcuff. This has a polished ss case and a smooth turning bezel. Great seiko fit/finish as usual. Only downside is the very easy to scratch crystal. I have several of these, the last purchase was from a less than reliable vendor on amazon. The band was a replacement, not original. It did not have the polished seiko tang, and the easiest give away... It was on backwards! I called amazon but no luck dealing with getting this taken care of.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1421938", "1": "0.27856618", "2": "0.18439646", "4": "0.13827282", "5": "0.072311915", "6": "0.18185635"}}
