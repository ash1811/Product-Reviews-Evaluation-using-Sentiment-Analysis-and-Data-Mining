{"text": "Carhartt is a great brand and produces high quality products.  This is another one.This jacket has a thermal liner so that it is not as heavy as some of their other jackets.  The outside is soft and pliable, but the inside is lined with the thermal liner (even the hood has this lining).  When I first tried it on, the liner was uncomfortable on my bare arms.  I thought that I would have to wear a long sleeve shirt whenever I wore the jacket, but after breaking it in for a few weeks I am now able to comfortably wear it with both short and long sleeve shirts.This jacket is light, but still is able to keep you warm.  I wear this in windy, sub 30&#730;F weather and it keeps me warm and comfortable.The only down side is that the pockets are not lined with the thermal lining.  They are made of the same material as the outer material, so they are nice and soft, but do not keep your hands as warm as it keeps your upper body and arms.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06668423", "1": "0.2734308", "2": "0.2157037", "3": "0.17406555", "4": "0.06422941", "5": "0.12855856", "6": "0.07732779"}}
