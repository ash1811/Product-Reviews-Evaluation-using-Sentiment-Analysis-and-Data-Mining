{"text": "First of all, the sizing on these bras makes no sense - I thought it was just weirdly displayed on Amazon, and that &#34;34/36 D/DD&#34; really meant 34DD/36D (as I have seen on other brands). But no, it really is labeled that way on the bra itself. What does that kind of sizing even mean? There is a pretty big difference between a 34D and a 36DD, if this bra purports to fit that range of sizes. In my opinion, it does not. I am a 34DD, 5'4&#34;, 155-160 lbs. This bra is cut way too low around the arm holes for a so-called full-figure bra - I had way too much flesh hanging out around the sides of the bra, and the placement of the straps made the whole thing look skimpy. Oh, I should have known better than to try to buy a bra online!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.0661529", "1": "0.15741047", "2": "0.078756474", "3": "0.25943732", "4": "0.08439079", "5": "0.17983596", "6": "0.17401609"}}
