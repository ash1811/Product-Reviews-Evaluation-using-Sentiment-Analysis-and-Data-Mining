{"text": "so i ordered this jacket for a series of new battlestar items i wanted to put on a jacket but i didn't want to put holes in my leather A-2 cause i liked the jacket too much. I have done this with jackets in the past and since i needed to replace my other denim jacket. So as to the jacket it looked good before but when i stuck the BSG gear on it it looked awesome. I used the correct placement, to those of you looking for correct information the viper fighter patch goes on the right the gold crest (Gold for officer black for enlisted) is on the left and the wings go on the right. My only issue is the angled down seam on the chest but thats a minor issue. Overall its going to be great for spring plus in pittsburgh our weather can shift quickly. I like to have a nice mix of outer wear. one day it can be 20 and snowing and the next day it can be 60. All the same i like it one very nice jacket", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16797136", "1": "0.18293776", "2": "0.37322205", "3": "0.12384046", "4": "0.08109435", "6": "0.068376765"}}
