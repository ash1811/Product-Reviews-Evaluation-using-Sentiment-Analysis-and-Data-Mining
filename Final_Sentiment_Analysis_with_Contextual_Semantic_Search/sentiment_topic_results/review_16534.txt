{"text": "I don't have much complaint about the product itself (I was sent the wrong item) but the seller 'MensWallet' is horrible. After I pointed out that I was sent the wrong item, the seller asked for a picture of what was sent. I send them the picture and they immediately realized what they did. But instead of providing me with a replacement they started to fooling around me. Their first offer was to issue me a $5 refund and keep the item they sent me (like, really? who does that?). Then I told them I'll only accept the item I ordered and their reply to this was, we don't have it in our stock anymore. I didn't believe them, of course, because their listing on Amazon was still up. I pointed that out and they told me to return the item and they are ready to refund.At this point, I knew I have had enough crap from them. I told them I am not taking any hassle to return this item because the seller was just trying to be a smartass on a cheap wallet. Then with a sarcastic voice, they asked if I am unable to print the return shipping label they're offering, and last line being, &#34;Hope this will resolve your 'serious' issue&#34;. I chose not to contact this people again (they are poor at communicating as well, roughly 1 reply a day and I had this going for around a week I guess).I escalated this to my first Amazon claim and as expected was issued a full refund. The item sent ended up in the garbage - took picture of that too because this seller tend to come back and asks for proof (yes, this is the other way round) and will lecture how their business works and they have a policy and all. Just a joke. The hassle I had to go through for a cheap wallet is really pathetic. I chose not to let go because I saw they did this to other buyers too and wanted to see the end of this.Buying from MensWallet - you've been warned.The wallet itself - it's not bad considering you're paying less than $20 (i got a replacement).", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06387626", "1": "0.27489132", "2": "0.10728648", "3": "0.08860664", "4": "0.071955346", "5": "0.16310292", "6": "0.23028098"}}
