{"text": "This is the real deal. The tactical shemagh here isn't one of those thin, useless fashion ones, but a thick cotton one that actually can protect your eyes and nose from the sand, or your face from the cold weather (which is what I'm using it for these days). A lot of airsoft players are using these too for face and neck protection, and this version will do the job nicely.It's hard to say much more about something like this. The size is right, it offers good warmth during the winter, and the tassels aren't too long. This is 100% cotton, made in India, and doesn't itch. If you're sick of trying to decide on which shemagh to order here on Amazon, since there are so many, you can stop looking now and order one of these. Heck, order a couple since they don't cost much. 'can't go wrong with the classic black and white or olive, but all the colors look good.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19485624", "1": "0.334381", "2": "0.1303509", "3": "0.19969723", "4": "0.026896529", "5": "0.11136762"}}
