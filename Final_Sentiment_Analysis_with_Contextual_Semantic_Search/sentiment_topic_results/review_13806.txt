{"text": "This is a solid dive watch by Seiko, and is of high quality even compared to other watches by Seiko in the same price range. The bracelet is very comfortable, no pressure points on the wrist, and sits well on the center of my wrist joint. It has a very bright illumination on the hour marks, the hands, and the dot at the top of the bezel. It's finished with a combination of polished and brushed accents. The bezel is raised around the edges higher than the glass so it's even more resistant to scratches. The bezel spins purposely and feel very sturdy, with soft clicks. Power reserve is about 24 hours.To adjust the bracelet though, take it to a watch shop. The pins are held in by some kind of cap and if you're not familiar with it, you'll break it or your tool.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14078571", "1": "0.15858975", "2": "0.23526725", "3": "0.08849706", "4": "0.13833585", "5": "0.12272366", "6": "0.11580069"}}
