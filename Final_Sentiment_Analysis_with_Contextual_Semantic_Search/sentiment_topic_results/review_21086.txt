{"text": "I bought 10 of these bags in 2007 and they've held up to weekly grocery shopping, along with lugging stuff to work/school/picnics/etc, and being washed at least once a month, and they're still totally usable! I'm ordering more because mine have seen better days. They look kind of dingy/dirty even when they're clean (I originally had the white/red bags), and they have some sort of latex type lining on the inside bottom that is wearing thin in patches, so I think it's time for new bags. We DEFINITELY got our money's worth with these bags ~ 6 years! I'll still use them as a back up when I have the big grocery trips for holidays, parties, etc,  and need extra bags. They're the perfect simple basic bag for groceries, I like that they aren't humongous because I don't like my bags to get too heavy. Durable, washable, lovely!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.118830726", "1": "0.23243703", "2": "0.122023724", "3": "0.14269161", "4": "0.10747013", "5": "0.23541848", "6": "0.04112836"}}
