{"text": "first let me say that my last acorn slippers finally wore out, I had no idea just how tired they were until I received the new ones and felt like I was walking on a pillow instead of bare floor,  the colors are very nice and not as plain up close (though not flashy bright either)they are the same as my old pair but different pattern, these slipper you can easily wear out to the mail box or running out to the car for a minute (not in the wet or snow however)I highly recommend these and hope they will last a good long time,though I will not wait 8 yrs before I get a new pair.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.1815477", "2": "0.11635616", "3": "0.1027931", "4": "0.16295831", "5": "0.22469136", "6": "0.20922293"}}
