{"text": "Sadly, the markers inside the watch, came lose and stopped the watch cold. The Invicta company only covers the watch for a year, and it makes no sense to send it back. Besides having to keep it wound all the time, my husband stated that the band was very unforgiving and uncomfortable. This is the third Invicta watch that I have had, and two of them are now no longer worth what they were paid for. It is very unfortunate because, the Invicta watches actually look so nice, but unfortunately, they just don't stand the test of time! (Pun intended). However, we also purchased a Citizen Eco Drive watch on the same day, and these watches are PHENOMENAL. They look great, and stand up to daily wearing, without losing time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13090368", "1": "0.15700108", "2": "0.25382692", "3": "0.108744554", "4": "0.11832777", "5": "0.17893176", "6": "0.052264214"}}
