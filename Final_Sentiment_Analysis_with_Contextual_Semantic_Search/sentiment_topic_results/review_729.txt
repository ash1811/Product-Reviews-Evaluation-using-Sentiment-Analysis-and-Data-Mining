{"text": "I bought this ring for a wedding band for when I'm out doing active things (hiking,swimming,exercising). My original wedding ring would probably get caught on things. It's a lovely ring, it has a great polish finish and just shines beautifully. The only thing is I'm a size 4 and the 3 mm is a bit big for my finger, but it's a great price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17612714", "1": "0.4248608", "2": "0.08727118", "4": "0.13490172", "5": "0.100313686", "6": "0.07242268"}}
