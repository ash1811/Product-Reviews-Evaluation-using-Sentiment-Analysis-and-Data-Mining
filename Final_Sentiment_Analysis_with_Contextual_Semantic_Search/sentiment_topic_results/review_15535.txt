{"text": "The Skagen 233LTTN men's watch is good-looking and so thin that you barely notice it under a dress shirt cuff.  The band is easy to adjust and of course it keeps great time.  I bought one of the &#34;in&#34; big, clunky watches and had to give it up because it was just too uncomfortable to wear under a shirt and suit jacket.  The Skagen is a dream - as comfortable as the old Universal-Geneve I used to own and just as handsome.  This is a great watch!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2094303", "1": "0.35792854", "2": "0.30706665", "3": "0.06273978", "6": "0.055654846"}}
