{"text": "My husband likes everything about this watch except the color.  When I ordered it, I thought it would have a blue face.  It actually has a sort of subdued lavender face (my husband called it purple, but it is not that shocking), which is also very nice, but he would have felt more comfortable if it had a blue face.  He is wearing the watch none-the-less.  I don't know why the Amazon watch description says \"blue dial\", if it really isn't.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.36337358", "2": "0.37214065", "4": "0.15605956", "6": "0.09817407"}}
