{"text": "Thanks to another reviewer I got the green ones instead of the raspberry. The green insoles have just the right arch support for my plantar fasciitis-ridden feet. I am glad to have them in my everyday Merrell slip on shoes. These insoles are not too soft, but soft enough, and after just one day of wear I don't notice them at all, which is perfect. Based on the last pair (I had the raspberry) I expect about a year from these, but will happily accept a longer wear time from them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14300846", "2": "0.123595715", "3": "0.31120747", "4": "0.31567433", "6": "0.10026778"}}
