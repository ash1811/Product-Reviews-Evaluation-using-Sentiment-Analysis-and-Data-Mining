{"text": "I have not used in rain yet. Rain pants are pretty basic. The material is very light and feels like it should keep rain out.  No places for rain to get in so should be good. The price is good.Warning they run small. I'm 5'6 and the length is ok. The waist  in the small is for those with maximum of 30 inch (I'm 32) waist if you plane to wear jeans. If I had to do all over again I would get medium and roll up pant legs. Will have to carry work pants separate and wear athletic shorts and change at work. I don't want the hassle of returning.Despite sizing issue I recommend based on material and price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06439327", "1": "0.41020578", "2": "0.19138825", "4": "0.21850899", "6": "0.11086856"}}
