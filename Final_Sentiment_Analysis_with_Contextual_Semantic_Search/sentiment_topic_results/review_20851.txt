{"text": "Havaianas lives up to its hype!  Got these yesterday, put them on and they fit perfectly.  Typically I am a 7.5 or 8 in shoes and the 37/38 size is spot on.  I had bought 38/39 by mistake and had to send them back but Amazon immediately issued me a credit (thank you!).These flops are comfortable and I will DEFINITELY buy more pairs in the future!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16378897", "1": "0.33663657", "2": "0.12645885", "3": "0.14435484", "4": "0.15534207", "6": "0.06920867"}}
