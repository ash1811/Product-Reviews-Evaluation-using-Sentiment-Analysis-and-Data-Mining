{"text": "I bought these after reading all the good reviews.  I have bought Easy Spirit previously, just not this style.  I am on my feet all day and these were not as comfortable as I expected.  I even put insoles in them thinking that would help...not the case.  They are still a nice shoe but nothing I can stand in all day.  They are true to size and fit well but not the comfort level I was looking for.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.055215415", "1": "0.42092595", "2": "0.14016438", "4": "0.122445635", "5": "0.10979786", "6": "0.14735174"}}
