{"text": "I have worn Ralph Lauren crew neck T-shirts along with a variety of other brands for years now. I have mixed feelings about this three pack of RL 65 shirts: they qualitatively feel thinner than I recall Polo undershirts being, but in all truth that's fine with me as I wear them predominantly under uniform shirts and don't generally need them for insulation. If you prefer thicker cotton, this may not be a good purchase. The texture is very soft and they are comfortable but they do have a drawback for taller men: the tails aren't especially long and tend to come untucked regularly (I am 6' 2\") which I find perpetually annoying. I rated them four stars overall, as if you like thinner undershirts and don't need longer tails I think these would be nearly ideal as they are supremely comfortable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1250783", "1": "0.29778588", "2": "0.09581124", "3": "0.116948575", "4": "0.07549214", "5": "0.1470876", "6": "0.14179622"}}
