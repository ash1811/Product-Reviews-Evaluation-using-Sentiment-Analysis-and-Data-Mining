{"text": "I love these pants, they're quite comfortable and feel durable through the several wearings/washings I've subjected them to. My only two complaints are:-- the waist is very small. My waist is MUCH smaller than everything below. The pants fit great around the hips/buttocks/thighs but the waist is tight. If it weren't for the small elastic panels in the band, I probably wouldn't be able to wear them. That being said, the pants do tend to relax after a few minutes of wear and I can tolerate the discomfort. (I just wouldn't wear them to anything like Thanksgiving dinner!)-- the legs are short. I have average length legs and find pants either break across the top of my foot with a little bit below the top of my shoe or they're REALLY long and I step on them. Not these pants. They come just to the top of my foot - in other words, wear nice socks or whatever because as you walk, they will be seen.If I had tried these on in a store, I wouldn't have purchased them. They fit enough that I didn't want to hassle with returning them (though Amazon was great about the other brand of pants I returned). I'm not sure buying a size larger would help because, as I said, they fit everywhere else.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09536332", "1": "0.31524342", "2": "0.15969478", "3": "0.3025092", "4": "0.056305666", "5": "0.06862499"}}
