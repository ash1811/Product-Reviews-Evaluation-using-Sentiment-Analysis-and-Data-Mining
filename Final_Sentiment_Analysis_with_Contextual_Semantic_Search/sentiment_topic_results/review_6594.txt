{"text": "I purchased these for my son, and he is very satisfied. I'm a longtime Thorlo wearer myself and prefer to wear nothing but Thorlo. The socks are durable, lasting a decade or more before they wear out. Plus - importantly - they don't have the toe seams that I find so uncomfortable in cheaper socks. They're also soft, cushiony, warm in winter, but cool in summer. I just wish these walking crews came in more colors than white, black, and navy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.040302116", "1": "0.3327002", "3": "0.14987113", "4": "0.1192143", "5": "0.17209752", "6": "0.18239859"}}
