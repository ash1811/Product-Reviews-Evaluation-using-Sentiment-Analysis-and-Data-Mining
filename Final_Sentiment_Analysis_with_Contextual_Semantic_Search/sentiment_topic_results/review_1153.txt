{"text": "I love this bra. I tried it on as soon as it was delivered. I was worried that it wouldn't fit right because I has a large chest, born with it, and I'm not so small around so I usually get a larger size around  the chest on other bras. I ordered 38D. It fits purfect. It stays up and has great support. It also came with clear straps. That was a bonus. If your looking for a strapless bra that is low cut and won't fall down, this would be the bra for you!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.074130505", "1": "0.24047434", "2": "0.05744113", "3": "0.4130961", "4": "0.09737412", "5": "0.042598475", "6": "0.074885316"}}
