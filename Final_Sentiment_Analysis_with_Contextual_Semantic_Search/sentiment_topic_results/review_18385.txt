{"text": "The watch looks at least as good as it appears in Amazon photos. The band looks great with a blend of brushed and polished metal. It looks and feels pretty heavy and solid, just right on my wrist which is average sized for a man. Comfortable to wear.After about a month, it is holding time perfectly. The dial and hands have a high contrast and look very attractive. The hands and markers glow fairly brightly in the dark. The date display is recessed so much that it is hard to read unless lighting is direct and/or you have good vision.Amazon price was a lot better than local retailers' sale prices. I had to remove a few links myself to fit my wrist - using a cheap $4 tool also purchased from Amazon.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.20533818", "1": "0.2641481", "2": "0.07022357", "3": "0.1307686", "4": "0.19461338", "5": "0.03885706", "6": "0.09605106"}}
