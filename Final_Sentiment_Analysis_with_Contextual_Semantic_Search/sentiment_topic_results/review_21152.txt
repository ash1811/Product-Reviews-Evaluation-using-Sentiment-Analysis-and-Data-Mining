{"text": "I bought these for a present and they did not fit the person- I guess Pleasers are a more of a miss than a hit.Added: The person I gave these as a gift to, brought them back to me so I could return them. I thought they were well made and wrapped very nicely. Each shoe was in its own individual cloth-like bag. They are cute.Too small however.
