{"text": "This Timex watch is perfect for my needs since it has a large analog face and very bright \"Indiglo\" back lighting, which makes it easy to read with my aging eyes. This is fairly plain looking and keeps good time, which is all I really need in a daily use watch.This is good value for a very functional watch!Recommended!CFH", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1934857", "1": "0.18190482", "2": "0.10795687", "3": "0.20258015", "5": "0.20156245", "6": "0.10817176"}}
