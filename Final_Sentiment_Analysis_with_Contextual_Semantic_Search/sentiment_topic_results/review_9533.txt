{"text": "I bought these and they are pretty tough, and I mean that in a good way. The bad part, due to which I gave it 4 stars, is because they are a bit hard to break in. I took out the soles it came with and inserted some Dr. Scholls Extra Support insoles because I use them for work and do a lot of walking and lifting which results in extra comfort. The steel toe is very dependable and protective to ones feet. The design too gives it a masculine and tough look so it gets attention and others want them, my buddies do. I HIGHLY recommend these boots because for them being brand named Caterpillar boots, they are pretty affordable!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08377014", "1": "0.15212403", "2": "0.104895726", "3": "0.16861473", "4": "0.17767903", "5": "0.17164223", "6": "0.14127411"}}
