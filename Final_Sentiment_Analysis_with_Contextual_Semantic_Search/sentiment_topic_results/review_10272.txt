{"text": "It's hard to buy a bandanna these days, as they tend to be crappy.  This was takes a few washings to soften up, like most of them do, but end up soft and don't bleed in the process.  Not the highest quality, but not a piece of junk either.  I use it around my neck when I ride my motorcycle, and it's great for that.  A bit small for around my head, but I also have a head the size of a zeppelin.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07771136", "1": "0.2611707", "2": "0.14021905", "3": "0.08649504", "4": "0.11339347", "5": "0.15929796", "6": "0.16171241"}}
