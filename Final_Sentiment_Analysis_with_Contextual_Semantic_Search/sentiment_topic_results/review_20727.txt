{"text": "FINALLY a strapless bra that actually does as advertised! Comes with fully adjustable straps so can be worn strapless, raceback, etc. Fit is true to size. Good lift and separation. No uni-boob. No spilling out top. No top edge collapse or falling forward that screams \"strapless\" under your shirt. Highly recommended.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.144285", "1": "0.20042846", "2": "0.12630746", "3": "0.21630496", "5": "0.221754", "6": "0.086589165"}}
