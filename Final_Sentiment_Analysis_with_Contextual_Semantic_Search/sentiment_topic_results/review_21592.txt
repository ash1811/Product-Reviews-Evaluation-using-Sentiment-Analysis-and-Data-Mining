{"text": "I've been eyeing this for awhile, but was reluctant to order it because of the price.  I finally caved -- and it is absolutely beautiful!As other reviewers have said, this is a very high quality product, so it looks very elegant sitting out in your bedroom or bathroom.  The acrylic is very expensive-looking, and doesn't look cheap at all.I researched this before buying it, and I had read something on-line about how acrylic is more expensive than regular plastic, and I can see why.  This has a nice sparkle to it.I bought it to hold my hair accessories and some makeup, and it looks lovely!  It's a definite splurge, but it holds a lot and looks lovely doing so!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17679653", "1": "0.207478", "2": "0.14816065", "3": "0.15867011", "4": "0.15257315", "5": "0.040035713", "6": "0.11628584"}}
