{"text": "My husband wears a size 10 shoe and I bought him a 10 in these. The toe part seems to stick out too far. It seems about a half size to big. While wearing these, he sometimes stumbles a bit from not lifting his foot high enough while walking. He treats them like his Tevas but his Tevas are a better fit. Not sure if he would have bought these himself if he was able to try them on first. Other than the toe thing, he says they are comfortable and feel good on his feet.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.31660286", "2": "0.10689095", "3": "0.21692526", "4": "0.14579357", "5": "0.07967789", "6": "0.13105679"}}
