{"text": "Bought to replace my middle schoolers backpack, which had a broken strap.  Her giant (broken backpack) is WAY overweight and when this came in, I didn't think what she had would fit.  Wrong!  This bag is deceptively roomy and  we packed it with ease.  It easily handled 4 1/ 1/2&#34; 3 ring binders, 3 workbooks, calculator, pencil bag, snacks, and three large novels checked out from the media center.  The zippers don't snag along the way and the pulls are easy to grab .  The entire bag has the look and feel of being well made.  Plus, it is attractive without being too &#34;girly&#34;- which is not my teen's style.  Great bag!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07059249", "1": "0.36759886", "2": "0.2921439", "3": "0.09009385", "4": "0.035180498", "5": "0.063998334", "6": "0.080391996"}}
