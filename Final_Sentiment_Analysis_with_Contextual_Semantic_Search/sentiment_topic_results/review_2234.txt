{"text": "Overall, I really like this shoe. It's comfortable, and has a skid-free sole. The heel is just a tad wide for me, however, and I get a little bit of heel slippage when I walk. Also, I wish they were  just a little bit lighter-weight. I'm a nursing student, and this shoe satisfies my needs providing for plenty of comfort for a reasonable price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.046072103", "1": "0.2559159", "2": "0.1783683", "3": "0.16715495", "4": "0.09989013", "6": "0.24850805"}}
