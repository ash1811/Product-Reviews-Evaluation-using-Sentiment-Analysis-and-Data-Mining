{"text": "I must say I was pretty stoked to order this guy even before I got it, but I will make this a fair review. I work in a industrial area so I like cheap watches that I don't have to care for and will break off my wrist in an emergency. I lost my last cheap work watch which was a Timex as I have stuck to them for year. I happen to see this one on the amazon webpage right next to the Timex I was going to purchased. There is always a shortage of calculators at my work, and I needed a new watch. I solved both issues at once.The normal display is just PM, hours, minutes, seconds and day of the week as seen in the pictures. The main function or menu bottle is on the side which allows you to scroll between functions. The functions in order from the main Time are calculation, alarm, the dual time, and stop watch. The calculator can do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. It claims to do powers, but really you hit \"3\" \"X\" \"X\" \"=\" to do 3^2 and \"3\" \"X\" \"X\" \"=\" \"=\" for 3^3 and so on. The alarm is just like any other watch, and it only has one alarm. No dual alarms here. It is nice that the alarm on/off is an actual button rather than having to press and hold a button. The dual time just keeps a separate time in case you need to know the time in another time zone. Lastly, The stop watch works very basically with start/stop and lap/reset.The watch band feels great, the rubber quality appears much better and softer than the Timex watches, but then again Timex watches you can drop all you want and they keep going. Only time will tell if this watch has similar durability.Pro:-Fun nerdy watch-Functional basic calculator-Fits comfortably-High quality band for rubber-Dual time-Stop watchCons:-Buttons are small-No dual alarms-No real powers function-Thin band for questionable durabilityOverall 5 stars as this is a fun, functional watch at a great price.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16887595", "1": "0.12885436", "2": "0.23014322", "3": "0.13563731", "4": "0.12048556", "6": "0.21348168"}}
