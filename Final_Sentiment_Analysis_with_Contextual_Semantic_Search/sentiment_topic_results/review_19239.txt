{"text": "Have to say that I carry a large wallet now that holds everything I need.  It is starting to fall apart so I was hoping this wallet would satisfy my needs.  This particular wallet only has a zipper compartment in the side that zips while the wallet I have has side pockets inside the zipped area so I am not going to be able to use this new wallet as well as I used my previous wallet.  It's not a bad wallet just wish it had more options inside it.  For its size it doesn't utilize the space well.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.042629916", "1": "0.20249447", "2": "0.2813318", "3": "0.18940808", "4": "0.030717343", "5": "0.061887767", "6": "0.1915306"}}
