{"text": "I have bought 527 jeans exclusively for over 20 years, as I only wear cowboy boots and these jeans fit me so perfectly.But the fabric has gotten shabbier and thinner with each passing year.  Now they almost feel like pajamas when brand new, and they wear put at the crotch, out seams, and cuffs within months whereas they used to last me 2-3 years of constant use under often rugged conditions.  Boooooooo!  What has happened to Levi's quality?  Another great brand gone to cheap labor and cheap materials.  Now what jeans can I wear?  Gonna give Wranglers another shot on my next order.  Bad Levi's!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.062438782", "1": "0.2212804", "2": "0.08264273", "3": "0.15350392", "4": "0.19644403", "5": "0.14594023", "6": "0.13774985"}}
