{"text": "I would rather replace batteries than buy new watches. I had been using small screwdrivers to remove the backs of watches. Sometimes, I attempted to remove the backs with steak knives. I couldn't always get the backs off. When I recieved this kit, I removed the backs from three watches that I thought I would have to take to a jeweler. I think that the kit has paid for itself!The reason that I can't give this 5 stars is that there were no instructions.I had ordered a watch repair guide that explained how to get the backs off using this equipment and/or other tools that I could have ordered from Amazon.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.052035656", "1": "0.38996828", "2": "0.33016336", "3": "0.08115114", "4": "0.097678505", "6": "0.04653252"}}
