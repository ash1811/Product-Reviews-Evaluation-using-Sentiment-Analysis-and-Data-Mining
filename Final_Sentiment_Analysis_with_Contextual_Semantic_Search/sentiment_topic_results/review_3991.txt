{"text": "Cant really go wrong with K Swiss , have worn them before and love them.  Dont typically buy black shoes but had to have them for work.  Only thing I would suggest if you have not worn K Swiss before is to maybe try on at a store before ordering online.  They run small- you will probably need 1 to 1 1/2 size larger than you normally wear.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09610681", "1": "0.1769138", "2": "0.1473817", "3": "0.23619534", "5": "0.23450628", "6": "0.10512618"}}
