{"text": "I love these boots.  They are the best for warm weather boots; terrific to wear when running errands without looking like a slob.  They are soooo comfortable that I don't even have to wear socks.  If you are an 8.5M, buy the size 8.  They are generous and roomy on the inside.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.37909847", "2": "0.06429572", "3": "0.07346586", "4": "0.14514732", "5": "0.23503652", "6": "0.097650625"}}
