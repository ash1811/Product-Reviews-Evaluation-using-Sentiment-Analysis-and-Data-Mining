{"text": "I was pleasantly surprised when this costume arrived.  The materials look luxurious (velvet, tulle, satin).  The stitching is well done and there is a lot of detailing (puffy sleeves with embroidery, several layers on dress, detachable cape).I found it ran bigger than I'm used to with costumes. I usually have to order up one or two sizes for my kids (especially if I plan on having them wear long sleeved shirts underneath).  Costumes always seem to run very small.  This one ran a little big in my opinion.  I ordered the 4-6 for my daughter who normally wears a 4 and had to take in the sides and shorten it quite a bit.  The fabric is pretty stretchy and I'm sure I could have gotten away with the smaller size.The detachable cape sits on velcro patches on the back.  After a while it falls backwards. It's not the best design but it doesn't take away from the front of the dress which looks like one of the more expensive versions of this costume.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24144167", "1": "0.2957803", "2": "0.051606923", "3": "0.055449616", "4": "0.1302612", "5": "0.11301059", "6": "0.112449706"}}
