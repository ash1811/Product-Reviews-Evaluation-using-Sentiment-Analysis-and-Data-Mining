{"text": "For 20 years or more I've purchased these moccasins.  I've loved them and worn them for hiking in the desert sand, wading in the river, and knocking around.  The indians had the right idea, they're indestructible.  I've purchased most every color over the years.  Since I grew up in Minnesota I loved the fact that they were made locally and wore fantastically.  I currently have about 3 pair that I still wear.  However, recently I've noticed that both shoes seem to be made on the same last or sole frame, and it makes you feel like you've put them on the wrong feet.  they don't fit right through the arch at all.  Likely this is the result of poor quality control.  Like so many things the new &#34;makers&#34; don't take pride in their workmanship and the shoes no longer fit right.  I've gone on to fine a new shoe to take the place, but have yet to find anything as durable and flexible as these were.  Too bad.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.068678536", "1": "0.23202685", "2": "0.11474293", "3": "0.24771926", "4": "0.14539582", "5": "0.11009001", "6": "0.08134662"}}
