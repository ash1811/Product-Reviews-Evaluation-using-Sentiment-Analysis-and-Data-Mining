{"text": "I own three pairs of these magical pants, and it's definitely for a good reason.There must be some special cut in the seat of the pants or something, because it flatters just about every booty and perks it right up..!  (Trust me, you'll notice.. and so will other people!)I'm 5'6\" and wear size 2 or 4 pants and I find that a \"small\" fits awesomely..  It does, however, graze the floor when I wear my sneakers-  Very fixable though.The colors do fade with time, but I wear these babies to work out at the gym so I'm not too big of a stickler with that..!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11074964", "1": "0.3873535", "2": "0.08691308", "3": "0.15201117", "4": "0.18236016", "6": "0.07790619"}}
