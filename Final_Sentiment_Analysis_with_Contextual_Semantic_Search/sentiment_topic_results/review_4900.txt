{"text": "I'm a little disappointed in this watch, mainly quality issues.  First the Pros:- Nice big numbers to read when on a run- Band is unridged, so reasonably comfortable- Alarm and Interval Timer work nicelyCons- Flix technology broke, then...- Indiglo feature died- wrist band loop broke (annoying!)- the band is better than others I've worn, but still tends to 'imprint' itself on my wrist.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10588729", "1": "0.10056586", "2": "0.17765318", "3": "0.234804", "4": "0.11282546", "5": "0.17786427", "6": "0.090399966"}}
