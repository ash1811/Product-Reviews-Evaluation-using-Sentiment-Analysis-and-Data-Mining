{"text": "Happy with purchase but not a 5 star worthy. I usually wear medium jacket but sometimes need large because of my wide shoulders. I've read reviews on this jacket with mixed reviews on size. I got a medium and it's long sleeve and length. I guess carhartt just makes longer sleeves because I had other jackets from them and were long too or maybe I'm just not in portion. Lol. No regrets I would buy again or other jackets from carhartt", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.41062155", "2": "0.19009735", "3": "0.1879758", "4": "0.113391176", "6": "0.09125084"}}
