{"text": "I bought the watch from Amazon direct and paid extra for overnight shipping.  Although the watch did not arrive overnight, I am quite pleased with the price, and quality of the watch.  This is a must have timepiece for an Seiko or Dive watch collector, or someone who wants good quality heavyweight watch for less than $200.00.  I also bought the Black Monster at the same time, and that is equally as nice.  I have purchased from Amazon a few times and the experience has been good, I will continue to use Amazon unless something goes amiss.  My only issue is the amount of processing time until shipment happens.  And I don't mind paying for overnight if I want something the next day, but I want it to arrive the next day. That's it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.032308683", "1": "0.28040677", "2": "0.26740247", "3": "0.18539603", "4": "0.1487221", "5": "0.049081523", "6": "0.03668241"}}
