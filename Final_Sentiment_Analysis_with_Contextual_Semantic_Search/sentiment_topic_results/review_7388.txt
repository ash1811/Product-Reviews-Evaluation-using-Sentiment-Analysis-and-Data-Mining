{"text": "My fault for not researching what different jean cuts mean! Nothing wrong with the jeans. I am a slim very fit guy and these totally swim on me. Whoops! When we opened the package we nearly died laughing, They could have covered a dining table. But when I slipped them on, the waist actually fits. I'm keeping them as &#34;backyard only&#34; work pants as they are tough as. But my mistake on the style! I've ordered slim fit. My 18 yr old daughter could actually fit into just one leg of these jeans! It had us in fits of laughter. Dad did bad. Ordered wrong. I've re-ordered.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19214346", "1": "0.27306458", "2": "0.11069078", "3": "0.07728909", "4": "0.16431582", "5": "0.117806196", "6": "0.06469013"}}
