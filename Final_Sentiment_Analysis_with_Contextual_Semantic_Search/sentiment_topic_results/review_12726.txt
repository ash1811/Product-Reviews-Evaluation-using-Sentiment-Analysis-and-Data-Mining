{"text": "First let me say the shipping was incredibly fast(like 2 days from ordering to my house fast). I love, love these pants.  They are very comfy and the pink camo is an excellent color.  I have these in regular camo as well and those have lasted for years through hunting in the great Northern Woods of Maine to just bumming around on the weekends. As for sizing I hope this helps.  I'm 5' 6-1/2\" and weigh appr 150lbs.  My normal jean size ranges from between 7-10 depending on brand and cut.  I ordered these in a size small and they fit great.  They are baggy (which is how there suppose to fit) but not ridiculously. These pretty much sit at the hip and was slightly big in the waist (good in case I grow) however there are ties to sinch the waist as well. The length is great for me I like to wear heals but even with flats you can sinch the ankle opening to accomodate. Can't wait till summer, these will be perfect with sandals and tank .", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.060977586", "1": "0.22517033", "2": "0.15467505", "3": "0.2275777", "4": "0.119852915", "5": "0.11756829", "6": "0.09417813"}}
