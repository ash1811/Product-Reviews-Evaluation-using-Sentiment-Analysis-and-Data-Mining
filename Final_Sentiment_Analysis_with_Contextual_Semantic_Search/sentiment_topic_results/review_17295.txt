{"text": "I purchased these because Im starting a  EMT program and needed sturdy shoes. These are so so comfortable out of the box. They also are good looking as tactical boots can be! Light as stated, and I wear a size 8,but in boots I always order up 1/2 to 1 size also being ordered online who knows???? So a size 1/2 to 1 up is safe to fit me. I don't mind my boots a bit bigger I can wear thick socks.I wear these on my off/days too.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12351001", "1": "0.3509365", "2": "0.12356379", "3": "0.24432069", "4": "0.15168512"}}
