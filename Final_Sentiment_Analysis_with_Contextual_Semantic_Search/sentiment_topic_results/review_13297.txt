{"text": "These are very comfortable. Be advised, they have no heel part. The back is open so it tends to get your socks wet there if walking through puddles water or more than an inch of snow. Also, if you walk up a steep hill, your foot will inevitably come out of the shoe. I just don't wear them under those conditions.Still, for me they are so comfortable, like wearing slippers. I wear them with black socks everywhere (not so obvious that it doesn't have a heel) when I don't need to be dressed up. They have a nice grip on the bottom that provides traction even on wet leaves and some ice patches. They have a nice arch as well so you get a good feeling on your feet when walking.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.057468776", "1": "0.25040287", "2": "0.14037088", "3": "0.15994863", "4": "0.09121164", "5": "0.16970636", "6": "0.13089086"}}
