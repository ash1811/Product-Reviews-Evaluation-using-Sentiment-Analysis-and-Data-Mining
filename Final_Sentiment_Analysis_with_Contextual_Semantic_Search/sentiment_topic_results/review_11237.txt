{"text": "I've purchased the 3mm, 4mm, 5mm & 6mm sizes.  I was happy with all, but not with this 6mm size.  These are from a different manufacturer/supplier, Leach and Garner.  While they look good, the posts are too short and very slippery, also the backs don't stay on tight, slipping off very, very easily.  I have thin to average ear lobes, but found I couldn't wear these without them falling off (potentially, getting lost).  Otherwise, they would have been fine.  I returned them and would not buy this pair again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24090688", "1": "0.27247292", "2": "0.054777186", "3": "0.17210576", "4": "0.17648108", "6": "0.08020702"}}
