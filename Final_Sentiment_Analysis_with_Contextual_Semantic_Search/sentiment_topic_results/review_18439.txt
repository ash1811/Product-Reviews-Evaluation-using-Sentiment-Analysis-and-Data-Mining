{"text": "I really like this slip, it works well for my skirts with the slit up the back.  I did find the elastic around the waist a little tight even though the slip fit perfect otherwise.  However, I am short waisted and I think a medium will fit be better.  I will buy this product again and size up.  It also washes very well.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.18155916", "1": "0.40694734", "4": "0.10534306", "5": "0.09296092", "6": "0.20498271"}}
