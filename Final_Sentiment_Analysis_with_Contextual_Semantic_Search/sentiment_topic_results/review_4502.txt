{"text": "There are honestly very few places that I could find a decent pair of fit jeans in a half-size 31 Waist. Fortunately, Lee Jeans really knows how to make strong and comfortable jeans for the sake of a man and his need for comfort in his clothes. This pair of 31 X 32 jeans in a regular fit feels like a comfortable and relaxing glove that would wrap around your hands, but in this case you legs. I really enjoy the comfort of this pair of jeans. It aso doesn't drag down or feels like it is falling down compared to other brands in a half-size waist. So if you're looking for a great pair of jeans, Lee is definitely one brand well worth the effort.Price: BComfort: A-Overall: B+", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03152629", "1": "0.19830975", "2": "0.12680703", "3": "0.3363051", "5": "0.07464851", "6": "0.23016433"}}
