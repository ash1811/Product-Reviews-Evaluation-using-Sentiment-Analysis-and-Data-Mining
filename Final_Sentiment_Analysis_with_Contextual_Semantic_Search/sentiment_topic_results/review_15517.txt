{"text": "I love these. I've got big hips and thighs and these pants have a modern fit without being cut so close to the skin that I look like I'm about to hit the club (I have this problem with a lot of scrubs). At the same time, they aren't cut like the one-size-fits-all scrubs that you see so many of that assume that the wearer has a giant, square butt that comes up to their shoulder blades. Inexpensive, too. I wash these at least once a week and they've been going strong since I bought them 6 months ago, no fading or obvious wear.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.052939847", "1": "0.26185116", "2": "0.08669944", "3": "0.22360599", "4": "0.18632475", "5": "0.07657019", "6": "0.112008646"}}
