{"text": "This kind of hat is perfect for my husband.  The Dermatologist said he should keep his ears covered when playing golf, due to some bad looking moles on his ear.  (He normally wears baseball caps).  The hate works great to protect his forehead and ears.  It was a bit small (I ordered Sm./Med.).  But we kept it and hubby wore it until he found more hats like this.  I'll probably give this one to my grandson.  If you want protection from the sun, it's perfect.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11594833", "1": "0.14480177", "3": "0.24211411", "4": "0.16902848", "5": "0.19004966", "6": "0.13511556"}}
