{"text": "These Acorn slippers are fantastic. I work at a desk and therefore I sit for very long periods of time. I know, it's not good to sit for so long without standing/walking. Nevertheless, my feet tend to get a little chilly and uncomfortable so I wear these slippers at work. They are worth every penny.NOTE: they run quite a bit small so order one size bigger than your normal shoe size. I returned my first pair and ordered the next size up. = perfect.I would definitely recommend this product.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17106423", "1": "0.15664737", "2": "0.06998982", "3": "0.37909827", "4": "0.05806966", "5": "0.050726622", "6": "0.11440403"}}
