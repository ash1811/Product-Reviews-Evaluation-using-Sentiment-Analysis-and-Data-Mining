{"text": "I brought this watch because I want something that has alarm, timer, and I want something between analog and digital. I have a timer analog watch but it timing was not easy to read down to the second because of the analog hand. So I was looking for something with digital. First I though I was going to have to pay for more than $ 100 dollar for something like this. Then, I saw other 30 and 20 dollar Casio wrist watch with thermometer, I know I have to get one of those two watch. But when I look closely at those watch, I saw that their appearance tell their extract price. Then I saw this one for 50 Dollar and it does look like a hundred dollar watch.For me, everything work perfectly, that included thermometer, I just had to calibrate as it written in the manual. First, all the buttons and setup really confused me but after I read manual and followed the instruction. It worked fine, after I change my UTC time zone to correct one, it even show my home town ,which is half way around the world in one of the most remote place, time correctly in WTC time.I have a small hand so I had to take off 5 clips off the bracelet but it was easy and now it fit like it makes for my tiny wrist.Work great for me.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.24611393", "2": "0.34421748", "3": "0.08138179", "4": "0.14010414", "5": "0.07657828", "6": "0.109073184"}}
