{"text": "This watch is exactly what I was looking for as a regular rugged type watch that I wouldnt worry about losing or getting damaged. It's a simple, clean watch with rubberized straps that give the appearance of a lather band because the straps are so thin. My wrists are really small, so this works perfectly for me but may look lost on the wrist of a bigger person. Would purchase again.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13767648", "1": "0.32163778", "2": "0.23803201", "5": "0.10639852", "6": "0.18869908"}}
