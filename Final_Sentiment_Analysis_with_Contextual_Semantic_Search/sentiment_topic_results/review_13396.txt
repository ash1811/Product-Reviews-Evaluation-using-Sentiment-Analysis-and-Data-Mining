{"text": "I have a very old pair of Easy Spirit.  They were so comfortable, but finally showing some wear.  Needed additional colors and the prices on Amazon were the best I could find.  Shoes fit great and love the variety of colors.  They wear well and have a nice grip on the sole.  I purchased one pair in black and one in blue.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.079955876", "1": "0.43696988", "2": "0.14463055", "3": "0.08074115", "4": "0.24926536"}}
