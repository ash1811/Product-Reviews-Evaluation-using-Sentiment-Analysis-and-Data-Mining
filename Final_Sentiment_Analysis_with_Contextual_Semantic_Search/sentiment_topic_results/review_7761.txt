{"text": "This is my 3rd pair of Levi 527's I have purchased online and the quality has been great. I feared that sizing may have changed since my last order which was 2 years ago but thankfully this pair fits just like the others. What I like about ordering clothes online, compared to buying in retail stores, is knowing that they haven't been worn by how knows how many people! Plus I have seen the backrooms of some retailers and its pretty disgusting how dirty and mis-treated their clothes can get. I know first hand that Amazon's clothing is kept very neat and orderly as I have ran data cabling in several of their Warehouse/Distribution centers. Amazon shipped my package to me in a box rather than a bag which I liked. I am accustom to receiving clothing in bags or large envelopes when buying clothing at other online retailers and there have been numerous occasions where the bags have been ripped and torn during shipping. Amazon's box was a little beat up my the carrier but kept my pants in perfect shape. Oh, yes, and in the box, the pants were packaged in a bag to protect against moisture as well! Talk about 1st class packaging!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09332916", "1": "0.289597", "2": "0.0853977", "3": "0.04591611", "4": "0.15672079", "5": "0.051015705", "6": "0.27802357"}}
