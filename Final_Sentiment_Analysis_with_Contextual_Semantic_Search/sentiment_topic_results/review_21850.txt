{"text": "I've been wanting a pair of UGGs for a LONG time. I mean like years. Especially this super cute mini one. I FINALLY muster up the guts to spend the money on them as my Bearpaws are getting worn out, and I order these. As adorable as they are, they are made of .... fabric? The only part of the outside that seems to be actual leather is the heel. The rest is some spongey fabric that I would expect a cheap look-a-like to be made of.There's a good chance I send these back. I don't want to spend that kind of money on something that my feet will still get wet in. I live in Seattle for crying out loud, we only get three DRY months a year!
