{"text": "Have been a Keen fan for years but after reading the reviews on these, decided to try them. They are much lighter in weight than my similar pair of Keens. Love that.They gray color is good for an everyday shoe but I did not like it on me. Even with the box toe style, size runs about half size too small so I returned and reordered a 1/2 size larger and a different color. The replacement pair arrived quickly. Color was not exactly as it appeared on the monitor, but I really like it. Have not worn them for any length of time yet but out of the box they are very comfortable.UPDATE: Love these sandals. Very comfortable for long time wear and lots of walking.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16204967", "1": "0.36325106", "2": "0.10862602", "3": "0.17683315", "4": "0.054086834", "6": "0.13284142"}}
