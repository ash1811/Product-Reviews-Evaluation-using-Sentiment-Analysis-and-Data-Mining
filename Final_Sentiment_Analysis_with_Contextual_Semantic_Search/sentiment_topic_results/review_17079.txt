{"text": "My 2 year old daughter hates wearing shoes, so my pediatrician recommended trying these.  I got the hot pink ones (Fuchsia), and they are much cuter than I thought they would be.  They are super easy to get on my child's feet (which is a huge plus when you have to chase your toddler down and wrestle them on).  Judging by the fact that they remained on my kid's feet (without tears!), I'm going to say they are very comfortable.  I appreciate that after a day of playing in the dirt, I can just toss the shoes in the bathtub with my kid and rinse the dirt right off both of them.  I imagine these would make great water shoes too, for days at the beach or splash park.  I definitely recommend these shoes for active and/or picky footed toddlers.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.117552355", "1": "0.12274121", "2": "0.24908118", "3": "0.25198403", "4": "0.041993078", "5": "0.13769959", "6": "0.07894858"}}
