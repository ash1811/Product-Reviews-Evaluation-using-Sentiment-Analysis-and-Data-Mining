{"text": "But like most Birks, are pretty stiff when you first put them on.  It helps to bend and move them a little and it really helps to get them slightly wet and then wear them as they are drying.  They are very cute and the part between your toes isn't as uncomfortable as I was thinking it would be.  Your toes have to get sensitized if you haven't worn flip flops for awhile, I probably haven't consistently worn flip flops since my youth, quite awhile ago.  They are the normal good Birk quality and will last for many years.  I am pleased with these sandals and would recommend them to anyone.UPDATE:  These shoes are SUPER good quality and very comfy, just as I thought.  Two summers later and they still look pretty new and I wear them ALOT.  They stretched very little and the part between your toes is holding up so beautifully.  A lot of thongs rip that part if you go down a hill wrong or something, no way with these, never happen.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15890755", "1": "0.4430828", "2": "0.105548345", "3": "0.051970832", "5": "0.1220828", "6": "0.116010636"}}
