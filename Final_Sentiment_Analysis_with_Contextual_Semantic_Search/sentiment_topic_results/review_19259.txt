{"text": "This is my first ever large wallet. I am only giving it four stars because honestly, I have no idea what to do with half of it. It's well made, beautiful, holds everything that I need it to, and even comes with a little calculator (how cool is that?!). But I am a bit overwhelmed by all of the pockets and nooks and crannies, and even though I probably shouldn't need one, without an instruction booklet, I feel as though I am wasting usable space in this awesome wallet.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.25389567", "1": "0.082534045", "2": "0.17932841", "3": "0.19179988", "4": "0.15995821", "6": "0.1293674"}}
