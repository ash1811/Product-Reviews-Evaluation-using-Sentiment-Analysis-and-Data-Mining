{"text": "This box is VERY pretty!  It is much more prettier in person then the picture....a subtle, shiny pink.  The music sounds great and the ballerina was in good working condition.  My daughter (5 yrs old) absolutely LOVES the box and keeps opening and closing it.  Honestly, this was a GREAT deal....good quality box for the price you are paying.  It also brings back so many memories of my own musical jewellery box as a child...every little girl will love it!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.23655854", "1": "0.31450918", "2": "0.12424206", "3": "0.06456435", "4": "0.16106461", "6": "0.09607488"}}
