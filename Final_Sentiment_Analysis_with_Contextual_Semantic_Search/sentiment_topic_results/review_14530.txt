{"text": "I purchased Medium (listed as women's 6.5-7.5 medium) for my mom.  The slipper footbed must be about a size 8.  And the top was too short to velcro shut for my mom who wears size 6.5 wide, and barely shut for me who wears size 8 medium.  Really disappointed, since most of the reviews were so good.
