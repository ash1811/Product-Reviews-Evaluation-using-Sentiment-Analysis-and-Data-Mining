{"text": "I saw this bag at the Relax the Back Store and was pleased to find that Amazon had them at a much better price so I was able to get two (black, brown) for the price of \"one.\" Unfortunately, months later, I find that the material is very hard to clean. Something as simple as a sunblock smear doesn't rinse or wash out in the machine. My bags, even after washing, now carry every stain, smear and sweaty mark they've managed to acquire in the past few months. I find this kind of strange but then I've never had a microfiber bag before. I'll keep washing them and hoping they bounce back to their original clean form but I'm wondering if I should have saved up for the leather versions.Material: 2-3 starsBag: 5 starsThe bag itself is really terrific. I love the pockets. It is really comfortable on back surprisingly and I can switch from side to side if one side hurts. It's amazing how much I can stuff inside of it and the way it is organize inside means that I can FINALLY stay organized, too.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17849247", "1": "0.24690911", "2": "0.05555991", "3": "0.18943995", "4": "0.11043476", "5": "0.1877942", "6": "0.031369578"}}
