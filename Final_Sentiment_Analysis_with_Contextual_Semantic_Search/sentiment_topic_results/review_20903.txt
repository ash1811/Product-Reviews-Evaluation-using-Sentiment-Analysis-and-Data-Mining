{"text": "These are really cute and close to perfect. Levi's tend to be my standard brand because they are quite consistent in their fit. I weigh 135 lbs. at 5'6\" and order a size 7. They tend to have a little more room at the top of the hips, and since I do not have a belly, that is the only thing that kinda bugs me. But it's nothing a belt can't fix. Otherwise these are really cute jeans, and this color is really nice too.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10504454", "1": "0.29078296", "3": "0.28192", "4": "0.07051542", "6": "0.24491076"}}
