{"text": "I love my new hiking boots, they are so comfortable. Pay attention to the size, they run a half size small, so order up and you will be fine. I wear an 8 and ordered an 8.5, they fit perfectly. These boots have great support and are comfortable right out of the box, no need for breaking in.
