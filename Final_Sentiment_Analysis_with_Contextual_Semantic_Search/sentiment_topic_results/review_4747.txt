{"text": "I just received these socks yesterday. So I went for a long walk today. 5 miles out in the country. The socks felt great in my walking shoes. I had to kind of rush for the last 2 miles to get home for my son, so I put the speed on. The socks even felt good at a good clip. They are nice and soft and cushy, yet they do not feel bunchy in the shoes. Overall a great sock. I will try them with hiking boots as soon as I can.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17212074", "1": "0.216694", "2": "0.16552092", "4": "0.104347", "5": "0.26481065", "6": "0.07352085"}}
