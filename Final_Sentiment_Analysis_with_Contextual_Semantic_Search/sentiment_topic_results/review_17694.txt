{"text": "I got this watch almost exactly a year ago. The metal parts are sturdy and dependable, but the plastic joints were what let me down. After a while one of the hinges snapped off and rendered the watch useless as there are no replacement bands for that. Also, I am still unsure how to get the analog interface to line up with the actual digital time. I read the directions several times. Perhaps the error occurred when I set the watch to NYC time, however they still get no points for ease of use.As for the people complaining that the watch is too big, you're either going to have to get a remover tool or take it to a jeweler and pay the $10 or so for the service. I'd honestly recommend something with all metal parts. I work my tools pretty hard, but I almost never blow out a watch in a year. My Timex Iron Mans always lasted 2-3 years before their bands blew out.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09539059", "1": "0.14783962", "2": "0.31159884", "3": "0.07161362", "4": "0.15840895", "5": "0.06558592", "6": "0.14956246"}}
