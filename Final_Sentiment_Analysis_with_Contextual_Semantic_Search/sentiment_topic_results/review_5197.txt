{"text": "I was a little disappointed when I got these because the picture I ordered showed the bomber brown and I got the bomber gray.  I think I still would have preferred the brown, but these are cute too and I chose to keep them.  I like that the finish makes them look a little different from the basic coquette that everyone has.  They hold up incredibly well -- I got these to replace the chocolate brown coquettes I have which are a little beat up but still going strong after 7 years of wear.  Like most Uggs, they run really large.  I'm a 7/7.5 and got a 6 and it's still roomy enough for a heavy winter boot sock with nor problems.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.030745143", "1": "0.24991232", "3": "0.37304577", "4": "0.11251777", "5": "0.09518054", "6": "0.13631102"}}
