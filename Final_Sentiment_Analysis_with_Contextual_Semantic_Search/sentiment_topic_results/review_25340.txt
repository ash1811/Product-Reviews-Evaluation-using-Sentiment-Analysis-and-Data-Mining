{"text": "I love these Merrell Moab's, matter of fact this is my second pair, my first I wear for working in the yard still after 6 or 7 years and the new pair for everything else.  They have great support, they come in wide,  I only can buy Merrell or New Balance for the correct fit on my Wide Feet.  I looked around for a while, and Amazons sales price beat out all other stores sale price.  Awesome Product, Awesome deal!!!!!!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.057320684", "1": "0.3460633", "2": "0.07843086", "3": "0.26898268", "4": "0.2087049", "5": "0.037386924"}}
