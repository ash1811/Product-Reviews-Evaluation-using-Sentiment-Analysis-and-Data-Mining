{"text": "These are the best.  When you get them out of the bag, you might think you ordered panties that were 2 or 3 sizes too small, but that's just the way they look until you try them on.  They fit great.  They hold in your stomach quite a bit and the leg opening doesn't ride up in the back.  Stays put.  These also come in a lace waist band that rests lower (on your hip).  I have that style too and it is  nice but I like these better.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1399701", "1": "0.34071565", "2": "0.0632943", "3": "0.35296467", "4": "0.09622568"}}
