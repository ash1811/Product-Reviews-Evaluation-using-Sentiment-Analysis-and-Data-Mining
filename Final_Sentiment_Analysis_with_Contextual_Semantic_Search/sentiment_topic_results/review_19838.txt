{"text": "I bought this watch primarily for running/working out so that I could use the stopwatch feature.  The watch arrived quickly and is exactly what I have been looking for.  The watchband is very comfortable on my wrist, even while sweating during a workout.  The face of the watch is not too big to where it looks huge on my wrist, but still large enough to easily read the display.  I like how it has a seconds counter showing when you have it set to just show the time.  Allows for easy minute interval training or checking heart rate without having to use the actual stopwatch.  Even that is easy with just a touch of the button.  I find myself wearing the watch all the time now!  Have taken it swimming in the pool, ocean, shower etc with no problems.  Very satisfied with this purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.103148915", "1": "0.21957833", "2": "0.13776031", "3": "0.15326115", "4": "0.14925128", "5": "0.06711884", "6": "0.16988115"}}
