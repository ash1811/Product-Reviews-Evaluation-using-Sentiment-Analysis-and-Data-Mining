{"text": "It's always cold where I live, but not with these slippers!  I got the ocelot color, and they are cute, comfy and very warm!  The padding is awesome, like walking on a pillow.  I never take them off except to sleep/leave the house.  I usually wear a size 8 and the small size fits snugly but not too tight.  Pricey at $32, but the quality is worth it--these are the best slippers I ever owned.
