{"text": "That was a very long ship time.  I ordered a medium (because that's what I wear in another Shadowline gown), however, this is huge.  The lace on the shoulders is very stiff and looks like a Klingon officer's uniform. No, it's not 'soft' lace as advertised. The neckline isn't as low as pictured, either.  I may keep it because it's comfortable but flattering?  Hardly.  Sexy?  Never.  I wear nothing to bed, so for me, gowns are something to be worn earlier in the evening or during breakfast time, so they should be really nice, sexy and good looking.I'd hoped it would be more shear, to add a bit of 'oomph' to it, but alas, it looks like something my grandma would've liked if she were still alive.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16918574", "1": "0.3084513", "2": "0.06215251", "3": "0.117575", "4": "0.12082534", "5": "0.09185636", "6": "0.12995373"}}
