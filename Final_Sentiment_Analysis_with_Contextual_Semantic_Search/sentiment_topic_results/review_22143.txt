{"text": "If you are like me and looking for the perfect glove for cold hands, you will not find it with these liners. Your best bet is to get something windproof (leather works best) and use these as a second line of defense in the winter. Also, invest in a $20 hand warmer if you are outdoors or just have cold hands during the cold season. Good luck on finding \"your\" glove.
