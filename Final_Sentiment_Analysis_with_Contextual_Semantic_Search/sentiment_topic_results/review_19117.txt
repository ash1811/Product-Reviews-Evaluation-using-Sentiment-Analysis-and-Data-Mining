{"text": "Purchased one pair of these at a local New Balance store; came home and checked on Amazon; over 20 bucks cheaper; ordered these.  New Balance is one of the only brands that offer wider widths in most sizes and styles.  I need a 2E width for my aging feet and they have what I need.  I advise going to the store for proper fit then shop on Amazon for price.  That said, Amazon did not have all the newest styles/models but more than adequate selection for me.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04229669", "1": "0.20311067", "2": "0.15919338", "3": "0.22092526", "4": "0.1985934", "5": "0.047922533", "6": "0.12795806"}}
