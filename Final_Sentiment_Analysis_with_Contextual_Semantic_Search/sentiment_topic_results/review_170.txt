{"text": "Bali Skimp Scamp Briefs are THE MOST COMFORTABLE UNDERWEAR I have ever worn in my 64 YRS. of life!! They are very Soft and Silky with a back seam instead of side seams. These briefs NEVER, EVER Ride up or get stuck (you know where), they ALWAYS Stay in Place, my clothes glide over them very easily and there's No visible Panty line either!! I would rather go without than wear any other under garment!! Try 'em, You'll LOVE 'em too!! You'll Never be Sorry with this purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08665821", "1": "0.32676584", "3": "0.20813209", "4": "0.29573837", "6": "0.07729361"}}
