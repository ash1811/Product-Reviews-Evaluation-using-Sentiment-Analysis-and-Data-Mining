{"text": "The Gerber training pants I bought were too small and fell apart after only a couple of washes.  These training pants are made of thicker, better quality cotton and have held up well through many, many washes (I have 3 preschoolers and I've had these for over a year).  They feel like thicker underwear, not diapers, and the fit is comfortably roomy.  Now, they aren't waterproof and they're not a diaper, so don't expect them to be something they're not, but they are absorbent enough that I only have to deal with wet pants and not a puddle on the floor when there's an accident, which is just what I expect out of training pants.  This lets them experience the natural consequences of not making it to the potty, without as big a mess for me to deal with.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.46589944", "3": "0.23670979", "4": "0.09408397", "5": "0.17123681", "6": "0.027027026"}}
