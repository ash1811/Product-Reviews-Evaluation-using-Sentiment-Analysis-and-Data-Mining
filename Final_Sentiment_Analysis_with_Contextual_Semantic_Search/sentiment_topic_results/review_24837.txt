{"text": "Bought these for my husband who is anywhere between an 8 and a 9 in shoes. He could get them on, but barely! They were so small he wants to try a 10.  Luckily, Amazon makes these super-easy to return. Other than that, he really liked them; casual, breathable canvas and a comfy footbed. He is not a filp-flop wearer so these will be great for the beach once we get the right size.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.1605946", "2": "0.0934911", "3": "0.25548938", "4": "0.19903883", "5": "0.1476542", "6": "0.1397259"}}
