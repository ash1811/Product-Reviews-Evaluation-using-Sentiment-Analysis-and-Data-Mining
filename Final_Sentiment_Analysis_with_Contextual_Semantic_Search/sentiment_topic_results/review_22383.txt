{"text": "These socks feel amazing!  The sizing is spot on and the material is light enough so that you feel closer to the ground and shoe.  No more toes banging into each other when running either.  These socks also help keep your digital alignment which is a huge plus.I would recommend these socks to everyone.  They look cool and feel great.  They are good for running and working out.  I am not sure how durable they are but they have held up so far (if you get white then they will get dirty and never be white again).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03978747", "1": "0.20069043", "2": "0.13267365", "3": "0.03882889", "4": "0.11352508", "5": "0.3032162", "6": "0.17127825"}}
