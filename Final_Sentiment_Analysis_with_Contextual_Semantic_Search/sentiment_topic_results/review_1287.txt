{"text": "At first these suckers felt weird on my feet with the rubber bumps and I was a little bummed. Now after some miles they have broken in a bit.I have had more comfortable slides in the past, so 3 stars for comfort and the extra star because they look good and that is more important than comfort:) I do wear them every day and walk about five miles with them. This is not really a good idea and I don't believe the are designed for the abuse I put on them and my feet.  I rated them fairly high due to the fact that used as slides were intended they are good.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3992852", "2": "0.12326612", "3": "0.11415855", "4": "0.066403605", "5": "0.122085355", "6": "0.17187838"}}
