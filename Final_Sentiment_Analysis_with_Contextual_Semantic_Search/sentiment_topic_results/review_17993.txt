{"text": "Bought this watch for my husband, one year and two weeks ago. The 10 year battery died 10 days ago. No special use. No underwater use, just normal wear and tear. I bought this watch thinking it would not need a battery change as often..and replaced his old watch that got about 2 years per battery..and this one got one year and four days. Wouldn't recommend it because that is a very misleading statement about this watch!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.091500156", "1": "0.06934259", "2": "0.27294713", "3": "0.12442636", "4": "0.09618652", "5": "0.19413047", "6": "0.15146679"}}
