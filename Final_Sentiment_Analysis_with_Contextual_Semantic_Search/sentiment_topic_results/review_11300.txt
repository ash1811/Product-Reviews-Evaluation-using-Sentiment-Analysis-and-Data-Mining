{"text": "I love these boots for what I purchased them for... Being out in the snow and cold.  They are definitely not fashion boots.  They are big, heavy and clunky.  That being said, I didn't buy them for fashion.  I bought them to keep my feet warm and dry in the cold and snow, and they do both very well.  They fit nicely at my normal size as long as I wear wool socks with them.  If you like to wear your boots without socks or thin socks you may want to get a smaller size than you normally wear.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03489329", "1": "0.29166424", "3": "0.30578566", "4": "0.117869385", "5": "0.18468238", "6": "0.062061567"}}
