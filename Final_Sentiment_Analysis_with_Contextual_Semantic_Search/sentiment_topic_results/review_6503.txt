{"text": "Hands down, Thorlos are the only sock I have ever purchased that will hold up.  I have the first pair of Thorlos I ever purchased and that was over 20 years ago.  This is a thick sock and you might find it can be a bit much for a sneaker, but they will protect your feet and keep them dry.  I wear them around the house as slippers sometimes and my feet never hurt.  These socks are much higher in price, but it's a matter of getting what you pay for.  I highly recommend these socks.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14055705", "1": "0.14902377", "2": "0.053681653", "3": "0.146957", "4": "0.17925563", "5": "0.21180472", "6": "0.11872016"}}
