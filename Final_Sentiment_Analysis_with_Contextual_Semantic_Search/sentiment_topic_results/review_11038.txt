{"text": "I love the style and fit of Acorn slippers. I purchased these slippers, as a gift, for my 86 year old mom. She owns two pairs already, so she was happy to have another pair in a different color. She wears a 9.5 shoe and the size XL (which is 9.5 to 10.5) fits perfect. I also have two pairs of these comfy slippers. I wear a size 9 shoe so the size L ( which is size 8 to 9) fits me perfectly. I definitely recommend these hard soled, extremely comfy slipper to anyone looking for a stylish slipper that comes in several colors and patterns.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1186785", "1": "0.35403672", "2": "0.057314176", "3": "0.19202451", "4": "0.034897275", "6": "0.24076715"}}
