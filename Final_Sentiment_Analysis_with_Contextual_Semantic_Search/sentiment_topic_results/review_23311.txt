{"text": "I am a runner, and have been experimenting with different shoes.  So far, I love my Brooks Adrenaline GTS.  These are supposed to be comparable, but they feel completely different to me.  They are much narrower through the toe box - I would recommend going a half-size up if you are trying these for the first time.  The sole is a little weird to me.  Under the arch, the sole comes all the way to the  inside so that it is flush with the rest of the sole, whereas all other running shoes I have worn look as though they follow the natural curve of the arch.  I can feel the shoe pressing up on my arches, although I don't know whether the weird sole is the reason or not.  The fabric of the shoe feels very flimsy to me, though I have had no issues with anything falling apart.  One great thing about this shoe is that it fits well - almost snug - without being tight.  I use this mainly for short runs and treadmill workouts.  I will not wear Saucony shoes after this.  It just feels like too much sole and not enough top.  However, you have to find the right shoe for you.  This is not the right shoe for me, unfortunately.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.21239312", "1": "0.06128653", "2": "0.10307662", "3": "0.34296998", "4": "0.11427852", "5": "0.06648013", "6": "0.099515066"}}
