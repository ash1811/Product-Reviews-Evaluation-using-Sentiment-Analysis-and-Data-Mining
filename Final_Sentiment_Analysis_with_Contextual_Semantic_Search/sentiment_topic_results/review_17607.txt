{"text": "I've been through a few Casio watches over the last 25 years.  I've bought this model a couple of times and it's the watch I currently wear.  While I could easily afford a fancier timepiece, I really just want to know what time it is.  This watch does the job.  It will go for months without needing a correction.  I doubt that any watch keeps noticeably better time than this.  The stopwatch feature is also occasionally useful. Fine watch if you don't need to show off.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.17199051", "2": "0.32093817", "3": "0.104774244", "4": "0.17853677", "5": "0.07386608", "6": "0.14696784"}}
