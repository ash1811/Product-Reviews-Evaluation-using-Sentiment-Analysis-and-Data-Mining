{"text": "I love that this bag is so flat.  It's much more space efficient than my previous bag, and can hold all the toiletries I need for at least a week.  I keep my kit packed so its always ready for the next trip, and my things fit nicely.  I don't travel with large amounts of makeup, so mine fits in this bag too.  You'd probably need an additional bag for makeup if you take alot on trips.I would have liked the center compartment to be a little larger & the side compartments smaller, but it will still work for me.  The hook opening (for hanging) was too small to fit a towel rack or doorknob.  I couldn't bend it more open, so I switched hooks w/ the bag I already had & that was easily done, though a little annoying to have to change it.  Also, my bag didn't come with any bottles, although the tags attached say it's a kit WITH bottles.  That made me feel like I paid for a bag with bottles, while perhaps the bottles were sold to someone else separately to increase their profits.  Not so cool, but I do like this bag alot &  I love the eggplant color, too!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.050520293", "1": "0.3484629", "2": "0.19462967", "3": "0.17616287", "4": "0.06324806", "5": "0.026487336", "6": "0.14048888"}}
