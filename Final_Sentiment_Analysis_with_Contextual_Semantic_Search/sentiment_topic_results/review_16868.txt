{"text": "I received these half-socks a few days ago. I haven't had the chance to wear/ use them yet. I'll update my review later, but I can say, they are nice quality socks, and they seem to be well-made. I wear a &#34;true&#34; women's size 10 medium shoe and they fit me just fine. The sock isn't too short or too long (they won't show, when you are wearing a mule type shoe), my only reservation, they do not have any type of skid resistance bottom.So, will they slip and slide around during the course of a day? I'm not sure yet. If they do, I'll post an update soon.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16655783", "1": "0.1268156", "2": "0.12092776", "3": "0.17598893", "4": "0.024789894", "5": "0.2968799", "6": "0.088040136"}}
