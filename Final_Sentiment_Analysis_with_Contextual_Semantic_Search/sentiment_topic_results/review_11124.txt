{"text": "After wanting these boots for the last 3 years, I finally got them. They are pricey, that's for certain. So if you can find them somewhere on sale, grab them while you can! I ordered these in the Stout (brown suede) color in size 8. I typically wear size 7.5 shoes, however in Uggs I find I need to get 8's. At first the boots feel snug, but after a few days of wearing them, the fur flattens down just a bit and molds to the shape of your foot.They are even better looking in person than online. The peach colored shearling is actually more of a rosey peach than an orange peach. The brown is a soft subtle brown color which I adore. The laces are big and thick, designed to hold up to years of pulling on them tight. The Vibram sole keeps the boots dry in snow and slush, which I need living in northern Minnesota! The tread on the bottom of these provides much better traction than one gets with the traditional UGG Australia Women's Classic Tall Boots. I slip all over the place in the winter with my classic Uggs. I've been out walking through the snow and ice with these recently and don't slip or slide nearly as much.You don't have to baby these boots nearly as much as you do with the classic Uggs. I wear these to the store, to work, out shoveling snow off the porch, etc. I don't have to worry about them getting wet, which is a nice change from my other pairs of Uggs. They have the same wonderful shearling as classic Uggs do, from the tip of the toes all the way up to the top of the boots. With the only difference being the outside of the boot, which is better designed for standing up to winter weather than the classic styles.I adore these and would buy another pair in a heartbeat if mine wore out. If they ever go on clearance because of being discontinued, I buying as many as I can!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1332296", "1": "0.2657731", "2": "0.112414375", "3": "0.13459177", "4": "0.13661963", "5": "0.09259355", "6": "0.12477797"}}
