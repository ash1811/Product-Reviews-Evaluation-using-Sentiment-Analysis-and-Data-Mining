{"text": "I've had mine for several months now and I love it.  Don't be fooled by the low price.  It's just the perfect balance of soft leather and protection from drops and scratches.  It looks very good, too.  My only problem is I lost it somewhere while I was shopping. - it must have come out of my jacket pocket and I didn't notice it until I got out to the parking lot.  Fortunately my glasses were on my face at the time.  I just now ordered another and can't wait until it arrives.Update:  I have downgraded my rating for the product and the manufacturer of it.  I received the second one and I liked it, too.  Then I recently ordered a third for my sunglasses.  It came with a broken hinge which holds the metal spring closure together on the edges.  It was totally separated and makes the case unusable.  I immediately initiated a return request through Amazon and I got a reply from Amazon that the seller had closed the request.  I wondered if that meant they had approved it or not, but I guess the answer was \"not\".  I have received no other communication.  Well, it's just ten bucks down the tube but that's shoddy quality and a lousy customer service attitude on the part of the seller.  I had been happy to buy from a USA manufacturer but I guess that doesn't necessarily mean \"high quality\" anymore.  Just be aware there's a chance you'll get a piece of junk and if you do then you're likely stuck with it.  My other two cases are still okay, but they turned a loyal and referring customer against them on this one.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09810053", "1": "0.23100817", "2": "0.21659288", "3": "0.31641757", "5": "0.08158378", "6": "0.05364162"}}
