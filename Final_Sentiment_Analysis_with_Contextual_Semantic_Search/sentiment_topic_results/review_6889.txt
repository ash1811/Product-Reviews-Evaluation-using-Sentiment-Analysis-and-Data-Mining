{"text": "If you are searching for a heavy weight pullover hooded sweatshirt with a high cotton content that looks fabulous, SEARCH NO MORE!  This Carhartt Heavy Weight 90/10 Cotton Hooded Sweatshirt looks and feels great and doesn't have the company name plastered on the front, back or anywhere, it's just a small 1 cubic inch square on the upper left hand portion of the front pocket!  (I despise becoming a billboard).  I wanted something thick, comfortable, warm and not trashy looking.  I searched many, many, many stores and the extremely few heavy weight hooded pullovers I found either looked trashy, were too huge or had a large company name across the chest or back.  I purchased this hooded pullover in black and although I would normally order a small men's, another reviewer said they run small and a medium was perfect.  The black hooded pullover was a nice deep dark black.  It really is my new favorite for cool nights watching games or camping.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06973841", "1": "0.36337665", "2": "0.19368967", "3": "0.12790057", "4": "0.11682032", "5": "0.039794005", "6": "0.08868041"}}
