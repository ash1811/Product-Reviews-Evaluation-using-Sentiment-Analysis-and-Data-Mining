{"text": "We needed a simple, long-sleeved onesie to go under our 6-month-old's sleep sack, and this 3-pack was a great choice.  The fabric is soft, and the onesie is well-made.  The fit is perfect for our 6-month-old, but she is on the small side for her age, so this onesie could run a bit small for other 6-month-olds.  The lap shoulder design makes this easy to pull over baby's head.  All in all, this is a good choice.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0838942", "1": "0.663071", "2": "0.040754233", "4": "0.06498379", "6": "0.1399194"}}
