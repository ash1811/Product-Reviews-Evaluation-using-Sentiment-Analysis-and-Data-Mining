{"text": "i gave this a 4 because i havent got to use it yet since it is a christmas gift and under the tree. But i looked at it before it was wrapped and it has a ton of storage space and I really think I am going to like this wallet when I get to use it.

Still in perfect condition! and I've really grown to appreciate all the space it has and the different spaces to organize my stuff.

Great buy!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17913872", "1": "0.15452456", "2": "0.120375626", "3": "0.21347573", "4": "0.038114395", "5": "0.15107536", "6": "0.14329557"}}
