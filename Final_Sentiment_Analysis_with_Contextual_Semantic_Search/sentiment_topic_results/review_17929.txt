{"text": "I just need a cheap watch for work.  My last one of 10+ years finally had the strap break.  When this one arrived and I tried it on I was surprised to find out how small-ish it was.  It was about 3/4 the size of a regular watch, and the band barely fit around my wrist.  I put it right back in the box, sent in a return request and mailed it back same day.  Getting a refund and will try again.  Thanks Amazon.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13810658", "1": "0.19758148", "2": "0.16761506", "3": "0.11531725", "4": "0.21432684", "6": "0.16378416"}}
