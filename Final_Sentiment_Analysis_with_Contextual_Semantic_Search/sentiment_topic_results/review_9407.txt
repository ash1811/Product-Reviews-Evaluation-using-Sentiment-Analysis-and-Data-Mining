{"text": "This is a nice gym bag, with one caveat.  It has a fairly rigid bottom so if you planned on doing a little scrunching to get it into a locker (and at 25 inches long you might well need to), you will have to stand it a bit on end to do it.  Other than that, the construction, including the zippers, is solid.  The breathable end pockets and the shoe pouch are functional and handy.  The one pocket hanging on the inside is also a breathable mesh and of adequate size for a tooth brush, deodorant and a few other smaller miscellaneous items.  The shoulder strap is comfortable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.061002888", "1": "0.14159194", "2": "0.1783701", "3": "0.066449486", "4": "0.17380767", "5": "0.11395227", "6": "0.26482564"}}
