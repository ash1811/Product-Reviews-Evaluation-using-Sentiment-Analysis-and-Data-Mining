{"text": "Having different-sized feet is one of the more annoying things I have been forced to contend with in my life. It would be one thing if the difference was slight, but my right foot is a good inch smaller than my left.  This has made shoe shopping a complete nightmare.  Since I cannot afford to buy two pairs of shoes so that each foot has a shoe that actually fits, I have been forced to improvise. Through the years I have tried cotton balls, toilet paper, all sorts of shoe inserts...you name it. But nothing ever worked very well, and the shoes would always slip off my right heel. I cannot tell you how happy I was to discover Heavenly Heelz. I like that this product comes in three different colors to better match the interior of the shoe.  I made sure to place the heel cushion pretty high on the back of the shoe, and it worked great.  I would caution folks to start with just the heel cushion and see if that works for you before inserting the second cushion on the top of the shoe. Due to the large size difference of my feet and poor fit of the shoe, I needed both cushions, but I found that the cushion on the top of the shoe made things a little too snug. Regardless, these have worked out great!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08663197", "1": "0.18129368", "2": "0.26762354", "3": "0.16841176", "4": "0.08266625", "5": "0.12430464", "6": "0.08906817"}}
