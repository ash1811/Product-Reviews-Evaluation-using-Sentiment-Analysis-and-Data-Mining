{"text": "I got these for Christmas and it couldn't have come a day too soon. I live in New England, don't own a car (i.e. I have to walk to get anywhere), and it is COLD right now. Regarding sizing: I'm a 5'6'' woman with thin hands so I thought a men's small might be big enough for a liner glove underneath but wrong. In fact the small is quite snug for me. If I'd known the sizing was small I might have gone for a medium to accommodate a liner glove but since I haven't needed a liner it all worked out. Good, heavy, warm mitten for the brutal cold.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.050678764", "1": "0.35999873", "2": "0.16339284", "3": "0.23538779", "5": "0.10037828", "6": "0.087777436"}}
