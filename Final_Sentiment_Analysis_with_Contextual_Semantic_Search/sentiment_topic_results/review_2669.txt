{"text": "This jet pack is easy to inflate, and my son can put it on himself. I like that it's inflatable, so my son can wear it as long as he wants, and then when it's time to take off, I can just deflate it, fold it up, and put it in my purse. The only problem we've encountered is that it rides up pretty high on my son's back, above his shoulders, so he keeps pulling it down lower, but it won't stay. It's pretty durable for an inflatable. My son crashes into things, the dog has stepped on it, but it still works.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.3807255", "2": "0.091574945", "5": "0.2687812", "6": "0.24976102"}}
