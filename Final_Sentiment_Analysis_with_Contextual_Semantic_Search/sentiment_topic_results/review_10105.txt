{"text": "I bought one of these (in black) and a pair of white Hanes, to see if there was difference in quality between the brands, rather than stock up on a bunch of colors in one brand.  I'm very glad I did this, because the Hanes were complete garbage (and that's where they ended up the first night I wore them!) and these were what I was looking for.The black ones are nice and thick, so they don't look sheer and they actually cover the legs and any blemishes and hair.  They also feel very soft and sleek.The fit was a big plus, too.  The Hanes tights I bought were ridiculously tight around the thighs- these Danskin tights actually compensate for normal women and the fact most women's thighs are bigger than their calves.  Additionally, the band on the top is flexible and sewn in the seam well, so it doesn't cut into the skin around the stomach or leave a huge, red line like some tights do.Some tights, the top band tends to roll down or needs to constantly be pulled up.  I didn't encounter that with these.  There is a small amount of fussing around the ankles and calves, because I am short and have short legs, and these are too long (this is where I docked), so they will bunch up down there a bit.  However, at least with the black ones, it's not noticeable since they stretch so well all over that the color doesn't thin out very much when it stretches.These seem fairly durable, overall.  No runs yet after more than 10 wears, and no worries about tossing them in the washing machine.I only wish they had colors or varieties of gray.I recall getting these very promptly, as well.  I will definitely be getting different shades!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.067524", "1": "0.25030762", "2": "0.09003739", "3": "0.16482686", "4": "0.18453155", "5": "0.21837687", "6": "0.024395706"}}
