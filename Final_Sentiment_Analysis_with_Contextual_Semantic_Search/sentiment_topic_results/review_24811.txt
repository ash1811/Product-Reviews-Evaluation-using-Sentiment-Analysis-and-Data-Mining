{"text": "I ordered 2 pairs of these (2 different sizes). The larger of the 2 had a sole that was enormous, but the fabric was incredibly tight on my foot. The smaller one seemed to have the correct size sole, but again, the fabric was too tight. Due to numerous reviews saying that the fabric stretches, I kept the smaller pair. I didn't really wear them for 2 weeks because I thought they'd cause ingrown toenails due to the pressure on my big toes. I kept stuffing them with larger objects in hopes of stretching them enough. Finally they feel pretty good. However, I purchased another pair of Sanuk Sidewalk Surfers (maroon Donnie's which were on sale for $20) in the same size and they fit perfectly from the start....and the sole is about 1/4 inch longer than these. I just think this batch was possibly seconds...not enough fabric so it has to be worked on before it fits.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10063543", "1": "0.18018422", "2": "0.17602932", "3": "0.17639342", "4": "0.15905756", "5": "0.17505643", "6": "0.032643583"}}
