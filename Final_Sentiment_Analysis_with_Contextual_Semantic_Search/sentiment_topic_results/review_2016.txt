{"text": "Okay, I admit I hemmed and hawed all winter about getting new slippers.  The old sheepskin pair I had was really getting stinky and the seams were wearing out.  They looked like they belonged on a homeless guy. I actually purchased and returned three different pairs of slippers from different retailers over the course of the last few months.  None of them my met definition of \"slipper nirvana\" :) I finally ordered these and just received them.The only thing I was not happy about (before I actually received these) was that they had a rubber sole instead of a sheepskin bottom.  I really wanted a pair with a sheepskin bottom.  However, now that they are on my feet I have reconsidered that position.  I have dogs that drag in snow and rain and dribble water out of their dog bowl.  My old slippers would get wet on the bottom. These new ones will keep my feet dry no matter how damp my kitchen floor gets.These are thick, well made, and I believe they will hold up for many winters.  I am way too picky about slippers but these Minnetonkas have won me over.  Other sheepskin slippers that I have looked at were cheap looking and poorly made. I wish I would have purchased these in September instead of February.  I could have had dry, cozy feet all winter!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14488183", "1": "0.21648045", "2": "0.19781244", "3": "0.14537701", "4": "0.07944137", "5": "0.104731604", "6": "0.11127531"}}
