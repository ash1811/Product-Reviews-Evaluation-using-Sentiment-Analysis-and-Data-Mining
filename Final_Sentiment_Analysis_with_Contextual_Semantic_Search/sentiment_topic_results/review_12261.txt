{"text": "All hard plastic. It did have a slight mold line as remarked in one of the 1 level ratings, so I just took my jack knife and smoothly carve it down flush to the rest, (there wasn't much of a mold line to start with hardly noticeable), now it is soft and non abrasive.  Works GREAT, use it daily...I'm buying another one.  The leather lined ones of today are CHEAP, they use protruding staples, talk about ruining your boots... this does the job it was made for very well, I highly recommend.  Worth the money.  Sturdy, well made and so easy.  Oh plus at night I turn it around and put the back part by my door, the carpet sits low enough that this would be an excellent door jam if any one tries to enter.  To cool!  Just what every cowgirl needs.
