{"text": "I have been wearing Savane slacks for years, but have had a harder and harder time finding them locally.  I decided to give these a try and have already ordered and received the same slacks in black.  They are maybe medium weight, very smooth and clean cut, nice cut & taper to the ankle, and hold up to machine washing.  Three minutes with an iron returns them to like-new condition. (I'm sorry, nothing is \"no iron\"...)  The fit is true to size, but the length seems longer than other slacks with the same measurement.  I'm blaming the other slacks for being wrong, as nothing else is wrong with this product, and this is not even a problem.Great product that I will repurchase.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08061306", "1": "0.2292934", "2": "0.073584594", "3": "0.20943029", "4": "0.064803414", "5": "0.10609217", "6": "0.23618309"}}
