{"text": "I have never experienced such comfort in a pair of socks! Not realizing that these socks were actually meant for tennis playing, I ordered them to wear with my hiking boots here in Aghanistan where I am deployed. I needed some cushioning, high quality, odor absorbent socks, and these definitely fit all the criteria! These are so amazingly comfortable, I even wear them as slippers.  I wear my boots at a minimum, 14 hours a day and these socks hold up and continue to support my feet very well the entire time.Thorlo socks are by far the most comfortable, high quality socks I have ever owned and best of all, they don't devastate my wallet.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.043193087", "1": "0.2375469", "2": "0.096938185", "3": "0.18986519", "4": "0.042551335", "5": "0.24003209", "6": "0.14987318"}}
