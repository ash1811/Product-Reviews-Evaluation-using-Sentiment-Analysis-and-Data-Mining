{"text": "I purchased to of these for work in two different colors in a size large. They both fit as they should, true to size.I'm stocky and usually have a hard time buying sweaters because if I get a large it fits great and then I wash it and then I look like a sausage... Or I buy an extra large and then I wash it and length wise it's too big. With these sweater I've washed them several times and they shrank a little as expected but still fit great.The only complaint I have is that they are pretty thin, they are not heavy so great for summer mornings but in winter (California winter) I will need to purchase a heavier sweater or put a jacket over it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.032467343", "1": "0.56318825", "3": "0.04489847", "4": "0.055406164", "5": "0.14064406", "6": "0.16084139"}}
