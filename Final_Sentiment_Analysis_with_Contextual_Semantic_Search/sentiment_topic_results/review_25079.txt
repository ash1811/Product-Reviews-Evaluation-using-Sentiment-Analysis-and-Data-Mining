{"text": "I bought this ring to replace a similar one I lost recently. I'm happy with it, but I think it could be a bit more durable. After just a few days of wear, there are noticeable scratches on the band. Mind you, these scratches are just from doing general daily stuff, not anything rough. I don't mind so much, because the scratches only seem to be a problem on the bottom side of the band where no one sees it.The stone is very pretty. Perfectly sized for my small hands, and not overly shiny like some CZ stones are. I haven't had any trouble snagging anything with it. It seemed to be sized correctly.For the price, I feel like it's just right. This ring is worth exactly what it costs, no more. If you're expecting something worth more, you'll have to pay more.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2765793", "1": "0.17552662", "2": "0.19438429", "3": "0.15584219", "5": "0.12251762", "6": "0.07279241"}}
