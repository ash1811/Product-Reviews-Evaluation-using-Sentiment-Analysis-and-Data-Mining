{"text": "I have been buying this model for more than a decade because of its durability and comfort as a semi-dress, non-formal work shoe.  I currently have two pairs that I was seeking to replace because of heel wear.The new shoes were not at all like my previous pairs.  The lasts are too stiff, and the soles are made of cheap plastic rather than very durable rubber (I think my first pairs of these had vibram soles).I decided to send them back.  Amazon declined to pay shipping because I said it was an \"unexpected style\" issue.  I would like to dispute this, but I don't know where to do that.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05764153", "1": "0.22129555", "2": "0.17360775", "3": "0.10795823", "4": "0.21045753", "5": "0.16885935", "6": "0.060180042"}}
