{"text": "I love this style of bra and currently own several of them in various sizes (weight fluctuations).  Anyway, it is always strong and supportive.  I have a narrow frame and full bust (32GG at the moment), and this bra is perfect for me for several reasons.I love the look this gives under shirts: smooth, rounded, with a little hint of cleavage.  This is a balcony, not a demi so the cleavage is subtle but nice.  This bra is molded and to me, that is one of the best aspects of this bra: it's like your breasts are air cushioned throughout the day and I find it helps them feel less heavy to me as I am carrying them.  Think about it like shocks on a car.  I notice in unlined bras, I don't get that air cushioned feeling that I get from this bra.I never have issues with ridges in my shoulders as the band is very supportive.  Additionally. the straps are leotard in the back so they give a good lift and do not slip off or cause chaffing in the underarm area.  I typically will have two in black and two in nude and they last a really long time if you rotate your bras and wash them with lingerie wash.Though they are pricey, these are on the cheaper end of high quality bras and they last and no what they are supposed to.  Highly recommend though be sure that you get the proper size, that will help with them lasting longer and giving the right support--I went to the local Nordstrom's and got fitted, then I buy them there or on Amazon as needed.
