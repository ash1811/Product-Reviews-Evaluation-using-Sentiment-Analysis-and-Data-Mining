{"text": "Every Autumn,in the South,I stock up on these socks to wear during the Winter months.They are very good socks,wash well.Over the years they still hold up. I find these at Walmart. They fit my 12 size foot nicely and since I have very hairy legs they do not rub the hair. A simple buy that will last over the months and years.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19525273", "1": "0.27722552", "3": "0.2229977", "5": "0.2206123", "6": "0.075229265"}}
