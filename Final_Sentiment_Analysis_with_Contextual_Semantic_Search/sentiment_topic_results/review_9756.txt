{"text": "i will leave the original 5 star review below but changed it above to a 1 star because not only did the shoe come with some slight peeling of the top layer of leather, which i originally overlooked, but after 3 wears the pull strap in the back tore off on the right shoe as if it were cardboard...despite all the raves below, that kind of bad quality nixes getting this shoe...i will now use the shoe collar to pull them on and walk around with the strap in the back attached on only one side, and hanging down, looking stupid. real question for skechers overseas made quality.love these. tried them on at a local store and fell in love with the look worn with straight jeans. i'll admit that if you are going to do a lot of urban hiking or trail hiking, these are NOT hiking boots (and don't pretend to be) so i got a pair of timberlands for my 4 hour city treks shooting photos. but these look better than the timberlands (which is saying a lot as the timbers don't look so bad) and are generally a nice comfortable shoe. Light enough too as they have no steel toe, but still offer great protection. they have a nice shape, not HUGE and OVERSIZED like some boots, so they really have a good look with jeans that are straight (meaning not bell or bootcut, tho they'd look good with those too).one of them did have a manufacturing light surface scuff, but realistically they will have a good 'worn' look soon enough so no need to send them back. other than that light scuff, very surface, the shoe quality looks and feels great and i just love these. until getting these my main shoe was dingo 12\" high cowboy boots with bootcut jeans, great but hard to do much walking in, so these are perfect. if you want a rugged jean style boot that you can actually walk a bit in, at a good price, i'd get these. i'm very happy.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.085600205", "1": "0.24586889", "2": "0.322534", "3": "0.119157", "4": "0.046705525", "5": "0.09034807", "6": "0.089786306"}}
