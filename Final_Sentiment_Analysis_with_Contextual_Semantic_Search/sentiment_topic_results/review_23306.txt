{"text": "I have bad feet.  Horrible feet.  I usually need to try shoes on, but I took a chance here, because of the free return policy.  These fit exactly like i needed them to.  10.5 is a tough size to find also.  The brand is great.  The shoes look great.  The fit is great.  And the warehouse deal is GREAT!!!  These shoes were new.  They had only been tried on by someone and then returned.  They were NOT 'worn&#34; by someone.  I've tried on shoes from Amazon myself, and had to return them without wearing them.. so you can get a great deal on NEW shoes.  :-)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08717845", "1": "0.28385383", "2": "0.1373329", "3": "0.24815202", "4": "0.09977282", "5": "0.05119231", "6": "0.09251767"}}
