{"text": "I travel a lot!  Over time, my wallet was crammed with more crap than I knew what to do with.  Even if I sat down to discard some of the most unnecessary crap, I found that I was never able to get rid of anything.  So, if you can't beat 'em; join 'em.  Which is what I did.  This wallet is amazing!  It holds all my crap with room to spare.  There are several zipper compartments and the slits for the credit cards, driver's license, etc. were the perfect size allowing me to easily slip my cards in and out without resistance...something that is usually a problem for most wallets.  This is the first wallet that I can actually carry my checks in without straining the snaps...of which, there are two that will allow me to add more crap.I have nothing negative to say about this item.  It was a perfect purchase for me!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11684487", "1": "0.21115944", "2": "0.2224816", "3": "0.05626174", "4": "0.19274999", "5": "0.0787724", "6": "0.121729925"}}
