{"text": "I LOVE THESE BOOTS !!!  I bought them to complete a Native American outfit for a special event.  But now I wear them with everything - long and short skirts, and jeans.  They are soft and comfortable.  They are sized correctly...I wear a 7, and bought the 7.  They are fine with thin trouser socks, but if you are going to wear them during colder months, I would suggest buying a 1/2 size larger to allow room for heavier socks.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18813841", "1": "0.073585264", "2": "0.14462827", "3": "0.117854446", "4": "0.032631904", "5": "0.40817532", "6": "0.03498642"}}
