{"text": "I purchased these in yellow gold a few weeks ago and could not be more pleased. They seem to be made quite well and have a nice luster to them. I had no trouble inserting them and little difficulty putting the back on. Even my big man's fingers were able to put the back on the post. Maybe it was beginner's luck because I have struggled with other stud earrings with equally small backs.I like the 5mm size. It seems to be just the right size for a man. Attractive without being ostentatious. I only have one earlobe pierced so buying earrings in pairs means I always have a spare. Right now I expect to get many years of pleasure from these earrings. If my opinion should change I will try to remember to update this review.ETA: I almost forgot to tell you. These earrings actually come with a \"Made in America\" tag. That made me very happy I ordered them.UPDATE after 2 months: Well, they were nice while they lasted. It's a good thing I have that spare earring. I've had to change this review from 5 stars to 3 stars. The ear nuts that came with them are apparently a little loose. I lost one earring after wearing it for about a week so I've purchased replacement ear nuts. Hopefully they will work better than the originals.To be honest, I wear an earring 24/7 including when sleeping or showering.  I've been doing that for several years and this is the first time I've completely lost an earring. I've had some come loose but they loosened gradually enough that I always felt it before the ear nut came off completely. The reviewed earring must have come loose and fallen out quickly enough that I didn't feel anything.FURTHER UPDATE: I found the earring that had fallen out and tried a spare ear nut on it. I had purchased several different sizes here on Amazon and found an ear nut that fit snugly enough I don't think I have to worry about it coming off. This earring is now back on the ones-I-like-to-wear list. I intend to go through all of my stud earrings and replace any ear nuts I suspect will not hold well.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12427612", "1": "0.22443941", "2": "0.05881411", "3": "0.17949189", "4": "0.09079035", "5": "0.19325458", "6": "0.12893349"}}
