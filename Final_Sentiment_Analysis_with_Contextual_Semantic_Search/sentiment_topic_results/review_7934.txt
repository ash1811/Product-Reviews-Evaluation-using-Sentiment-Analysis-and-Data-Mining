{"text": "Having had bought Pleaser shoes many times before I am well equipped in knowing that the shoes run small so order a half-size or whole size up. Sadly, even in sizing up, they were super small and really tight but for what I needed them for I didn't have time to get new ones so I kept them. The shoes are tight fitting around the leg which is nice because I hate when boots like this are bulky. I had to go to the store to buy 2 sets of padding for the insoles (2 for each foot) because they are REALLY uncomfortable to walk in and stand in after about 20-30 min, there is NO support inside. The are so tight around the toes that if you DO wear them for more than 2 hours and you are on your feet the whole time you will suffer nerve damage like I did. I wore these in October and it is now January and I still have the nerve damage on the outer part of my feet to where I can't feel my last 2 toes or the outside of my foot anymore which sucks. Think when your foot is asleep and you can't feel it and it's numb to the touch, that's what I have going on almost 4 months now. These shoes are the worst.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13406701", "1": "0.3459096", "2": "0.20376758", "3": "0.15428226", "4": "0.06816588", "5": "0.058059867", "6": "0.03574785"}}
