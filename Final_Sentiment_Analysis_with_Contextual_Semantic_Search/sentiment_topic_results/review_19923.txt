{"text": "Sizing was confusing online and shoes were way too big- I should have tried on the shoes in a retail store first to check size. Returns were easy though the clerk was going to charge me for return.  I had to remind her that Amazon guaranteed &#34;free &#34; returns so she gave me a free return. No problem there, sent me a mailing label for UPS and I sent it back. Was credited to my account today, with no problem.The customer service is very important to me as much as a good quality product.  The shoes were very well made  and I was impressed with the quality.  However,  they did not seem to have as much arch support as I would have preferred. Could not have really evaluated fit and comfort since they were so big.  I would have liked to have had a chance to try them, but could not reorder since I had no idea about size.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.24987447", "2": "0.13700455", "3": "0.12610684", "4": "0.16657665", "5": "0.09456608", "6": "0.22344565"}}
