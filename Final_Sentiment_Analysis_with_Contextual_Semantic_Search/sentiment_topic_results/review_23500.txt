{"text": "Let me start by saying that I have only had this watch for about a week at this point so this may not be the most reliable review but I'll say what I can.  First of all, the watch looks fantastic! The pictures don't even begin to give this thing justice, it looks great.  The dial is a deeper blue and the band is a much nicer gold color.  It does look a lot like the Rolex that I saw on my coaches wrist last week but let's be serious here, this is not a $10k watch.  The band and clasp both feel a little cheap and I imagine the gold plating will eventually come off.  BUT for 75 or 85 or however much you pay for this watch, it's worth it.  I've worn it almost every day since it came in the mail and it very well may be my new favorite.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13643256", "1": "0.118370965", "2": "0.16876407", "3": "0.21102005", "4": "0.117164105", "5": "0.14182878", "6": "0.106419496"}}
