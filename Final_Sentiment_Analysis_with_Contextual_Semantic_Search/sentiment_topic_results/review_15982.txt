{"text": "So comfortable!!! Perfect combination of support and comfort.  Just what I was looking for in flip flops.  I'm very particular and it's just about all I wear from the first 60+ degree day till it gets below 60 again.  Fabric strap is very comfy don't even know you have anything between your toes.  I do think they run small.  I wear an 8.5 and usually order 9 because I don't like my heel to hang off, not sure if it's the placement of the thong portion, but there is way more in front of my toes than behind my heel.  So be careful if you are a true 9, it may be too short.  Just my observation.  I want more pairs in more colors!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0793477", "1": "0.18111941", "2": "0.19150458", "3": "0.19985725", "4": "0.08528174", "5": "0.098758206", "6": "0.16413113"}}
