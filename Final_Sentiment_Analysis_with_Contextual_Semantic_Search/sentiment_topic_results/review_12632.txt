{"text": "Started wearing the Traveltime shoes about 5 years ago and love them.  I have also given them as gifts to 5 different relatives who also now love them!  I have bought 5 pairs of the \"Natural\" and one pair of the \"Black with patent trim\" and two pairs of the white ones!  I will say,  however......the two pairs I bought this year do not seem to have the same quality of padding and mesh as in years past.  No matter,  I still love them and plan on buying a pair of 'Navy\" tomorrow on sale plus I have a coupon for additional savings!)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.078598246", "1": "0.051560663", "2": "0.09881826", "3": "0.2506674", "4": "0.26621613", "5": "0.12221806", "6": "0.13192126"}}
