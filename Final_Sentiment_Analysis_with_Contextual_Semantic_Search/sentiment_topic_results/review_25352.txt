{"text": "With this inexpensive grade of diamonds, visible flaws can be very likely, as can off-colors. Combine that with cloudiness rather than the clearly refracting internal facets of a good diamond, and the stones are dull and lifeless.Unfortunately, the slightly larger size of 1/2cttw makes these flaws more apparent.  The result is hit-or-miss depending on your particular stones.  Mine was more miss than hit, so I returned them rather than giving the flawed earrings to my wife.  I also got a pair of the 1/3 cttw diamonds (very similar and cheaper):14k White Gold, Round, Diamond Stud Earrings (1/3 cttw, K-L Color, I3 Clarity).  That pair worked very well and was bright and clear, as shown by shining a flashlight into the stones.Amazon's lenient return policy applies equally to jewelry, of course.For me at least, these 1/2 cttw earrings didn't work.  Not recommended.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18264027", "1": "0.18117274", "2": "0.107287236", "3": "0.15214375", "4": "0.12155631", "5": "0.1464276", "6": "0.10877211"}}
