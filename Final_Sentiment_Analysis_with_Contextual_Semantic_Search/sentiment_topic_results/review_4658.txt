{"text": "I gave this to my fiance as a birthday present, i love Cahartt and i have other products from them. We live in Boston, so the jacket is very warm and fits its purpose, the only problem is that is very, very big, i think i got him the medium one and it fits like a large one, it's very bulky too, but as i said, if you are looking for something warm, go for this one but maybe a size less.Nice color and it's cool that it has inside pockets, at least that's what my fiance says :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2550109", "2": "0.2710035", "3": "0.16693683", "4": "0.12558255", "5": "0.13151579", "6": "0.04677015"}}
