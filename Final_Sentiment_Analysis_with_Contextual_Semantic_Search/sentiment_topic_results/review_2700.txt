{"text": "This watch is perfect as a casual dress watch.  I like the slim profile, and the blue dial really seems to attract your eye.  I get random compliments on it all the time.  The clasp is a little suspect, and the only negative about the watch.  Its easy to not hook it up properly, and it could fall off if your not carefull.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06535482", "1": "0.29759866", "2": "0.15769647", "4": "0.3013201", "5": "0.0976698", "6": "0.07558078"}}
