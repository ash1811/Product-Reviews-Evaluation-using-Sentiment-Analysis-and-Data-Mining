{"text": "I've been wearing this classic watch daily for about 1/2 year & it keeps very accurate time, the eco-drive technology works well without any problems so far, I just place it on my dresser table face up when I'm home to recharge it with whatever light it gets (artificial light or indirect natural light). but about once a month, I will super charge it by placing it on a windowsill to get some direct sunlight for an hour or few.  But I will have to agree with some reviewers who mentioned that the watch crystal & band scratches quite easily, so far there's several small scratches on my watch's crystal & many scratches on the band but the watch still looks good.  I love that I don't have to change batteries especially since my previous watches always lose its water resistance after the battery is changed once or twice.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.19909573", "1": "0.13069105", "2": "0.18053116", "3": "0.15482013", "4": "0.13062778", "5": "0.07946664", "6": "0.124767564"}}
