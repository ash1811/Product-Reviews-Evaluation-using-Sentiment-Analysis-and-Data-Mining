{"text": "I ordered these jeans when my husband's previous ones began to get frayed at the hem.  Levis never disappoints! They are a quality brand. My spouse says that the pants fit well, are comfortable and I think they look great on him.  I've laundered them several times and the color hasn't faded.  In the past, the washing directions stated, &#34; wash in hot water, &#34; but now it suggests cold.  I think this is a good change, because clothes laundered in cold water seem to last longer.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.030736579", "1": "0.33634105", "2": "0.15408216", "3": "0.14120041", "4": "0.040465996", "5": "0.16062587", "6": "0.1365479"}}
