{"text": "I had read great reviews on this bra from women who need bras that provide more lift and support, so I decided to give it a try. The bra does supply a bit more lift than many others, but there is nothing particularly exceptional about it. The cups are soft and will pucker slightly. They don't provide much modesty protection either. A thicker lining, such as a stretch foam or doubleknit cotton would help.The band is somewhat scratchy which, while it becomes less noticeable after several washings, does make the bra less comfortable when wearing for a long period of time. Finally, I don't know why they call it a sports bra as it provides no more control of movement than any regular support bra. It looks more like a regular bra too.Bottom line: it's okay as a support bra, nothing special, and not worth paying extra as a sports bra. There are better choices out there.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08576428", "1": "0.27742502", "2": "0.04912526", "3": "0.33837605", "4": "0.04846963", "5": "0.061402313", "6": "0.13943745"}}
