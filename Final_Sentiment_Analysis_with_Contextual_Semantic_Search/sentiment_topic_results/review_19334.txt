{"text": "A nice looking watch except for the fact that the writing at the bottom of the face is crooked, which spoils the appearance and it's hard to set because there's not enough friction in the stem. The slightest movement while holding the watch with the stem pulled out causes the minute hand to move making it hard to get it aligned with the minute marker.
