{"text": "I got a pair of these handed down in the 6-12 months size and they are amazing.  They are warm and lined with faux fur so you don't have to bother with socks.  They are also good for lots of different weather outside from fall to spring.  They are also really cute - EVERYONE compliments us when my little girl is wearing them.  They are the only shoes she wears.  I think once she starts walking, she'll need something with a little more structure on the bottom but I think I'll get her another pair of these in 12-18 anyways.  Great shoes!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2635268", "2": "0.09543227", "3": "0.10149831", "4": "0.14009933", "5": "0.24677859", "6": "0.14991227"}}
