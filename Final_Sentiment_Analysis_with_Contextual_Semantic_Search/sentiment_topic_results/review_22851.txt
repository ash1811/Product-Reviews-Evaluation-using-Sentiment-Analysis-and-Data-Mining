{"text": "I love these boots and I'm not sure why I waited so long to buy a pair.  I have several different styles of Ariat shoes but I know they run big so I took a chance with the boots.  I wear a size 10 in most shoes but my first pair of Ariat clogs purchased at Amazon size 10 were pretty big so the next pair I ordered 9.5 and they fit perfect at did the Fatbabys in a 9.5.  When I purchase shoes I always try to find the person who tells how they fit and feel before I order.  I am looking to order another pair pretty soon. ts 3/19/2013", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.088697985", "1": "0.35280365", "2": "0.1761787", "3": "0.12427748", "4": "0.25326362"}}
