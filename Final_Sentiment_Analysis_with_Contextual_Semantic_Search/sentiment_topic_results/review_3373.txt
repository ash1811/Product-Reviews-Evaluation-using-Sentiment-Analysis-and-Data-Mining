{"text": "I bought this bra primarily because of its beauty, but I was very impressed with its comfort and fit.  Since it doesn't have a satiny/slippery outer shell, it may bind the front of a tee top, under a silky or woven cotton top, that shouldn't be an issue.  This is the perfect undergarment for a bride, or to feel like a bride again!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10321607", "1": "0.16232552", "3": "0.26170474", "4": "0.17945518", "5": "0.14492203", "6": "0.14344068"}}
