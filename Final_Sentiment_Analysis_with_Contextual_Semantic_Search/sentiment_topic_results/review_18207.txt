{"text": "This is a very cool watch and I am so glad it is still out there.  The watch has the buttons right on the face to start calculating which is perfect for any fellow that loves to do math and likes &#34;gadgets.&#34;  I can't tell you what else it can do because my son, now age 26, is the one that owned several over about a ten-year span and he set the time on the one I recently bought as a gift for my grandson, now age 12.I know the Casio Databank Calculator/Watches he owned each lasted for years of daily use by a very active young man.  I believe having that calculator on his arm further stimulated his love for math as he found many reasons to use it.  I'm almost positive this watch holds other information and that you can store phone numbers in it which can be real reassuring and practical for a youngster, to know they have information at their finger tips.Let's see, what else can I tell you?  The band is pretty adjustable, soft, no rough edges to catch on hair or other things, it's quite comfortable to wear.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12029855", "1": "0.1712252", "2": "0.1289179", "3": "0.13777775", "4": "0.27687576", "6": "0.16228461"}}
