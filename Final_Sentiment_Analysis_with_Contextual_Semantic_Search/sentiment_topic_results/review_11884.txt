{"text": "I bought these shoes based on glowing reviews but was disappointed when I received them. Overall, the look is a bit \"librarian\" and ho-hum. The picture for some reason looks much better than the reality.The delicate leather is indeed extremely soft but darker than the picture (the mocha y more like a dark coffee brown). The padded synthetic lining and pleather insole really cheapen what could have been a good shoe. The leather-lined heel is delicate and will no doubt show wear much sooner than other shoes, especially if you use them for driving.On the practical side, the sole is non-slip and flexible, if on the thin side. The thickly padded insole compensates and has some arch support. The elastic slit on top serves no purpose really, it barely expands, maybe 1/8\" or so. Fit-wise, the heel runs very wide and even though my feet are a medium width, and the length is Ok, they don't stay on. They wouldn't work for me even without all the other issues. I returned them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1058927", "1": "0.16810007", "2": "0.19279647", "3": "0.17001082", "4": "0.14795975", "5": "0.15659407", "6": "0.058646176"}}
