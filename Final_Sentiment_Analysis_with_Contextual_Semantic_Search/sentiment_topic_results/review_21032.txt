{"text": "I've been wearing these leggings for years.  I usually get them at the department stores, and even when they're on sale it's never this good a price.  I stocked up and got 7 pairs in large.  I machine wash and dry them, and they hold up surprisingly well.  Also, I like that the black color doesn't fade easily, and the leggings are very opaque so I don't have to worry about see-through.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07350488", "1": "0.30876634", "2": "0.07016051", "3": "0.16085522", "4": "0.21260367", "6": "0.17023349"}}
