{"text": "This is his 3rd pair of the \"Seawalker\" shoes.  He has not previously had this color, which is a deep chocolate brown with sueded finish, unlike the smooth finish on his other pair(s).  Like other reviewers, the stitching is coming undone on the old pair, which he has had for several years.  I don't know whether that is simply from normal wear and tear; he certainly has worn them a LOT.He is pleased with this new pair.  They are comfortable and look good, in fact I like these brown shoes much better than the old ones.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1274665", "1": "0.44851306", "2": "0.18161857", "3": "0.10373037", "4": "0.04085052", "6": "0.0948261"}}
