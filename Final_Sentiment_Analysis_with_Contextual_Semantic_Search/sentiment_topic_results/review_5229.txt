{"text": "These slippers are comfortable and fit well.  I wear either an 8 1/2 wide or a 9 medium.  When you first put them on for the first time they may feel slightly tight.  That's okay because they are made out of stretchy material and begin to form to your feet and stretch out in all the right places to fit perfectly. At first I thought maybe I had ordered a size too small, but after wearing them one or two times, the fit is absolutely perfect.Much more comfortable than wearing socks and they don't flip around like a lot of slippers.  They are also great for putting in your purse to take to with you when visiting family and friends.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.4934548", "2": "0.059667867", "4": "0.07204368", "5": "0.20802957", "6": "0.16217996"}}
