{"text": "This bra is comfortable and beautiful and fits well and is the best bra I've ever had. I ordered a couple more in other colors but for some reason the red seems the most comfortable. Only negatives: The picture looks like a dark pink but it's actually a definite red color. Not that it's bad at all, I was just expecting pinkish. Also, when I adjust the straps to be shorter, they readjust themselves back to be longer again after a couple of days. And there is slight pilling in a couple of spots after wearing sweaters. But still these are A+ amazing bras! And the padding is just enough where they're not so \"nipply\" at the office.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10257788", "1": "0.32050884", "2": "0.09064344", "3": "0.17315894", "4": "0.14099815", "5": "0.11729064", "6": "0.0548221"}}
