{"text": "I lost my wedding ring and have not been able to locate it in the last month or so. Now that I have been without it every time I look at my hand I realize something is missing. After 26 years of that finger being occupied It seems strange not to have a ring on it, so I had to find a replacement until I can afford to get another one. I choose this one and receive it today and it looks even better in person than it did pictured. Size, quality and appearance are just as described. This was a good purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13159625", "1": "0.2789516", "2": "0.15927543", "3": "0.058993403", "4": "0.07633505", "5": "0.2251441", "6": "0.069704235"}}
