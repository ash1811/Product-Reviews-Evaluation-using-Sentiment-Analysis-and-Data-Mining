{"text": "I wasn't sure about the fit, given the issues in others' reviews.  I am about 8 1/2 men's shoe size and these (9.5-11 US mens) fit perfectly over my casual shoes and hiking boots.  I use these instead of buying snow boots that I would wear about 5 times a year.  Instead, slip these bad boys over your shoes and they are perfect for snow, mud, etc. They seem tough, they travel well and roll up easily.  The buckle button at the top is confusing (do I punch out the material in the middle or not?  I split the difference and seems to work either way). And, my feet often slide out of my shoes when trying to take these off--no biggie.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10648623", "1": "0.31438008", "2": "0.19799195", "3": "0.15909772", "4": "0.119069494", "5": "0.07752736", "6": "0.025447126"}}
