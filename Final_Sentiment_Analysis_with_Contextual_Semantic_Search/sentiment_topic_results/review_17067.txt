{"text": "I just double checked the style number now to make sure I had the right bra because I can't believe all of the positive reviews. I am a 34DDD in nearly every size but apparently I am not in this one. I had muffin tops where my boobs were overflowing the cups and the straps were thin and very elasticy. I can't imagine feeling support even if I bought a cup size up. If felt like most Victoria Secret bra's for me where I have to re-adjust the straps three times a day because the metal thing keeps sliding down. I am glad it is doing it's job for so many other women out there but sadly it did not work for me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08975331", "1": "0.1825855", "2": "0.24171723", "3": "0.29198012", "5": "0.16081046", "6": "0.030580295"}}
