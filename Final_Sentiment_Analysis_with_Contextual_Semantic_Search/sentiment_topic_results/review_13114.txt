{"text": "I purchased, what was labeled exactly the same, pair of jeans from another store. Found them $20 less here on Amazon so returned to the store and ordered these. My husband said these fit how 501s should fit, the first pair were too wide in the legs.  I'm happy with the lower price, he's happy with a perfect fit.  I will be purchasing one or two more pair in other washes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.5199498", "2": "0.1022841", "4": "0.261034", "6": "0.105667576"}}
