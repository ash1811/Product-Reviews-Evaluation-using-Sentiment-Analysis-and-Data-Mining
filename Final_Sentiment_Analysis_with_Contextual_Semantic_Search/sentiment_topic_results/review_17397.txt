{"text": "I work in event management and sometimes have to spend long hours on my feet in uncomfortable shoes.  That's where these come in!  I learned a long time ago that the comfort of your socks are as important as your shoes when you're on your feet a lot.  These midweight socks are extremely padded/thick and save you from blisters, rubbing and sore soles.  Make sure your shoes have room for a thick sock before ordering or else buy the lightweight version.
