{"text": "yes, people will still buy these for the DM mystique; yes, they still look cool; yes, the leather can still be worn battered and bruised, a la skins or goths, or polished to a brilliant shine.BUT -They are not in the same league, as when they were made in England. The cushion is gone, the interior of the leather is rough and stiff, as though the leather was never treated. Construction is solid and 'industrial' and I really LOVED my old pairs, which I wore for an average of 6 to 8 years. But these, for the price, will look good on you, and that's all. I gave mine away after trying to break them in for over 6 months and treating the leather with every kind of dressing I could. My old, old combat boots were easier to break in, many years ago.My recommendation - if you like the goth / skins look, spend a few more bucks and get a seriously good boot that you can wear clubbing, biking or just hanging and chilling, and that will alsotreat your feet and legs with respect. If you want boots for work, for military, LEO or paintball, go with Original SWAT or Altama.  If you just HAVE to have Doc Martens, then go ahead, but know in advance that you're gonna be hurting.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07982187", "1": "0.2812955", "2": "0.19983098", "3": "0.19369148", "5": "0.17834134", "6": "0.06473263"}}
