{"text": "As per others reviews and my experience with other dance sneakers I sized up 1 1/2 sizes. I may have been able to use an 11 but I wanted to put a different insole in the shoe and it was a little thick. So, when I say 'fit as expected' I mean that I expected them to run small and sized up.The reason I do not give these 5 stars is because I feel there should be another hole on top like sneakers have, so that it grabs the top of your foot better. These are a little too loose.Otherwise, I highly recommend the shoe for jazz and zumba.  I find that the dance sneakers are better than sneakers for doing zumba. I have tried many of the 'cuter' more colorful ones, and they made my feet tired.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.20934795", "1": "0.12588565", "2": "0.16208489", "3": "0.25523898", "4": "0.070466086", "6": "0.17454226"}}
