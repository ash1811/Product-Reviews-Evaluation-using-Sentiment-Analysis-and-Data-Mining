{"text": "I got this watch off an online website for only twenty seven dollars with shipping included.  No box or instructions though.This is a nice watch, but nowhere near as nice as my Tag or Rolex.Two things that could make this watch better are the following:1. Screw down dial.2. Rotating bezel with better tolerances.  The bezel has a bit of slop and can only be rotated smoothly using two fingers.  My two fingers still slip though, because the grip is not good.It's nice to have a digital watch now with alarm and hourly chime.  I also like the large glow hands and the dual clock feature with military time.  I especially enjoy having a watch with a rubber band that I can just slip on and not worry about damaging.  Although large, it doesn't seem bulky or heavy.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.085856594", "1": "0.14974931", "2": "0.17502698", "3": "0.23086318", "4": "0.27907753", "6": "0.07732258"}}
