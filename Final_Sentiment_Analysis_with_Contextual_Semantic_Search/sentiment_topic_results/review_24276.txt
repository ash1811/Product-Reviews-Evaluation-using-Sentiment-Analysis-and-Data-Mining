{"text": "I wore this jacket for 10 years until it was so worn down it wouldn't even stop a gentle cold breeze.  So I went shopping for a new cold weather jacket.  After seeing 4 or 5 different models, I went back to this one.  it is generously sized so you can wear layers underneath, warm and stops the wind fairly well.  My only complaint is that there should be a storm flap over the zipper as this is where the wind can get in.  A few things you need to know before you purchase this.  First, when you first put it on, it is VERY stiff.  You will not like it.  Just keep wearing it and it will break in.  When it does, you will like it alot more.  Second, the hood is large.  And stiff. it can and will get in the way.  I roll mine up inside out.  it gets it out of the way and makes for a nice warm neck roll.  I'll wear this one for ten years and will probably get my third one.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12090715", "1": "0.22697942", "2": "0.10858567", "3": "0.19449605", "4": "0.03539609", "5": "0.17006125", "6": "0.14357434"}}
