{"text": "I am no stranger to shoe trees, I have been using them for a long time.  In fact, until recently, I had two pair of leather shoes that I bought new 15 years old and aside from their style, they looked perhaps eight months old.  I cleaned and polished those shoes after every second wearing, had the soles and heels replaced when they became worn, and of course, used shoe trees.  When I recently bought some nice new shoes, I thought that I should update my tried and trusty, but tired shoe trees.  After much Googling, I decided upon the Allen Edmonds combination cedar shoe tree.  For the un-informed (which previously included me), the combination cedar shoe tree is for non-Allen Edmonds shoes.  If you are fortunate to have Allen Edmonds shoes, then you want their full toe shoe tree.Like I wrote earlier, I am familiar with shoe trees, but the Allen Edmonds are in a class of their own.  They are hand sanded and you can feel the wood's smoothness.  You can see that the wood is solid wood and not a veneer.  The trees are actually curved for your left and right shoes ... that attention to detail surprised me.  As another reviewer mentioned, the finger grip on the tree heel is very effective in removing the tree.  It may be intuitive to some, but I'll add that when you insert the tree, you are supposed to ensure that the tree heel is firmly situated and then you reach into the tree with your fingers and push the split toe as far forward as it will go.  It does not take a lot of pushing/pressure, but this push will properly seat the split toe and help prevent wrinkles/creases in the shoe.My conclusions:PROS:  classy appearance, nice fit inside shoe to minimize wrinkles, reportedly absorbs moisture, easy to insert and remove, nice smell.CONS:  I have not identified any cons at this time. I will edit this review if my experience reveals any cons.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12089271", "1": "0.23292056", "2": "0.17634666", "3": "0.15894507", "4": "0.08142689", "5": "0.06313019", "6": "0.16633788"}}
