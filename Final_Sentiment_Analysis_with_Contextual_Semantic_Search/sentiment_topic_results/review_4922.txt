{"text": "I bought this watch back in '08 and have loved it!  I wear it almost everyday! It has been through lots of water and has held up so well!  I love the chrono feature I use it all the time when exercising and I have 3 different alarm settings!  This was a great find and reasonably priced for the quality of product!  I am still wearing it and still love it!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.52579176", "2": "0.17244874", "4": "0.23979996", "5": "0.049687237"}}
