{"text": "I bought one of these a year or two back because I wanted the features of my GW5600 G-Shock without all the clunkiness. The fact that it is available in brown & green was really nice, because I could wear it to work and it matches khakis.One day, I decided it is a disposable watch. I needed a clock on my motorcycle, so I took this off the band and used double-stick tape to stick it to the gas tank. Sold the bike and the watch went with it.I have missed it ever since.Another thing it has over the G-Shock is that the buttons protrude a bit and are easy to press.The light is a proper backlight, and the button is front & center, but not too easy to press accidentally.The one feature that is getting harder and harder to find, but is super-useful is the countdown timer. The basic digital watches don't have it.  It is useful for reminding oneself to change laundry, to time frozen pizza in the oven, and even to time the brewing time on a pot of tea.The last thing that is really nice about this watch is that the leather/nylon strap is much more comfortable than the resin strap on most of the Casios in this price range.  It breathes a bit, instead of sticking to your wrist.I miss this watch and will buy another one shortly.For reference, this seems to weigh about 1/3 as much as a G-Shock and has a smooth profile that easily fits under shirt sleeves. I don't believe it has a mineral crystal, so it will scratch easier, but that doesn't really matter. It will still be legible.The green LCD background also makes it easier to read than a gray on gray, like most of them have.I highly recommend this watch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.090192586", "1": "0.17067933", "2": "0.14278144", "3": "0.18140072", "4": "0.24502781", "5": "0.0647281", "6": "0.105190024"}}
