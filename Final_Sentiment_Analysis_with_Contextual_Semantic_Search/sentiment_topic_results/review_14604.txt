{"text": "I bought these for my husband who has only worn Levis 501 for the last 40+ years.  He was sceptical but agreed to try a pair since his size is difficult to find in Levis sometimes.  He was very pleased.  They fit nice, feel soft but still have substantial heft and wear and the color is just right.  He reports that they are more comfortable than his Levis and gave a thumbs up to buying more.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04797083", "1": "0.3258247", "3": "0.08724998", "4": "0.10319013", "5": "0.13461624", "6": "0.29724336"}}
