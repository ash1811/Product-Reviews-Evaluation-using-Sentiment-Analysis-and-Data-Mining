{"text": "But what is holding them ON??? There's no sticky, nothing.  Just my body heat I guess but the bra can't be loose at all... no show though and no these do not show either... wasn't \"life changing\" for me, but I can now wear bras I couldn't before with white t-shirts...so that's something.You only get one \"leftie\" and one \"rightie\"... I thought this was a package of many of them for some reason.  I opened it up and thought - I paid $10 for each one of THESE?Okay. Someone is really getting rich off this product / they probably cost pennies to produce, but they do work...I do wish they had some sticky on the back or option to have to hold them on...in case I bend over and my bra shifts alot.... hmmmm.  I may find some body glue of some sort and use that...I'm not RAVING about this like everyone else is here... I only got two of them, if I lose 1 I have to buy two more...okay.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07382566", "1": "0.16542055", "2": "0.13822697", "3": "0.106102735", "4": "0.2446515", "5": "0.07669125", "6": "0.19508137"}}
