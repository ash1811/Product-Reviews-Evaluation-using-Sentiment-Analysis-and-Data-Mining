(maybe not!) i find i am drawn to these more... i LOVE the color and i LOVE the slipper and i love the warmth, i bought my husband a pair and i think he has already worm them out, he actually wont take them off... so i would say GREAT PRODUCT!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03160937", "1": "0.42498428", "4": "0.21615489", "5": "0.23498833", "6": "0.0866304"}}
