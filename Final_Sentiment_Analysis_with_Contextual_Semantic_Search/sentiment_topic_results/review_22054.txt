{"text": "I purchased, the Shirt, pants, sock liner, and glove liners. Shirt and Pants somewhat bigger than I wanted. 6'@185 43 Inch chest, however I didn't want them too tight. Not particular good on Motorcycle, found my Hanes cotton's to be better for what I was trying to use them for. It's about the same as panty hose, no wind blockage but then I was running about 70mph in about 45-50 degree weather. The glove liners did show any improvement. One thing for sure, keep them away for Velcro, it will stick and pulling it away causes multiple silk strands pulled out.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.026019001", "1": "0.15075213", "2": "0.36643666", "3": "0.22920021", "5": "0.093128204", "6": "0.13199627"}}
