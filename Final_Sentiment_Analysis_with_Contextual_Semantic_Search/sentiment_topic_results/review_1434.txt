{"text": "Wow, this backpack is incredibly roomy. I am using it to hold all of our &#34;in case of a zombie apocalypse&#34; emergency supplies. I thought I would need two backpacks to hold everything, but, no, it all fits easily into one bag.There are two huge main zippered compartments and several smaller ones (and even more compartments inside those compartments!). The straps are very sturdy and comfortable, even when holding a full pack. The backpack, overall, is of very high quality, but I love having the lifetime guarantee anyway. I also love the bright red color.In short, I am extremely happy with this purchase!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07673731", "1": "0.16517046", "2": "0.36542496", "3": "0.13733447", "4": "0.21825598", "6": "0.034804173"}}
