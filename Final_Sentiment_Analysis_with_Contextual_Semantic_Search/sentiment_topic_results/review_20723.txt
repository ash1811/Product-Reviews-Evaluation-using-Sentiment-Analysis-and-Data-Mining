{"text": "Polypropylene glove liners are an essential part of dressing for winter.  Used under a pair of regular winter gloves, you will get a sublayer that is warm and will wick sweat from your hands.  They can also be used alone for fall and spring outdoor activities.  Runners like them for runs when the temperature is around 45 - 55 degrees.  Cross-country skiiers will love how they keep the fingers warm and dry while on the trail.  I have purchased three sets of these and place them in my heavy-duty snowblower mittens, my out-door hiking gloves, and my every-day (work) gloves.  They fit comfortably under each set of gloves.I have found the liners to be long-lasting if used under another pair of gloves.  If used alone for outdoor activities, they will wear and get thin.This is a great price.  I know you will want more than one pair, so get several.I favor polyproplyene over silk liners, as the silk is a bit more expensive, and tends to snag more easily.konedog", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06015418", "1": "0.29833046", "2": "0.17628905", "3": "0.14269923", "4": "0.21715227", "5": "0.081397094", "6": "0.02397772"}}
