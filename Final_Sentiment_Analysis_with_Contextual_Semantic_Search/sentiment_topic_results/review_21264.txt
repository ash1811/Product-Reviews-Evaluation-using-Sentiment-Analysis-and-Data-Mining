{"text": "I am 60 and have foot problems like over pronation and bunions. Plus my left foot is very flat at the ball of the foot due to a bunion operation.  I walk my dog twice a day for at least 20 minutes each time.  This shoes is great for balance and I don't feel I need an insert when I wear this shoe.  I will buy it again and again as long as it is available.  The only drawback is the shoe is hot as it is expected to be 110 degrees this week.  I will deal with this because the mesh shoes just don't provide the support I need.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.040652547", "1": "0.19203071", "2": "0.1341715", "3": "0.23380393", "4": "0.15471485", "5": "0.09699473", "6": "0.14763173"}}
