{"text": "I tried a million different sunglasses on before settling on this pair.  I tried several different sizes, as well.  I am not that small of an individual(I do have a small nose, but not to an extreme or anything), but the regular size Wayfarers AND Original Wayfarers fell off my face!  These fit great, the lenses are awesome, and the design looks cool.  Tons of reviews say the 52mm are child size, but they fit me perfectly.  If you have a store that sells Ray-Bans near you (I wish I had and this would have taken a lot less time to figure out!), I would try the sizes and models on and then come to Amazon to get a great discount on legit sunglasses!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.091263786", "1": "0.2820671", "2": "0.14343399", "3": "0.1991038", "4": "0.15523413", "6": "0.12654963"}}
