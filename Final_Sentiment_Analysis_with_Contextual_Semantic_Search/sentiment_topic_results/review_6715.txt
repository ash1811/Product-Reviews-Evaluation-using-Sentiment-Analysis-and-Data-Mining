{"text": "Since first purchasing Bates boots while in the military in the 90's, Bates is the only boot I'll spend my money on.  The quality is excellent, they last for many years, and they're comfortable right out of the box.  Very light, especially for a \"protected\" toe boot.  Once you get the tension of the laces right, the zippered side makes on/off a quick breeze.  I purchased these Bates because my current boots, now 7 years old, are showing their age with scuffs, etc., though the boots are still comfortable and function well.  A great boot that's fit for work and everyday use.  Highly recommended.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03412686", "1": "0.28753686", "2": "0.074853465", "3": "0.0742133", "4": "0.41871658", "5": "0.034228183", "6": "0.076324806"}}
