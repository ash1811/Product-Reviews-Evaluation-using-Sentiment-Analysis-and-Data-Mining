{"text": "I originally ordered this bag in yellow for my husband to pack his snorkeling gear when we went on a cruise. What it arrived, I liked it so much that I wanted one, too.  That's Amaon's super fast shipping, it arrived before we left.The zippered compartment was handy, and the strap was relatively comfortable.  My bag was big enough to carry all my snorkeling gear, a big beach towel, cover up, bottles of water, and first gen kindle.  We wound up taking the bags even when we went on a couple excursions without our snorkeling gear.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.22327986", "1": "0.3277077", "2": "0.30181986", "3": "0.04263751", "4": "0.099442445"}}
