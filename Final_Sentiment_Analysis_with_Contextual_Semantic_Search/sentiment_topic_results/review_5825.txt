{"text": "Okay, I am 6'2 210 lbs and when I bought my last shirt like this a decade ago I purchased it at a local army / navy surplus store.  It has lasted great and is getting thread bare :). I read the reviews before buying this one, I normally get XL in every shirt I buy but went with the Large after reading the reviews.  I also will buy Longs when available but also opted out of that decision.  This shirt fits perfect in the shoulders, the sleeves are plently long and so is the length.  If it helps or matters mine was made in Honduras, I would have given this product a 5 star rating but is does not seem to be made with the same weighted material as my original that was made in the USA so long ago.  Hope this helps ya all......", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08759754", "1": "0.33517656", "2": "0.05988625", "3": "0.1295563", "4": "0.13193078", "5": "0.09989834", "6": "0.15595423"}}
