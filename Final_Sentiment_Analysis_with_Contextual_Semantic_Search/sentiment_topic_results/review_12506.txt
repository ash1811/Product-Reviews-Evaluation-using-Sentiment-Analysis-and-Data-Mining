{"text": "The toe post is not stiff or thick. The straps are fully padded so they feel soft.  I have a moderately narrow medium width foot and the straps are perfect.  The yoga mat bottoms conform to your foot and give cushion, support, and a pretty good arch support.  One can walk in them all day without getting aching in the arch or other foot areas as happens with flat hard bottom flip flops.  I am pretty much in love with these shoes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09464287", "1": "0.31886968", "2": "0.13801116", "3": "0.15414332", "4": "0.13644119", "5": "0.15491255"}}
