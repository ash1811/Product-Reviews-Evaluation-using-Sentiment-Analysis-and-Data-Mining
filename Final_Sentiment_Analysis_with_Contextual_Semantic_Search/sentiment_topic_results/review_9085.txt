{"text": "These are very nice and comfortable for around the house. I prefer this type of slipper because the bottom is very sturdy, so you can wear them outside to get the mail/take trash out/etc without ruining them, and they tend to last several seasons before losing their comfort and support. They are very warm, and the color I purchased (Sand) is very cute.Two things I don't like about this slipper:The shape of it is a bit wider and more cumbersome than other slippers. These make my feet look quite a bit larger than they are. I usually wear a size 8, so I ordered an 8, and they seem to be about a half size too large on me. I'm not totally sure that a 7 would be big enough, but once the fluffy lining gets worn down and compacted, I'm certain that it would be. I suggest going down a half size to 1 full size from your usual shoe size - it may seem snug when you first get them, but the fluffiness will go away over time, making them perfect in the long run.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.18880366", "1": "0.34261256", "2": "0.02831045", "3": "0.24748172", "5": "0.08893689", "6": "0.10138282"}}
