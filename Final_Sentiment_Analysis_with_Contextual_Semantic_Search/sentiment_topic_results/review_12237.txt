{"text": "I had ordered these a few years ago, but in xs for the compression fit. They were still extremely comfortable, even though I generally wear a small. I ordered them again but this time in medium, and the fit is a bit loose for me, not a compression fit, but that is as I expected. I wanted these leggings to be loose enough around the waist so I won't get a muffin top under tight shirts, and this fit the bill.The color is a deep, pure black. But my other pair faded a bit with much wearing and repeated washings. The fabric looks like cotton, but my favorite part about supplex is that cat hair doesn't adhere to it like it does to cotton, so I don't have to lint roll my legs five times a day...generally I can just brush them off with my hands and I am good to go.It's also a breathable fabric that is very comfortable to wear in hot summer months.I also bought the Capizeo black supplex tights, and I far prefer the Danskin. The Danskin have a much better stretch, much better feel, and hold up much better than the Capizeo tights did.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.029987168", "1": "0.4454108", "2": "0.082111575", "3": "0.15876529", "4": "0.06825294", "5": "0.106733814", "6": "0.10873843"}}
