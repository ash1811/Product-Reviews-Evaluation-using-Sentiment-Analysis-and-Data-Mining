{"text": "Here is a great gift idea and a great value as well. For the price of just under $200, these are 14k yellow and white gold pieces that are stunning in style with a mirror-like finish that is a real eye-catcher. They are of a fair size  and look heavier than they are. They are well made and nicely presented in a gift box and a velvet pouch. They are stylish enough to be featured in a 5th Avenue window where they would probably sell for 2 - 3 times the price of admission here. Running out of time for your sweethearts holiday gift? Just pay a few more bucks for next day delivery and you are all set! I just don't see how you can go wrong with this fine set of earrings.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.25542152", "1": "0.18322496", "2": "0.0845887", "3": "0.037776317", "4": "0.14955392", "5": "0.15528439", "6": "0.13415018"}}
