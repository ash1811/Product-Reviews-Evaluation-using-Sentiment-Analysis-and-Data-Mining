{"text": "I'm pretty picky about boots, especially because when I wear them I wear them all day. This is my second pair of Dan Post boots (I wore the other pair out completely), and this brand is my all-time favorite. There is very little break-in needed and they fit well from the first time you put them on. The price is also very reasonable. My one warning is make sure you have a good pair of tall boot socks when you wear these boots or they will rub against your calf.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10821022", "1": "0.16620424", "2": "0.092988774", "3": "0.1558309", "4": "0.28289682", "5": "0.15814169", "6": "0.03572734"}}
