{"text": "I'm a big guy, but not pear-shaped. Most stuff for big guys tend to be cut for the pear or blob shaped. I however, just have a huge gut. The rest of me is shaped pretty normal. So most 5x sized shirts tend to look like Omar the Tent-maker sewed em up. Let's face it, nothing is going to flatter my shape and I don't expect miracles. But man is it nice to put this thing on.Covers the tummy completely, which almost NEVER happens with any shirt. I almost always order XLT's to get enough out front to cover the gut (resulting in the huge, sail-like profile of most shirts), but this does. And without 50\" long sleeves or other silly looking results.Bottom line, if you're a big guy with a big gut, you'll like this sweatshirt. Best fitting one I've ever found.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10850685", "1": "0.2803564", "2": "0.0834839", "3": "0.27729768", "4": "0.24625413"}}
