{"text": "While the sock itself isn't so bad, they seem to run fairly small. They seem like they may wear out quickly with heavy use. I would recommend getting a larger size if you are on the higher end of the size chart. I did notice these had more lint than the average sock, too. I ordered these because I enjoyed other Wigwam socks but these I am not too impressed with. I prefer the Carthartt or Timberland sock to these.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2589815", "1": "0.24445808", "2": "0.1183213", "3": "0.06793201", "5": "0.17970304", "6": "0.12692492"}}
