{"text": "I bought the High Sierra fat boy backpack for my weekend camps about two months back. I love trekking and always wanted a durable, large and versatile backpack. This backpack has everything I wanted. The compartments are big enough to hold my trekking shoes, snack, rope, hooks and more. Despite the size the backpack is quite spacious. The straps are adjustable and the backpack also facilitates a MP3 player pocket with headphone port. The shoulder strap is comfortable as it is Vapel mesh airflow padded. Similarly the back panel also is padded. The backpack is of the right size and not bulky. The zippers are of high quality even after rough use it is still working fine.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11999636", "1": "0.16457598", "2": "0.33428752", "3": "0.13495442", "4": "0.08827698", "5": "0.12918837", "6": "0.0287204"}}
