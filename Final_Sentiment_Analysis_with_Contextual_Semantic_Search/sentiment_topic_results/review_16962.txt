{"text": "One of my late, larger than life uncles could warm the air with a stream of salient cusses so unique that no one minded. One thing he liked was Carhartt's quality. Some things remain, and I continue to appreciate the workmanship in Carhartt products. This is one generously proportioned, carefully constructed work shirt; these guys don't skimp. For once, if you order an XXL, it will be really roomy. So, if you normally find XXL a little too big, the X-Large may be large enough. You get every penny's worth from this totally practical shirt, it's truly durable and will last a long time while looking professional. The only caveat is be aware that this soft and comfortable high-quality shirt consists of thick heavy-duty fabric, appropriate for cool/cold weather. Carhartt provides the real thing, this is not for ornamental or pretend-work wear. A Borgnine thumbs-up.
