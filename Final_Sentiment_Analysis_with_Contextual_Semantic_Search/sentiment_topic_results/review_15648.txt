{"text": "Such a cute costume!  It seems very well made, and has held up well to my daughter running around the house in it saving the day.  I love that the cape attaches on the shoulders via velcro, much better than the around-the-neck cape on my son's costume, which irritates his neck.  This costume also came with cute accessories, including the shiny boot toppers and the gold belt. The top is also a very soft velvet-like material, with little gold bands at the sleeve. A great pick, we're very happy with it!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.25630632", "1": "0.14016049", "2": "0.14426386", "3": "0.19206966", "4": "0.11832047", "5": "0.06197193", "6": "0.086907275"}}
