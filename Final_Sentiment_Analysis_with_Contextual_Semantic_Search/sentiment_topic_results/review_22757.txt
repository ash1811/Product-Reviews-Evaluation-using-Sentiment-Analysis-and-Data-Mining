{"text": "The heart charm is beautiful. Shiny and high quality silver and just the right size. Many reviews here give this item 3 or less stars because of the chain. As the title says the chain is a stock chain. A stock chain is a chain that comes on pendants that is for display purposes only but must be replaced for use. A stock chain is thin, easily breakable, and of low quality. Like I said it is for display of the \"necklace\" and not meant for wear. You are buying a \"Silver Floating Heart Pendant\" here, not the chain and for ~$13 it is an excellent and beautiful buy. I would take this much cheaper yet equally as beautiful charm over Tiffany's price any day. The chain is not meant for wear. YOU MUST REPLACE THE CHAIN. Especially if you are giving this as a gift. Trust me.I replaced the chain with a sterling silver snake chain.SN030DC Nickel Free Italian Sterling Silver 1mm Snake Chain Necklaceis available on Amazon. It is beautiful. A snake chain is rounded and has a slippery feel that the heart will move smoothly along. A snake chain more keeps it shape. The other possibility is a more flexible box chain. Also available here on Amazon isBOX1MM Nickel Free Italian Sterling Silver 1mm Box Chain 14\" 16\" 18\" 20\" 22\" 24\" 30\" Necklace. A box chain is a boxed shape and is less slippery and more flexible than a snake chain. I prefer the snake chain with this charm but either will work perfectly. I also recommend 1mm and 18\" as that is the standard length.Enjoy this charm but replace the chain.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.048513863", "1": "0.17432578", "2": "0.056938242", "3": "0.06701048", "4": "0.21869259", "5": "0.15515123", "6": "0.2793678"}}
