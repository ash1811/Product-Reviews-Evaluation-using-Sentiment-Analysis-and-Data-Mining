{"text": "Overall this is a really good quality robe. It is super soft and definitely serves its purpose - I especially love the fact that it is cotton and that it is not too thick. This robe is perfect for summer or if you live in a warm climate. I bought it in a light pink color, and the only reason it is not getting the full 5 stars from me is because it is see-threw. If I am wearing just underwear underneath it, I do not feel comfortable opening the door or walking my dog outside - just in case the neighbors are around. So if you are planning to get the pink color, just know that you will most likely have to wear PJs underneath it (if you plan to wear the robe in front of others). I love hanging out in my PJs and I go to the mailbox with robe on etc - if you plan to wear this in privacy then its definitely a 5 star product.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.2542518", "1": "0.29265583", "2": "0.049474645", "3": "0.17643043", "5": "0.055343296", "6": "0.16903469"}}
