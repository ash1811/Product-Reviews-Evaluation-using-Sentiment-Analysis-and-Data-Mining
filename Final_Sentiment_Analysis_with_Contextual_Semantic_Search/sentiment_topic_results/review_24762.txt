{"text": "I use these as sleeping shorts and lounging around the house. I have a 36\" waist, but I order these in XXL! They still fit well and are very comfortable. I like them over boxers/pajama sleeping shorts (hate the front drawstrings on pajama shorts), and also I could go outside to mailbox, etc.  Also no opening in front, so no accidently flashing someone!  Also, here is another good brand I use for sleeping shorts in Oxford Grey (they are a little lighter weight) >Champion Men's Jersey Short With Pockets", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.23682736", "1": "0.2277341", "2": "0.03332928", "3": "0.15954477", "4": "0.08998477", "5": "0.12691164", "6": "0.12566808"}}
