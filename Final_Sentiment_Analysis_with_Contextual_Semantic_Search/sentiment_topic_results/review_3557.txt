{"text": "I just love this bra.  I was first introduced to Playtex when my doctor's nurse suggested that I buy something good when I was expecting - and NOT Victoria's Secret!  Playtex's maternity bras are virtually indestructable and I just loved those.  So, I changed to these because quite frankly, you're not the same after nursing but this bra does the trick.  The support is just wonderful, but you don't feel like you are wrapped up tight in a sheet tied with a rubber band either.  It's a very comfortable bra and I wear them all the time.  They last a long time through the washings and come out looking great.  I'm so glad that I found something that works without feeling like I'm dressed in something that makes you feel like you're in a straight jacket.  The underwire isn't even noticeable, another great plus.  I'll be wearing just these as long as they make them!  Plus, they provide nice coverage too.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12785713", "1": "0.33137977", "2": "0.04238668", "3": "0.18567008", "4": "0.1489315", "5": "0.085137576", "6": "0.07863721"}}
