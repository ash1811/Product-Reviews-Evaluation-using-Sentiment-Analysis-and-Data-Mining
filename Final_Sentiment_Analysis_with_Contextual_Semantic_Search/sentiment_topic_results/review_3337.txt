{"text": "Merrell Men's Jungle Moc Slip-On,Gunsmoke,13 W is a not so good fit for my son.  I wish Merrell made more WIDE and extra-wide shoes.  These were a struggle to get on over socks.  After a couple of weeks he admitted to me that he could not wear them but was unable to find the box and receipt for a few days but when he did he brought them over to me.  We printed off a return label and immediately took them to UPS for a return.  The easy Amazon refund only took a few days.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04615739", "1": "0.22543052", "2": "0.12738669", "3": "0.13712254", "4": "0.16536696", "5": "0.1993292", "6": "0.09920667"}}
