{"text": "Really love this bra. It supports well and creates an uplifted shape....not at all a matronly shape. I wear the same size in this bra as I do in most other bras so I would say it is true to fit. It lasts well, also, even though I cheat and wash mine on the delicate cycle in my washing machine. I do line dry. I have three bras like this one and wouldn't buy any other kind.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.21363151", "3": "0.423378", "4": "0.119024985", "5": "0.13279635", "6": "0.103809886"}}
