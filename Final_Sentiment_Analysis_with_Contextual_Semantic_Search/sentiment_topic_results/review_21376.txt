{"text": "I not only like this for back support, but when I put it on, my litle girl kicks because she doesn't like how it feels. Then she moves up and away from my bladder and cervix. That makes me a very happy mommy because she isn't tap dancing on all those parts below. Plus it does help to keep weight off my cervix, and it also helps prevent back pain. Win-win!
