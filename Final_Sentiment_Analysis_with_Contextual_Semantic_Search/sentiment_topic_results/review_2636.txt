{"text": "I bought this for my 8 month lean baby boy. I did have to take it in a bit (It is sized for 12 to 18 ), but it was easy to do. He loved it and had it on all night over his PJs. It is made with mobile babies in mind, not one hole. The top fit well on his head over top of a beanie (I put the beanie on first for a while till he was used to it, then added the top) he didn't even notice it (until the top would flip down, but to really a problem, flips back and is pretty sturdy) .", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05682624", "1": "0.34975955", "2": "0.24990524", "3": "0.29589945", "5": "0.04210158"}}
