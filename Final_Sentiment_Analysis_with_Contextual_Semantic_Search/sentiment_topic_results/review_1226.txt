{"text": "I found these to be a bit smaller than store brands like Hanes and Fruit of the Loom. I do like the style though. My one big problem with these panties is that they are perfumed. Seriously, whose idea was it to scent women's underwear?? Why is this necessary? Jockey, do you also scent men's underwear, or are women just particularly stinky? And why would they think we would like it?? I've washed them 3 times now, soaked them overnight in a borax and vinegar mixture, and they still smell. I'm worried that I could get a UTI from the scent if I wear them. As long as they keep using perfume in their underwear, I will not purchase Jockey panties again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11269819", "1": "0.2770721", "2": "0.13945271", "3": "0.28270894", "4": "0.060825013", "5": "0.080862895", "6": "0.046380088"}}
