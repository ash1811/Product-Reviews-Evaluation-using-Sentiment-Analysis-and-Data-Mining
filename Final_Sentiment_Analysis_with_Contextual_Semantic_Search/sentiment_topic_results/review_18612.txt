{"text": "This item is exactly what you pay for. The material is on the cheap side and very fragile. The garter is not substantial. The model in the photo is very petite, so the garter looks wider than it actually is. The waist is adjustable, but it runs small. I tried it around my waist at its largest setting. It fit, however, the fabric was distorted and did not lay flat. I wear a size 6- 7. I think this would probably look nice on someone who is smaller. Don't even think about it, if you have a muffin top. This will probably not hold up for everyday wear. I own several garters, and this one does not compare in quality. It would be fine for someone looking for an inexpensive garter to spice up &#34;the bedroom&#34;. The actual appearance of the item isn't bad and the thong style is O.K.  I did not receive stockings with it, as some of the other reviews stated.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1062308", "1": "0.3151735", "2": "0.1223323", "3": "0.13929641", "5": "0.20528069", "6": "0.10924477"}}
