{"text": "I was in the market for a slim, attractive, sophisticated and unique watch, and when I first saw the Skagen line I loved it.  However, the model I wanted was not availabe when I tried to find one.  Then I found a great choice - Now, I have nearly this same exact watch but from Skagen's secondary line - Grennen Denmark - in Steel rather than Titanium.  And I got it on sale for $30 one year ago.I will eventually find a Skagen watch similar to my first interest but I will stand by these watches as being very good quality and very comfortable, nearly un-noticeable on my wrist.  So if you like these look for Grennen to see what you might find there.  Save some $$.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12077214", "1": "0.19835642", "2": "0.30588642", "3": "0.06460154", "4": "0.17264915", "6": "0.13533875"}}
