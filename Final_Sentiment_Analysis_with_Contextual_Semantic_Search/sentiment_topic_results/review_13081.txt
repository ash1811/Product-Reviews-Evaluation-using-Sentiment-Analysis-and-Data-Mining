{"text": "I was looking for a more masculine way to lug around my baby boy's diapers and wipes.  This bag fit the bill perfectly.  Enough room for a pack of wipes and a stack for pampers.  Small pockets in front are fantastic for small things like Bourdeaux's Butt Paste, hand sanitizer, etc.  A far cry from the intended purpose of this bag (ammunition).  OD green color beats the jungle animal rainbow diaper bags I found in local stores.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.055740193", "1": "0.2844732", "2": "0.123907596", "3": "0.03927556", "4": "0.11300244", "5": "0.16460808", "6": "0.21899289"}}
