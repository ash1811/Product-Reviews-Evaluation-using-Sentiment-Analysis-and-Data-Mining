{"text": "I have several brands of sandals and Keen tops them all! The Venice is slightly less clunky looking then the Newport model. But the Newport hugs the foot a bit more. The footbed of Keen sandals is the selling point, no other sandal comes close. The sizing of Keen, and in fact all sandals being sold now, is confusing. I have sandals bought 5 years ago in Columbia brand that are one size smaller and are the same size as the Keen. I noticed other brands seem to be tending that way too. I found New Balance and Merrel shoes seem to be trending the same way (like a 8 is now a 9) You will find Keen sandals selling used on Ebay for almost new price because they are so loved and last forever. There are many sandals in other brands that \"look\" like Keen. Try them on and they are not even close in comfort. You will not regret buying Keen sandals. Comfort wise, the Newport model (which I order here on Amazon too) is a bit better fit because of more straps. I have a narrower foot then some and that may be why. The bumper toe on all of them is very clever and well needed if your going to wear the shoe. But I love them both. I know the price is hefty... try checking off season and Amazon usually has some at a better price (maybe closeout models?)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.104364894", "1": "0.0695893", "2": "0.19309773", "3": "0.28433162", "4": "0.08437482", "5": "0.034987893", "6": "0.22925375"}}
