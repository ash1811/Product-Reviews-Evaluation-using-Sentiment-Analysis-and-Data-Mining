{"text": "Excellent everyday pants. As they age, I'll put them in the work wear pile. I hate to use them for farming out of the box.The slate is understated. I own olive and brown as well.  I like the snap pocket flaps. The knees are reinforced and you could possibly stuff some light weight foam knee pads in the bottom opening but they do not appear to be made to do so.I wish someone would make a thigh pocket with a smartphone sleeve inside  the pocket to keep the phone vertical when you walk.  I am six feet tall and weigh 204 and the 34 X 34 is a good fit as I like to wear my pants long. They don't shrink in the wash. They are somewhat stiff and on the heavy side of medium weight, so they will be a little hot in the summer and should wear well.The product picture shows the way they fit on me. The leather knife clip protector is a nice touch. They fit a little slimmer than Propper's in the legs and buttocks.  The Ranger fit compares to 5.11 brand tactical wear. The 5.11 all-cotton &#34;covert&#34;  has some useful interior zip pockets and is lighter weight which will fade and wear out on the cuff faster. 5.11 does make pants out of a lighter weight rip stop material that can pass as more dressy and has sheen to them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.044497978", "1": "0.3296844", "2": "0.11459249", "3": "0.16923915", "4": "0.15576561", "5": "0.09708021", "6": "0.089140184"}}
