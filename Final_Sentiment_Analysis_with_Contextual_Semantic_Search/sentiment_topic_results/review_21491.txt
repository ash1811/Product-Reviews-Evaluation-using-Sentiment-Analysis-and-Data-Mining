{"text": "Update July 14, 2013  I'm back for another pair in a different color. This summer I have worn these to the beach , the mountains, through streams, puddles and daily life. They have decent traction in wet conditions. I found the sole does break in a little, conforming to your foot. They clean up easily with a quick rinse, still look new and provide great support. They stay on. I get compliments on these things. I still find the look an acquired taste, but pretty is as pretty does, and that makes these sandals absolutely beautiful. Got the Petrol blue/twilight this time, a good blue to go with denim.Original review:This is one of many pairs of Keen sandals I own. They sell more heavy duty soled(NewportH2) and lighter soled (Turin water shoes) sandals in these water sandal type. They are all comfortable and have their uses, but these are my favorite all around. They are a little more open, yet the straps all hit in perfect places in relation to my toes. The soles have a nice flex that is thick enough to make  a bluestone driveway a comfortable walk. They offer good support to avoid re-injury if you have suffered plantar fascititis. They stay on in the surf. My only complaint is that they will pick up sand and rocks (and stuff) while in the surf. Wear flip flops at the beach instead. These are my favorites for everything else. They are snug to pull on. Once on they disappear on your feet. Don't get better than that. I also find the red is lovely, does not show dirt. If you have never worn Keen sandals before, these are a good style to start with. I usually wear size 8.5W in shoes, these I went up 1/2 size (to size 9) and they are perfect. They will accommodate a wide foot, and the lacing will tighten to fit a slimmer low volume foot. The protective toe I have learned to love as it keeps much debris from between my toes when walking through the woods and fields.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10294767", "1": "0.35146946", "2": "0.06856948", "3": "0.20835233", "4": "0.10188295", "5": "0.10621162", "6": "0.060566477"}}
