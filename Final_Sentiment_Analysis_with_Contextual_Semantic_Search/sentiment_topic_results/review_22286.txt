{"text": "I do love these socks. They fit well and are true to size. It seems to me my feet sweat a little more than usual when I wear these socks.

Great socks, no problems with these and I love pink.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.41067514", "2": "0.07700908", "4": "0.15344217", "5": "0.23779798", "6": "0.11310841"}}
