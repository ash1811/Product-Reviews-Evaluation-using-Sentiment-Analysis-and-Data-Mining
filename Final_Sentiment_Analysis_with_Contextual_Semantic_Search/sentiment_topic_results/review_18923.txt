{"text": "How can Levis give four completely different pants the same model number? It is a joke of the first order. How are you supposed to ever find the jeans you like when you can *NEVER* count on getting them twice in a row using the same model number? Who is the genius who decided that '514' should be applied to all manner of totally different pants? Who decided they should be made in disparate countries from production run to run? I will never patronize Levis again - number one they are made in Bangladesh or Columbia, number two they are literally morons at Levis, and morons don't deserve our business.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12771061", "1": "0.28007683", "2": "0.20456728", "3": "0.14934559", "4": "0.09249192", "6": "0.14325032"}}
