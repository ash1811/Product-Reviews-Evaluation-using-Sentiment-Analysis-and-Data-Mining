{"text": "Love these shoes....however this time one of the shoe's toe mold is a bit off.So that natural feeling to walk with ease isn't quite there in one shoe. I am hoping that it will ware down and be great like the other shoe and as normal. It's a great pair of shoes.I am not sure what happen with the one shoe. I could have made a return...but I wanted to wear the shoes so badly that I just didn't want to part with them. I should have done a return. So...it's my own fault not to be perfectly pleased.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14346103", "1": "0.43689984", "2": "0.31842384", "6": "0.09185084"}}
