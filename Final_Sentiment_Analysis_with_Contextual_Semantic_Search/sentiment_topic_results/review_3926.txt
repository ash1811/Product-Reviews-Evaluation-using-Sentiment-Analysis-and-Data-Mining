{"text": "These are very comfortable slippers with a very soft terry feel, nice grip base, and a wonderfully cushy insole that is similar to a tempurpedic mattress.  It conforms well to your feet and these are fantastic if you do lots of cooking as well.  I have a stained concrete floor in my kitchen and these make cooking comfortable...I just slip out of my shoes and put them on, who needs a chef's gel mat?These are fantastic.  And nice looking as well!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13968265", "1": "0.2621842", "2": "0.10105108", "4": "0.13926059", "5": "0.07086315", "6": "0.2834474"}}
