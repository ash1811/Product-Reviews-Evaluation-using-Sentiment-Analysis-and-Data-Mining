{"text": "Fitting: Fits comfortably. It's between a Regular-Fit and a slim-fit, I'd say. I have 36\" waist, so things maybe different for you. good looking denims but soft and comfortable to wear.Color: actual color is darker than photo but color tone is accurate. A true bargain at such price.Style: the top part of the jeans (waist/pocket area) has deliberate crease, making it special. check the photo and you'll know what I mean here. So, you might not want to wear long and baggy clothing with these, covering the pocket area wasting this feature.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.095269755", "1": "0.29316264", "2": "0.12261054", "3": "0.07926078", "4": "0.14899282", "5": "0.14778428", "6": "0.112919174"}}
