{"text": "I fell in lust with these in Black on Beige Frame/Green Solid Lens for $130 at my eye dr's last week.Pros: style! many color combos, frame for smaller face/sits out away from cheek, price ~60% off retail and Ray-Ban.com, green G-15 lens has excellent color contrast in bright light (ask old pilots re G15)Cons: smaller frame design means less eye/skin protection, not suitable for sports, not polarized at this price, overall poorer lens quality compared to older Wayfarers and most other brands, fakes reported here on AmazonFit: size 52 mm is great on my ~average-sl. narrow face (female, US, cauc) with a small nose bridge. I have to hunt to find plastic glasses with built-in nose pieces that don't slide down my nose. This is open boxy style is less slanted than orig and is less likely to hit your cheek than other styles. This is not a one-size-fits-all frame; best to try it on someplace if you can, esp guys, or order both 52 and 55mm and return. Not meant to be worn for sports.Style/Color: classic done better, loved the ~cream/black w/ green lens combo, many more fun combos availableWarranty: Just 30 days vs others brands 1yr (Oakley)-2yr (Maui Jim, Serengeti).Offical warranty says: Return Authorization (RA) number within 45 days of receipt of product. The product must be returned within 30 calendar days of the issuance of the RA number.Price: ~60% of retail $130. Polarized lens are $50 more. Lightning deal again tomorrow!Fake?: There are reviews re Ray-Bans they bought here were fake. I posted questions to some reviewers asking how they could tell they were fake but didn't get a response.There was a green/gold Ray-Ban sticker that annoyingly covered part of the left lens if that helps. (It could be faked).To see official sticker, Click on Size: 52 and choose 3rd color down\"Black Frame/Green Solid Lens\" to see the official sticker that was on the glasses at the eye dr's last week. The color that is shown is actaually the \"Black on Beige Frame/Solid Green Lens\" I want; it is correctly listed with photo under 55mm.I would really like for someone to speak up! Other companies like Oakley have a form to \"Report Fakes\".Lens: Oakley, Maui Jim, Serengeti, Persol have much better quality lens. Seems like since Bausch&Lomb; sold the company late 90's. Older lens were higher quality. These (-)polarization seem murky compared to other brands.I did not buy these.After I looked out the window then walked outside I was blown away by the difference in quality- signs, cars, people-everything was so much clearer through Maui Jim's I tried on last.The more $ polarized Ray-Bans are better but still can't touch the clarity, sharpness, color through MJ.The warranty, special UV , anti-scratch coatings sealed the deal.These are still way cool!Wish I'd bought these from Amazon, ditched the lens and ordered Rx lens online. It's the need for special lens and pressure/convenience to buy while you are there at the eye doctor's office...Next time!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.20702471", "1": "0.11611889", "2": "0.25020275", "3": "0.15829504", "4": "0.1066125", "5": "0.060271945", "6": "0.10147415"}}
