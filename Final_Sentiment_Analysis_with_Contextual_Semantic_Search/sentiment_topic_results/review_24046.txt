{"text": "I received these hiking shoes for Christmas, about 4 years ago.  At the time, I was hiking 28 - 35 miles per week.  I was unemployed at the time.  Now I am hiking less, but still at least 7 miles per week.  Still wearing the same pair.  Never a single blister or problem, and they still look almost brand new.  The trail i hike has some very steep sections, some rugged sections, some sandy, some dirt.  I have also worn them mountain bike riding.  True to size, and my feet are slightly wide.  (not wide enough to have to wear wide shoes).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21969803", "1": "0.18651135", "2": "0.15608768", "3": "0.191598", "4": "0.08770558", "5": "0.030432241", "6": "0.12796713"}}
