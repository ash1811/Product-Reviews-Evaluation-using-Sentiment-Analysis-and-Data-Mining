{"text": "This is a great valued, good-looking watch that keeps accurate time, but the crystal is a bit convex-shaped, so it looks a bit like a magnifying glass, I would've preferred the crystal to be flat...  also BEWARE of the band as it was impossible to adjust without scratching & denting the band at a few small spots as I was re-sizing it myself (I resized other watches myself including another Casio watch w/o such trouble, think it's due to the large angulation of the individual links on this watch that makes it so hard...)  guess a jeweler w/ better tools should be able to re-size this watch properly...", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.124548584", "2": "0.17307745", "3": "0.2773127", "4": "0.18429926", "5": "0.11212485", "6": "0.12620354"}}
