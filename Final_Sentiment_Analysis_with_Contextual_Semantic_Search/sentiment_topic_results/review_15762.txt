{"text": "I have 10 watches that I love to wear with different outfits. I have been paying $5 and $6 to get the battery changed. This kit is saving me money hand over fist. It is so easy to open the back of the watch and replace a dead battery. What a great idea! all the items in the kit are useful including the brush, the tweezers, the back opener and small screw drivers (one Phillips and one flat head) and the knife. It is very sharp so be careful. I highly recommend this watch battery replacement kit for anyone who wants to save money on their watches.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11999994", "1": "0.26768374", "2": "0.24236135", "3": "0.05934205", "4": "0.11222941", "5": "0.09908065", "6": "0.09930283"}}
