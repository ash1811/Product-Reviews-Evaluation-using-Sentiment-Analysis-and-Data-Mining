{"text": "I couldn't believe this price so I ordered them. I've been pricing Haviana's and didn't like the steep price for flip flops.  Then I saw these on Amazon and had to try them. They are beautiful, love the color, and so comfy. I normally wear an 8 so I ordered the next size up, as I heard they ran small. Perfect fit.
