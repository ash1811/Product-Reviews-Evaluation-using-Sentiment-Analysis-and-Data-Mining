{"text": "for the longest time I would would wear under armour shirts as undershirts. Not because I was trying to suck it in, but because I liked that it was thin yet fitting and wouldn't bunch up under shirts.  Well luckily I was introduced to these since then! These have everything I like about under armour. It is tighter, it doesn't bunch up, it keeps me cool or warm depending on weather, and it is long enough to tuck in.  It really is GREAT as an under shirt and fits extremely well!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3628988", "2": "0.18773519", "3": "0.09043731", "4": "0.06733379", "5": "0.20305109", "6": "0.08528813"}}
