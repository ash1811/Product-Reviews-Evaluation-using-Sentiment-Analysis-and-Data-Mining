{"text": "UPDATE:  After wearing these for a few days, I'm happy with the size (1 full size lower than sneakers.)  With thin socks, both feet feel extremely comfortable with one of my feet being looser than the other.  With thick socks, my right and wider foot is a bit tight in the widest part of the forefoot.  1/2 size lower would be too big for my left foot especially when wearing thinner socks.  These look so sweet...  It's taking everything not to buy a 2nd pair while the cheaper, previous version is still available.Honestly, I just ordered these from Amazon 10 minutes ago but I just got back from Nordstrom where I almost bought them on the spot but didn't as Amazon currently has a sale.I used to wear cowboy-like boots as a kid and am just getting back into the boot style - rustic, classy, manly.  I've wanted the Frye 8/12R Harness for the past five years but never went beyond dreaming as I thought the cost was high.  Amazon was having a sale so I decided to act and went to Nordstrom to try them on.I typically wear a 10.5 in sneakers (Nikes, Adidas) and the 9.5 is the size that worked best for me.  The 10 felt okay but loose enough to not feel perfect... the 9.5 hit the spot and they still felt extremely comfortable with no tightness.  I have what I consider thinner legs and ankles so perhaps that's why I had to go down a full size - I can basically slide my foot in the 12R with no resistance at all.  I imagine that many people buy boots online and assume that the size they bought is perfect when a size lower would actually work even better (as I easily could have gone with a 10 without trying a 9.5) - so definitely try these on in a store or order 2 pairs and return the 2nd.These (the 12R and 8R gaucho) looked amazing in the mirror with jeans on - I was really impressed and excited - they really look awesome.  I don't think I can include more positive words in that description but they deserve it.I'm 5'11, 32.5 inseam - the 12R and 8R both felt good but I liked the upper leg coverage (the feel when static and moving)and will like it and the added warmth even more come winter.  I think when you buy a boot of this style that you should go with the full-fledged boot style.It looks like Frye is selling their latest 12R and 8R @ $390 in two colors that I do not like as much as I do the gaucho/dark brown.  I imagine they'll release more colors but I believe that is a $100 MSRP hike from this previous version.  ...So that stinks and I suggest buying now while they are the lower cost.Sweet A... boots - I'm excitedly waiting for them to arrive so I can wear them around town and to work.  I highly suggest you buy them based on their style/look/fit.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.026148923", "1": "0.33280832", "2": "0.14421725", "4": "0.14905342", "5": "0.2059028", "6": "0.1396934"}}
