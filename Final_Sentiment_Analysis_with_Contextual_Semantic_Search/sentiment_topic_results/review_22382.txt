{"text": "When I don't wear these when biking or hiking my toes rub an skin comes off.  These prevent that.  I have NEVER had a hot spot when wearing these as a base layer sock.  I wear them under wool socks when hiking.  I won't hike without them.  Period.  I also like them for biking for the same reason.  They keep the toes from rubbing together.  They also allow me to wear sandals while driving to the bike trail.  I can pick things up off the ground while wearing them.  Not important for some people, but for me it is. The fact that it freaks my brother in law out that I can pick a quarter off the carpet with my toes even while wearing these is just a plus.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.32386822", "1": "0.19143167", "2": "0.08031462", "3": "0.110439755", "4": "0.09519206", "5": "0.119824275", "6": "0.0789294"}}
