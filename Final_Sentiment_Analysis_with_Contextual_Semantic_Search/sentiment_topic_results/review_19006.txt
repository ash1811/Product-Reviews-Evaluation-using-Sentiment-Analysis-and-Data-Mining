{"text": "I had no problems at all with shipping.  The item is very soft and forms around my sides nicely.  The straps are a bit smaller, but then again Im only an A cup.  It also has two clasps on the back instead of three.  I ordered the color pink, and it goes well with alot of my clothes.  For the price, I wold definetly recomend this item.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.28005004", "2": "0.12582551", "3": "0.14863747", "4": "0.22090213", "5": "0.061394908", "6": "0.15871689"}}
