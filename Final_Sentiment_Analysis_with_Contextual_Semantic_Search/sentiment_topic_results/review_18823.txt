{"text": "I have a special weakness for Wenger watch since I already have one and am very happy with it. Hence when I came to know about this latest version of leather military watch from Wenger, I couldn't resist taking a look at it. I am extremely pleased with my new purchase. The brown colored leather strap design is really elegant and feels comfortable on my skin. The mineral crystal ensures better durability and the magnified date display helps in clear viewing. The watch is water resistant and comes with three-year manufacturer's limited warranty. I opted for the round shape. The 72900 series guarantees precise and high quality Swiss-quartz movement so that you are never late for any appointment.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20342319", "1": "0.16814928", "2": "0.2590675", "3": "0.14342798", "4": "0.11629294", "5": "0.027650163", "6": "0.08198896"}}
