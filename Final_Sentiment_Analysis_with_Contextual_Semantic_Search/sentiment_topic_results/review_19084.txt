{"text": "This ring looks far nicer than its picture!  It is shinier than the picture.  It is very well made and the CZ stones are sparkly without looking tacky.  Each of the three rings is not too thick so they roll over each other easily without too much bulk.  You do not need to order a larger size due to the overlapping rings making it smaller, the manufacturer already factored that into the sizing.  You should just order whatever size you normally wear.  This is a great everyday ring that you can wear without worrying about losing it.  The seller was very fast in shipping my order.  I received it less than a week after ordering.  I highly recommend this ring.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16255912", "1": "0.35621536", "3": "0.2133718", "4": "0.09748633", "5": "0.06306396", "6": "0.10494572"}}
