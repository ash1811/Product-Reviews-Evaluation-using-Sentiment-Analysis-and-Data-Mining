{"text": "I WEAR A SIZE 7 AND ORDERED A WHOLE SIZE LARGER BASED ON THE REVIEWS.  WHEN YOU FIRST PUT THIS SHOE ON IT IS VERY TIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOOT- HAD TO USE A SHOE HORN BUT ONCE I GOT IT ON IT WAS VERY COMFORTABLE.  HOWEVER, AFTER 2 ZUMBA SESSIONS, IT LOOSENED UP CONSIDERABLY AND I NOW WISH I HAD ORDERED JUST A HALF SIZE LARGER.  THAT BEING SAID, IT'S A GREAT SHOE BUT IT COULD USE MORE ARCH SUPPORT SO I WILL USE AN INSERT WHICH WILL ALSO TIGHTEN IT UP.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1175041", "1": "0.19966689", "2": "0.1780667", "3": "0.30125192", "4": "0.14949146", "6": "0.05075161"}}
