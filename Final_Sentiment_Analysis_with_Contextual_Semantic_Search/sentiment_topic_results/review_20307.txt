{"text": "I did not buy my pair on amazon but mine are amazing. I have had mine for a few months now and I love them. I got the gargoyle and jade ones and I have to say the picture on here makes them look much darker then the pair I have. Unlike most of the reviews I have seen for these shoes I did not feel like they were comfortable right out of the box however after breaking them in I think they are very comfortable. My job requires a lot of walking around in the woods and in wetlands. I can walk around in the wetlands pretty well without getting my feet very wet unless the water goes over the top of the boot. I have noticed that a little bit of water does seem to seep into the shoe through the mesh, however it takes a while for this to happen and you would need to be standing in the water pretty consistently. Overall however I do think these shoes do a very good job at keeping my feet dry even when walking around in wetlands as long as I do not fully submerge my boots. Also these boots do a good job with not making my feet feel to hot. Definitely a good buy. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good hiking boot.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.110312305", "1": "0.332776", "2": "0.13900894", "3": "0.12469291", "4": "0.2225377", "6": "0.06801879"}}
