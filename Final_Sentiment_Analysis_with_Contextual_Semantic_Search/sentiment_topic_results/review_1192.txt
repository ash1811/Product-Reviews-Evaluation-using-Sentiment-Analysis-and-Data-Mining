{"text": "There aren't many options for inexpensive cotton bikinis that let you pick the color range you want. So I decided to take a chance on these despite some of the complaints about the smell, since some of those reviews were older. These bikinis did arrive with a very strong baby powder smell. I couldn't stand to wear them until they had been washed 6-7 times. However, after repeated washings, the scent is nearly gone. Now they are very practical and comfortable.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12373691", "1": "0.29039747", "2": "0.20704135", "3": "0.16029887", "4": "0.10164141", "5": "0.058338575", "6": "0.05854543"}}
