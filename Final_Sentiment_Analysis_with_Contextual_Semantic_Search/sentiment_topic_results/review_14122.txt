{"text": "Great product to buy, its simple and i have been wearing it ever since i got it to get it used to my ankle. The anklet is really thin and i thought with at least one good tough pull that it would break and fall off. So far it hasnt (and i tested it with a few accidents myself), showing its remarkable sturdiness or whatever its called xS. I also appreciate the fast shipping, a great anklet to buy!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.05712359", "1": "0.28585142", "2": "0.12294376", "3": "0.10407153", "4": "0.1932468", "5": "0.06809479", "6": "0.16866809"}}
