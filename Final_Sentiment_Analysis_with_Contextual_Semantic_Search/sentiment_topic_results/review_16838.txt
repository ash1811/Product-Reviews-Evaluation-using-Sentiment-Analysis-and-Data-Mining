{"text": "At my age, I do believe I am getting \"wiser\", I turned 57 this past January, and I needed a new pair of comfortable work/casual shoes, so I was watching several brands and styles, having purchase a pair of Deer Stags about two years ago and are in still in very good condition I came across this shoe.  I noticed there were limited quantities in my size (10M), but there also was a \"used\" pair in stock. The box (packaging) was damaged but the shoes were perfect!  I paid over half price, and I think now I would have paid 3 times the price, as these shoes are strong, sold and so comfortable.  You know the saying \"walking on a cloud\", well it fits! These shoes are wonderful, maybe that's why they only have a few left in my size??  Ya think? Buy a pair and prove me wrong!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.101839356", "1": "0.26450452", "2": "0.14028879", "3": "0.21862312", "4": "0.20965013", "6": "0.06278338"}}
