{"text": "It is well made and is relatively cute, although in order to find a cup size that would fit I bought the XL which makes the back of the bra travel high on my back.  I am wearing a 36DD right now, but am afraid the Large would not have given me enough coverage.  I like though that everything stays in place while I sleep and it feels like I'm wearing nothing.  I also have bought the Lamaze sleeping bra which I also like and it fits better and actually is cuter while wearing, but things pop out while you're sleeping, so I haven't found the &#34;perfect&#34; sleeping bra yet.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05992258", "1": "0.24628776", "2": "0.10148042", "3": "0.33626837", "4": "0.089108855", "6": "0.16457808"}}
