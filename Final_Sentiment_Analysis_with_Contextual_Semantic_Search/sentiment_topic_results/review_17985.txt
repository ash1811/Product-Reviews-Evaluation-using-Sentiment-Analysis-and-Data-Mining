{"text": "I have had this watch for @ 2 months now.  I say for under 20 dollars it's a pretty good watch. It has kept perfect time over 2 months. It is lightweight and the band is very comfortable.  I like having the analog hands and being able to display the digital date/time.Now in no way do I expect this watch to be anywhere near the quality of my Citizens Chronograph, my Invicta Diver or my Swiss Army Officers watch. The Casio is a watch I bought for bumming around.On the negative side, the light does not do a very good job of illumination.  Additionally, setting the time is really cumbersome. Setting the anaog time is not too bad, but setting the digital date and time is really a pain. Keep the instructions handy, you will need it when you have to change the time.All in all, for @ 15 dollars, it is a nice decent watch. A good value purchase", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16351968", "1": "0.16289604", "2": "0.15336101", "3": "0.09620752", "4": "0.052081075", "5": "0.1398013", "6": "0.2321334"}}
