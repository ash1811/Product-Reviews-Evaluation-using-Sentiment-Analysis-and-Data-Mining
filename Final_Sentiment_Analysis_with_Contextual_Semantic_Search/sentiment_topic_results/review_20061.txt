{"text": "I love love love this back pack! I have back issues and the padded straps and back are very comfortable. I also like that you can adjust how far out the pockets hang with the side straps.  My only issue is trying to fit a laptop a binder and a big plastic container for lunch into the backpack without the zippers being ready to burst.  Its definitely me trying to put too much into it though and not the make of it.  It's super cute and well made at an awesome price! I love it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.34654647", "2": "0.20319799", "3": "0.0879118", "4": "0.1945933", "5": "0.13381617", "6": "0.031011507"}}
