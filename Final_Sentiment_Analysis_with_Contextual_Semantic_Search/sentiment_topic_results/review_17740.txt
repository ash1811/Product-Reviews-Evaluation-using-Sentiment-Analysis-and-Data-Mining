{"text": "Like someone else said - this is a 5-star watch at a 1-star price. I'm very pleased with it. Everything I need and nothing I don't need. Hey, it even has instructions that are understandable!!On a side note - after many years, we still can't figure out my wife's digital watch - incomprehensible instructions. That's what I wanted to avoid with this purchase. I also wanted to avoid the larger G-shock models - they have a lot that are too bulbous for my wrist. This design is one of the smaller ones - I wouldn't purchase anything bigger.Alarms? I only need one. Readability - I need good contrast so it's easy to read. And, Indestructible! For $40? I love this watch and highly recommend.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07532112", "1": "0.17056604", "2": "0.18168114", "3": "0.1368421", "4": "0.13411893", "5": "0.13991863", "6": "0.16155201"}}
