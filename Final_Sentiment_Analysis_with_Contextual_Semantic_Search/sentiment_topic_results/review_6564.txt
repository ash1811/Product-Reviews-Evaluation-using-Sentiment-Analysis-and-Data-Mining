{"text": "This sock is actually my favorite and I have many pair. They're very well padded (by the way they have knit the sock).  This padding is great for protecting your feet.  But because it is so thick it actually adds enough width and length to your foot that you should have this sock on before buying the shoes you plan to wear with it.  Also, because it is so thick, my feet tend to sweat more than normal (the sock is hot even without shoes on), and though the sock is advertised as wicking, it doesn't wick very well.  Do wash them inside out (as directed) because if you don't the padding matts down and you get balls of fluff that will fall out once you do turn your socks inside out.  I find that the first place on the sock that wears out and gets a hole is on the center ball of the foot.  Never had any problems with any other location on the sock wearing out - just the ball, maybe because that's where most of the pivoting of the foot occurs?  When the sock is new, once it has been washed a few times, it gets sort of a light fuzz look on the outside probably from the small fibers that help make up the padding.  As time and wear goes on, those fibers disappear and the sock becomes more smooth on the outside (of course the inside is also being affected over time).  I find also that the socks have a tendency after enough time to turn slightly creamy (a faint yellowish tint), though I wash my socks with white clothes only, I do not bleach, and if I've been going stocking-footed (no shoes), I will use a stain remover to remove the dirt stains on the sole of the sock.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14992872", "1": "0.08288481", "2": "0.1263116", "3": "0.03106243", "4": "0.2275999", "5": "0.36444435", "6": "0.017768191"}}
