{"text": "I needed a watch for a beach vacation that would be durable enough to wear in the water, cheap enough so I wouldn't worry about it, and attractive enough to wear all the time. This watch is perfect for my needs. It's shock resistant (of course!), waterproof and inexpensive.I set the time in just a few seconds after I unwrapped it. It's easy to set. The alarm function should be useful for traveling.The numbers that indicate time are smallish. The dial is normally sized for a modern watch but the numbers for date and time take up only a small portion of the available room. Instead, Casio, oddly, places a revolving second wheel and a seconds indication bar in the middle of the dial. I took my glasses off and the time was still large enough to be legible, so I'm pleased.The button that lights up the display is large and placed at the bottom center of the watch. This is good because you would normally be using this at night.The watch is not large enough to get in the way, but it is thick. It feels as if it extends about a half inch above your wrist.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.056855656", "1": "0.27367377", "2": "0.27624774", "3": "0.080442324", "4": "0.0794907", "5": "0.10062719", "6": "0.13266256"}}
