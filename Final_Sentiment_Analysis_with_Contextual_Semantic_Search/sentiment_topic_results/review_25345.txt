{"text": "I'm one of those unfortunate souls who runs between a medium and a large.  I purchased the medium and it fits great everywhere, except for being a bit small across the shoulders.  This isn't a problem, just an observation.  I expected the coat to be a medium brown, but it's a very dark brown.  Again, not a problem, just an observation.Having never owned an oilskin coat, I halfway expected it to leak a bit.  I was outside for hours in medium to heavy rain, and didn't get wet.  By way of comparison, my jeans were soaked from mid-calf to the ankle.When standing around doing nothing, I was a bit cool, but I tend to get cold easily.  Once I got moving, I was more than warm enough.  I expect to be cold come fall/winter though, so I bought the 2008 wool button-in liner.  (The liner will be plenty warm, but I cut off the collar, because it's huge!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.42820206", "3": "0.14861573", "4": "0.1916072", "5": "0.08806979", "6": "0.13873394"}}
