{"text": "I just bought this vest in black from a local store today. Took the tags off and threw it in the wash, as I do with most new garments (and especially Carhartt stuff, which always needs breaking-in).When I took it out of the dryer, the inner lining had already started to disintegrate in one spot, with the insulating material showing through.I don't know if I got a faulty product or what, but I expect my workwear to hold up to a lot worse than a single wash. It's going back to the store tomorrow. This is my first disappointment from Carhartt.[Edit] I exchanged the black one for the Carhartt brown one. The brown one has been great, no problems with wear and tear. Hopefully the problem I had with the black one was just an isolated issue.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1657817", "1": "0.20238928", "2": "0.23737575", "3": "0.11496486", "4": "0.03329816", "5": "0.15438269", "6": "0.09180753"}}
