{"text": "These shorts are heavy duty and feels like it will last for a long time.  The navy color is deep and is almost black.  The waistband has 3 layered stitches with a thick drawstring.  The strength of the band can be felt as it is stretched.  The drawstring is looped and is not the shoestring end type, so there's no need to worry about losing the ends inside the waist.  I have a 30 waist and went with the medium size, it fits comfortably without needing to pull on the drawstring and the length goes down to the knees.  The pockets are deep enough for keys, wallets, and phones.  Basically, the Soffe shorts use heavy cotton material and is well worth it.I can only speak for the navy color since I read from another reviewer that the other colors may have different quality.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11655159", "1": "0.22316037", "2": "0.16716738", "3": "0.101881295", "4": "0.09139819", "5": "0.06893663", "6": "0.23090456"}}
