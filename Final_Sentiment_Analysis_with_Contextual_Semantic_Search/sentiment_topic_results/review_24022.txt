{"text": "I just opened these ... and they dont fit well.. I have small feet. Size 7-1/2 mens but these are supposed to be for mens 6- 12. Further either there is extra material at the toe. but they are tight fitting around the foot... Low price, but I wouldnt buy them again  - Made in El Salvadorbeen wearing these and hour and just downgraded rating to 1 star .. socks are rolling around my feet inside my shoes just walking around the house... Spend a few more bucks and get a quality made USA sock.  Wish I returned these.. wont buy cheap againUpdate after z couple hours the excess material at the toe is bunching up under my toes.
