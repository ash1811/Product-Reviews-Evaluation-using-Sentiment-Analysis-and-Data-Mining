{"text": "Great watch with many great features. I love the size of the digital layout and the metal band is durable. To resize the band, push out the pins from the side that looks like screws.Pros: Accurate, good looking, multiple alarms, timer, and stop-watch.Cons: Metal band latch sometimes deforms, making it hard to latch. You have to bend it a certain way to make it work. The analog hands sometimes get out of sync with the digital time. You can fix that easily, but annoying sometimes. Lastly, at night you can't use the watch features. There is a light, but it occupies a button used for setting alarms and such. So if you are setting your alarm, you can't see the display. Timex has a night feature that, once enabled, turns the light on with every button press. My former watch had it and it was a very handy feature.Great for the price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1722012", "1": "0.17445144", "2": "0.11827183", "3": "0.07664797", "4": "0.28399652", "6": "0.17235476"}}
