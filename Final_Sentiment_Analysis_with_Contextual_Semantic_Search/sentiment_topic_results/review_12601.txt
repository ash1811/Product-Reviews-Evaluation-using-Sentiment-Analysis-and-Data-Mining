{"text": "I love these shoes.  My sister and mom have them also.  So easy to slip into, yet they don't slip off when walking due to the lip that is in the back.  I throw these on at work, until it is time to put on the heels.  Great for walking, or running around the house as well.  LOVE these shows!Highly recommend!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20811023", "1": "0.094512895", "2": "0.10388331", "4": "0.10464221", "5": "0.3569461", "6": "0.12695006"}}
