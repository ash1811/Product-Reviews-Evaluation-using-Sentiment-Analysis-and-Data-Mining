{"text": "These are great looking boots. I wear 9 1/2 shoes.  Because of the reviews I decided to order the 9's. The length was fine. I have Plantar Fasciitis so I used inserts. I read reviews where people who wore medium width had to have the boots stretched. I thought since I wear a AA width they would work fine for me. I could hardly get my foot in the boot. They are VERY narrow. Since I have feet issues anyway I didn't want to pay the price for the boots, try to have them stretched and they still not fit properly so I decided to return them. Disappointing because I loved the looks of them and they looked well made.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.086849764", "1": "0.28288758", "2": "0.1255759", "3": "0.09750462", "4": "0.19527175", "5": "0.12568955", "6": "0.086220816"}}
