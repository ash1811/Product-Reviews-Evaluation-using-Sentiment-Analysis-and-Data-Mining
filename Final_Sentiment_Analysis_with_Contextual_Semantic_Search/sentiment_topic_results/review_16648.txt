{"text": "I like the watch, but certainly haven't drunk the G-Shock Kool-Aid like a lot of others. Unfortunately, the time is difficult to read in most lighting conditions. There also are a few other issues with the design, but I got used to them very quickly.1.  The watch face is a little \"busy\", meaning there's a lot of things going on when you're trying to read the time.2.  The digital read out is relatively difficult to read in variety of light, especially very bright light (like when you're driving) because the contrast is bad. The readout is best read in perfect, indoor, indirect light, which seldoms exists.  Also, the Hardlex crystal is very reflective, so there's a lot of glare in direct light.  Note that the photo in the product listing was taken under perfect lighting.3.  I would have preferred a G-Shock button on the front for the back-light in low-light conditions, instead of using one of the existing function buttons.4.  The sweeping digital second hand, which is the round thing on the left center of the watch, is almost useless.  It's too small and dim to read, even with the back-light.  There's another seconds indicator in the digital time, so the sweeping digital second hand isn't really necessary anyway.5.  It's difficult, but not impossible, to get the analog hands to match the digital time.  However, that won't last, and you'll need to set it each month.  Frankly, I don't care if the two times off by a minute or so, but I know a lot of people that do.6.  There's a lot of function button sequences to remember in order to set the times and also for the alarms.  Although this is my first G-Shock, I learned them very quickly.All in all, I like this watch, but would be hesitent to encourage someone else to buy one.  I also would suggest going to the GShock.com website first to look at all of the different possibilities.  Note that a lot of people are fans about G-Shock watches (as in \"fanatics\" who own 20 G-Shocks).  Keep that in mind when you are reading reviews.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10637654", "1": "0.22391695", "2": "0.11920606", "3": "0.21341237", "4": "0.07944793", "5": "0.054635946", "6": "0.20300423"}}
