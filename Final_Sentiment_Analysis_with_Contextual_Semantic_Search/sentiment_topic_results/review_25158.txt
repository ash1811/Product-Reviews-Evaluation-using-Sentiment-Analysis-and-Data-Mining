{"text": "I've always worn the underwires; the push-ups; all the va-voom bras but the underwires started killing me and I gave up all the pretty, sexy bras three years ago and went for comfort.However, I just can't seem to have my cake and eat it too when it comes to support, pretty, feminine look and also comfort.I heard they've improved the wires and would love to try but I am not a mall-gal or even a shopper period - I'm an online shopper and always have been.So, back to Amazon to see what I might find and this one seemed good. I got it the very next day! Wow. That's Prime at its best! Anyway..I can say that the underwire..so far anyway..doesn't poke me in the armpits..doesn't poke me between the breasts and so far doesn't constrict my breathing! Gee, those things are wonderful!I can say it is a pretty bra and fits nicely (true to size since I ordered online!) and does really flatter. It is sexy and feminine and looks good under my clothes.My only negative comments would be that I find it really itchy. There's a piece that is right above the cups that itches so much and rubs that it leaves red marks. Also, if I'm wearing a blouse and a blazer, it makes my straps slide down - the multi-layers seem to move the straps.December 2012 Update:I would actually rate this a 3.5 star and changed the review to reflect that. For the price, and the itchiness, it's really a little more than \"ok\".I have since ordered this bra, below, and I find the design and fit about comparable, but more comfortable, and certainly not itchy for a third of the price:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012N4VOA/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03696374", "1": "0.1333254", "2": "0.12218036", "3": "0.19975547", "4": "0.15117726", "5": "0.16491468", "6": "0.19168308"}}
