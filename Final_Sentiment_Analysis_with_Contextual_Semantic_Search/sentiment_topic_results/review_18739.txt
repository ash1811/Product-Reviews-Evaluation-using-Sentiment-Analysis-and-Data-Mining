{"text": "Let me preface my comments by saying at no time in the description did the seller state the earmuffs were adjustable.  And that is the problem.The ear pieces are super nice and warm, but the headband is not adjustable.  I am a small lady, and would like to adjust the head band so the muffs fit over my ears comfortably, but there is no way to do this.  The muffs were nice because there is a fabric cover for the plastic head piece.  But one size does not fit all, and it would have made the muffs feel ever so much better.  I would have even been glad to pay the extra few dollars for this feature.I can't attest to the warmth of the muffs because we've hit that January spell in Tennessee where we've had to turn on the A/C to keep comfortable.  I expect that will not last, and I'll be able to report back about the warmth of the fur.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.24936849", "2": "0.21561846", "3": "0.09344836", "4": "0.18168093", "5": "0.104349084", "6": "0.1531036"}}
