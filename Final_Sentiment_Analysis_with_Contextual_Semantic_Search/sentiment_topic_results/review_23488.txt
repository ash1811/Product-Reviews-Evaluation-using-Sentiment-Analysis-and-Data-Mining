{"text": "As one reviewer noted already, the pictures do not do this watch justice.  It is a very attractive watch.  It seems quite solid and was heavier than I expected.  I don't mean heavy in a bad way, but heavy as in well constructed and sturdy.  I have worn watches all my adult life as a professional, but this was the first watch people have noticed and complimented.  I should qualify this review by pointing out I am not a guy who would spend the money on a rolex or similar luxury watch, nor be qualified to pass judgment on the virtues of various luxury watches.  To me, the watch is quite appealing and elegant with the contrasting blue background and dial.  It also does have a second hand - I don't know why an earlier reviewer said it does not.  It also came in a beautiful, elegant box.  This watch would make a great gift unless the recipient is a watch enthusiast who is aware of and tracks the true luxury watches (Rolex, Tag, etc) that costs many times more than this watch.UPDATED MARCH 2009:I purchased this watch and absolutely loved it.  It was sturdy and handsome.  I received it in November 2008 and a few days ago (March 2009) heavy condensation started appearing under the crystal.  I have never done anything to the watch except wear it.  Although it is supposedly water proof to hundreds of feet underwater, I had never dived with it, although I did wear it in the shower.  I googled \"invicta watch water condensation\" and learned this is a frequent problem with Invicta watches. I thought \"hey, no problem\" I bought it at Amazon and have the free platinum warranty. Only problem is the confirmation post card from Invicta indicated you must pay a flat $20 \"shipping\" fee to get warranty service. That's on top of the $5-6 I will pay in shipping charges.  Since I purchased the watch at Amazon during a sale for $80, that amounts to 25% of the purchase price to obtain warranty service a few months after purchase. I wasn't expecting a Rolex here, but I don't find that kind of poor quality acceptable.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.022657428", "1": "0.1861282", "2": "0.25245506", "3": "0.045617588", "4": "0.11257793", "5": "0.20327954", "6": "0.17728424"}}
