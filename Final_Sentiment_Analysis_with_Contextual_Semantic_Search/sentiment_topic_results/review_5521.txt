{"text": "Good price for work out shirt (or very casual wear) but would not wear for anything else. Fabric is extremely thin (think cheap t-shirt) and VERY boxy-there is absolutely no definition between arm pit and hem (even the really cheap T shirts at discount stores usually have some curve in at the waist so you don't have ~8-10 inches of fabric bunched around your waist).  Sizes seem to run large (and a little long). I ordered what was supposed to be \"my\" size based on the size chart and it was baggy and too long to tuck in (the one I got hung ~4 inches down my thighs-and I don't have a petite torso), so if you want something more fitted, order a size down.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.02803215", "1": "0.29089114", "2": "0.24448076", "3": "0.24884853", "4": "0.059486784", "5": "0.12611997"}}
