{"text": "I bought these slippers in January 2014 and they are already trashed. When I first got them they were very comfortable and I was satisfied. Little by little, they got worse and worse. Now it feels like there is only a thin piece of material between my feet and the floor. They are also stretched out so they flop around a bit. I spend very little time at home and I never wear slippers outside. Very cheap slippers.I had faith in Isotoner and the quality of their product. Boy was I wrong. I am currently wearing the slippers that I thought were worn out, which is why I bought the Isotoners. If anyone out there knows of a slipper that will support my tired feet, please share the information.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13182129", "1": "0.23238447", "2": "0.1084695", "4": "0.13583569", "5": "0.1041041", "6": "0.2847735"}}
