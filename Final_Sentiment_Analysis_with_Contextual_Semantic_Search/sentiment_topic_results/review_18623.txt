{"text": "After reading many reviews, I decided to purchase this Rothco Shemagh in purple.There were none of the flaws other people reported.No loose threats, no offensive odor.It was made in India and I washed it twice. The color did not fade. It did not shrink.The measurements are 42x42.5The fabric is not too thin, not too thick and it feels soft.I am absolutely pleased with this scarf.I liked this Shemagh so much, I ordered another one.I just wanted to tell you the difference.My second Shemagh came from Army Universe for basically the same price.They had a color, black and silver, that Rothco did not have.The Army Universe Shemagh is made in Pakistan.There was no bad smell but a few loose threats.There were also some flaws in the pattern and the fabric was not woven as tight as the Rothco one. It was not as soft and it was smaller  38\" x 41.5\"Overall, the Rothco Shemagh looks better and feels better.Today, I have received my third Shemagh and now I can compare it with the regular Rothco and also one from Army Universe.This one is Foliage Green - which is  more a gray with a tint of green,  a very nice, camouflage color.It actually smelled nice but I washed it anyway, like all new clothes.I was surprised that the water stayed clean unlike the other two Shemaghs which I had to wash twice and rinse a few times.There were a few loose threats and minor mistakes in the pattern.It is supposed to be lightweight but I hardly noticed a difference.It is soft, like the other Shemagh from Rothco  andit is the largest of the three with 43\" x 43\"Overall the quality was like the Shemagh from Army Universe.I see very little difference in a Shemagh made in India or Pakistan.Being able to compare the three different fabrics, I came to the conclusion that I will buy my next Shemagh based on price and color", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11373735", "1": "0.47534004", "2": "0.10808147", "3": "0.060600873", "4": "0.204958", "5": "0.03504531"}}
