{"text": "This pouch is what it is, a two pocket unit you can put on a standard or tac belt for storing extra magazines and even whole boxes of ammo. I've carried two boxes of .40 in the large pouch and still had room if needed, while putting a LULA in the front pouch for speed loading magazines. It handled the weight without a problem. The clasps are simple to open giving quick, easy access to whatever you put inside. (I was able to stuff it full of small gear for a brief hike, with binoculars in the large pouch and assorted other small junk like chewing gum a pocket knife, compass etc in the smaller one and again still had room for more stuff if I wanted to.).  The material is canvas which should hold up to the rigors I plan for it. A bit of parafin wax, should help make it water resistant for hunting this fall/winter.I bought one each, for my black tac belts' and one for my woodland camo hunting belt and would buy more if I needed more. I was able to stuff it full of shotgun shells for skeet shooting as well as using it as a magazine pouch for a Ruger 22/10. I could see quite a number of other uses for hikes etc in state parks and the like, and will no doubt bring one along when we do this soon. All around pleased!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18761724", "1": "0.18278223", "2": "0.08030081", "3": "0.1540517", "4": "0.16443816", "5": "0.086734734", "6": "0.14407513"}}
