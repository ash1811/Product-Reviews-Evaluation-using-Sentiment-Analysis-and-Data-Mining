{"text": "I normally wear size 7, and I have wide feet (D).  I ordered this style (Sandy Flip Flop) specifically, because many reviewers have mentioned these flip flips are wider than other styles from Reef.  It turned out to be very true - they are wide enough that my little toe rest comfortably on the rubber sole instead of hanging out.  The stretchy straps also make them more comfortable to wear.  However, I do find out after a short walk to the gym, the straps still hurt my feet and left red marks as some of the rubber straps did to my feet.  That was disappointing.The most unforgivable thing about these flip flops is the sizing problem.  The sole is indeed the size that I ordered, but because these straps are pushing my feet to the back, both my heels do not rest entirely on the sole, instead, they hang outside of the sole about 1/2 inch.  The improper fit also causes pain at my achilles tendons.  I would definitely recommend to order at least one size larger.  I am not the only one who complains about the incorrect sizing.  Later on I found numerous reviews, based on this and other Reef flip flops, point out the same problem - they are really one size too small.  Anyway, I am not that impressed with these flip flops, as they are neither comfortable or visually appealing.  Won't buy them again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.035062823", "1": "0.3469677", "2": "0.20729561", "3": "0.09766419", "4": "0.10170267", "5": "0.07236215", "6": "0.13894486"}}
