{"text": "Ordered this to wear with a medallion so that I can layer it with shorter pieces. The chain is a nice length and the medallion sits right in the middle of my chest. I've had it for over a month and have had no issues with tarnishing- still just as shiny as the day that it arrived and also doesn't tangle or kink up like cheaper chains. I recommend this one.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.3151494", "1": "0.124119274", "3": "0.14474268", "4": "0.17248209", "5": "0.101124614", "6": "0.13775754"}}
