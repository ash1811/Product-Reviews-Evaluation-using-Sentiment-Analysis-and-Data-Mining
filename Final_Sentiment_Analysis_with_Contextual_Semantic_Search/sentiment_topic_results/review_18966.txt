{"text": "The 514 is my favorite Levi's cut and price can't be beat! These are very decent jeans for the price. I've spend hundreds of dollars on expensive jeans such as Diesel, but for the money, I still wear Levi's as well and have to say I look just as good.I'm slender and they fit me quite well and don't look super skinny or anything, they just look like they fit me very well. I have about 3 different pairs of these however I feel they have too many washes to choose from.Some of the lighter washes are a bit similar so it can be confusing to choose, especially when ordering online. If they had about 5 washes total, I believe that would be enough.My favorite ones are the Tumbled Rigid, which are very dark and almost 'raw' like they just came out of the factory or something. I also like the Indigo wash which is like a good old pair of jeans that you have had for years. Some of the other washes with fancy names are too light for my liking, or they just don't look that good to me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.034901746", "1": "0.33761248", "2": "0.07997517", "3": "0.13772966", "4": "0.12757672", "5": "0.15072021", "6": "0.13148399"}}
