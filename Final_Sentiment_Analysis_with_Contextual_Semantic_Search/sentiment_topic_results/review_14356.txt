{"text": "I have several pairs of dark blue leather shoes and the toes and heels get scraped up leaving a whitish color underneath.  I couldn't find this polish at Wallmart, Kmart or Target so I just decided to order it.  It cost more because of shipping (though it says it ships for free if you buy 25 dollars worth of stuff, you still pay for the shipping because of the cost of the polish).  Anyway, I first used it on my favorite pair of dark blue leather boots and the polish covered the scratches adequately but not completely.  I could still see them lurking under the polish even after 2 coats but still, they look a LOT better than before the polish.  And since some of my dark blue shoes are of differing shades of dark blue, the polish blended in just fine with all of them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21340667", "1": "0.23982796", "2": "0.10739602", "3": "0.08969588", "4": "0.16783954", "6": "0.17961788"}}
