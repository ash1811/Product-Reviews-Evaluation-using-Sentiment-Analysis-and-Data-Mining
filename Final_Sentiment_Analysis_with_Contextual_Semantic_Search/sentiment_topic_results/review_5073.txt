{"text": "I've had Birkenstocks off and on for years and years.  While wearing &#34;sandals&#34; with both feet suffering from Plantar Fasciitis isn't the best option, I've found that Birkenstocks are just about the only sandal I CAN wear when my feet &#34;flare up&#34; --  they still hurt badly at the end of the day, but less so than with my Orthoheel's  and also less than my tennis shoes.  In winter, I just put them on with crazy socks and voila!!  I'm good to go :)  Extremely fast shipping.  Very satisfied with my purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24747619", "1": "0.10237205", "2": "0.04052987", "3": "0.15941313", "4": "0.22930709", "5": "0.10989363", "6": "0.11100805"}}
