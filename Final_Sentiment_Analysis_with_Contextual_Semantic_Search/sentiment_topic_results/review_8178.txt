{"text": "This is the MOST comfortable purse I've ever had in my life.The inside of it has a little hook to hang keys so they don't get lost in the bottom.  It has a zippered compartment on the outside and another zippered compartment on the inside.I frequently go to the gym and use the little pocket at the top for sun glasses, a water bottle, or my cell phone.  About the only improvement I'd like to see is to have velcro close that little pocket if it holds a cell phone.It's formal enough for work, casual enough for informal activity and very practical.  I often love to draw, and this holds my various art supplies in addition to my wallet.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.020492045", "1": "0.1491897", "2": "0.23708436", "3": "0.2840085", "4": "0.111366875", "5": "0.069395274", "6": "0.12846324"}}
