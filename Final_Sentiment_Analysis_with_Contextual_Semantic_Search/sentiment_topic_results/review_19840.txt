{"text": "Just short of two years and suddenly this watch has little water droplets inside the dial. It worked great until now. I used to swim with it on for a year. Yesterday I went for a regular swim and ended up with water inside the dial. Can't see the time on it anymore. Too bad :-(Update: I opened the watch (thanks to 4 tiny screws on the back panel and only 3 convenient components inside), wiped the water off, greased the rubber o-ring with chapstick and put it back together. Good as new!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18337876", "1": "0.20031053", "2": "0.14256692", "3": "0.0684306", "4": "0.25950676", "5": "0.03229017", "6": "0.11351626"}}
