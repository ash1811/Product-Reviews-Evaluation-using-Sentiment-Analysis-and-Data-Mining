{"text": "They are high quality and comfortable. I like the camouflage print,it doesn't show dirt. I also appreciate the drawstring tie on the top side of slipper, it allows me to adjust shoe size for when I'm wearing socks or have swollen feet. I have to let big dogs out frequently and its nice to have slippers that can go outside without ruining them. I like them better than any other slipper I have purchased. I bought size 15 for my brother and I am excited to give him this great present.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.37069732", "2": "0.13729973", "3": "0.17800453", "4": "0.041863155", "5": "0.045684766", "6": "0.22346358"}}
