{"text": "I had worn Thorlo socks 10+ years ago and then somehow had forgotten about them. I'm so happy I stumbled across them again. I had forgotten that Thorlo is all about cushioning, comfort, fit and wearing the correct sock for a specific activity. My feet are much happier in Thorlo socks. I'm throwing away my other crew socks and am just going to wear Thorlos. To keep the socks in good shape, read the small print about how to correctly launder them! Thorlo socks are worth every penny spent on them!!!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.058220334", "1": "0.16728416", "2": "0.087071456", "3": "0.14171687", "4": "0.06972573", "5": "0.21725616", "6": "0.2587253"}}
