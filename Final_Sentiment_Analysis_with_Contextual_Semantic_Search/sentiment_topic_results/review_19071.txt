{"text": "First off, the fabric is extremely delicate. Imagine putting extremely delicate hose all over your body. There is no substance to it. The fabric puckers when you pull on it to put it on. You have to be so careful not to tear it. It catches in everything. It is not really scalloped in the center above the tummy the way the photo suggests. The bottom is completely straight when worn. It is so large. I wear a 6-7 and I'm 5'6\". It's like wearing a garter dress. It comes halfway down my bottom and looks very awkward. You can't adjust the garters on it. I can't create the scallop above the tummy by tightening the garters. It just looks frumpy. The actual garter clips come almost down to my knees. The stockings are made of the same material. The band at the top gives my thighs that gross \"muffin thigh\" look. I don't have very large thighs, either. I think this outfit would be good for someone who is quite tall and a size 6 or a little larger. A slightly shorter plus size woman (size 14) might also pull this off. The fabric is super stretchy, and I think that some of the length would be compensated for by the larger waist line. If you are thin and petite, don't waste your time. The concept is very sexy, however, the one size fits all aspect makes it difficult to know if it will actually fit.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1491795", "1": "0.095588006", "2": "0.11337373", "3": "0.18679601", "5": "0.3214717", "6": "0.13119358"}}
