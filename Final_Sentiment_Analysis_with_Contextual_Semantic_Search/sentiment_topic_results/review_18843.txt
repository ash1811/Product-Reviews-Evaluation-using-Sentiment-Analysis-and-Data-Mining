{"text": "I bought this item in two different colors, but in the exact same size. The first pair fits fine. The second pair was too small in the crochal region. The waist is too small, and the distance between the waist and the, uh, you know, THAT, the distance is too small. So the part of the pants where the two legs begin to separate is high, causing my twig and giggleberries to rest on it. So it's either walk around with that all day or it's &#34;pick a pant, put your junk in that pant&#34;. I end up looking like the cover of the Sticky Fingers album by the Rolling Stones.Otherwise, I guess the quality of the material is good, and I'm satisfied with the pair that actually fits.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.32525137", "2": "0.15302092", "3": "0.04198845", "4": "0.122797385", "5": "0.083984345", "6": "0.2706109"}}
