{"text": "Received this product a few weeks ago.  Used it several times already.  Its a compact umbrellas that folds up small.  Strong spring-loaded automatic opener and closer.  The wind vents are very useful so the umbrella can withstand normal windy, rainy weather.  Quality construction is better than average as the &#34;spokes&#34; are thicker than the typical compact umbrella spokes that bend/break.  Highly recommend.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16818848", "1": "0.060946546", "2": "0.15006073", "3": "0.14798906", "4": "0.13123655", "5": "0.20591569", "6": "0.13566296"}}
