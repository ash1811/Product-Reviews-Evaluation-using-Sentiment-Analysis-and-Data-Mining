{"text": "I pretty much wear one brand of jeans and style of jeans 527s, but I keep thinking they don't last as long as they use to; looking at 3 generations of 527s I have found that they are much lighter denim now than they were a couple years ago for the same price.  They are still comfortable and a great fit but they really aren't as heavy, so they wear out much more quickly.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.044159893", "1": "0.4961675", "2": "0.15999989", "3": "0.10094774", "5": "0.12251647", "6": "0.07232525"}}
