{"text": "Owning 2 other pair of Keene Newports, I was pretty sure of my choice! Ordered a half size up on advice of online raters as they are water shoes and I do wear my Thorlos in them a great deal of the time. The only difference in feel from my Newport H2s is that the leather grabs the socks a bit on foot entry as opposed to the nylon straps. I expect the leather will smooth and leaving the laces in loosened position helps too. Support and looks are great as well.  My 3 season (and work)  shoes are great!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24556", "1": "0.2208731", "2": "0.2050186", "3": "0.1321942", "5": "0.14434369", "6": "0.049357004"}}
