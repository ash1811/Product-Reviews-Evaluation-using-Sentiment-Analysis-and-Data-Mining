{"text": "I bought two pairs and after 18 months, I have noticed that the soles on both pairs have disintegrated. The sole turns to a tacky rubber.  It is a chemical reaction.  At first I thought that I may have stepped into some acid, but after reading many reviews, I knew that it is a problem caused by manufacture ECCO.

Never again.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.089083485", "1": "0.21023673", "2": "0.114766575", "3": "0.11388672", "4": "0.22797838", "5": "0.10385333", "6": "0.14019479"}}
