{"text": "I bought this when I was 20 weeks pregnant and started having horrible round ligament pain and pelvic pressure. This helped take the weight off some. I liked that it was thinner than the belly bands I already owned, though those worked well, too.I agree with previous criticisms regarding the sizing. I bought a medium instead of a small based on manufacturer's recommendations. The belt was a little loose at 20 weeks, but at 22 weeks is working fine. I think maybe buying the small and the medium might be a good option for some. They are cheap enough that you could do that.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13116273", "1": "0.20227341", "2": "0.18891205", "3": "0.23550968", "4": "0.123319335", "5": "0.116436355"}}
