{"text": "The jeans are very nice, upscale. I like a bit on the upscale side. I never know about ordering the right size of pants on line, but the regular 42 would have been fine. Recommend if you wear a 40-42 in this relaxed size that you order a 40. You will be happier and others can gauge my assessment. I am giving this 4 stars because part of this is my own problem. I find ordering from Amazon - generally in tools and etc, that I get more variety and choices. Take a look at my other reviews. Hope this helps.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2391906", "1": "0.34440595", "2": "0.10310857", "4": "0.10958087", "6": "0.19785455"}}
