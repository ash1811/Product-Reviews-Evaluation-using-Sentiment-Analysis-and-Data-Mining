{"text": "This watch has the simple to use and set alarm my 24 year old nephew requested for the watch he needs while attending Law School. Considering his past treatment of watches I knew it needed to be an inexpensive watch since he usually loses them.  I was delighted that it looked to be of good quality and had an attractive but understated design. After already thanking me for the watch and wearing it out the house Christmas Eve my nephew has skyped to me that he is getting a lot of use out the watch and is utiliziing the alarms on a regular basis.  He offerred that information up out of the clear blue without me asking him so he must be impressed with it. He ordinarily never contacts me! Hopefully he is learning the true value of a thing is not what it costs or how flashy it may be. Just maybe because it is so useful he won't lose this one! Actually there is no reason to take it off since it is water resistant even if it goes into the water. I got another one for my other nephew who I noticed wears it. He is in his last year high school so you know it has to be considered at least sorta cool looking.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18329066", "1": "0.1529202", "2": "0.24901249", "3": "0.15038136", "4": "0.052420538", "5": "0.09777138", "6": "0.11420339"}}
