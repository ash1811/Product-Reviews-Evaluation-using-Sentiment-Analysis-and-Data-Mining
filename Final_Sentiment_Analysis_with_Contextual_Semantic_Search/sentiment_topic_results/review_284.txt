{"text": "First of all, order a size LARGER than you would normally.  China's idea of waist size is not the same as Western even though their &#34;chart&#34; lists them as such: if you're 38-42 in waist, get the x-large, the &#34;large&#34; (supposedly fits up to 39&#34;) won't work.  Heck, I'd be surprised if a 36&#34; waist would fit in the &#34;large&#34;: 38 does NOT.Second of all, as with all of these Rothco garments, make sure to go over them - inside AND out - for ropes (loose threads).  Before wearing or washing, burn all the ropes you find outside AND inside to prevent unraveling later or in the wash.  Make sure to check inside the pockets as well.  Oh, yeah.  You should also take the time out to use a needle and thread to re-enforce the buttons all around the shorts: they don't use enough thread for a solid hold.The &#34;normal&#34; front pockets are deep enough but a bit small.  I have only average size hands - not small, not large - but I have to sort of fold my hands to reach in to them to pull stuff out.  They're not bad, just another little thing.  The &#34;drawstrings&#34; are not all that useful, they don't really allow you to tighten anything.  And, I'm not going to apply great pressure on them to see if that loosens them up enough to work.All the above said, I really like the garments once I give them the going over.  They ARE durable and great for utility and everyday wear.  I've got several of Rothco's &#34;para&#34; style pants that I love.  And, they've held up well over the winter.  These shorts are NOT sized the same as those pants, but I've done my best to give you an idea how to order on the size issue.  The leg length IS to my knees, in the style all the kids seem to favor for longer &#34;shorts&#34; length.  Again, if you follow the care I've outlined above, these will be some pretty durable shorts for spring/summer.The reason for 3 instead of 4 stars are two reasons: first, the size issue.  They really should adjust their &#34;size chart&#34; on the item to reflect reality instead of wishful thinking.  They would prevent a lot of shipping costs, on their part, when you have to send them back because their chart is misrepresenting the product.  My second reason for 3 instead of 4 stars is PRICE.  You can get Wrangler, or Faded Glory cargo shorts for $7-$10 less, and they're a lot less hassle before wearing them.  How many they'll sell at this $26-$27 price, I don't know.  But, they'd sell more if they were more competitive.  For me, I like this style enough to shell out the extra (buttons all around, reinforced seating and pockets) for one - MAYBE two - set.  But, I can see where most people would not want to shell out that kind of cost.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09487463", "1": "0.19245976", "2": "0.22497608", "3": "0.14449105", "5": "0.24991654", "6": "0.09110879"}}
