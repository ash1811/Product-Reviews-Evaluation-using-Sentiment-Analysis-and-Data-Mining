{"text": "I would give this coat 5 stars had it been manufactured in the U.S.. I think its made in Mexico. As far as the quality its typical Carhartt. Fit, finish & design are excellent.I like the double zipper for convenience in accessing my pockets, * eliminates the occasional binding below the waist. I also like the color. Canopa did a good job in shipping this item.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03525012", "1": "0.36996403", "2": "0.2368335", "3": "0.086760655", "4": "0.12459783", "6": "0.14272544"}}
