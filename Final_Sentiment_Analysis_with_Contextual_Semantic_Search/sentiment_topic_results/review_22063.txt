{"text": "I've been searching for fingerless gloves to wear at work while typing, using a mouse, and writing as my hands get really cold. These gloves just didn't quite do it for me.The fit is strange. I have small hands, and ordered a small. They go to past the second knuckle on me, and the thick nature of the weave did not make typing comfortable. Also, the fit was really baggy, and bunched at the palm when curling my hand such as when using a mouse. This proved to be uncomfortable. The wrist on mine was not as pictured. It had an elastic \"waist\" of sorts where it was somewhat tight in the middle, and immediately loose above and below so the wrist part itself was flared and not fitted at all. Strange to say the least. In addition, this \"waist\" of elastic at the wrist was too low and kept pulling down on the heel of me hand. Very strange and REALLY uncomfortable. I've never had fingerless gloves of this style fit like this before! I will NEVER actually wear these they were that uncomfortable. They are a little scratchy as they are wool, but I wear wool sweaters and socks and it doesn't bother me at all.On the plus side, they are warm, they are wool, and they are inexpensive.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15551868", "1": "0.3034019", "2": "0.16068876", "3": "0.27172917", "4": "0.051528495", "5": "0.054666758"}}
