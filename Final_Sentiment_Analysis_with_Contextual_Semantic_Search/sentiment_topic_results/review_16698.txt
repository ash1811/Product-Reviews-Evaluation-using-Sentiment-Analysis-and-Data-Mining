{"text": "I'm a big boot fan, and I love these!! After a couple years of heavy use they're still holding together. They are showing some wear, but they still look and fit well enough to continue wearing. Super comfortable. They are pretty true to size. I usually wear a 7 or 7.5, and i ordered a 7 but a 7.5 probably would've fit just a tad better. I kept them though a end they were just fine. I HIGHLY recommend these!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17511831", "1": "0.49342754", "4": "0.23100598", "6": "0.09146852"}}
