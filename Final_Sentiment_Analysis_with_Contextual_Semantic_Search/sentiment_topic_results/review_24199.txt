{"text": "I ordered this in a 40D. I had the same 2 bras for five years, definitely time to start researching the next favorite sports bra. I like that this is over the shoulder as having any straps too close to my neck or crossing over my shoulders gets a little annoying. At first I thought it was too tight. I had it on the tightest hooks and the longest straps (I am 5'9&#34; so long enough straps is often a problem). Then I went to the middle hooks and took up the straps a tiny bit and that was much better. In other words- play around with adjusting it to find a good fit. This is a 4/5 for no-bounce factor. It is not lock-em-down, but it is great- I have been running 2+ miles, 2+ times a week and always reach for this sports bra. It softens over wearing and wash too.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11986257", "1": "0.16545825", "2": "0.16474494", "3": "0.16881019", "4": "0.07763572", "5": "0.11770307", "6": "0.18578526"}}
