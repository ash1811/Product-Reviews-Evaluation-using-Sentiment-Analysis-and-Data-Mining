{"text": "The pendant itself is gorgeous! (I'm actually thinking of ordering the matching earrings because of the beauty of the pendant.) That alone is worth the $29.99 I paid for it. The necklace is not nearly long enough and is fairly thin, making me think every time I wear it that it's going break when my hair gets caught on it.  Overall, I think the pendant itself is worth the price, but be prepared to buy a new necklace before you wear it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.25833094", "1": "0.2521466", "3": "0.08076727", "4": "0.041664522", "5": "0.32015845", "6": "0.043642852"}}
