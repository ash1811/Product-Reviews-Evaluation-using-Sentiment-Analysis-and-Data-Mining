{"text": "Bought this for my 8 year old  grand daughter because pink is her favourite colour.She loves it. Allows her to tell the time numerically rather than digitally. It was a perfect fit for her small wrist. She claims it rings at every hour so it keeps her abreast of the time.Very suitable for her age and upwards to pre-teens. The band seems sturdy but is not genuine leather.She is very pleased with it because it is not plastic.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.059742294", "1": "0.38441312", "2": "0.14225903", "3": "0.052203566", "4": "0.23044126", "5": "0.094826415", "6": "0.036114365"}}
