{"text": "I picked these up (on sale) to use running around the house and while standing cooking. (I have plantar fasciitis* in one foot and brother-in-law ortho told me to start wearing shoes around the house.) I typically wear between a 9 and a 9 1/2 and noted that others said to size up so I went with a 9 1/2, the sandal is barely long enough, if I didn't hate to return things, I probably would have exchanged them for a 10, which I never need to do. As for width, you had better have narrow feet or these will not fit you. I have the skinniest feet you have ever seen and these fit perfectly.As for comfort, well, the sole is comfortable but the floral strap over the foot, around the great toe is not very comfortable. I am hoping that it softens with time and wear. Long story short, if I tried these on in a store I would not have purchased them but since it is a hassle to send them back and I got them on the cheap side, I will keep them.Not Recommended.*Yes that really is how it is spelled - lol.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13541846", "1": "0.16083509", "2": "0.03439227", "3": "0.13203754", "4": "0.17441529", "5": "0.15129311", "6": "0.21160822"}}
