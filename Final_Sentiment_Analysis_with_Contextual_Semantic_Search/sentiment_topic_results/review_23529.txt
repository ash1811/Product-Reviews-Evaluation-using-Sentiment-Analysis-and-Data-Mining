{"text": "This watch is fabulous. It looks like a Rolex and feels like a much more expensive watch. No issues with keeping time and I've had mine for about a year now. It's a great watch for daily wear because it is so cheap that you don't have to concerned with getting it scratched or getting mugged on the subway. Just give the mugger this watch. You'll walk away safe and the mugger will be a little upset when he goes to pawn it and finds out it's almost worthless!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2663768", "1": "0.356355", "2": "0.21049961", "3": "0.050537344", "4": "0.06313603", "5": "0.04976446"}}
