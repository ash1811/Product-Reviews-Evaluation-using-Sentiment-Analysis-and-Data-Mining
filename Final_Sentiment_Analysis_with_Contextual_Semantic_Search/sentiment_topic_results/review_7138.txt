{"text": "I take Zumba classes almost daily and because I tend to have extremely flexible feet, not all sneakers work for me and I find I need to take excessive breaks during my workout due to uncomfortable shoes and/or numbing toes.  After trying most tried and proven workout sneakers, I spotted someone in my class with similar issues wearing a dance/hip hop shoe like this one where the piece in the middle is flexible.  I came across this shoe on your website and immediately ordered them.  Not only was it made by a trusted company, but the price was amazing and not bad on the eyes!I have already used them many times and there was no need to break them in at all.  I am totally impressed with the performance of this shoe.  I didn't have to take any breaks during my routine and found I was able to pull off all of the Zumba moves with great ease and speed which is something I find difficult to do with a sneaker.I usually take between an 8 and 8.5 in woman's shoe depending on the material and quality of the shoe so I went ahead and ordered a 9 in this shoe and it fit perfectly!  I like that it came with an extra pair of shoe laces in gray which allowed me to change my look.  Would definitely recommend this shoe to anyone who has similar issues and enjoy a dance routine as a workout.  It doesn't disappoint and as a matter of fact, I'm thinking of buying an extra pair so that I never have to go without.  Although the shoe itself looks and feels quite durable and can take a beating.Vickie from NJ", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09694407", "1": "0.2463026", "2": "0.17935401", "3": "0.10480816", "4": "0.07321858", "5": "0.22788055", "6": "0.071492024"}}
