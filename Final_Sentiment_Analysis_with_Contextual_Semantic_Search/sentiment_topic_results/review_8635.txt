{"text": "I bought these jeans for my husband.  He likes the jeans and feels like they are well made and durable.  They wash well and fit well too.  they seem a little longer than the 32 inch length I thought I ordered but other than that, they are the best.  I will buy more of this brand in the future!  The pockets are good and made with a dark and sturdy material.  I would highly recommend these jeans to others who are looking for durability.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.5036128", "3": "0.10488321", "4": "0.15050028", "5": "0.12457672", "6": "0.1095808"}}
