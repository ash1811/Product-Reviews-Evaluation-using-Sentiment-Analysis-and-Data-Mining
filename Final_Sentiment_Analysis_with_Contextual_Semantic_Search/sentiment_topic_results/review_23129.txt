{"text": "I should've known better, because I've had issues with Playtex bras before -- I had to order one band size up for it it fit.  It did fit -- good coverage, soft.  I had it on 10 minutes and had to take it off.  The arm pit area is too high up.  I hate that.  It feels like you're stuffed.  I can't honestly believe anyone likes that feeling.  I have crossed Playtex off my list forever and will stick with Glamorize bras.  I just wanted to try something different...lol  Not recommended.  I'm a large lady...hard to find sizes that support and fit well -- that are COMFORTABLE.  The girls were hoisted up enough, but I was not a happy camper.  Off to the charity bag it goes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07390624", "1": "0.2715741", "2": "0.11012587", "3": "0.2677926", "4": "0.11956511", "5": "0.09038498", "6": "0.06665107"}}
