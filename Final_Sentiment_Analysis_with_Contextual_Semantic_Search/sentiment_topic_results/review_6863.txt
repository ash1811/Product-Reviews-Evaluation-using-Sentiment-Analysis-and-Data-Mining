{"text": "These were my go-to thermals last winter for the really, really cold days when I worked outside at a ski resort in Colorado. These fit snugly and didn't restrict movement. Solid construction-- no holes from wear in the typical spots so far. Stitching looks really solid so I'm not surprised they've held up so well. For the price, I don't know where you could find a warmer pair of thermals. Very satisfied!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07117166", "1": "0.22291036", "2": "0.107496515", "3": "0.106441475", "4": "0.28705385", "5": "0.08731338", "6": "0.11761275"}}
