{"text": "My husband has been trying to find a \"NON-BAGGY\" pair of Levi's for years or since the Baggy style became the trend.  He's been wearing the 505 but really not happy.  I read the reviews on the 514 and purchased the \"Tumbled Black\".  1st pair was a 36 x 30 which was too large around the waist.  On-line, Amazon issued a return label for the 36 x 30 and I placed a separate order for 34 x 30 which arrived and actually fit! My husband has legs and a seat again and looks really good! No longer the \"I can see the pants moving but is there someone in-side them look\"?  The \"Tumbled Black\" is a woven material with white threads through it so it is not a true solid jean's black, more a muted black because of the white threads. We will be buying more of the 514 Slim Straight Leg in different colors. He was extremely happy with the fit and so am I!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09449711", "1": "0.14658298", "2": "0.14268115", "3": "0.17489393", "4": "0.23012468", "5": "0.10219554", "6": "0.109024584"}}
