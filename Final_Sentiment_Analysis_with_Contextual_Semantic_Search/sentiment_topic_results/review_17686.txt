{"text": "I bought this watch when my Timex gave up after less than 2 years; I've owned several Casio in the past and never had them break after such a short time.The main feature I went for was the ani-digi function. It turns out, that's as much a curse as it is a blessing...but more on that later.This watch does everything but sing and dance, and it's possible that's somewhere in the cryptic instruction book too. Multiple city times, stopwatch with all the usual bells and whistles, day/date display.Here's the thing about the analog display, it does not set automatically! You have to set it by holding down a button (or two buttons if it's a long way off) while the hands twirl around. And you don't set the minute hand and hour hand separately...if you're off by 11 hours (daylight savings time?) you have to watch the minute hand go around 11 times. And if you miss...you can't go backwards...so it's another 11+ hours. This seems really, really silly to me. As advanced as everything else is on this watch, I think setting the analog hands to agree with the digital should be automated.Pros:Ani-digi displayLarge face/dialVery substantial feel/weightMetal bandCons:Hard to adjust fit (but this is the case for any metal band)Analog setting isn't automatedAutomatic light feature turns off and must be reset after a certain amount of time.So...I think it's a good watch, well worth what I paid for it, but it could have been so much better.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12533398", "1": "0.19433977", "2": "0.12413833", "3": "0.12479332", "4": "0.12750697", "6": "0.30160332"}}
