I wear these for work with a button down shirt and tie. While they are probably designed as work pants, they do very well for a contemporary dressy look. I'm on the heavy side and find these are very roomy.

I send them to the dry-cleaner and so far minimal fading.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06324399", "1": "0.37415227", "2": "0.036583032", "4": "0.1362287", "5": "0.2662294", "6": "0.1209449"}}
