{"text": "Soft and really light.  Works really well and is very well thought out with 2 zippered pockets and an large Velcro pouch with 2 separate pockets.  I find this a very good arrangement.  Money in one zippered pocket and card and license in the other and the cell phone in the Velcro pocket. I also like the adjustment on the length of cord so you can wear it high or lower.  Not my everyday wallet as a full size Spec Op but this is great for days when more security is need or no pockets.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11304739", "1": "0.35911548", "2": "0.098770514", "4": "0.17981556", "6": "0.24351913"}}
