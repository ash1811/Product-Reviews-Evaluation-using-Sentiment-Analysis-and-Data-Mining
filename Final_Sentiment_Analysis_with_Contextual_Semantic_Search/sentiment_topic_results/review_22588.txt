{"text": "I always have a problem finding pants that are not too long for me. I am 5'4\" and about 115 lbs and I bought these in a size 3. They fit perfectly, being just an inch or two too long. Usually pants on me are about 5 inches too long! I have been wearing Dickies for years and years to work and I needed new ones. They came quickly and I plan to buy another pair! The color is true to the picture, and there doesn't seem to be any defects.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.57718", "2": "0.103092864", "3": "0.10097942", "4": "0.06408982", "5": "0.063871495", "6": "0.087374285"}}
