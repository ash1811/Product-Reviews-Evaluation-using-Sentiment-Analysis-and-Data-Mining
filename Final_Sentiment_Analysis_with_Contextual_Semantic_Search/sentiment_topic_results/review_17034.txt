{"text": "Excellent, classic sandal from Keen. I have very flat feet and can feel the arch support. More of a closed sandal so foot feels very secure, can understand why Newports are great for long walk/hike. As usual, and this issue is always important when I review Keen reviews by others, go 1/2 size up from usual size shoe. Great buy from Amazon.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08869045", "1": "0.21420905", "2": "0.18217944", "3": "0.20252436", "4": "0.10010645", "5": "0.09475116", "6": "0.117539056"}}
