{"text": "This dressy style men's watch is perfect in every way except for fit. My boyfriend needs a wrist watch that is 8.5&#34; length in the band, and this one didn't meet the requirement. He loved the look and all the features though. Returning it was a breeze. I'll look for another Casio product to replace this one, and would recommend this watch to anyone who doesn't have such a wide wrist.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.23940709", "2": "0.17453559", "3": "0.11082973", "4": "0.15684004", "5": "0.19001283", "6": "0.12469875"}}
