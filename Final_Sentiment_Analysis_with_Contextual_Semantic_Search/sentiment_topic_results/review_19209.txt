{"text": "After my favorite expensive leather wallet stopped snapping shut, I came here to find something to hold all of my junk until I get a nice new one. After reading the reviews and the inexpensive price, I bought this wallet and it came in last night. It is perfect for me! Plenty of room for cards, cash, change, checkbook, etc. I will be keeping this until it falls apart!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21437143", "1": "0.4051981", "2": "0.1407629", "3": "0.113293596", "4": "0.042129412", "5": "0.05297159", "6": "0.031272996"}}
