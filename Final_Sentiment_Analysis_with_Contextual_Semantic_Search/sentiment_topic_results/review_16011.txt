{"text": "Based on the other reviews, I expected the sole of these flip flops to be a lot more comfortable than they are which is why I only gave it 4 stars. It's a bit like a stiff board and not very cushy, but comfortable enough for me to walk around the house and do errands. The upper part and the piece in between the toes is fabric and very comfortable and doesn't rub.  I think the bottom will conform more to my feet after I wear them a while. Overall would recommend.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.40227517", "2": "0.08969256", "4": "0.07466845", "5": "0.23047465", "6": "0.19553924"}}
