{"text": "My wife got a pair of these crocs and absolutely loved them so I figured I would give them a try and I purchased a pair myself. They are the most comfortable shoe to wear. They look nice, they hold up well, they are so light and they massage your feet while you walk because they have all these little bubbles inside. I purchase them before we went on vacation and loved them because they can get wet or anything and can't hurt them. You really need to try a pair of crocs. You won't be disappointed.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13047172", "1": "0.37657645", "2": "0.1033746", "3": "0.24420452", "4": "0.049604345", "5": "0.030203843", "6": "0.065564506"}}
