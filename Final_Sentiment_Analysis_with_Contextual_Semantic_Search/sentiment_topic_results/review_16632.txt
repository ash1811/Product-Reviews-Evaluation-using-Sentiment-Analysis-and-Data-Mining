{"text": "Nice multi-function watch.  It is larger than your average watch, but the green version is good looking and does not come across gaudy at all.  Actually looks sporty. The band feels very secure and the watch is solid.  It's water resistant to 100 meters.  The functions are easy to navigate and the interface is fairly intuitive, although you will need to at least skim the manual to know  how to work all of the functions and to calibrate and reset altitude and compass reference points.  It has 5 daily alarms, hourly chime, barometric pressure /altitude reading and trend chart, air temperature (reads warm when wearing the watch, but perfect reading when attached to my backpack), altitude alarm, and compass (which is functional but  not a serious tool).  Great watch for the price. Very happy with it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.104806274", "1": "0.29012403", "2": "0.17207494", "3": "0.10712611", "4": "0.08255333", "5": "0.15277126", "6": "0.090544015"}}
