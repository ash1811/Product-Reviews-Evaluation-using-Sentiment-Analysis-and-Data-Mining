{"text": "Love this watch. I've got a couple, one in black, one in gold, and I'm very pleased with both. This is a watch you can like even if analog-digital isn't your thing. The design has been around at least since Arnold Schwarzenegger wore it in 'Kindergarten Cop'. It also comes in a blue version with blue bezel.I call this my 'snorkel' watch. The dive bezel works smoothly but moves in both directions, so it's not for true Scuba...however I've snorkeled with this down to 20-25 feet and no problems, so it's definitely waterproof for all non-Scuba uses.Time adjustment is simple. The luminescent hands are quite bright when you first come in from the sun, they seem to last about an hour before fading, so they're for casual use but not, say, serious spelunking. That said, they're easy to read in all light levels against the black. It's a great watch at twilight because you can still clearly read the dial. The second hand is also easy to read in all light levels.This is a quietly handsome watch at a great price. Solid, reliable like every Casio, but unpretentious.I've worn mine as a general outdoors sports/beach/knockaraound watch, and it still looks great.The crystal is completely un-scratched despite some pretty careless treatment.I'm totally pleased with both of mine. Check out the gold face version as well. This same style series also comes in a three-dial chronograph version which is equally attractive, affordable and reliable. I have a couple of those too.There's nothing not to like about this watch. The rubber factory band is fine, but these really look good on a nylon Nato strap (if you're not familiar with those, google it).I found mine for around $30 shipped. Prices fluctuate, so do shop around.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.032696202", "1": "0.12719771", "2": "0.1764808", "3": "0.36755157", "4": "0.10773488", "5": "0.12431713", "6": "0.06402173"}}
