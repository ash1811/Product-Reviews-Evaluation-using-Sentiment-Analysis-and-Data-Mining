{"text": "In an effort to start saving up money, I decided to stop buying fancy \"name\" brand purses and wallets. So, when my beloved Kate Spade wallet wore out, I turned to amazon. My main requirement was that the wallet looked classy and was all leather. This wallet filled those requirements nicely! I love it. It is a nice supple leather and the cc slots are also leather (a lot of other wallets make those cloth/nylon). I am thrilled with my wallet and I can't believe I used to spend over $200 for wallets when this one is the same quality (or better). I'm a fan of this brand now!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10562997", "1": "0.15280041", "2": "0.22249594", "3": "0.15782146", "4": "0.14744684", "6": "0.21149285"}}
