{"text": "My husband looks so cute in these. I bought them for him for work. He's constantly ripping holes in his front pockets from pulling tools and pens in and out, but so far, hasn't had any problems with these. The flat-front is very attractive. As some other reviewers mentioned, the waist fits snugly. I took a chance and purchased my husband's usual size, and he actually likes the way they fit. It took him a few wears to break these pants in, but he's very happy with them. I expect that they'll outlast the brands he usually purchases.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07430509", "1": "0.19882953", "2": "0.12871046", "3": "0.091323316", "4": "0.13707015", "5": "0.19188985", "6": "0.17787161"}}
