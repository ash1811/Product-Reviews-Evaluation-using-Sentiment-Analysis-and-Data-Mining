{"text": "Altogether I now own 7 pairs of Dickies scrub pants, 4 are part of a scrub set. They are well made, colors don't fade, seems don't come apart, material holds up to repeated washing and the rigours of my job. I purchased a few cheaper scrubs to save some money and ended up regretting it. You really do get what you pay for. I now use the cheap scrubs when I am painting or cleaning. No more cheap scrubs for this girl, paying a little more for scrubs that will last longer and fit better saves money in the long run. I have never regretted buying any of my Dickies scrubs and I will buy more in the future", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16217443", "1": "0.3326688", "3": "0.22476216", "4": "0.11488265", "5": "0.06452943", "6": "0.09866877"}}
