{"text": "I've been wearing this watch as my every day timepiece for a few months now and I have to say that I am very glad I bought this watch.For those that state they have trouble with the clasp, they simply aren't putting the watch on correctly.  The clasp clicks down and then has a swing arm fastener, so there is no way this thing will \"accidentally\" unbuckle.The watch is extremely light weight and comfortable to wear.  The color of the watch does not fade over time and it is relatively scratch resistant.  The timepiece itself is accurate and doesn't need to be adjusted at all, and the date window is a very handy feature.Highly recommend this watch for everyday users.  Not too much of a \"showy\" timepiece but great otherwise.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10225655", "1": "0.11045413", "2": "0.21280505", "3": "0.029359432", "4": "0.27967602", "5": "0.1024011", "6": "0.16304773"}}
