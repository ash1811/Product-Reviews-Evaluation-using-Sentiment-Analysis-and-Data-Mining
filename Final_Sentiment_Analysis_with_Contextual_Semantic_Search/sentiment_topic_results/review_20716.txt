{"text": "I just got my first pair of these- in the green. They are not only vibrant and beautiful, but they are amazingly comfortable. The insert has a couple of raised portions which act like a massage function on my feet. They don't seem to make my feet sweat, and they are very easy to slip in and out of and still stay on my feet. A lot of my slip on shoes tend to come off if I'm not paying attention, these are snug without being tight. The workmanship on the shoes is lovely and they seem like custom made shoes.I love these shoes!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07991333", "1": "0.33905575", "2": "0.20917472", "4": "0.25048682", "6": "0.115496665"}}
