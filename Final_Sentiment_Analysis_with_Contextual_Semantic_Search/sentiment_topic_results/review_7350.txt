{"text": "Should have listened to the review that said these pants run small in the waist. I had to return both pairs, and then re-order next-up size in the waist. Also, as another review said, the pants are offered with free return shipping but you have to contact customer service to get it. They responded right away, so it wasn't a problem.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12766856", "1": "0.18496329", "2": "0.12990886", "3": "0.28600886", "4": "0.13884738", "5": "0.033399533", "6": "0.099203505"}}
