{"text": "My husband runs both marathons and ultras so he is prone to blisters.  He had been given a pair of these for Christmas and has since bought more due to the fact that with these socks he no longer gets blisters between his toes on long runs.  He does not wear these on his shorter training runs but does wear them on his runs over 16 miles.  The socks have made a tremendous difference in the health of his feet.  However, he did wear these on a water hike in his chacos and they did not fair well - they developed two holes and pilled up.  I would highly recommend these socks if there is a serious runner in your house as these will help protect their feet.  Happy running!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13748404", "1": "0.18769072", "2": "0.12983944", "3": "0.2226206", "4": "0.06995382", "5": "0.22394885", "6": "0.028462559"}}
