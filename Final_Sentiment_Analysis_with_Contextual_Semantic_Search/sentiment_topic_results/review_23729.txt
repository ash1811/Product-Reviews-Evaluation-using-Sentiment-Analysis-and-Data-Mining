{"text": "I got a bunch of these about a year ago, and about half of them are pretty much worn out. The material is very thin, and they don't get any better after a few dozen times in the wash.As for the socks when new, they're decent- they do as described, cover the calf and stay up decently well (not much elastic to speak of, it's just friction). They're also quite long in general. They do an okay job at absorbing moisture while being adequately ventilated. Sometimes the thinness of the material is a good thing, especially if it's hot out.For the price, which was pretty darn low, they're all right. However just be aware that they're not the most durable socks out there. I have some Silvertoe pairs that are considerably older and are in much better shape despite equal use over that time.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08522477", "1": "0.2534332", "2": "0.09687656", "3": "0.17142823", "4": "0.2527166", "6": "0.1380062"}}
