{"text": "Overall, I am not too excited about these boots. I did make sure to take care of them, so they lasted longer than someone who would just throw them around. After six months of use, I saw that the synthetic leather was peeling around the edges and corners of stitching. As I am writing this review I am about to throw them away from when I bought them back in april due to a crack in the sole.I used them for work and they did their job, but it did take at least 3 months to break in for them to be average comfort.Pros:-Water Resistant (water does leak in from the laces)-Cheap-Possible to polishCons:-Not very much comfort-Synthetic Leather-Questionable qualityMid-Grade shoe for a Mid-Grade price, nothing more. If I didn't take care of them, I wonder if there would have be any other problems. If I were you, I would save up some money and go looking elsewhere unless you need a quick boot to buy. Over all, 3 stars for an OK product. Don't expect much though.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.049463995", "1": "0.27254167", "2": "0.21452585", "3": "0.15014131", "4": "0.080416866", "5": "0.23033674"}}
