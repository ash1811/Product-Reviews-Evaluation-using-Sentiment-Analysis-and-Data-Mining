{"text": "I have to wear khaki colored pants at work.  I had found a pair of these on a clearance rack at some point last year and absolutely loved them.  Those wore out and after buying a few other brands and styles of Carhartt, based off what was on sale, I finally decided to just get another pair of these.  Many of the other pants have very small front pockets or the the opening is too tight, especially if you have larger thighs.  These have a fantastic cut to allow for mobility and the pockets are the best of any pant I've used. I will absolutely be buying more of these.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22651444", "1": "0.35508168", "2": "0.058635734", "3": "0.09468041", "4": "0.13544782", "5": "0.08858225", "6": "0.041057657"}}
