{"text": "The medium size costume is supposed to fit a child 50-54\" tall.  My daughter is 50\" tall and the costume is extremely short, probably more appropriate for a size small or x-small.  The headband was also extremely small, it couldn't even fit my shitzu puppy's head.  The belt was way too small. The boots appeared to be appropriately sized.  I sewed elastic to the headband and the belt and they now fit correctly.  However, the skirt on the costume cannot be altered and my daughter will need to wear shorts under it.  I think someone tossed different sized parts of the costume into one package and sold it as a size medium.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20683628", "1": "0.16868345", "2": "0.16915154", "3": "0.2548985", "4": "0.11029347", "5": "0.0559054", "6": "0.0342314"}}
