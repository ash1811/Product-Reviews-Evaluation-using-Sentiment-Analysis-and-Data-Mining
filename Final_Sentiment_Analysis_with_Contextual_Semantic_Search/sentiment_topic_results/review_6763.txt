{"text": "First off, the 9312 Invicta (gold case/blue bezel) is beautiful, no doubt about it. It seems to keep excellent time and has very good water resistance.However, the bracelet is not quite so good... one of the springbars for the clasp was defective, and failed on occasion. I had a spare from another watch, however, and after installing that the problem went away.The plating seems easy to scratch off of the bracelet, while the case and bezel have remained pristine. The bracelet is also somewhat uncomfortable when worn for long periods.For those with nickel allergies, the inside of the watchband does not seem to be gold-plated, so you might consider replacing the standard bracelet with something else.The luminous paint on the hands of the watch is a bit weak - it won't disturb you while you're sleeping, but it also won't be too easy to read when you wake up at 4 AM.This is a very quiet watch, especially in contrast to the Timexes I've had in the past.Excellent watch with a bracelet of somewhat lesser quality.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.075706065", "1": "0.20768455", "2": "0.26037338", "3": "0.06723084", "4": "0.084928386", "5": "0.21082738", "6": "0.09324944"}}
