{"text": "I have had my watch for about 4 years now and I love the way that it looks and its functionality.  It has most features that you might want, BUT...1.  The strap DOES come off fairly easily.  This isn't usually a problem, but I worry about it when I am in the water.  It has come off inadvertently about three times since I have had the watch.2.  The dial is not very easy to see at night or in low light.3.  The original strap broke, and I replaced it with one that I bought at the mall.  Most non-metal watch bands seem to be this cheap plastic that eventually will break.  I would love to have an actual Neoprene strap instead of the cheap plastic ones that are so common.Aside from those issues, I have really enjoyed the watch both for its looks and functionality.  The yellow dial looks really sharp when you are wearing navy, green, or yellow.  The alarm, stopwatch and dual time functions are very useful.  I also like the rotating bezel for timing things quickly and easily.  I was glad to read the review that said that the reviewer had actually used it for diving to 90 feet. Even if a watch is water resistant to 100 meters, it may not be designed for the pressure changes involved in diving, so that figure can be misleading.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.20004132", "2": "0.23580025", "3": "0.29056245", "4": "0.17495662", "6": "0.093117245"}}
