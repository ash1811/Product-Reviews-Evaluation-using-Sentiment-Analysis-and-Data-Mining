{"text": "I now have several of these fine, inexpensive watches simply because I fear the day that Casio will realize that it's too great a bargain and withdraw it. Beyond the fact that it keeps excellent time, there are some more subtle virtues. It doesn't look expensive or cheap. It's looks black and discretely sophisticated. It goes with anything including, I'm told, I've never tried it, a shower or a swimming pool and, if it does and things don't work out, at the price offered you can easily, quickly (It's on the Prime list so there's no cost in shipping and it arrives promptly in a couple of days...) and no one knows-or probably care-that you've had to replace a watch. (A friend suffered the embarrassment of having to take a &#34;used&#34; smart phone to the repair place. So far so good. They had questions about certain &#34;substances&#34; that were found in it which was when it was revealed that it was recovered by a plumber from a clogged toilet.It's reliable, comfortable and the only slight negative is that if it's very hot, your wrist might sweat a bit. Of course, if it's that hot, other places will also be sweating and who will care about a sweaty wrist? AND if you're paranoid about sweaty wrists, at the price you can easily have a spare that is dry and ready to roll. An excellent purchase which I've had for several years. And worth every month of it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04881049", "1": "0.19544907", "2": "0.23539478", "3": "0.09557334", "4": "0.10419068", "5": "0.25285175", "6": "0.06772988"}}
