{"text": "When the package bearing this jacket arrived at my door, I thought there had been a mistake with my order because it seemed too heavy to contain only one garment, but no, it was just this jacket.  This sucker is HEAVY, extremely well constructed, and totally impermeable to the hardest rain.  It's the kind of thing you would expect people to wear aboard fishing boats in bad weather.  The only downside to this kind of heavyweight rain jacket is its lack of breathability; fortunately, the button-snap opening permits some ventilation to avoid perspiration buildup.  A great jacket for cold, wet weather that will last most people a lifetime.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18050745", "1": "0.1203724", "2": "0.2700284", "3": "0.07860969", "4": "0.055734348", "5": "0.111209415", "6": "0.18353826"}}
