{"text": "My current backpack of choice is a High Sierra single strap backpack. I got this one since I thought it would be the same as my other backpack, but have two straps. There are a couple things that sadly are not the same. The main compartment doesn't have a padded divider. Since I use my backpack mostly to carry around my laptop, a padded divider would have been a HUGE plus. The second thing is that the compartment meant for your iPod (or other mp3 player of your choice) is the same plasticy fabric that lines rest of the backpack. In my single strap High Sierra, it had soft fabric for that compartment which definitely prevented scratching. The yolk at the top between the two straps is uncomfortable. I can feel it pressing against my back. Maybe I just haven't adjusted it correctly yet. Those things aside, it still has the same high quality construction and has plenty of room. Maybe once I break it in a bit more I'll be happier with it.Update: Yeah, this backpack blows. I have tried adjusting the straps in various ways, but that yoke piece is still bothersome. If you look at the picture of the mannequin from the back, you can see exactly what I'm talking about. Either the backpack has a gap between it and your back or that yoke is pressing into your neck. Personally, I want a backpack to sit flush on my back so if you need to bust out a sprint to catch the bus, the backpack isn't bouncing around smacking the crap out of you. It also helps defuse the weight more evenly. Even though the single strap High Sierra backpack tends to fatigue my shoulder if I wear it for too long, it's still infinitely more comfortable than this one. Gave it to my nephew to play with. He uses it to \"play school\".", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09848735", "1": "0.13041195", "2": "0.37770036", "3": "0.1107563", "4": "0.09498352", "5": "0.048734806", "6": "0.13892576"}}
