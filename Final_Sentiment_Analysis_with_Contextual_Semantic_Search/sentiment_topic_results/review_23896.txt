{"text": "I really wanted to like these after reading the other reviews. I have trouble finding pants that fit as my waist is smaller than my hips. I end up buying a bigger size to fit my hips, but the waist is way too loose in most pants. The elastic waist was the best solution. Also, I wanted khakis that didn't wrinkle immediately and look horrible. I'm planning a vacation to a hot climate so wanted a material that would be breathable as well. The minute I put these on, my legs felt hot (like they do in blue jeans) and that was indoors in air conditioning! I couldn't imagine what they'd feel like in 90 degree temps. Also, I didn't like how the pleats looked. I wear my tops outside my pants and they didn't lay flat. The pants stuck out too much and it wasn't a smooth look. I wish they had these in a flat front with a lighter fabric.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03549397", "1": "0.2820779", "2": "0.075306974", "3": "0.045121342", "4": "0.19500619", "5": "0.22104244", "6": "0.14595117"}}
