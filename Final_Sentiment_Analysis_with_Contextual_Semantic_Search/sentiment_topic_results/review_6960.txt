{"text": "I wore the Rick Steve money belt throughout a two week trip.  It lies flat and is comfortable and very soft against the skin.  It has one long zippered compartment wide enough to hold a passport and paper money and one narrower compartment divided in half, good for credit cards.  I would have liked a separate wide compartment just for money, just to be more organized, but that might have added to bulk.  It's also important to note that there are no 1 euro paper notes, only coins below 5 euros, so the change has to go in the pants pockets or a different purse. The only other comments are that the adjustable strap is very long, which could be a good thing for bigger people but the unused portion of the strap has to be tucked in somehow and can be annoying. My other comment is that when it's warm it got kind of sweaty and the money got damp, so maybe it needs some kind of lining inside that large compartment.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06766406", "1": "0.3436941", "2": "0.1932425", "3": "0.12615958", "4": "0.08200508", "5": "0.0564385", "6": "0.1307962"}}
