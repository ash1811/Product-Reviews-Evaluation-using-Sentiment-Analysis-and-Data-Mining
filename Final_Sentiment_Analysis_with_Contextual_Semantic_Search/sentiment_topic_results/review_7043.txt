{"text": "One of the drawbacks about ordering boot/shoes on line is that you can't try them on before purchasing them. That is the case with the particular boot. Another issue I had was that the leather shaft was very stiff, not something that you could spend very much wearing right out of the box. The construction is nice, very light with a nice heel. Needless to say I had to return this pair and look for something a little smaller and more supple. Will probably need to spend a little more to get what I want. As the old saying goes, &#34;You get what you paid for.&#34;", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07403194", "1": "0.29055232", "2": "0.21069646", "3": "0.1968363", "4": "0.07298221", "5": "0.040161297", "6": "0.114739485"}}
