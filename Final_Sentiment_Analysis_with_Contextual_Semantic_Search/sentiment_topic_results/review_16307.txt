{"text": "I have lots of hats with glitter and colorful trim, but really needed a basic black one for those bad-hair days when I have to run out to the store for some little nothing that seems important at the time. :-) I wanted black because it goes with more, so when I saw this \"cheapie\" at Amazon, I grabbed it up!For this low price I expected it would be poorly constructed, so I'm very pleased that it's sturdy, well-made and of good material. Woo-hoo... For once I got a real bargain.I tip my cap to the maker of this product. Highly recommended.Reviewed by Betty Dravis, October 30, 2010Author of \"Dream Reachers\" (with Chase Von) and other books", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19569577", "1": "0.17910202", "2": "0.14211866", "3": "0.10472867", "4": "0.18073691", "5": "0.103559665", "6": "0.0940583"}}
