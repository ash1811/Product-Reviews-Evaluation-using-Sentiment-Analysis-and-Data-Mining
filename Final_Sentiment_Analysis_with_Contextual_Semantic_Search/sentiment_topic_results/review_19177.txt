{"text": "Because of their fantastic prices compared to the competitors, I gave Gem Avenue a try and bought six chains to go with gift pendants. I was not disappointed! This chain had great sparkle and draped fluidly as a snake chain should. The clasp was strong (italian-type), and the chain held the pendant securely. So pretty! The chain, at such a great price, even came in a small gift box that could be wrapped and well-presented. Very good  customer service, good delivery time. I'm happy!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.26128504", "1": "0.12410778", "3": "0.04511391", "4": "0.31336516", "5": "0.15384044", "6": "0.09948214"}}
