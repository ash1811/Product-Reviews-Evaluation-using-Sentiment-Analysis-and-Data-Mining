{"text": "My husband wears only Keen shoes. We ordered these and within just one month the sole began to separate from the shoe last. I contacted amazon and they were fantastic about returning the item. Only problem was that they decided to charge me almost $18 for &#34;restocking&#34; fees?  Really?  So overall my experience was not good and we will never buy shoes from Amazon again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09232156", "1": "0.13427581", "2": "0.291418", "3": "0.1434956", "4": "0.24007869", "6": "0.09429613"}}
