{"text": "My husband has worn these pants since I met him in 1991. These pants are much smaller than the pants we have purchased in the past. I'm not sure if I'll have to get one or two sizes larger in the waist. The other's started off loose and tightened up a bit as they were laundered. These are so tight I'm afraid to wash them. He can barely get them buttoned. I will need to exchange them for a larger size.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14933023", "1": "0.32653838", "2": "0.093271114", "3": "0.1964825", "4": "0.057598643", "5": "0.045985106", "6": "0.13079402"}}
