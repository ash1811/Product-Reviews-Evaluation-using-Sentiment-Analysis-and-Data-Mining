{"text": "This watch meets all my needs: attractive; easy to see time, day, and date at a glance; illuminated hands for viewing in poor light or in the dark; no need to replace battery; nice looking as a dress watch if you switch the band to black leather; it's fairy thin and is lightweight.  The band that comes with the watch is nice.  Had I not needed a dress watch, I would have kept the band it came with.  WARNING: The manufacturer gives explicit instructions that you should follow.  Don't even try to set the day and date until the watch is FULLY charged.  I hate manuals, but this manual means what it says.  All will go smoothly if you follow instructions.  I LOVE the watch.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06852896", "1": "0.23561235", "2": "0.14017102", "3": "0.13237195", "4": "0.1385743", "5": "0.12552916", "6": "0.15921223"}}
