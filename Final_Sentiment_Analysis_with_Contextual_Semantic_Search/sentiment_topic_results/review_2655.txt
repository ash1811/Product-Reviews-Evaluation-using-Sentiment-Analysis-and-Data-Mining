{"text": "This mumu is so comfortable! If only mumu's were the latest fashion I'd be in heaven. I feel fine wearing it around the house but am too embarrassed to wear it out and about (my own insecurity, I know...I shouldn't care. Maybe when I hit my 60's that will be the case).This mumu is made out of that type of cotton that is always crinkly (no need to worry about wrinkles!) and it feels nice on your skin. It has two big patch pockets that can hold gardening clippers and wire ties or your mobile phone while gardening or just hanging out enjoying your yard. The arm holes are pretty spacious so there is no pinching or tightness on your shoulders or arm pits. Super cozy and comfortable and handy with the two pockets - what's not to like?Someone needs to take the initiative to make mumu's the height of fashion! Why can't we be comfortable in a breezy mumu and be a style maven too??Buy the mumu - wear it with pride or hide it away at home as a guilty pleasure (like me...)  - either way you'll be glad that you did!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09261249", "1": "0.29552737", "2": "0.17550348", "3": "0.08307683", "6": "0.3482432"}}
