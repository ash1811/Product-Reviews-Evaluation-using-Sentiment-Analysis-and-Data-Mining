{"text": "This wallet is everything it is advertised to be, and more. The workmanship is great, the leather is nice and not too thin, and it definitely has plenty of room and slots to hold much more than just your spare change!The best part, though, has got to be the price! It is incredible to be able to purchase a leather wallet of this quality at this price. Even if it only lasts me a year, it will certainly be worth it's cost to me (I've owned leather wallets that have only lasted that long and they were 4 times more expensive than this one).The wallet is definitely BIG, as its name implies. Fortunately, with the large handbags now in vogue, this will not be a problem for most women! I plan on purchasing several more as gifts. Just a great product, all around!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3625053", "2": "0.27544942", "3": "0.28782597", "5": "0.044951033", "6": "0.024142878"}}
