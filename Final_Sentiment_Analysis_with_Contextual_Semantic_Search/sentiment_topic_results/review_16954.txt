{"text": "Overall I'm very pleased. The color is exactly as in the picture (Midnight), the quality is self evident. Nice and thick cloth, tightly sewn buttons, couple extra buttons, nice leathery decal on left pocket. Also, the XL size I ordered (5' 10, 210lbs) fits me exactly like store bought XL. No complaints about any of that.I took it down one star as, the picture led me to believe the shirt had shape to it. It has none. It's straight up and down. I prefer shaped outer shirts but, I'll get used to this one.Overall, I'm very pleased.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12003121", "1": "0.38194036", "2": "0.064960435", "3": "0.093170546", "4": "0.08356109", "6": "0.25409707"}}
