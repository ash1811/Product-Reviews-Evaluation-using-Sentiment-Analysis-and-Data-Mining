{"text": "I ordered this bra in a medium since I am somewhere in between a 34/36 C and it fits perfectly. It doesn't fall down for me throughout the day. The only thing I found a bit bothersome about the bra were the little cups. They seem to sometimes slide around inside the bra and it can be annoying.
