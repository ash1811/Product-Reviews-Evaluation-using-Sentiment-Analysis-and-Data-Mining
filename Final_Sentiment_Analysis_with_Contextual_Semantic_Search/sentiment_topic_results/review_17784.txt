{"text": "It's hard to begin a review about an item that I love so much. If you would like the history of the G-Shock brand that begins all the way back from 1983, here's the official link:[...]Now, about this specific model the DW6900-1V is a model that has been around since the early 2000's and is considered to be an entry level unit in the G-Shock family of products. Here are the official specs from the casio website:Shock Resistant200 Meter Water ResistantEL Backlight with AfterglowFlash AlertFlashes with buzzer that sounds for alarms, hourly time signal, countdown timer time-up alarm1/100 second stopwatchMeasuring capacity: 00&#8217;00&#8221;00-59&#8217;59&#8221;99 (for the first 60 minutes)1:00&#8217;00-23:59&#8217;59 (after 60 minutes)Measuring unit: 1/100 second (for the first 60 minutes)1 second (after 60 minutes)Measuring mode: Elapsed time, split time, 1st-2nd place timesCountdown timerMeasuring unit: 1 secondCountdown range: 24 hoursCountdown start time setting range: 1 second to 24 hours(1-second increments, 1-minute increments and 1-hour increments)Other: Auto-repeatMulti-function alarmHourly time signalFull auto-calendar (pre-programmed until the year 2039)12/24 hour formatsAccuracy: +/- 15 seconds per monthBattery CR2016Approx. battery life: 2 yearsModule 1289/3230I have always been the guy that never wanted to spend a ton of money on a watch.  Part of the reason is because I have a job where my watch was prone to constant damage and bruising.  So like many folks I would go to Walmart and pickup a 15 dollar watch every year.  I was going through watches at about that rate. Until about 2 years ago I saw a UPS driver wearing a G-shock watch (not the DW6900, but a different model).  He went on to tell me all about the watch and how much he loved everything about it.  From the design, to how well it fits on his wrist, but the most important aspect of all which is how durable, touch, and well built the watch is.So after listening to him, I decided to purchase this G-shock and have never looked back.  Everything about this watch is amazing.  Simple in functions compared to more upscale G-Shocks, but for me that's a plus.  I don't need to know sea levels or faces of the moon.  I just need a timer for daily tasks and a Chronometer for exercise.  Plus this watch has a fantastic feature that many digital watches no longer have, even the upscale time pieces:  The feature is that no matter which watch mode you are in, the time is always displayed on the upper right portion of the screen.  This may seem small in importance, but believe me when you get started using the watch you will wonder how you managed without the function in the first place.  It makes it so convenient to not have to switch between modes just to know what time is it.  I find it very strange how this function is not available on most digital watches now...The only two minor complaints that I have about this watch are:  1-)  If you have small wrists you may prefer the smaller model 5600 which is the all time classic still available, and fits much better on smaller wrists.  2-)  The \"G\" imprint on the light button is not colored...  Again this is a small dislike that to others may not think it is.  In my opinion Casio could have colored it red for an extra 3 cents on the cost of the watch if that...To wrap up the review, for the price of this watch there is no better watch out there.  This watch will go through hell and back with you.  You may not be as tough as this watch is.  It is standard issue for many military and law enforcement agencies around the world.  Here's a link to Google pictures of military units wearing g-shocks all over the world, thanks:[...]", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.30281234", "1": "0.13061425", "2": "0.0770927", "3": "0.053702176", "4": "0.15228385", "5": "0.0899007", "6": "0.19359396"}}
