{"text": "I was use to a little stiffer bag that stay upright when you pack it. This is a duffle bag style. You have to constanly grap it to fill it. That is not a con but just what it is. The bag itself is strong and very big. it does hold a lot of clothing. I do use it every week to transport all my stuff to and from my summer place and home. I was suprise about the size of the bag.If you want a duffle style bag with plenty of volume than this is a good choice for you. My self it is too big and I can not live out of it like I need too. I seem to lose things inside of it and have to take it all out to find things.if you want to transport to and from 2 places and unload all when you get there this is the bag for you,6/14/2013The bag stinks. I have had it 1 year now and it looks like it is 20 years old. the seams have a started to come apart . I just pack it for a trip and my stuff fell to the floor coming out of the whole in the seam. I went to check the seam and with very little effort it just rip apart. time to look elsewhere for a new bag.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.33175164", "2": "0.17615633", "3": "0.24950495", "4": "0.15392156", "6": "0.082919456"}}
