{"text": "I am a serious hiker, to the point that I walked all the way across Scotland, through the highlands.  In living in Europe, walking/hiking is an ethic in some countries, and I can say, without reservation, that Merrel makes some of the best treaders in the industry.  Have been wearing them for years, and they even finished the Nijmegen Vierdaagse (four days, 25-30 miles per day) with me, two years running.  They're light, comfy, and breath better than most.  I do find that they work best when I insert a good gel-sole, but that's all I do, and I'm off and running.  They also last forever, and I don't pitch them until the bottoms are almost gone, which is usually around 2-3000 kilometers.  Outstanding product!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10685259", "1": "0.15387964", "2": "0.21017215", "3": "0.15419778", "4": "0.17515415", "5": "0.1974163"}}
