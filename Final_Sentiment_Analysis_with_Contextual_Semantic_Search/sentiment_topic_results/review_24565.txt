{"text": "I am not a dancer but wear the leotards for work daily as an alternative to body shapers. FYI I am 5'-3\" and vary between size 8 and 10. I first ordered the ballet pink in large and it fit wonderfully and is super comfortable. I love love love the fabric - it feels good, stretches great and launders great.I then ordered several more in different colors and they are still great but the white in particular feel much smaller than the ballet pink in the same size. Not sure why.I noticed another reviewer mention that the black has a shelf bra - the two blacks I ordered do not have a shelf bra or a lining. just FYI. The ballet pink has a beige bathing suit lining and the white has a white lining (actually the white fabric is doubled; I suspect this may be why the white is less stretchy and more constrictive).But overall I am very happy with the purchase and already have more colors on the way.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07244309", "1": "0.19965386", "2": "0.05172441", "3": "0.22589616", "4": "0.13167316", "5": "0.057404485", "6": "0.26120484"}}
