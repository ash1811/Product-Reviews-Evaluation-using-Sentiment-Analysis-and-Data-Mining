{"text": "This is a great push-up bra for those of us not so well endowed. It really enhances my cleavage nicely, which I really like. It's well made and has very good support and I really like the pink satin cubs and the black satin trim. The comfort level is not the greatest for me (the reason I subtracted a star), but it's not bad. Especially if you consider the enhancement you receive in lieu of a slight comfort trade-off. I forget that I have it on after a short while. Overall, I would say that I have always had good luck with my Jezebel bra purchases.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03139957", "1": "0.3389913", "2": "0.1300806", "3": "0.07998034", "4": "0.13528286", "5": "0.045499623", "6": "0.2387657"}}
