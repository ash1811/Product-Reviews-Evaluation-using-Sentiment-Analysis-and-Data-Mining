{"text": "The waistline (size 14) berely fits - it's too tight and very uncomfortable. Don't know what kind of elastic they used but it is not stretchy at all. But below the waist because of the pleats those pants really balloon out so the front looks rather ugly.It is a total enigma why they called them Relaxed Fit - if I  buy size 16 to feel comfortable at waistline - below the waist I'll look like a circus clown. And I haven't even washed them yet.Possible to wear with smth long over them to cover the ugly puffed front, but otherwise not.So no, definitely not buying this model again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21388829", "1": "0.22687566", "2": "0.032157484", "3": "0.20097528", "4": "0.12024073", "6": "0.20334417"}}
