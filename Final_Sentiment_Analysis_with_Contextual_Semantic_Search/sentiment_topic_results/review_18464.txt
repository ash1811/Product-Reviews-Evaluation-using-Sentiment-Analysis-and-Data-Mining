{"text": "I purchased my own Montrail sandals last year in preparation of walking \"The Camino\" in Spain. The owner of the small sport shop in BC Canada suggested them to wear at the end of the day.....they were very light and didn't rub between my toes! After walking 20-25km it was wonderful to spread my toes in the sandals! Thus I bought a pair for my husband for his birthday......he is so happy with his pair also. I plan to purchase another pair for myself in a different colour next year. I have already recommended these sandals to others.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.050174788", "1": "0.2657047", "2": "0.13059431", "3": "0.08921939", "4": "0.23623016", "5": "0.047563296", "6": "0.18051338"}}
