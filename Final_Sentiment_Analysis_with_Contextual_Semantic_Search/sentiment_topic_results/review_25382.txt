{"text": "There are things I love about this bag and things I hate about it.Love:- it is extremely well made and durable.  The two large outside compartments are well thought out and come in handy.  The front one (as pictured) has an envelope closure secured with velcro.  The back compartment is open without the flap, but is still secured closed with a small velcro square.This compartment is very handy for throwing my car keys and phone in when I get out of the car and run into a store.  The fact that it's still secured shut with the velcro, makes me confident neither will inadvertently fall out.- the two side exterior pockets are perfect for slipping glasses or a small bottle of water into.Hate:- the straps are made of nylon webbing and each has a plastic slider on it so you can adjust the length of the straps.  While this feature is handy, the plastic pieces made the bag look extremely cheap and casual.  There is no way this bag could pass for a laptop tote in a work environment.- while these plastic sliders allow you to adjust the length of the straps, keep in mind that if the length you choose happens to mean plastic sliders end up where the straps rest on your shoulders, it is not be comfortable at all.- this is just personal preference, but I was looking for a tote that would stand open in more of a boxy shape.  I should have paid more attention to the photo, but the shape of this bag is exactly as pictured - - the top opening of this bag stays in a zipped-closed shape instead of the squared-off open shape I wanted.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10654422", "1": "0.2642873", "2": "0.2863106", "3": "0.1802181", "4": "0.048952155", "5": "0.042700853", "6": "0.07098673"}}
