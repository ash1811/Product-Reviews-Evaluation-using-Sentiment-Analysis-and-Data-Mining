{"text": "Beautiful earrings.  Nice weight, polished beautifully, and very rich looking.  I like the size, the circles being slightly larger than a penny.  These are my new favorites.  You can change the look a little, too, depending on whether you wear the polished ring next to your skin or the satin finished  side.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12968208", "1": "0.21155742", "2": "0.28815818", "3": "0.07061751", "5": "0.13544206", "6": "0.1599241"}}
