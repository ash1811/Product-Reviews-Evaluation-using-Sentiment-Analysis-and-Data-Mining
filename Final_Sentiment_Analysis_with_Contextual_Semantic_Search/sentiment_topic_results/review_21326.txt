{"text": "Slightly disappointed in jewely box, I know I didn't pay alot for it, but I did read reviews before I purchased and they were pretty good, so I went ahead and purchased it. On receiving it, I feel it is not a good as I thought it would be, it is basically cardboard covered in pink foil with ballerinas on it,the ballerina inside is so-so, her face is a little askew, the music quality is good. I would recommend a different one.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19367489", "1": "0.27653354", "2": "0.0758529", "3": "0.28083527", "5": "0.041263506", "6": "0.12865831"}}
