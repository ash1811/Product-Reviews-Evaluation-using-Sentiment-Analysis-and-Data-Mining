{"text": "These are an OK value for the price, but they only lasted 3 or 4 wearings before they ran.  They don't stay up very well-- a common problem with this type of stocking -- but can easily be used with a garter (which is a sexier look in any case). I prefer sooth top to lace.  I won't order again, but I recommend this seller for inexpensive lingerie that does not need to be too durable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1472416", "1": "0.41519958", "3": "0.13377821", "4": "0.07478984", "5": "0.18315846", "6": "0.041605346"}}
