{"text": "I had been looking for a small faced, dressy (not-plastic-sports-style,) digital watch for months.  They are very hard to find!  This is exactly what I had in mind.  It is small, but easy to read. The case is thin and attractive, and the band is easy to adjust to fit perfectly.  The only concern I have is that the clasp can be knocked open if bumped against something. (I previously had a similar watch with a latch that folded out making a continuous loop so that it didn't fall off if accidentally opened. It saved the watch several times!)  I haven't tried the alarm feature yet - but I will soon be on after-school grandchild pick up duty and I KNOW I will use the alarm often!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.093336165", "1": "0.17894335", "2": "0.20082922", "3": "0.1208027", "4": "0.17011696", "5": "0.11245281", "6": "0.12351882"}}
