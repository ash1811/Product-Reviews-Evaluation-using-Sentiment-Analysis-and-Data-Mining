{"text": "So, these are comfy and have a thick cotton feel. Nice pockets and draw-string. Looks to be well-made..BUT!!!!!!These aren't really the modern-cut sleep shorts I was looking for as a young (20-something) man. They are a little short in the leg and have a &#34;poofy&#34; old-man quality.  Not to say that there is anything wrong with the shorts, because there isn't.But, from a guy that typically sleeps in athletic shorts, these have a very old-guy look and will be given to my father.Good shorts, not for me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.30408224", "1": "0.10450546", "2": "0.117853634", "3": "0.1178979", "4": "0.26113558", "6": "0.091033146"}}
