{"text": "So i purchased this to use for a snow white costume.  So i cant say how this would hold up for a heavy wedding dress BUT i think it would probably be ok.  Its really a good quality and came packaged nicely. The hoops are adjustable and i like how the waist is a slip/pull tie. Im 5'3 and hits the floor just right and if you want to wear it higher on your waist you can because of the adjustable pull tie waist.  I would recommend this product", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1511057", "1": "0.29168156", "2": "0.20004985", "3": "0.106486164", "4": "0.034882396", "5": "0.12505439", "6": "0.09073996"}}
