{"text": "I had this watch for about 10 days now and am not wearing any of my others.  And this is the most inexpensive of the lot by many multiples.  It has kept virtually perfect time for the 10 days and I never had to reset it as I expected would be necessary from an an inexpensive automatic.  It is very light on the wrist and while the numbers are kinda ridiculous for normal people, I tend to tell time by the position of the hands.  I highly recommend for what it is recognizing it is not a TAG or Rolex.  Only minor issue is that the watch is only slightly water resistent.  SO now showering or swimming with it.  I had bought and returned the larger more expensive (and more jewels) version of this, a Seiko SNZ series.  I*t kept terrible time and would not run longer than about 6 hours once you took it off your wrist.  No problems like that with this self-winding watch.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08737008", "1": "0.23776409", "2": "0.18548825", "3": "0.14635213", "4": "0.19363682", "5": "0.14646268"}}
