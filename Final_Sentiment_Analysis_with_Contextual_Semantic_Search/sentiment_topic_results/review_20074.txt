{"text": "First, it's super quality, the zippers, the buckles and the fabric are just wonderful.  It has plenty of room and holds a lot of books.  My daughter is in highschool and really needs a good bag.  The padding on the shoulder straps are great.  I've already put it in the washer, I have a frontloader, and just let it air dry.  I highly recommend this brand.  I know we'll be able to use for a while.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.095148005", "1": "0.19129662", "2": "0.08964775", "3": "0.22256862", "4": "0.10062158", "5": "0.24579354", "6": "0.054923907"}}
