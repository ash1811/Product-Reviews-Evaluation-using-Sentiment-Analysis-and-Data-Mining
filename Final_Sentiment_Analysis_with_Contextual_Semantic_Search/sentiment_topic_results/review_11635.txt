{"text": "This pack can fit a very impressive amount of gear. It seems to keep expanding as you pack it, yet you can cinch the compression straps when it is less than full and it becomes a manageable day pack. The zippers are somewhat difficult to operate, but the advantage to this is that should you forget to close them items will not fall out of the front storage areas. Another seeming issue I find to be an advantage is the lack of the multitude of internal and external trademark Maxpedition pockets and compartments. At first I found this a little disappointing, but after 3 months of use I find this to be actually preferable in this pack. It is all about secure interior space. I attached the Maxpedition water bottle carrier and now this pack is my standard for anything over 1 day or for multiple changes of clothes and gear. The rear CCW compartment is also outfitted with the holster and mag holder, and I can't even tell my Sig is sitting in there while I am wearing the pack. With a little creative attitude and persistance (and with the pistol removed, of course) this can also pass as an airline carry-on, allowing you to avoid checked baggage for trips of a week in duration. In black it is also appears far closer to a traditional pack than a tactical or paramilitry pack, which helps in avoiding scrutiny from overzealous airport security.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.18206324", "1": "0.26086625", "2": "0.22221994", "4": "0.04042297", "5": "0.09759567", "6": "0.19431901"}}
