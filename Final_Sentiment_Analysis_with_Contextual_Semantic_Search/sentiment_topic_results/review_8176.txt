{"text": "Here is the main difference:  with my other bag, I dragged in the mall doing my Christmas shopping.  It was bulky and cumbersome and heavy on my shoulder.  When I came home I had had enough and jumped online to look for something better.  Found this bag, decided against the x-small because I carry a LOT of stuff and can never decide what to leave at home, ordered the small instead, and WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!!  Same stuff  I carried before but feels like only 1/3 of the previous weight.  Seriously.  The bulk is gone, I think I will find my stuff in there including my Kindle, LOVE that bag!  I will probably order the medium size as well, or another small, don't know yet.  I am not one who uses a different purse every day, I grab the same one on my way out the door.No comment as to durability since I just got it, but even if it wears out in a year, saving me back pain will have been worth it!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11394873", "1": "0.21106532", "2": "0.07877221", "3": "0.16088665", "4": "0.16144224", "5": "0.13563871", "6": "0.13824612"}}
