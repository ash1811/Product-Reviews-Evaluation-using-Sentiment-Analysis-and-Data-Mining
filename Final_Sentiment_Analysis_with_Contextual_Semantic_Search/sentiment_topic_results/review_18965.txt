{"text": "I like the fit of these.  I have muscular legs and a narrow waist, and I can actually get the legs of these over my thighs and calves without a struggle unlike the 505's.  But they are badly mislabeled.  I ordered a 31 inch waist/30 inch inseam.  The product I received was labeled as such.  The actual inseam measured with a tape measure was almost 32 inches, way too long for me to wear.  I don't understand how such a basic failure in quality control can be allowed to happen.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19279711", "1": "0.13879414", "2": "0.20192568", "4": "0.06446409", "5": "0.18935424", "6": "0.20960684"}}
