{"text": "Having read the reviews about this shirt running large, I ordered an XX-Large in Heather Grey and New Navy for an otherwise 3XL husband.He is 6'1&#34; tall and has a large frame and wide body, what I would call a fire hydrant shape. He looked like a sausage in this shirt.While the shirt's sleeves and body length were good, the cuffs and waist band were very tight. The torso was also tight.We're not talking big belly. We're talking straight wide body from chest to hips. This is a fitted and not a relaxed fit shirt, perhaps because it's made in Mexico and not the USA anymore.Since this doesn't come in a 3XL size, I'll have to return it for a refund.The sleeves and torso would be too long in the Big and Tall Men's size 3XL.The quality of the shirt seems pretty decent, but not the same quality of Carhartt in years past.My children were teasing my husband about his 10-year-old Carharrt sweats, so I decided to spiff him up with new ones :)Sadly, it didn't work out.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2626397", "2": "0.10344083", "3": "0.15330346", "4": "0.08313877", "5": "0.20127004", "6": "0.19402885"}}
