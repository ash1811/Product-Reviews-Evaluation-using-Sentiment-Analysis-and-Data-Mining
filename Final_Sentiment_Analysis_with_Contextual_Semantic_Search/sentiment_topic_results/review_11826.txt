{"text": "I wanted a water shoe for my 3 year old daughter, so she could mess around at the beach and in the creek.  It was a little bigger than I thought it would be in the fit, but it's OK because there is an elastic draw-string type closure to tighten the shoe around the top of the foot/ankle.  Plus, she'll have room to grow.  I'm very satisfied with this.  She's already used them twice and we've had no problems with quality or size.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.26899663", "2": "0.1919016", "3": "0.24190828", "5": "0.21254613", "6": "0.07782898"}}
