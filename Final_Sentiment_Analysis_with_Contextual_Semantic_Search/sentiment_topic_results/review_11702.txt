{"text": "This bra (36D) fits very well and feels great. I don't wear it for high-impact sports though (I've got an Enell for that). One thing that others might find frustrating is that the straps are not adjustable. They happen to fit me very well, but if they didn't, there's no way to shorten or lengthen them.  I like the V-shaped straps (the straps attach to the middle of the back not parallel over the shoulder) because they stay on better.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.324911", "2": "0.2079187", "3": "0.15679274", "4": "0.15707926", "5": "0.036117222", "6": "0.11392927"}}
