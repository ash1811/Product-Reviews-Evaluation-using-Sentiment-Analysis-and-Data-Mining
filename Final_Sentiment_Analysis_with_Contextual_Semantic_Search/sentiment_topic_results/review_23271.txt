{"text": "This is the most uncomfortable thing I've ever slept in - I woke up partway through the night and threw it across the room! The seams on the inside are NOT flat so they dig in and leave marks on you. The elastic around the bottom is both very thin and cheap and is unfaced on the inside so it is scratchy. The elastic around the shoulders is also not faced so it is scratchy. I think the only way this might be wearable at all is inside-out...as if it wasn't ugly enough to start with. Totally disappointed with this product!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06878181", "1": "0.1859457", "2": "0.07162325", "3": "0.28128913", "4": "0.11790998", "5": "0.06632148", "6": "0.20812869"}}
