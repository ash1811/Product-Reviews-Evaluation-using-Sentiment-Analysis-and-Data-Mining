{"text": "I am highly satisfied with this purchase !  Take my review with a grain of salt - I merely purchased this watch to be able to tell time while I play with my preschooler in conditions involving everything from water to mud to paint, and playdough.  I don't use it for laps or long runs, although the indiglo function is nice for my morning jogs.  The watch was easy to set and it cleans up nicely after finger-painting days.  All in all, a great buy!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.077480406", "1": "0.37834504", "2": "0.2000718", "3": "0.22955318", "4": "0.042483", "6": "0.06872182"}}
