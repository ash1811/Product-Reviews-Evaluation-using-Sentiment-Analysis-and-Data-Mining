{"text": "Ordered shoe from Zappo's.  Very fast delivery and follow service.Be aware that these shoes run very wide.  I used the sizing chart but they were too wide.  I had to order a full size smaller. They fit but still feel a little wide.  However I suspect that I will be wearing thicker socks and this may help.  They are not the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn, but if they improve with wear I will update this review.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.088224955", "1": "0.3053576", "2": "0.21249866", "3": "0.17276856", "4": "0.03910893", "5": "0.06689523", "6": "0.11514606"}}
