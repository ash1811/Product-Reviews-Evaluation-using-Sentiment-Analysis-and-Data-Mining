{"text": "I have a hard time finding shoes that fit, and sometimes I buy colors I wouldn't normally wear, and I use this black dye to make said shoes black.  I purchased this initially to dye some beige sandals and it worked great.  I then dabbed some along the zipper of a coat I had used fabric dye on, but the stiff fabric of the zipper had remained pinkish.  After applying this black dye to that rough zipper fabric, it looks much better.  I plan to use it on a white summer belt next.  I am one of those people who wears a lot of black, so I feel I have definitely gotten my money's worth out of this bottle.  I plan to apply some to my already black footwear, just for a sharper look.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10992467", "1": "0.1664447", "2": "0.33595362", "3": "0.11182697", "4": "0.06704247", "5": "0.17923829", "6": "0.029569263"}}
