{"text": "Before: I am not a backpack person at all, but have to admit sometimes there is no substitution for it. Well if I have to buy one then at least it has to be pretty (read \"orange\"). But, besides the look, I really love the quality and practicality of it. The \"layout\", if you will, is very well thought out. Materials are amazing. And, for 26 bucks? Did I have to think longer? )) My husband who is backpack expert suggested that it should be nice to have an extra mesh pocket at the front, but I don't think I want one, it'd always look messy. Overall, love it.Now: All is true, but there are some things you only learn after you tested it \"in the field\", not just looked at it. Because of the way its straps and a loop are made in one, it is not very comfortable on the neck. If you pull it appropriately, then it rubs against it like sandpaper. If you let it hang more, then the weight distributes wrong, it pushes below your waist on the back, and there is a gap between your back and the backpack. I felt like I wanted to cut deeper the straps/loop thing. Don't question my anatomy, 4 people tried it and said the same thing.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.20019954", "1": "0.2657849", "2": "0.2133574", "3": "0.042799477", "4": "0.110817544", "5": "0.073273905", "6": "0.09376723"}}
