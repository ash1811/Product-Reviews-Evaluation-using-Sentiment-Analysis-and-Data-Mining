{"text": "This is another one of those cased where it's a shot in the dark getting the sizing right. I took a chance and got it right, now I hope this helps you. I normally wear size 10.5 in dress and casual shoe and size 11 in running shoe. I ordered the size 10.5 and the size was just right. I can't figure out the color, they say the color is Black, but they look more like a very dark brown.They are comfortable and will be a good casual shoe. Great buy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06824853", "1": "0.4144324", "2": "0.15423208", "3": "0.05322324", "4": "0.031700548", "5": "0.07340199", "6": "0.20476124"}}
