{"text": "These Aqua Sanuk Yoga Mat flip flops are my fourth pair. Eventually I want one in every color! The Aqua color, in my opinion, has more of a green hue than a blue one, but that is fine by me. The sole is dark brown. These Sanuk's feel great from the first flip and flop. Once they have been worn for awhile, they are a little looser, as expected with most shoes. Some reviewers have reported that these flip flops get smelly. I have not had that experience. I don't wear the same pair for days on end and I do clean them with a damp cloth or an anti/bac wipe on occasion.I will buy these flip flops over and over.And over.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.0629378", "1": "0.3243004", "2": "0.21857032", "3": "0.15037335", "4": "0.084126174", "5": "0.10457282", "6": "0.055119123"}}
