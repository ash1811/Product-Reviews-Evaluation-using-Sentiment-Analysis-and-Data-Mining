{"text": "My wife and I normally never carry on any luggage when traveling, but since a lot of the airlines have started charging for bags, we are now carrying on as much as we can per their rules.  After a lot of research, these bags were our choice and we are very satisfied with them.  Plenty of room, easy to move around, very versatile and well made.  We are very tough consumers, and they have impressed us both.I use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products. I do this so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product. You can look at my review which will be close to my purchase date and tell how the product is doing as time passes.  I am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very own.UPDATE: 5 years later and thousands and thousands of miles, these bags are still going.  Even though the edges are somewhat smoothed the bags are still in good condition and we do not hesitate to use them.  Excellent product.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03898126", "1": "0.2335397", "2": "0.13981114", "4": "0.21407387", "5": "0.25261068", "6": "0.11827959"}}
