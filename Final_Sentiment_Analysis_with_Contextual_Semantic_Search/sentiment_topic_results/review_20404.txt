{"text": "Ever buy a pair of shoes that are a PERFECT fit and after a few months you SWEAR your feet have shrunk or one of your fat footed friend MUST HAVE tried on your shoes?? Or maybe it's just winter and your feet have shrunk from the cold. Yeh, been there, and chucked the shoes.DON'T MAKE THAT MISTAKE EVER AGAIN.I bought these insoles as a means to keep my feet from slipping and sliding as they were a hazzard walking down a road and my shoe was going to fall off. Since using these, my shoes fit. The insoles stay in place and i don't have to worry about tripping because my shoes feel too big.Only con - they're kinda pricey!! But I guess it's better to fix my shoe then to have to buy another pair - especially when you've got a pair that you LOVE!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0861403", "1": "0.19037056", "2": "0.12936413", "3": "0.17940283", "4": "0.25883684", "5": "0.09354705", "6": "0.062338304"}}
