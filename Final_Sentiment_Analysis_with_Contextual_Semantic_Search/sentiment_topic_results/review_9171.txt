{"text": "I bought these for my husband, he tried to put them on, and they wouldn't budge. He wears a 10 in mens, that is what I ordered, but the sizes seem to run VERY SMALL. I'm keeping these, I'm a 10 in womens, so if you are going to order these I would order 1-2 sizes up. Very comfy and warm though, pleased even though I was not the intended reciever.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.23760839", "1": "0.2421501", "3": "0.23193564", "4": "0.23831078", "6": "0.04203764"}}
