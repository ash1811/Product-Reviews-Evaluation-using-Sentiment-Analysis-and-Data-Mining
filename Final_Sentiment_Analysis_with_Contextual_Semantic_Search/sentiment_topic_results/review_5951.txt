{"text": "I was a bit skeptical about buying a bra on the Internet, especially since I wasn't sure what size to get after reading all the reviews. I decided to stick to my regular size, 32b. I got in the mail fairly quickly, and it was great! It fits pretty well, and gives me the perfect amount of lift, without being uncomfortable, or weird. The only bad thing about this, was the bottom part was very tight. I am 5'6 and 110 pounds, and it makes me look like I have love handles. I would definitely recommend getting a size up in size, but not the cup.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.47428435", "2": "0.15666042", "3": "0.31713203", "5": "0.043961927"}}
