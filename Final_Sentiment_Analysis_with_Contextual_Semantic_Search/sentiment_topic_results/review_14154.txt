{"text": "I am a 5'8&#34; tall woman.  I clarify this because it fits me, lengthwise, just a couple of inches above my ankles.  If you are petite, I do not recommend this robe.  Sure, you could have it shortened, and that is a great option.  But, also, since it is unisex, the shoulders are broader than a woman's robe.  All of that said, I absolutely love this robe.  It is heavy and warm, just what I wanted for winter.  It is also beautiful.  I got the robe in blue and the colors are true to the picture.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16860026", "1": "0.2557906", "2": "0.07626909", "3": "0.079219416", "4": "0.22947611", "5": "0.0928907", "6": "0.09775386"}}
