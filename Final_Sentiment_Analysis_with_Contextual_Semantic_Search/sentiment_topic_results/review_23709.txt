{"text": "My husband is a Texas cowboy and wears boots almost every day.  He swears by Hanes socks.  He's heck on them but they hold up as expected.  I stock up on them for him, when Amazon runs a sale on them every year or so.  I wear them with my cowgirl boots, too, when I'm out of my socks (with jeans to cover them up, of course).", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.18207653", "2": "0.17285265", "3": "0.18526024", "4": "0.22453384", "5": "0.22708727"}}
