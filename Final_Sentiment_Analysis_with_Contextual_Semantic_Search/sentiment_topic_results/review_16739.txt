{"text": "I am 5'2&#34; (barely) and 125 pounds. My body type is average with more athletic (bigger) legs. I've always had issues getting jeans to fit my thighs/calves. I usually have had to get a bigger size and they'd be too big at the waistLucky jeans are the first brand of jeans that truly fit my body style and they are versatile so they fit a lot of different body types, too. I'm a big fan of the Lola Boot cut and the Sweet n Low styles. These jeans are not an exception.They are stretchy enough to accommodate my legs and fit nicely around my midsection. They don't grab anything or make anything &#34;spill&#34; over the top-- they have a nice stretch which flatters. There is a slight flare at the bottom of the legs of the jeans which I would say is a bit more than a normal boot cut jean, but I like it especially since I have larger calves-- it draws the attention away from them. The Lola boot cut are more like a traditional bootcut in my opinion. These are more like mid-rise jeans (not low cut as the name implies) so you don't have to worry about the derriere making any appearances even when you bend over.As for length-- I'm short (5'2&#34;) and their &#34;ankle&#34; cut option is good for flats or even a slight heel.As for size-- I am normally a size 2 or 4 in jeans and knowing Lucky Brand, I always go to the higher end because they often run a bit small. So I got the 27 with a 30&#34; inseam and it fits perfectly.The color is true to the picture and the jeans are very soft and comfortable to wear. I'd definitely recommend them!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08125614", "1": "0.22320473", "2": "0.11064019", "3": "0.18524705", "4": "0.04783811", "5": "0.23415776", "6": "0.11765599"}}
