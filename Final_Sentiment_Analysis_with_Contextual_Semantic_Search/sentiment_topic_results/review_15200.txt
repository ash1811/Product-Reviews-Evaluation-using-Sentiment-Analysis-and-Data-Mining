{"text": "Just purchased these to go hiking in Turkey.  I'm having some trouble adjusting to the deep molded pattern in the rubber footbed, but  assume there is a purpose to it and I will get used to them in time.I wear 6.5 extra wide athletic shoe and have had a lot of problems buying sport sandals, even other Keen sandals, which give a wide appearance but don't actually accommodate a wide foot.The 6.5 medium Venice is the best I've tried so far. There is a slight pinch on my little toe, but it has enough room for my high arches and a very comfortable backstrap.  These come in a wonderful variety of colors, which should make everyone happy,  Although most orders are fulfilled by Amazon, the price varies greatly depending on which size/color you choose.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11814062", "1": "0.28518423", "2": "0.06083553", "3": "0.14718041", "4": "0.053608514", "5": "0.26266357", "6": "0.07238716"}}
