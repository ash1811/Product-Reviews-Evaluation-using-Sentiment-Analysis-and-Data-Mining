{"text": "I'm a 38C but based on other reviews I ordered a 36C and that fits perfectly. I usually kick the bra off once I'm home for the night, but I forget I'm wearing this bra. It is so comfortable. It is comfortable for sleeping, supportive enough to wear to work, and pretty enough to feel feminine. I can wear it for mild to moderate exercise. I will have to order many more. I want to live in this bra.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05072268", "1": "0.34415132", "3": "0.40048838", "4": "0.090369076", "6": "0.10706649"}}
