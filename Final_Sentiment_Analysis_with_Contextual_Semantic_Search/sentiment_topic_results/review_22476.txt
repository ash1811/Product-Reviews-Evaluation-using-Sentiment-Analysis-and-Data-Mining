{"text": "I love Hanes underwear & this size and style fits me well so I'm a &#34;life customer&#34;  as I think they are better quality and fit than any others.  BUT the reason I bought these is because the photo shows pretty plain underwear - soft, light colored adult underwear & after traipsing through numerous stores all over, I'd come to the conclusion that they didn't exist anymore in size 6. I found plain Hanes bikini underwear in other sizes but never in size 6. I just received my package and despite the fact that I know they will fit, I'm really disappointed that they are purple polka dotted, bright pink, purple, black, paisley with one white pair. I know they are underwear, to be worn under your clothes but is it too much to ask for to expect plain, white, beige or even pastel colors, even if I ordered them that way? Good Grief!  I'm not going to send them back for this but I just wish the photos matched the product. I would be satisfied with the colors shown in the picture, even though they have muted patterns. BIG difference between Minnie Mouse polka dots & muted light blue.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08241335", "1": "0.3200327", "2": "0.07056279", "3": "0.37485874", "4": "0.057214104", "5": "0.039977398", "6": "0.05494092"}}
