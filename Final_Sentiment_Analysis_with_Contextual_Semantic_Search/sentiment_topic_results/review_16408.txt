{"text": "I purchased two pairs of the Reef Men's Phantoms Thong Sandals almost two years ago. These are comfortable and well constructed, although the bottom layer sole on one pair has started to seperate from the top. Otherwise they're in almost perfect condition. I've used them as shower shoes on occasion in some of the places I've worked and they hold up very well. These are comfortable and light. I wear a size 8 1/2 to 9 shoe and the size 9 Phantoms was a perfect fit for me.Please rate this review if you found it helpful.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.32828933", "2": "0.12144623", "3": "0.25825396", "5": "0.08148202", "6": "0.20558946"}}
