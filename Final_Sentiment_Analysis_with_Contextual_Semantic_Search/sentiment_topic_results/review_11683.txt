{"text": "I've been using rubber strap-ons, or better, streeeeetch-ons, for years.  They worked fine as long as I didn't try to climb over icy snow mounds or hike through the woods since, if I got stuck on a root or hung up on hidden ice chunks, I'd suddenly find myself without the cleats.  Finding the missing one was one thing, but getting it back on without falling over (there's never any tree to lean against when needed) was a different issue all together.  Plus they tended to slide around on the boot and I'd end up walking on only half a row.So I decided to give these Stabilizers a try although I was a bit hesitant despite the great reviews.  Reason:  I was worried that snow would pile in between boot and Stabilizer and make for heavy, possibly sloshy walking.  Not so at all!I had to undergo a complete knee replacement revision just two months ago, my second knee replacement surgery in 15 months, so needless to say, I have to be careful not to suddenly twist the operated leg since a fracture could spell disaster.  But I'm an outdoor person, not a couch potato, and I love going out in ice and snow and hike with our dog and hope to even snowshoe again this winter.  Right now, however, with the first storms bearing down on us in the Northeast, and lots of ice and crusty snow on the ground out in the woods and meadows, these Stabilizers are a God-send.  Yesterday I even ran a little here and there with them on uneven ice, that's how well they perform (just don't tell my surgeon...).  I would NOT have attempted that with the old stretch-ons, but these things stay put and make me feel safe as can be.  These have no carbide points; rather, they are solid steel round screwlike studs with a hollow center, and the outer, grooved ring of each stud bites into ice securely.  I used to slip a tad with the carbide points, but not once, not even a tiny bit, with these.Great product, velcro fasteners are easy to use, highly recommend for anyone who needs or wants to be out when it's icy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13789074", "1": "0.18532719", "2": "0.10579219", "3": "0.19505686", "4": "0.07985218", "5": "0.17788951", "6": "0.11819138"}}
