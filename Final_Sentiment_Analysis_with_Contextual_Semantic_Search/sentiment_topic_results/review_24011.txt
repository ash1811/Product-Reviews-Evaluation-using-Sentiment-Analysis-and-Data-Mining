{"text": "I'm very impressed with the quality of these socks.  They're nice and thick and well made.  For the price point, I was expecting something much thinner.  If I have one small gripe, it's that the uppers are pretty tight around the ankle/shin/lower calf.  I have pretty skinny legs, so if you have thicker legs it may bother you pretty bad, since it bothers me some.  They should stretch out with use, so not a big deal for me.  I don't often wear socks in the summer, so I imaging these will last a good long time.  I'll update when I find out.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.102515586", "1": "0.46226677", "3": "0.10032764", "4": "0.116124295", "5": "0.12393794", "6": "0.092216924"}}
