{"text": "Quality is very good.  Comfortable except that size is at least a half size too small.  Didn't realize it until it was too late.  Sucks you can't return shoes once you wear them outside.  My big to is sore after 8 hours of wear.  I have been wearing size 11 for 40 years.  Most other size 11  shoes fit fine.  I just bought another similar Merrell walking shoe 1/2 size larger.  It amazes me how 1/3 of the reviews say it is too small, 1/3 it is too large and the rest perfect fit.  Just ordered a different Merrell style.  I know a lot of people who have Merrell's so I hope my new pair is  a good fit.  Will review them once broken in.
