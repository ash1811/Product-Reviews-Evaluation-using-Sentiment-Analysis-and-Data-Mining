{"text": "I've been looking for a pair of black boots for a while and I'm glad I got these. The heel height (2.5 inches) is high enough for me. I've been wearing these in winter temperatures with socks and my feet have actually been warm (the ling is thin however). The rubber sole adds to the comfort. Point to note: I have slim calves and would have liked the opening to be a little smaller, if worn with jeans it's not as noticeably large.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.040023338", "1": "0.19602825", "2": "0.1276688", "3": "0.4054951", "4": "0.11529329", "6": "0.112363845"}}
