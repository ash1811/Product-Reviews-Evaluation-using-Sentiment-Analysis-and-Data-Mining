{"text": "I do enjoy supporting American brands when possible so I could not pass up these AO aviators when I learned about them. I drive a 40 minute commute East in the morning and West in the evening so I need a good reliable daily driver pair of sunglasses. These are excellent for this purpose! Not only are they stylish with clean good looks but they are very comfortable and robust. The metal frames feel strong and the lenses are clear and provide great coverage. I opted for the all black model this time but I will be purchasing the gold frames next. I have never had a pair of glasses with the bayonet style arms on them and I was very surprised at how comfortable they are. Much nicer than the spatula type temples which can sometimes fatigue my ears after long use. I can also see the value in the bayonet style for those who wear a hat or helmet; much easier to put on and take off. All in all, I am impressed with these glasses and AO has a new customer: me!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11466915", "1": "0.19826244", "2": "0.21159619", "3": "0.24013087", "4": "0.03032949", "5": "0.044271376", "6": "0.16074051"}}
