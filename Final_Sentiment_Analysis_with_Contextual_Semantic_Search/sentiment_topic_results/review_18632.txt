{"text": "I have many brands of these things. Some had issues. The Rothco's faired better than others.The Rothco shemaghs came in and the stitching was as expected. Its not a tight stitched nor heavy garment and isn't meant to be. If you wash these the stitches will &#34;plump&#34; and it will make the material feel rough which I hate. I suggest hand washing only and hang drying. The material is thin enough for this to be a non issue even indoors. One of the pluses I had with these was a lack of smell attached to the product. Other brands I got just flat out got their stank on. These did not stink. I haven't gotten into washing them either, but an issue I also had with others was the dye bleeding badly. I suggest a thorough hand wash to check for dye bleed upon receiving any of this type of product just in case.Overall: material is thick enough but I'd like thicker, stitching is fine, colors are true to picture, size is true", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.16885903", "2": "0.13735263", "3": "0.14328845", "4": "0.2406459", "5": "0.1289578", "6": "0.17833017"}}
