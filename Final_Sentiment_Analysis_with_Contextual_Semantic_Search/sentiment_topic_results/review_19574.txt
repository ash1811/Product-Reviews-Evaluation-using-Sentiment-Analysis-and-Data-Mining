{"text": "I did not buy this bra on Amazon but wanted to weigh in on all the hype after trying it out for myself. I have a small frame - usually size 2-4 in women's clothes - but with an unusual bra size (30FF or 32F). Most bras, even if they look pretty in a sample photo, look matronly once you get into the larger cup sizes. This one is definitely different. The Dream Tisha Lace bra has a youthful yet sexy look while still providing full coverage and exceptional support. It gives a nice, smooth line under clothes and is very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Plunge bra styles in larger cup sizes will look nice but too much falling out in the course of normal day-to-day activities keep that style from really working as an everyday bra. This one provides all the support I need and still makes me feel pretty wearing it. To be honest, the whole \"Oprah's best bra\" hype was a turn off and kept me from trying this for some time. I'm glad I relented and gave it a try. I am very happy and surprised with this bra and will definitely buy more.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07314169", "1": "0.23803565", "2": "0.121233545", "3": "0.45404294", "4": "0.07006216", "6": "0.04137583"}}
