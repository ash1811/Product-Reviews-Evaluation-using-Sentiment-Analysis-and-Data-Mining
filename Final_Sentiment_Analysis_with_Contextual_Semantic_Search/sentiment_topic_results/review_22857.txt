{"text": "I was looking for a set of laces to replace my laces for the Air Jordan III.  My last purchase of KIWI brand laces were good but incorrect in size, unfortunately they did not have 45 inch available and so I went with SOF SOLE.  I picked up both black and white 45 inch FLAT laces.  The first thing I notice are that these laces are slightly wider that the original laces, secondly the design is different and lastly, the color is off and does not match, especially the white (TOO WHITE).Based on the overall marketing of these (I see these laces everywhere), I assumed these would be a perfect match but alas, no, they weren't.The KIWI brand laces matched closest to the AIR JORDAN III laces if you can find it in 45 inches or less. Nike's website also sell some laces I just hate the fact that laces should be cheap but add shipping and they become overpriced..  These SOF SOLES are in my opinion overpriced for the quality.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13066669", "1": "0.20254695", "2": "0.10363841", "3": "0.110134006", "4": "0.120486416", "5": "0.19081286", "6": "0.14171469"}}
