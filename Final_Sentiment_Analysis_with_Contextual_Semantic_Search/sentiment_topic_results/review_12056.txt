{"text": "I've had this product for about 9 months now. I love it, as I considered my guardian angel of my dad to watch over me. I planned to wear in on my wedding day but as I went to put it on I noticed that all the the silver \"coating\" is bubbling and will be peeling off soon. I have taken impeccable care of this item. When I wasn't wearing it, it was always hung up in a safe, dry place so why it is bubbling can only be attributed to a cheap product. I am very disappointed, as this meant the world to me, yet now I am scared to even wear it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22576718", "1": "0.12272522", "2": "0.06682439", "3": "0.08720312", "4": "0.06468477", "5": "0.30089805", "6": "0.13189729"}}
