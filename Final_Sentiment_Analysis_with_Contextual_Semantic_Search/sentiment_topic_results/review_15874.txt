{"text": "I wear size 34D and this bra fits me well.  The material is soft and silky.  The straps are adjustable and on the shoulder area there is a soft padding so that the straps don't dig into your skin.  The cups are not padded but there is a lot of support.  Overall this bra is a basic yet comfortable one and for the price, you can't go wrong.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.062286407", "1": "0.34099042", "2": "0.17180488", "3": "0.20180166", "4": "0.05026923", "5": "0.11295192", "6": "0.059895445"}}
