{"text": "I ordered 6 of these bags for my bridesmaids.  Even though they shipped together in the same box, each one was charged $4 in shipping.  So while the bag was only $4, it was a total of $8 per bag.  I didn't think that was a bad price until I received the bags and felt how cheap they are.  Very thin.  Will work for a beach bag and I am not returning them since they are gifts, but I would not buy more unless they get the shipping down to an acceptable level.  $8 for this bag is WAYYYY too much for the quality delivered.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.22632374", "1": "0.47432697", "4": "0.21917683", "5": "0.07119478"}}
