{"text": "I hate shoes - I will wear flip flops all day long and suffer thru the pain and stiffness. I used to hobble around when I got up in the mornings.These shoes are amazing. Wearing these instead of flat flip flops and my heal pain and stiffness is gone.I got them soaked in flooding, which concerned me - they weren't AS wonderful after they got soaked - it messes with the cork obviously, but they're still wonderful. I've had them almost a year now, and just now had to put the latch thru another loop bc of stretching, but they still look brand new and I wear them nearly every day.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.12739731", "2": "0.29855552", "3": "0.1461525", "4": "0.14470822", "5": "0.18870017", "6": "0.092098035"}}
