{"text": "I got this for my 6 yr. old son, even though it is big, it is really lightweight. The straps are great, there are plenty of pockets and the 2 main compartments make it easy to carry school work and separate gear.It looks better than the picture and he got lots of compliments. It will be good for him for a long time. The price was great for a Jansport pack.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1199443", "1": "0.43088904", "2": "0.12878163", "3": "0.11564576", "4": "0.13092718", "6": "0.07002222"}}
