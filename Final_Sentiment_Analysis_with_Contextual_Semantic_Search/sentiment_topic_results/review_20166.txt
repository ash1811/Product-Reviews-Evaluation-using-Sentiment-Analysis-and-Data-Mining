{"text": "This is an awesome piece. The main compartment is roomy enough for many days worth of clothing. I fit almost a week's worth as well as 2 Christmas present in the main compartment. I love the versatility as well. The whole thing can become a backpack, which is wild. It rolls well and smoothly. Perhaps my favorite part is the small backpack attached the front of the pieice. It has lots of pockets and nooks and crannies which I am crazy about. Whether the attached backpack is on or off, the piece looks normal. It doesn't look like something is missing if you take it off. In fact, I originally bought this piece in store (paid way too much) and didn't even notice that the front backpack was missing!I bought this because I had a Swiss Gear carry-on stolen (another piece I loved) and had to find a replacement. They discontinued that Swiss Gear model, to my dismay. My brother has a huge High Sierra suitcase that he is crazy about. So I bought this. My fiance and I have registered for a full High Sierra set.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09347876", "1": "0.30877462", "2": "0.13258311", "3": "0.20214957", "4": "0.09174929", "5": "0.09185878", "6": "0.0794059"}}
