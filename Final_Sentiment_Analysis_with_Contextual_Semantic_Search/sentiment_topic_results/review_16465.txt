{"text": "I got these in the tortoiseshell color and like them a lot. They are just a wee bit tight on the sides of my head, but I have a large head and this is always an issue, which is an easy fix with the adjustment machine at my optometrist's office. They are probably fine for 99% of the population in that regard. I like that they are large enough to block a lot of light. They are definitely a bargain and the seller was very fast shipping them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.15229523", "2": "0.10882961", "3": "0.13294072", "4": "0.18374604", "5": "0.17815132", "6": "0.24026607"}}
