{"text": "Got someone who likes turquoise? They'll probably like these chip earrings.  I saw from a few other reviews that some people were dissatisfied with the color of the turquoise... I didn't have that problem. I gave these as a gift and the girl liked them; she thought they were probably around $10 so I suppose that's a win for me.I can't comment on how durable they are, but they look pretty good when she wears them.  They're a bit small, probably you only get 5 or 6 chips per earring, but they work for a simple accessory.  If you want something a bit more elegant (and a bit more expensive) I would recommend these:Sterling Silver Double Oval Drop Earrings.Thanks for reading :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.23609932", "1": "0.37242064", "2": "0.106058754", "3": "0.06729969", "4": "0.09360371", "6": "0.12236819"}}
