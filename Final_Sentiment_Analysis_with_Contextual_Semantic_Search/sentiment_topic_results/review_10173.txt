{"text": "I ordered these earrings as a gift. They are beautiful! They are packaged nicely. They may not be real crystals, but they sure shine like one! They sparkle under the light and pick up any surrounding colors. They have a very delicate, feminine look and are just beautiful. I almost want to keep them for myself!! :D  The clasp also seems very sturdy. For only $16, these earrings are a great bargain! They look much more expensive than what I paid! I know my friend will love them!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0586707", "1": "0.39900878", "2": "0.094275266", "3": "0.11745169", "4": "0.05669665", "5": "0.21157326", "6": "0.06232363"}}
