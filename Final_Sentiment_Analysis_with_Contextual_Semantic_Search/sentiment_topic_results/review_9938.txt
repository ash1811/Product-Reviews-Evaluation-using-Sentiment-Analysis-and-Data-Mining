{"text": "I am a fan of timex watches, but this watch is a dud.......My son had this watch two different times.  The first time his grandparents bought it for him.  He loved the watch and wore it daily.  The description says it is water proof, so I let him wear it while swimming.  It stopped working the minute he got it wet in the pool.  I felt bad since I had let him wear it (even though it stated it was waterproof) so I purchased another one for him so his grandparents wouldn't know it had gotten broken.  He only wore the second one for a few weeks, and it also stopped working.  This time it wasn't because of swimming, I don't know what caused it to quit working, but after that I called it quits with this watch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17419328", "1": "0.24871105", "2": "0.19106112", "3": "0.060055863", "4": "0.06850711", "5": "0.16406065", "6": "0.093410924"}}
