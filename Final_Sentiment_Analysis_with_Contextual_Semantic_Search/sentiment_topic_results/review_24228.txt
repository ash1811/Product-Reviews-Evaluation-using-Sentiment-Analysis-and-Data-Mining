{"text": "I purchased the other Glamorise Sports Bra that has the cami looking attached to it and loved it. I thought I would try this as well and I am so thrilled. I think this one is even more comfortable. It is not binding or making you feel like its cutting into your skin. I normally where a 40D but listened to another reviewer who said get a size up so I did. Am happy I listened. I put it on the second notch of hooks and it is perfect and I can go down to a 40 or up to a 42...just thrilled with this purchase. There are ALOT of hooks on the bra itself which was a little bit of a pain but its worth the extra effort hooking each one because I have never wore another sports bra(other than an old nike model) that is this comfortable and it(in my opinion makes it a minimizer) as I look a size smaller and even my husband thought so(and he normally does not comment) but I asked what he thought! And as far as those who would jog wearing it...it will do the job. I do not jog or run but I walk and I will not feel a big self conscious or uncofortable, in fact it makes me want to work out more knowing I won't have to feel self conscious of others staring at me! Thanks Amazon & Glamorise for making a bra that is not only comfortable but is not ugly...it is a bra you can wear for any occasion! I am wearing it now, ha ha! Its that comfortable and I would not say so if it wasn't!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.34742022", "2": "0.09193788", "3": "0.21630128", "4": "0.06531538", "5": "0.19735886", "6": "0.07885882"}}
