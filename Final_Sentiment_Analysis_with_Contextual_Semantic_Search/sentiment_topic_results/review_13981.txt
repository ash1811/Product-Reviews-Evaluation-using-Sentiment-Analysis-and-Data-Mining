{"text": "Perfect for my son to wear when he started college.  Numbers are big and easy to read without interference with all the unnecessary fancy chronograph dials.  Basic in style and appropriate for casual or dress.  LOVE the fact that it doesn't need batteries.  Feel more secure that it won't suddenly stop and screw up time reading for the day.  Also hate having the hassle of buying so many batteries for our watches and the danger of not doing it quick enough to avoid battery leakage.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.024862858", "1": "0.29462525", "2": "0.044780694", "3": "0.13792977", "4": "0.18049352", "5": "0.16807859", "6": "0.14922933"}}
