{"text": "The watch arrived after 7 days since I placed the order, the reason for the delay is because I used free shipping. The looks of the face of the watch is really impressive, however the steel band has a cheap feel to it. The steel strap is not brushed and has some sharp edges to it.I had to spend $5 at the jeweler to adjust the steel strap. I usually wear it on Mondays since it has the blue face. Monday blues I guess.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.26646912", "1": "0.06775043", "2": "0.3138313", "3": "0.07924408", "4": "0.1919378", "6": "0.07757977"}}
