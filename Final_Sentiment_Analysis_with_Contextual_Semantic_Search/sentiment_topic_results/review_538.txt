{"text": "Having recently lost weight-and not being able to purchase 'off the shelf' at our local Post Exchange in South Korea because of my inseam length - Amazon Prime again came through with the right size and a quality product.I purchased another well known brand - and found immediate durability issues - with the rear pocket tearing away from the seat - as I keep my smart phone tucked back there.This jean used much heavier denim fabric and I expect much better durability.
