{"text": "I gave these size medium sweats a three star rating because they are warm and I like the Oxford color. The closed bottom are a bit tight for my taste. I'm 5' 3\". Me personally, I like a more loose closed bottom so that my pants fit over my shoe a certain way. These comfortably hug my ankles but I don't care for this particular style. The fit is rather loose in waist and legs though. I bought two sets and washed and tumbled dried each piece and they did not pill and the inside remained soft. I will wear these only around the house and to bed.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08973842", "1": "0.30421874", "2": "0.09917142", "3": "0.11682922", "4": "0.16109395", "5": "0.083723806", "6": "0.14522445"}}
