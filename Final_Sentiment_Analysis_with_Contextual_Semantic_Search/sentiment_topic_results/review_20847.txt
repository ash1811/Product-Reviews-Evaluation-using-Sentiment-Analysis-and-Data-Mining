{"text": "These are the best flip flops ever.  I can wear them traveling  - walking a LOT.  No shin splints or sore feet even when I'm running.  They are sturdy and well made.  ***NOT Made in China***This is my 3rd pair and I'm stocking up.  They were really hard to find locally and my first 2 pairs lasted several years.  The first pair was chewed by dogs....and the 2nd pair is carefully guarded.I can't wait to get the other colors I've ordered!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16251703", "1": "0.26262882", "2": "0.14592275", "3": "0.19165446", "4": "0.12339699", "5": "0.061036937", "6": "0.052843012"}}
