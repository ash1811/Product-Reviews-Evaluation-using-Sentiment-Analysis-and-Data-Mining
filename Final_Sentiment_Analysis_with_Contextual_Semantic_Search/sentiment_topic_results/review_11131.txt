{"text": "I love this boot!!!  Fits as expected  and kept me warm which was totally unexpected.  I also like the color which is heavy cream color rather than the pinkish color shown in the picture.  They match my coat.  I've had such poor luck with boots in the past.  I was out today in 10degree F weather with 40mph winds.  The ONLY part of me that was not cold were my feet.  Toasty all day long.  I thoroughly recommend these boots.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09215249", "1": "0.30213237", "2": "0.1044033", "3": "0.1544648", "4": "0.26793665", "6": "0.07549919"}}
