{"text": "A friend bought me a pair of sand-colored, regular-height Uggs for my birthday last year, and I love them, especially in this nice fall weather.  They're so warm, soft and comfy ... perfect for tramping around the neighborhood, admiring the changing leaves and winter scenery.Since I never tuck my jeans inside the boots, I saw this shorter length and decided they would be even more practical.  I was already sold on the comfort, so decided to go for variety of color.I chose distressed blue--perfect complement to jeans--and when I strolled over to the park, I was the envy of all my friends. I hope they make these in pink, like the regular height. I can't wait to get another pair.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.02335691", "1": "0.27615017", "2": "0.05314162", "3": "0.1352361", "4": "0.1060721", "5": "0.27120546", "6": "0.13483763"}}
