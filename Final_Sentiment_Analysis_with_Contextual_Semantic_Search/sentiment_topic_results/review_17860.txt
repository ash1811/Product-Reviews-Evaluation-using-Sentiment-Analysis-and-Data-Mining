{"text": "I was really surprised to find a Casio watch available for such a low price but Amazon always has the lowest prices around.  The watch is stylish and exactly the right size for me.  It isn't overly large or covered in sparkly things.  It's just a simple watch on a silver band which is exactly what I wanted.  I have worn it every day since receiving it and have not had any problems at all.  Several people have complimented me and asked where I got it which is always nice.  The clasp seems to be quite secure which I really like. My old watch had a clasp that was always coming apart so it dropped off my wrist on many occasions.  If you don't like a loose watch, you will probably need to have a link or two removed because it is loose on my wrist but I happen to like my watch a bit loose.  Overall, this watch is a great value and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.099403106", "1": "0.21760656", "2": "0.17062694", "3": "0.100534074", "4": "0.12242664", "5": "0.06936283", "6": "0.22003986"}}
