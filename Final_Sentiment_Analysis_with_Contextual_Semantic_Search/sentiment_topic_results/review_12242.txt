{"text": "I bought these for a brief hospital stay and since I have never had a proper pair of slippers, I got these to match my pjs. They are VERY comfortable. I got the 9 and it is a little big but I usually wear an 8 1/2 so I expected that. The sole is thick and sturdy..it feels like you could safely wear the slippers outside as well. And the fabric is sooooo soft and luxurious. Very good buy!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.036011815", "1": "0.31434926", "3": "0.19631268", "4": "0.122351624", "5": "0.13495679", "6": "0.19253014"}}
