{"text": "These boots are great for what they were made for. I bought these for my husband to go fishing in and they will be great for that or just wearing outside in the mud, when needed, but keep in mind the size runs large. I read the reviews on that from previous buyers, but took my chances since shoes are so difficult to decide on. Great quality, but keep size in mind. My husband wears a 9.5 and I bought a size 10 and it was a full size too big. So, maybe stick with the original size and don't go up a size just because it's a boot (which is what I typically do).Otherwise, they seemed great and was dissapointed to have to send them back.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1318345", "1": "0.24892683", "2": "0.04149965", "3": "0.30954418", "4": "0.11454784", "5": "0.06827048", "6": "0.08537651"}}
