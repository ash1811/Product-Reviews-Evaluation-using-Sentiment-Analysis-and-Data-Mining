{"text": "We bought a pair of these for a two-week trip with cross-country air travel and several hundred of miles by car. They are lightweight, durable and held all our clothes plus a child's travel cot.The bag rolls very easily. The zippers are strong and the straps provide additional support to keep it closed. The backstrap feature is great for lugging luggage up stairs in places that have no elevators or if you are pushing a stroller. It will go over the weight limit if you expand it but if you are traveling by car, these bags fit well side to side in any trunk and expand vertically as needed. If you're traveling with children the shape of these are especially good - we were able to fit an umbrella stroller as well (they're all similar in size and shape).There was only minor damage from a major puncture caused by the airline, which was stopped in its tracks by the thick rubber-like padded lining on top of this duffel (I didn't even notice it until I saw how well it protected the contents). If I had used any other duffel, the contents would have been damaged, so I'm very happy about this. The small tear on top doesn't affect performance and can be easily patched.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14689346", "1": "0.12560593", "2": "0.119360454", "3": "0.15860282", "4": "0.09909177", "5": "0.2148978", "6": "0.1355478"}}
