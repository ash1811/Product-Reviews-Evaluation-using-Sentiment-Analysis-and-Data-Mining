{"text": "This shirt is so great. The fabric feels amazing. It is 100% polyester (according to the tag) and has a silky feel to it. The fabric is matte and not shiny. The only issue I have with it is the fabric by the seams inside the pockets is fraying, but it said it was machine-washable, so I'm hoping it will last a while. The sleeves are long sleeves when not rolled up, they aren't 3/4 length sleeves. I got the Ink color, which looks so cool, it is a true steel-blue. The zipper pockets are big and I can fit my phone in it nicely. It is a longer length, hits around the top of the thighs, which is very flattering in my opinion if your hips are not the slimmest. Now for the size. I measured out the size small laying flat and this is what I came up with.Size small measurements:39.5 inch bust39 inch waist44 inch hip area28 1/2 inches long in backI did measure the size XS too but forgot to write it down. I think it was an inch smaller in each measurement. I ended up with the size XS because it looked like a better size, but the sizing on this is rather silly, because I'm quite sure no one would consider me an extra-small person in real life. I am 5 5 1/2 inches tall, and 140lbs with very large hips compared to my waist for the record. Anyway, this shirt is a new favorite and I would describe it as casually sophisticated. Highly recommended.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0380915", "1": "0.31828937", "2": "0.059468817", "3": "0.1442489", "4": "0.03648383", "5": "0.1541116", "6": "0.24930596"}}
