{"text": "I'm not usually a girly girl but I've wanted this style for a while. I wanted red but I decided to go with something more neutral to start with so I got the beige-y gold. Loved it upon arrival. Delivery was FAST. Packaging was great. I ordered a size 8 as that is my size; I did notice it was one of those 8's that runs on the smaller size of 8 as opposed to the larger side. It differs with every shoe so it is NOT unwearable by any means; will just need a wee bit of breaking in. HOWEVER, if you're normally very snug in an 8 than I'd try a 8.5. But yes, as I said, the 8 is definitely wearable; I just wear it around the house to break it in ;) seems to be working so far! Very cute and feminine shoe.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.083399974", "1": "0.2776409", "2": "0.14524876", "3": "0.15530713", "4": "0.08714813", "5": "0.08853402", "6": "0.16272105"}}
