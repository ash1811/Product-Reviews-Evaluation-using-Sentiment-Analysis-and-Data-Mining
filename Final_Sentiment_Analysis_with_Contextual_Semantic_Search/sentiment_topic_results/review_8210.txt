{"text": "This fits about as snugly as I expected for a medium, but the torso is really short. I could wear this as a layering piece, but it barely skims the top of my pants (normal pants, not lowriders) so if I sit or bend over, my belly is exposed. I'm fairly fit and 5'6&#34;, but don't consider this to be a normal length of shirt. Would not be comfortable for me to wear as a top by itself because of this. I'm returning it to try the large- it was snug enough in the rest of the fit that I think it will still be flattering, but I'm hoping it will add some needed length.The shelf bra was comfortable and the stiching around the neck was nice- in the picture it looks like it may be a blue or grey color, but the tread was all white and was a nice casual style that could be dressed up with a scarf or layered top or would be sporty with sweats or jeans by itself.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17835763", "1": "0.3255203", "3": "0.1952035", "4": "0.088323556", "5": "0.038230147", "6": "0.1718037"}}
