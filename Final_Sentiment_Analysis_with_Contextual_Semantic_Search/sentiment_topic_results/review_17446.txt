{"text": "I'm a major Converse fan, I like to collect them in all different colors, why not pink? I already knew my Converse size from the other Chuck Taylor colors I already owned, so sizing wasn't an issue at all, even though most of my other Converse are low-cut Oxfords. The high-tops can take a little more work to get onto your feet, but it's worth it I think for the high-top style. And the pink is a nice subdued shade, not a gaudy hot pink or anything like that. Definitely recommended for both women and men who are secure enough in themselves to go out and about wearing pink Converse. They look great.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.032248903", "1": "0.21489696", "2": "0.25527617", "3": "0.1545117", "4": "0.09236887", "5": "0.11472103", "6": "0.13597637"}}
