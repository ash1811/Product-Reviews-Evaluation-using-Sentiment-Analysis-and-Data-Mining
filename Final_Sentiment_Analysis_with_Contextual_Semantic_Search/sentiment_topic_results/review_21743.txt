{"text": "As with all of these Melissa & Doug magnetic dress-up sets, the doll and her outfits are beautiful, brightly colored, and well-made. And also like all the others, this one has no lid. Why? Why oh why? The pieces wind up all over my house because I have no way to close the box. Considering it's so well made in every other way, I don't understand why they didn't just add a clear plastic lid. Could it have added that much to the manufacturing cost?My 2-year-old daughter loves playing with her, though I admit that her interest has dwindled. In the beginning (about 5 months ago), this was one of her very favorite toys. After 3-4 months, the interest lessened, though this set still comes out to play sometimes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09387689", "1": "0.21563552", "2": "0.13492192", "3": "0.12214815", "4": "0.20813748", "5": "0.09566262", "6": "0.12961742"}}
