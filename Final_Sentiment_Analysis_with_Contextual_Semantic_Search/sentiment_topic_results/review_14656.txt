{"text": "I'm a large size (34 E) and have a Panache sports bra that I absolutely love, so I was surprised to find that I didn't care for this bra at all.The band is not large enough to support a larger bust, the straps offer no help either (although the band should do the work anyway.)  The cups themselves had a strange shape, shallow but large, sort of pushing things down on your chest.  This actually worked as a minimizer, so in that way it could be beneficial.  But with the poor support, I wouldn't want to wear this bra in public.It was comfortable -- that and the minimizing were it's good points.  Other than that, a waste of money for me.  It would probably work well for a C-D cup or smaller.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16718587", "1": "0.048368536", "2": "0.15885088", "3": "0.34344462", "4": "0.109304085", "6": "0.17037292"}}
