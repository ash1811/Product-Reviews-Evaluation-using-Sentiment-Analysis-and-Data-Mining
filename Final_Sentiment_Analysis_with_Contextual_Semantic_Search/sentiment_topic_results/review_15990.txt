{"text": "I got these sandals after reading numerous reviews raving about them.  I personally don't find them to be off the chart.  They are bit stiff and even though there is a rough bottom to them, I feel like they are kind of slippery on some surfaces.  They aren't completely uncomfortable but I've definitely owned more comfortable sandals for less money.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08182244", "1": "0.20557632", "2": "0.13095652", "3": "0.288606", "4": "0.083344124", "5": "0.15292643", "6": "0.056768235"}}
