{"text": "This is my wife's second pair of keens, the first was of similar style. These are work shoes for her in a job that has her on her feet some. She says they are the finest shoes she has ever had in her life. The first pair lasted about 3 years, when the finally wore out she went to a cheaper leather tennis shoe. Within a week her feet were constantly sore. In the past she had tried many different shoes, but I think this Keen shoe will be the last brand she ever wants or buys. You simply cannot go wrong on these shoes, at least in this style. For the price worth every penny.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.052958585", "1": "0.2158551", "2": "0.22768413", "3": "0.14341243", "4": "0.22938772", "6": "0.12827083"}}
