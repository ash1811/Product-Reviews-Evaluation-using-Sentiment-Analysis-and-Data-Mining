{"text": "Good bargain schemagh. They are lightweight and a light weave but cheap enough that you can buy another one if you wear it out. It will work as a winter scarf despite being thin. When rolled and doubled up it keeps out the wind. Since it is cotton it will pull heat from your neck/body when wet. That can be a benefit in the summer but if it gets wet from melted snow in the winter its a disadvantage. Overall satisfied. My original one is holding up well but I have yet to Machine wash it. More to come.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10753265", "1": "0.30617228", "2": "0.08795306", "3": "0.08629521", "4": "0.11953336", "5": "0.22640567", "6": "0.06610779"}}
