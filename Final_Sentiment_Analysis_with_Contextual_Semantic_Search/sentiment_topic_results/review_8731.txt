{"text": "This Casio watch is about the fifth Casio I have owned. I like them all, but some more than others. This has a more reasonable profile than other watches that have a few more functions. I like the ease of setting the alarms on this watch. It is far easier to use than the TeleMemo 30 model which has an additional two daily alarms. The only drawback is that the watchband is a little smaller than others, so it has a snug fit. This was surprising since I have other Casio watches which have longer bands, and more adjustable clasps.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12862067", "1": "0.07730698", "2": "0.23893633", "3": "0.12569608", "4": "0.19241524", "6": "0.23369811"}}
