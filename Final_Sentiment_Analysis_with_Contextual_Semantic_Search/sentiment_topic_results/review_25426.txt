{"text": "My husband wears a size 13 narrow, and he has a hard time keeping the heels from slipping off or the heel shifting wearing on the sides.  These fit very well.  I ordered them for my husband and he is very fussy.  He likes the fit, loves the look.  AND his orthodics fit with plenty of room for his feet.  Definitely order again.
