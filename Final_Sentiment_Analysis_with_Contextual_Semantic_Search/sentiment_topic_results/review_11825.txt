{"text": "I got these as a gift for myself, great quality, sturdy, comfortable to wear, I don't even feel they're there! They're a bit bigger than I expected, maybe next time I'll go for the smaller thicker ones on offer here at Amazon (if they go on sale! hint hint!) Even with my long curly hair they show. I'm very satisfied.Update: More than a year later and these earrings are perfect, I even sleep with them. They get mega abuse and they're still going strong.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12622271", "1": "0.2868673", "2": "0.055377115", "3": "0.2674187", "4": "0.15905371", "5": "0.10235387"}}
