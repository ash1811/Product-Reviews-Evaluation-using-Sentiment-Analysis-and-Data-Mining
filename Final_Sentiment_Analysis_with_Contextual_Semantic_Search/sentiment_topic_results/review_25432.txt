{"text": "I ordered these slippers for my husband as a birthday gift. I assumed that I would receive new slippers. However, when I opened the shipping box I immediately saw that the outer box was bowed out on one side, dented in a little bit on the top and had paint scratched off the bottom. Hmmmm. . .  Opening the slipper box I pulled out the slippers and saw that the bottoms were dirty. These were clearly slippers which had been worn by another customer and then returned  to the company. I completely understand that customers return items, and I have no problem with that. I do however have a problem with spending money for an item which I assume is new and clean and instead receiving a dirty item in a dinged up box.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.042713076", "1": "0.1531818", "2": "0.21039641", "3": "0.069964595", "4": "0.13198781", "5": "0.12048038", "6": "0.2712759"}}
