{"text": "Pros:* Appearance - the best-looking (to my tastes) combination analog and digital watch I've seen. Sized well for a small arm; case is a little thick but not too wide. Easy to read in light (see Cons about the night light).* Buttons - easy to access, and they don't protrude from the case like Timex's do. There's not even a crown.* Comfort - Lightweight, wears very well.* Functions - Alarm is loud and easy to hear. Two alarms are a plus, but the screwy \"snooze alarm\" is definitely a con. It also has all those other functions, but I only use the timer.* Accuracy - spot on after 48 hours, rated to +/- 30 seconds a month.Cons:* Setting the hands - they only go forward, not back. If it's set ahead, like mine was when I got it, you have to hold down two buttons simultaneous then watch the hands spin around until you stop them, then goose them to the right setting.* Night light - OK if the hands are illuminated, but useless otherwise. Only illuminates sides of face.* Velcro strap - I never have had good luck with them, they always fray or stain, so I replaced it with a water-resistant leather strap that looks great on it.* Snooze alarm - This is just goofy. If you set it, the fool thing sounds every five minutes until you deactivate it.* Alarm programming - Timex is way ahead of Casio on this. My old Timex digital had three alarms with weekday/weekend/daily/off options. Casio's are time only.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.20321597", "2": "0.13020414", "3": "0.16473877", "4": "0.24861714", "5": "0.14660697", "6": "0.10453149"}}
