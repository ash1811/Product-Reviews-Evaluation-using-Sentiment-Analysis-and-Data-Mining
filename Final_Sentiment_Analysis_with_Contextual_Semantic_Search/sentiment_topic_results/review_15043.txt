{"text": "I was looking for the Citywalk Midnight sketcher shoes item 60488 BLK, and found this item when searching.  I was originally concerned because the price was about half the price I have paid on other websites, and the description was goofy \"Sketchers Men's Midnight Bike Toe Oxford\" didn't sound like what I was looking for.  I decided to take a chance and am happy that I did!  These were exactly the shoes I was looking for!  For those that state that the grips on the bottom fall off, I can not speak to this exact order, but my boyfriend has been wearing these shoes for years and yes, the bumps do wear down (we have never had the problem with them falling off), and he typically buys a new pair every year.  He is on his feet 8+ hours a day so that is what I would expect.  If you think these shoes are going to last you for years with moderate to heavy use, you will be disappointed.  But when you do wear them, they are extremely comfortable and are the only shoe my boyfriend likes to wear.UPDATED 11/26 PM hours...  So I looked on a box from last year compared to this recent purchase, and the only difference is that these shoes are made in Cambodia, not in China, like my older box shows.  I emailed Sketchers to verify these are not an inferior quality product and they do have plants in Cambodia.  I guess I am just being overly paranoid since the price is half of what I have paid in the past.  Will update again when I get a response.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1601137", "1": "0.2089729", "2": "0.16589257", "3": "0.06430779", "4": "0.048571534", "5": "0.2382289", "6": "0.113912605"}}
