{"text": "When my husband and I ordered the socks, we expected them to be made of heavier/thicker material. The tube socks we usually buy in stores are made of thicker material and don't stretch clear to the knee. These stretch all the way to the edge of the knee. Maybe that's a good thing for some people.According to my husband, these socks are not horribly uncomfortable, but the sock doesn't fit my husband like he had hoped.His calves aren't particularly thick, but the top of the tube sock sort of bites at the knee as well.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17669165", "1": "0.3538189", "2": "0.10721068", "3": "0.06840581", "4": "0.09450235", "5": "0.19631983"}}
