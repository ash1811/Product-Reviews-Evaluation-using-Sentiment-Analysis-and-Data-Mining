{"text": "The glasses are stylish and nice, then way you'd expect any other rayban to be. The only problem is, they make a creaking sound each time I move the plastic part around, so when I move the parts to fit over your ears before I put it on, it always creaks and makes a noise as if the plastic is grinding together/ rubbing against each other.
