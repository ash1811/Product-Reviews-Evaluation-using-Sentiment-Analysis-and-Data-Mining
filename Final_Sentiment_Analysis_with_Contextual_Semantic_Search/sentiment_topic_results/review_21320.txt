{"text": "Great boxers.  Very comfortable.  The plaid design is not of tacky colors.  It seems to look big at first, but when I tried it on it is just the perfect fit.  It is not loose on the legs nor it gaps on the fly.  Made with 55% cotton, 45% polyester - won't crease at all.The fabric is just a bit thin.  When I am lounging, watching TV and just going about the couch.  Sometimes it feels restrictive and wish that the boxer is a little bit more relaxed or constructed with a some stretchable materials.  When you are just sitting at the office or at a dinner table in a normal way, there are no problems at all.If only it is blended with kevlar, then I can say it can really protect your investment after all.Overall, I am satisfied and may plan to purchase again.The one I received was made in Costa Rica.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15308978", "1": "0.29109165", "2": "0.124611676", "3": "0.07395721", "4": "0.15855318", "5": "0.06475643", "6": "0.13394007"}}
