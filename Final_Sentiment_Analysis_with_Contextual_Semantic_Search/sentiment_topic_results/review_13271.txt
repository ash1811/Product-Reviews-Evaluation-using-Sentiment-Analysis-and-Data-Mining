{"text": "Too small.  Was very disappointed.  Great looking shoe.  Order in size 14 and Amazon sent them out very quickly.  Refunded me before UPS had the returns in hand so I could get the new ones on the way, and I couldn't be more pleased. Look great with jeans and Khakis, but the ladies will snicker if you wear them with sweats or slacks.  Too bad; they're very comfortable.  Wish I could wear'em with a suit.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.112371504", "1": "0.20205367", "2": "0.12467346", "3": "0.11412953", "4": "0.24921668", "5": "0.1322599", "6": "0.06529525"}}
