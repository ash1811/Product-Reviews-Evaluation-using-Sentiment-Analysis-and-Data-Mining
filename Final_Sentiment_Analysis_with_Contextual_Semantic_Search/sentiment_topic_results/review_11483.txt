{"text": "This is a heavy, well made T-Shirt at a reasonable price, something I haven't seen much of of late. It's a bit darker than the pics here suggest...but still looks good so I don't mind. It didn't shrink when washed(cold water), and fits true to size. More than this you really can't ask for for the money spent. I will definitely be buying from this make in the future.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10295027", "1": "0.36259186", "2": "0.124174945", "3": "0.22273272", "4": "0.052154496", "6": "0.13118166"}}
