{"text": "I received this today---what a gorgeous piece it is!!! After reading the other reviews, I made sure I ordered a size up. I'm usually M(8-10) and ordered a L(12-14): it's fitted (like the model in the picture) and it doesn't feel tight or uncomfortable. The sleeves are a little long and I'll also have to hem the skirt a bit but I'm already used to hemming most of my clothes (I'm only 5'1\"). The hat fits my head perfectly, it feels like it'll stay put. It stays up as shown. I cannot praise this enough---it is JUST like the picture, it's so hard to find a product that is just as advertised!!! I will update this once I wear it for Halloween. I'm sure it'll be a success!!!UPDATE-- Went to the Pumkin Festival at Central Park wearing this---I was a hit! Even had grown ups take their pictures with me. Looooooove this custome, cannot praise it enough. I will be the Wicked Witch of the West for years to come!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16022354", "1": "0.2767635", "2": "0.044654284", "3": "0.16987598", "4": "0.10346534", "5": "0.10926768", "6": "0.13574968"}}
