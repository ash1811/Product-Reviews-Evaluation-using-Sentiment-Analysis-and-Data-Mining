{"text": "I have always loved these glasses since president Kennedy made them famous at those yacht races up in Hyannesport Mass. but I am much bigger than Kennedy was and with a size 7 1/2 hat size they are just to small for me. Ray- Ban makes the model 4147 in a 60 mm lens, that I cant say enough about. So why cant they make the Wayfarer in the larger size? There are a lot of us out there who would buy them in the 60 mm size.
