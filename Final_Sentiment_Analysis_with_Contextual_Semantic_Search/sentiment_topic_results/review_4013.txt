{"text": "These slippers feel great. They are so soft and warm. I ordered the size 8-9 since I am usually a 9. I was pretty sure 9-10 would simply be too big. I don't remember if 8.5-9 wasn't an option or simply not available, they would probably have fit better. I just wish the sole would be a big softer. It's stiff and quite loud on non-carpeted floors.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0919338", "1": "0.39372817", "2": "0.1619425", "3": "0.06388941", "4": "0.04506718", "6": "0.23956384"}}
