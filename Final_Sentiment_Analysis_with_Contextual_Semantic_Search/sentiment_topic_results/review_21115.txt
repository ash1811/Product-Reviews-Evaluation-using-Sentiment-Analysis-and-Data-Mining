{"text": "I was looking for a swimsuit for Water Aerobics and purchased the Speedo Ultraback.  I purchased size 14 but it seems a little small, almost got a 12 and glad I didn't.  Most of my swimsuits are 12's so maybe they run small.  Hoping it stretches just a bit in the next few weeks.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.22705652", "2": "0.27548477", "3": "0.35758227", "5": "0.12500665"}}
