{"text": "I ordered two pair for my husband.  He hates the new &#34;slick&#34; shorts that the teens love.  He wanted shorts that were soft and cotton like his sweat pants.  We could not find any shorts like this is all the department stores around town.  But Amazon had them.  And my husband is extremely happy with them.  They have pockets (a must for him), comfortable stretch waistband, and 100% soft comfortable durable cotton.  And, better yet, they were fairly inexpensive for the quality.  I hope they keep producing these for men who like the old-fashioned look and feel, plus the quality.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12516211", "1": "0.40278414", "2": "0.040518098", "3": "0.24580708", "4": "0.1809403"}}
