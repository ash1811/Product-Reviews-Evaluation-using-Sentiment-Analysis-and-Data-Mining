{"text": "I bought this for my almost 7 year old son.  He's tall and skinny.  In the waist, he's still a size 6.  In the length, he needs a size 7.  The size medium fit well, although I needed to take in the collar a bit.The quality of this costume is not especially high - I don't think this is one that will last a long time.  However, for under $15, I wouldn't expect anything more.The pants have an easy fit with an elastic waist, and they are not too baggy on him.  The material is a bit sheer, and darker underwear could be seen through the white stripes.  The shirt/vest is one piece.  The front of the shirt is a sort of pleather, so it looks a bit like a leather vest.  The diagonal brown belt is just printed on the vest.  I think our sash is a bit shorter than pictured, but that doesn't bother us.  The head wrap is a nice touch, and I think it looks very cute on my son.Overall, this is definitely a \"buy.\"  My son loves it, and he's worn it twice already.  It's comfortable, and the price is low enough so it doesn't matter if it doesn't last.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09769232", "1": "0.27446845", "2": "0.11133627", "3": "0.059112225", "4": "0.123826444", "5": "0.103382945", "6": "0.23018138"}}
