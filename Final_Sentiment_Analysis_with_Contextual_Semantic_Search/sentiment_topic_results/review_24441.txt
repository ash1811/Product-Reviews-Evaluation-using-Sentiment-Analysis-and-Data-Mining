{"text": "Lovely material--just a little sheen to it, and seems sturdier than other brands I've tried while still delicate--and I even got to like the black seam (I definitely thought it was tone-on-tone rather than black on nude, which is my own mistake for not reading...). However, when these were pulled up so as to take the most slack out of the hose, the lace was waaaay up my leg and really cutting in since it was at the widest part of the thigh. It broke blood vessels by the end of a couple hours and I had to move them down a bit, which meant the lace showed when I sat and crossed my legs (wearing a knee-length pencil skirt). I'm 5'4 and juuust on the far side of the sizing chart so I ordered the appropriate size for my weight, but I might try the next size down and see how that works. The silicone top absolutely kept them up while the lace looks attractive--they never felt like sliding down, which impressed me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08985738", "1": "0.10494389", "2": "0.1150685", "3": "0.2751381", "4": "0.11561659", "5": "0.1537209", "6": "0.1456546"}}
