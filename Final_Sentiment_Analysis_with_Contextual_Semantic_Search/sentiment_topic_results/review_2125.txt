{"text": "I had read and watched several articles and shows about this product and thought I would try a pair since I was going to a wedding.  The panty was of nice quality but I do believe they should cost 25 dollars.  The fit well for most of the evening but I did have to go to the ladies room twice because the waist was rolling down on me.  From what I read this was not supposed to happen. Overall, I would not spend the money again on this product as I believe it should sell for no more than 15 dollars not 25 dollars.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.19647351", "2": "0.10704349", "3": "0.20479523", "4": "0.122342065", "5": "0.22752722", "6": "0.13862865"}}
