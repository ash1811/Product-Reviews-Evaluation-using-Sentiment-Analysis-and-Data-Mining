{"text": "My wife picked this up for me as a daily lunch carrier since I tend to carry books and other items besides my lunch. It was a bit larger then expected but since I work in an art field no one seemed to make fun of it since some of them carry truly strange things. Although it's larger then I'd like it is good for what it is and therefore I recommend it.Pros:Rugged, thick canvas.Strong zippers, though plastic.Thick insulation.Plenty of zippered pockets.Large capacity.Good for a day trip on the trail.External bottle carrier.Cons:Cheapest water bottle ever made. Leaks. (You'll be replacing it.)Velcro on small side pockets is worthless. Should be magnetic snaps.Pocket inside main compartments lid is very awkward to use.Main flap has small velcro strip. Not a secure fastener.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08482019", "1": "0.17094512", "2": "0.24398312", "3": "0.07896865", "4": "0.25495854", "5": "0.123905316", "6": "0.042419054"}}
