{"text": "After looking through previous reviews for this product, I had second thoughts about purchasing it, but decided it was really cute so went for it...AND SO HAPPY I DID!  The jewelry box was a MUCH better quality than I anticipated -the pictures were clear and the colors were bright.  When my cousin opened the gift at her 5-year birthday, she was ENTRANCED by the spinning ballerina and the music.  She LOVED it and kept opening it.  Great purchase and I highly recommend it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.23074642", "1": "0.3977105", "2": "0.075684704", "4": "0.03009304", "5": "0.15227155", "6": "0.11030995"}}
