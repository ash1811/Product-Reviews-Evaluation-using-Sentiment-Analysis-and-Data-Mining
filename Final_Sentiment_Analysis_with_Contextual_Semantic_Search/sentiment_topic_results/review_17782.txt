{"text": "I purchased the G-Shock as a gift for my son who is a big believer in punctuality. The watch is accurate to 5 seconds a month in my experience. He set his to my Casio Pathfinder which syncs with the Atomic Clock and was one second off after 3 weeks. I think that speaks to the accuracy.A good watch especially for the money.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18444419", "1": "0.4296749", "2": "0.15040213", "3": "0.0695846", "5": "0.046548933", "6": "0.11473006"}}
