{"text": "I had purchased a pair of these before, and had forgotten how thin the material was in the pockets- if you carry keys in your pockets, be aware it will quickly poke holes in them- That said however, the jene material seems pretty rugged- and doesn't seem like it will wear out nearly as fast as Levi jeans do (at least the levis I've bought in the past). The lining seems a little thin too-  To be honest, I think the Carhart lined jeans are a tougher jean- but I think with care, these wrangler lined jeans will be ok- but am definately goign to have to reinforce the pockets", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.057853326", "1": "0.20281379", "2": "0.35324883", "3": "0.077630796", "4": "0.06962073", "5": "0.12874424", "6": "0.11008826"}}
