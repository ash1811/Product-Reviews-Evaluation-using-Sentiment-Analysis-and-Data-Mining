{"text": "These slippers are comfortable and seem well made.  The sole is very sturdy, much thicker/stiffer than other similar slippers.  This is great if you want to be able to walk outside, etc, but one downside is that these slippers are LOUD to walk in!  We have hardwood floors throughout our home, and these slippers make just as much noise as my hard-soled dress shoes.  I have to slip them off when walking past my baby's room, or the risk waking her up with my footsteps (even if I walk as lightly as possible).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.097120345", "1": "0.3882907", "2": "0.073316455", "3": "0.07321401", "4": "0.04506117", "5": "0.10544685", "6": "0.21755049"}}
