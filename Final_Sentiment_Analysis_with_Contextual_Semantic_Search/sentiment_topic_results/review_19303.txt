{"text": "An attractive and expensive looking watch that keeps near perfect time.  Face is smaller than its picture.  However, as I have small wrists, this is a great fit.  I like the look and feel of the watch, and it continues to attract attention wherever I go.  Don't mind that it runs on a battery.  It seems to keep time just as well as my other Invicta that is self winding.I would recommend this watch to anyone interested in a reliable, accurate, and attractive watch.  The only reason I did not give it a five star rating is because the face is a bit small, and this may not appeal to men with large hands and writs.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09173303", "1": "0.23568806", "2": "0.24026786", "3": "0.11688066", "4": "0.085183084", "5": "0.118451", "6": "0.1117963"}}
