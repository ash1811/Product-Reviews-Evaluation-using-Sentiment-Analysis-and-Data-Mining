{"text": "I compared these to the 5.11 ATAC.  Although the boots look very similar and have similar features, they felt considerably different.  The most significant difference was how the Bates had a wide sole at the heel and under the metatarsals.  Standing it might have provided some extra stability, but moving it seemed to interfere with normal pronation and made my feet feel like they were clopping.The Bates were warmer.  I imagine in warm weather they would be hot.  The ATAC felt lighter and cooler.  In fact they were only half an ounce lighter on the scale for the same size.Overall, I preferred the 5.11 ATAC without a doubt.  However, I have deep skepticism about this type of footwear.  It's mostly chosen by users to fit a uniform rather than for function.  These obviously evolved from combat boots that were inexpensive to produce for government issue, and have incorporated some athletic shoe features in an attempt to add comfort and performance, and then they have Goretex to add waterproofness while promising some breathability.  As such, they're sort of like Frankenstein footwear.  They're not really comfortable, they don't really breathe either, and they're too low for the waterproofness to be very useful.The bottom line is, these get bought to complete a certain &#34;look.&#34;  They go with your tactical pants.  If you actually want fit-for-function footwear, you probably have to start thinking differently.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08256649", "1": "0.16232587", "2": "0.21528032", "3": "0.14042975", "4": "0.19131278", "5": "0.09158417", "6": "0.11650062"}}
