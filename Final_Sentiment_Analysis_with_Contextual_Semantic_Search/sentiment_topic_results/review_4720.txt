{"text": "I took the advice of some other reviewers and ordered a size down from my usual. Glad I did - if I got my usual size I would have been swimming in it. I recently bought a Carhartt hoodie that fits true to size. Don't know why companies (like Carhartt) can't be more consistent with their sizing.Overall, this is a nice quality midweight sweatshirt, great as a standalone in cool temps, or for layering under a jacket in colder temps.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.030116826", "1": "0.4685844", "2": "0.07227835", "3": "0.32516724", "6": "0.09669171"}}
