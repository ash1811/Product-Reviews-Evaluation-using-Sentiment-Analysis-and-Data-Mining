{"text": "These boots are just great.  It is now 0 degrees with a stiff wind and my feet are still warm.  My only comment is that I am a size 9 and I ordered a size 10 -  I do feel they run comparatively small.  The boots are very light and a very rich color - the fleece is actually less pink than in the picture and very attractive.  I'd buy them again and my husband is seriously looking at the Men's version.  A great purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.34754607", "2": "0.07010809", "3": "0.18452927", "4": "0.1532924", "6": "0.23717228"}}
