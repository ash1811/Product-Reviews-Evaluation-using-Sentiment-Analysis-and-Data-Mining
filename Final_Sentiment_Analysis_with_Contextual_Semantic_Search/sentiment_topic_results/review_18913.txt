{"text": "Ladies with Kardashian sized behinds or Jennifer Lopez sized backside, listen up!  This is the boyfriend jeans you've been waiting for.  The legs are slim enough but not tight (so it fits your outlandish man-sized thighs) but the seat of the pants are large enough to fit Arsenio Hall's famous buttocks.  It may even fit the muscular physiques of the Williams sisters and a couple of tennis balls in the back pockets.  In fact, I put a small phone book in the rear while the waist button was closed and I could still stick my full hands in the back pockets.  Mind you, everything else fit just fine.  The legs are slim but not skinny and the waist, while sitting on the hips. were snug enough to hold the pants up.  I guess the foreign pattern makers who work Levi's jeans these days watch too many American TV shows and think that this is the land of the unfit lard behinds.  To top it off, the fabric quality is atrociously bad.  I'm going back to the 501s.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.123772755", "1": "0.25591", "2": "0.20476085", "3": "0.037142493", "4": "0.12598819", "5": "0.14994703", "6": "0.102478735"}}
