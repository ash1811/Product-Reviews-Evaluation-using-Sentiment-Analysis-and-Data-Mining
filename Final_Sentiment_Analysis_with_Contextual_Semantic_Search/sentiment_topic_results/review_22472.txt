{"text": "I own these but I don't wear them anymore, nor will I be buying more in the future. While they're very soft and come in pretty patterns, they don't stay put despite their claims. They don't have a very full coverage in the buttocks, which then leads to shifting and having to manually put them back into place. Sort of defeats the purpose of buying a \"wedgie free\" panty. My biggest complaint however, is that without fail, at least 1-2 pair in each pack is cut oddly or much smaller than the rest. Leaving me no choice other than to throw the pair(s) away. They don't do what they promise, and they cause me to waste money by having to discard brand new panties. Not a bargain in my opinion.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14372747", "1": "0.2308146", "2": "0.08433405", "3": "0.22615851", "4": "0.10901138", "5": "0.13817872", "6": "0.06777528"}}
