{"text": "This bra is much more comfortable than I had expected. I found the sizing perfect in the cups, but the it does run a little small in the band. I usually wear a 38 DD, but because Amazon didn't offer this bra in a DD in a 38, I sized up. Good thing too, because there is no way the 38 would have fit. However, since I did order a size up, it does fit just fine. I wore it all day shopping and didn't have to tug at my straps even once. I forgot I was even wearing it!  I definitely recommend this item.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17134073", "1": "0.15874533", "2": "0.08686594", "3": "0.3742324", "4": "0.024175745", "5": "0.09093267", "6": "0.093707144"}}
