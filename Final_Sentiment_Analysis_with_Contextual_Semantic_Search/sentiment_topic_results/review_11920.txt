{"text": "Bought these jeans for my birding husband...he goes out early mornings in all kinds of weather and loves these fleece lined jeans.  They fit his older body well. The description is true...the jeans are not slim cut but  are a bit fuller and  do not look \"loose fit\" or baggy.The denim is heavier than most and the pants  launder well. Since this was a recent purchase and  I've only washed them one time, I can't say how well they will wear.UPDATE 4/12:  Just laundered these jeans and put away til next fall...they have been a boon to the birder whether walking cold, windy beaches or tramping through the woods.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.2598578", "2": "0.20022848", "3": "0.10406028", "4": "0.104618765", "5": "0.25702518", "6": "0.07189767"}}
