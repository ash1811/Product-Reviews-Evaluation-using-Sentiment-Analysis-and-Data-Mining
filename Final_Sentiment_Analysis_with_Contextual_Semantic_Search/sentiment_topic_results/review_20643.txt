{"text": "I don't really have much to compare this dye to but it did the trick. I bought this to refresh a favorite, but old, leather coat that had a few scratches and was worn around the sleeves. The dye matched well so I was thrilled that I didn't have to dye the whole coat. The instructions warned that sometimes the dye would take on a coppery cast. Well, they were right. Everywhere the dye touched, it was coppery. They recommended a product of theirs to remove the cast but I used mink oil and it worked (with a LOT of elbow grease). I would probably do it again but wouldn't look forward to it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.116392314", "1": "0.27739578", "2": "0.29835856", "3": "0.029136531", "4": "0.167187", "5": "0.06237442", "6": "0.04915541"}}
