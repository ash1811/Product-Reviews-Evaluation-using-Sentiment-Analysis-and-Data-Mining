{"text": "These are good shoes, sturdy, nice leather, however the arch support in them is not the best.  I have fallen arches and can only wear these for a limited amount of time.  They need better arch support.  Also, the pair I bought squeek on one side.  It's really strange.  Otherwise they are good, and water proof.  Just disappointing arch support!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13241781", "1": "0.21082714", "2": "0.20002568", "3": "0.26774257", "4": "0.10188211", "6": "0.08301461"}}
