{"text": "I purchased this ring while my engagement band was being sized, and I'm happy with it as an alternative. Do not buy this ring if you want to convince anyone that it's a real diamond, because it is certainly not. But as a placeholder on my finger, it was very satisfactory. I have a 3/4 carat diamond in my engagement ring, and this stone seems fairly comparable in size. I wouldn't get one any larger. If you're looking for a passable ring while yours is getting sized or during pregnancy, I recommend this one. I would not recommend it as a substitute for a more substantial ring if your budget will stretch farther.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2786531", "1": "0.3250544", "2": "0.09534702", "3": "0.04344775", "4": "0.085668325", "6": "0.16896768"}}
