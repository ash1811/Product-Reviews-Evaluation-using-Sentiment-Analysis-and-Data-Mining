{"text": "My 11 year old son loves this bag, makes him look cool and is a really better way to carry stuff than a backpag.  Be warned though that it is not big, just medium sized and can hold about 2 big textbooks and 3 notebooks plus wallet and small stuff.  What's great is the water bottle container and the option to carry it by hand.  It is sturdy and even if I see this bag thrown on the floor and stepped on, it is still in one piece!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11927158", "1": "0.22782575", "2": "0.13145544", "3": "0.17800915", "4": "0.20563269", "5": "0.07827156", "6": "0.059533827"}}
