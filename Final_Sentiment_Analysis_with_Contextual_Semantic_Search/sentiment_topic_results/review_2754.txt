{"text": "I love keds but I am kind of disappointed because I had almost identical tennis shoes from Forever 21 and wanted to but a pair from keds because I love the brand. The keds were with discount so I bought them for $20 the same price from Forever 21 which was great until I wore them...they were uncomfortable from the back, it made me a stitch on both feet and made me bleed, perhaps if you put a band aid before putting the shoe on will help, I will try doing that the next time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.12470689", "2": "0.15890785", "3": "0.25700274", "4": "0.17758596", "5": "0.24270415", "6": "0.035762098"}}
