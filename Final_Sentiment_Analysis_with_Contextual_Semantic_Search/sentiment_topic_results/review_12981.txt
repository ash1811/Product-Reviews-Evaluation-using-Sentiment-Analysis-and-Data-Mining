{"text": "I am sold on Olga, after trying for years to find a comfortable 42D bra that is thin (who needs more padding?) and comfy.I bought 2, this style and another one, equaly comfortable. Very supportive without too much flattening or too much of that \"they're supported so high and out, they are the first things in the room when I walk in..\" look. Doesn't ride up in the back, doesn't have me longing to get home and take it off at the end of the day. Not the most sexy design but at almost 50 I am getting OK with that!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.070054226", "1": "0.45038256", "2": "0.063770555", "3": "0.08780064", "4": "0.15562086", "5": "0.09175025", "6": "0.080620885"}}
