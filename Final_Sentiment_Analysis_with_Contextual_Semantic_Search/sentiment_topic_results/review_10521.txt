{"text": "My husband and I both wear these socks. He wears them all year I wear them when I switch from sandals to my winter shoes and long pants or jeans. These are so comfy cozy, when I put them on in the morning, I like to wiggle my toes in them. They're also good to sleep in on a cold winter night!
