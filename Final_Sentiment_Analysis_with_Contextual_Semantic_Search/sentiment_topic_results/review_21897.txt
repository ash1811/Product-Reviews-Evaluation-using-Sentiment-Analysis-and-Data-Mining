{"text": "I was previously doing pilates bare footed and felt it was a bit unsanitary.  I saw someone with the giliam socks and started researching on Amazon.  My search took me to toesox.  Although a bit pricey, I really like these socks.  They fit nicely and give me added grip for jumpboard class.  It takes a little practice putting my toes into their designated slots though.  I like them so much that I bought a 2nd pair.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.02710281", "1": "0.25476208", "2": "0.12802543", "3": "0.15934373", "4": "0.16633047", "5": "0.152593", "6": "0.11184246"}}
