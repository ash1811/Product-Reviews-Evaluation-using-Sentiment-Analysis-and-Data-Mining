{"text": "I've only had this watch for about a week now but so far, it is keeping perfect time. There are a couple of minor issues with the watch but nothing that I found to be dealer breakers. First, the watch band is difficult to adjust (remove links). I gave up and went to a jewelry repair shop and had them do it. Second, the date box (displayed between the 4 & 5 O'clock hours) is small and my eyesight isn't what it used to be so unless I have near perfect lighting condiction, I am unable to read it. Not a big deal since I usually know the date anyway. Third, the watch band WILL pull arm/wrist hair. I overcame this by simply shaving the small area where I wear the watch. It isn't overly obvious so I'm okay with it. Other than that, I like the watch a lot!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16788545", "1": "0.23576343", "2": "0.2209004", "3": "0.09297259", "4": "0.15630656", "5": "0.052608605", "6": "0.07356299"}}
