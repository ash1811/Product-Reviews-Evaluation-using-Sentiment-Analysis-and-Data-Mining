{"text": "I have high arches and wear orthodics in my shoes for extra support.  I also have a little bit of foot pain from plantar Fasciitis, which I control by wearing shoes with orthodics.The problem is, when I wake up in the morning (or am hanging around the house) I don't want to put on 'real shoes' - I just want to slip something on so that I don't have to walk around barefoot (which hurts after a bit).Birkenstock only has two models with high arches - this one (Boston) and the Arizona.  Both in Taupe Suede.  I bought both.Let's face it, they are not the most attractive shoes...  But I think the Boston looks better than the Arizona when wearing pants/jeans.  However, in the summertime, when it is hot - your feet will sweat in the Boston!  So I bought the Arizona for hot days/shorts and the Boston for cool days/pants.Again, they are not stylish or attractive, but they are COMFORTABLE.  And they will get more comfortable with age.  As you wear them they will mold around your feet, making them even more comfortable.Regarding sizing:  The suede stretches.  I have been wearing Birkenstocks on and off for 20 years.  And the suede stretches more than the leather.  But the suede is definitely more comfortable.  So be prepared, as it stretches, to add a hole or two to make them tighter (I use an ice pick, knife or scissors to make additional holes).  (You will know it has stretched when your toes start to hit the front of the shoe.)  With other shoes I opt to get the shoe a bit bigger for comfort (especially to give room for my orthodics), but with this shoe I go true-to-size.  (E.g., with other shoes I wear a women's 9.5, but with this shoe I wear a 39 narrow).Lastly - I am not sure if it is always the case, but when I bought them they were cheaper here on Amazon than they were on the Birkenstock website!Yay for Comfortable Shoes!  :)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12787224", "1": "0.24096137", "2": "0.13278", "3": "0.16909543", "4": "0.14645848", "6": "0.18048051"}}
