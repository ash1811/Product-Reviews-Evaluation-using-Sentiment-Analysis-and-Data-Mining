{"text": "Izod makes a great pair of somewhat loose fitting \"relaxed fit\" jeans for gentlemen who want a slightly more relaxed look to their jeans; and these jeans are also a good choice for people like me who are slightly overweight. I doubt that you'll be disappointed. They just plain give you extra room; and that's great!The denim is nice and thick; and these jeans are extremely durable. The excellent TRIPLE needle stitching--along with the rivets they use--helps make this possible. In fact, these jeans last for years at a time without any fraying--even at the bottoms of the legs and at the five pockets. I also like the relaxed, very slightly oversized look on the sides of the straight legs.Make sure you choose the right size and color for you if you're using the pricing and availability chart above on this webpage. If you want a pair of jeans with some extra room in the seat and thigh areas, this may be just what you're looking for.Unfortunately, according to the sizing chart as of this date Izod does not truly make these jeans for big and tall guys. That's a shame; I hope that changes soon. In addition, although they are essentially permanent press, I would wash these jeans with similar colors to avoid any color dye bleeding onto white garments in the wash or dryer cycle.Overall, however, these fine jeans by Izod easily outscore jeans made by other manufacturers. They are remarkably comfortable and yet the fabric is so strong that it will definitely last years at a time!Wear `em in good health!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.096808314", "1": "0.23305413", "2": "0.091662474", "3": "0.16201921", "4": "0.052968737", "5": "0.2647889", "6": "0.09869822"}}
