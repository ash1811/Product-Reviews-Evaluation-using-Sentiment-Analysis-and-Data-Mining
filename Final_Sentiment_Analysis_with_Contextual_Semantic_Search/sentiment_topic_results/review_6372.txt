{"text": "I only wear thorlo socks.  I have a smorgasbord of styles and love them all.  They fit perfect, great padding under ball of foot and heel.  The socks don't slide down like many mini styles do.  They don't lose shape and will probably last a year or more depending how often you wear them and how many pairs you have.  I won't and don't wear any other brand.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.164052", "2": "0.03852156", "3": "0.27513796", "4": "0.20021941", "5": "0.27215177", "6": "0.045825034"}}
