{"text": "I read that these run small, and I'm usually between a 5 and a 7, so I went with the 7 and they fit great!I am 5'7, 135 pounds. For my height, these are too short to wear with heels (I don't do heels, anyway), but they are a great fit . Not too tight, very professional. As well, I find them very flattering for my shape. The material feels like really great quality.The price could not be beat! I'm very happy with my purchase.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.29035288", "1": "0.36941075", "2": "0.033000976", "3": "0.21422493", "4": "0.055086516", "6": "0.034511704"}}
