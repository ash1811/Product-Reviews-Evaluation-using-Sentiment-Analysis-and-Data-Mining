{"text": "I love these, especially under my nice black slacks. I'm a size 6/8, with a flat tummy, small waist, and large pones that will never go away no matter how thin I get. (If you don't now what pones are...don't worry, you must not have them!)The panty line on regular panties accentuates pones and just aren't flattering from behind. My point is to draw attention away from my backside. These look great under slacks, jeans, etc... No panty line shows, especially because of the lace trim.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09340196", "1": "0.15643488", "2": "0.28373593", "3": "0.12467572", "4": "0.114980526", "5": "0.04638173", "6": "0.1803893"}}
