{"text": "This is a high quality, extremely comfortable shoe. It gets more comfortable the more you wear it, as it has a cork footbed that lacks a metal shank that most other dress shoes have. A negative review on stated that a salesman likened these to birkenstocks and used it as a slam against Allen Edmonds shoes.  It is not a negative, but rather a feature that makes them more comfortable with wear, as the footbed molds to and cushions your foot. If you are looking for a little more flair may I recommend you check the fifth avenue model before buying this which has some slight broguing along the edge of the cap on the toe.  Allen Edmonds will recraft these shoes for a slight fee, refinishing the leather and replacing the sole and heel, which means these shoes will last 20-30 years, so they really are worth the price, and a great bargain when you think about it like that.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16438726", "1": "0.20150581", "2": "0.12499597", "3": "0.08389399", "4": "0.1274493", "5": "0.146324", "6": "0.15144366"}}
