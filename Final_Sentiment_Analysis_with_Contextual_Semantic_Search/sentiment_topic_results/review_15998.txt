{"text": "I am not able to wear these yet.  It is still snowing here in Indiana.  I did try them out right after I received them.  I like the way they look and feel.  They are made of good quality.  They were all I hoped they would be.  I will keep an update, should I change my mind, if the weather ever clears up.  These shoes(sandals) will match anything.  That is the main reason, besides comfort, that I chose these.  I haven't bought a new pair of sandals in years.  Don't really like having to buy shoes, don't wear them that much.
