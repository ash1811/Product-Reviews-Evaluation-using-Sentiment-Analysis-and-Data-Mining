{"text": "I ordered these for my husband, who was just starting out in running and was having arch pain.  We even bought him new tennis shoes, thinking that was the only problem, but they still made his arches hurt painfully when running.  When we first got these, he didn't like them because the arch placement felt weird (but the instructions say that this is normal, and this is where you SHOULD feel the arch opposed to where it's normally at in shoes) and they were hard, not soft and cushy like you'd think would be good for insoles.  However, he's tried them out for a while now and he was pleasantly surprised that his arches didn't hurt after running in them!  Obviously the people who designed these knew what they were doing!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16546501", "1": "0.09278038", "2": "0.19024971", "3": "0.24235916", "4": "0.05268295", "5": "0.10033356", "6": "0.15612926"}}
