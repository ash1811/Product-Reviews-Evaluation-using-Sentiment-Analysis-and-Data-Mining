{"text": "Ok, I'm going to have to agree with the majority of the people on here, these boots are absolutely gorgeous. They're comfortable and the heel is just right, not too high. The leather is soft and supple adding to the comfortable feel of the boots. My only advice in purchasing them is to size up a .5\". I got these in my normal size 7 but I had to return them because they were too tight in the toe section. I got them in a 7.5\" and they were a perfect fit. So other than the fact that the boots are not exactly true to size, I would highly recommend them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1065022", "1": "0.25615418", "2": "0.07158691", "3": "0.24670589", "4": "0.18225905", "6": "0.13380921"}}
