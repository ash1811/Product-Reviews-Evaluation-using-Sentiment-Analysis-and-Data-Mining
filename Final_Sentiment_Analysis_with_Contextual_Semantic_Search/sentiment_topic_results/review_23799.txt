{"text": "I'm a vans girl. I have like 10+ pairs, not counting the ones that are sitting at the back of my closet b/c I wore them through. This are not Nike's so they're not as comfortable, but it's kinda like one of those things where you wear them b/c they look good, and you sacrifice a little on comfort. But they're fine. You'll wear them in. Your feet will be so cute. And who the hell wants to wear nike's all the time?", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.14741902", "2": "0.15163597", "3": "0.06983859", "4": "0.1908232", "5": "0.24080023", "6": "0.19590113"}}
