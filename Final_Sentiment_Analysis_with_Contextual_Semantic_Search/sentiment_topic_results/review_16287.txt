{"text": "Getting slippers that fit is somewhat difficult....too small and they pinch and are hard to get on and off...too large and they are too loose on your feet.

And, the price is not too high for my wallet!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09452471", "1": "0.29460496", "2": "0.13886015", "3": "0.14110939", "4": "0.1881113", "6": "0.13858102"}}
