{"text": "It was time for another pair of the this shoe.  My first pair is over five years old and used heavily on a regular basis.  It has walked over Scotland and Paris a number of time.  It is my go to shoe for a casual vacation and easy slip on and off at airport.  It has been a welcomed shoe for a person with a wide foot who believes in comfort over style.Well, this pair is almost the same.  The length is a bit shorter even in the same size.  The knit seems a bit less dense since at times, in certain lights, I can see my foot even with though I ordered it in black.  Also the built in support seems to be in a bit of a different place.All in all, I am keeping them, but will be a bit hesitant about ordering again.  I am also not throwing away my older pair.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15670647", "2": "0.23237117", "3": "0.2517758", "4": "0.14759512", "5": "0.061125815", "6": "0.14799078"}}
