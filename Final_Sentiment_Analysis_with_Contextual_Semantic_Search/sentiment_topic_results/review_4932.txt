{"text": "I bought my first pair of these shoes more than ten years ago. They were simply the most comfortable pair of dress shoes I ever had. Not only did they look nice, but their soles gripped well on icy surfaces, which, living in a northern climate, as I do, is especially important. In fact, I felt as safe on ice with these shoes as I did with my running shoes, which is saying a lot. Eventually, after a decade of wear, the soles began to wear out. I decided it was time for another pair of shoes. I went to the same store where I had gotten my first pair and was delighted to find the exact same style of ECCO shoes as I had bought originally. Needless to say, I made up my mind immediately. I've had the new pair for a couple years and they still look the way they did when I first put them on. My only hope is that ten years down the road they're still making them. I'm figuring that for what I paid for them (and they aren't cheap) I'm spending less than fifteen dollars a year on dress shoes. I consider that to be quite a bargain. And as far as comfort goes, they're the only pair of dress shoes I've ever had that I can wear all day without my feet becoming extremely uncomfortable.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08286583", "1": "0.28935447", "2": "0.1728359", "3": "0.09690934", "4": "0.15204789", "5": "0.17315826", "6": "0.032828283"}}
