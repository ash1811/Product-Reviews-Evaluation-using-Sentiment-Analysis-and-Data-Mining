{"text": "I bought this bag for my 14yr old son for Christmas (2012). He wanted something small to medium in size that he could carry his phone, pens, and journal in. This works great for him and is very stylish as well. I was very pleased with the quality. The bag is made of durable cavnas, and the buckles on the sides are sturdy. The shoulder strap is long enough for him to put this over his head and around one shoulder w/no problems.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.5062653", "2": "0.09285605", "4": "0.088653974", "5": "0.1425509", "6": "0.162991"}}
