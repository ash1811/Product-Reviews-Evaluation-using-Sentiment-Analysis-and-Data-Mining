{"text": "Casio is well known for making excellent and inexpensive watches. I bought this one because it is the least expensive Casio, but still boasts a 10-year battery and combo analog and digital time/date/day display. It even has a metal wristband! Most watches at this price point have rubber or plastic bands. I highly recommend this watch if you demand accurate time-keeping and reliable quality, while want to spend as little as possible.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15333556", "1": "0.16493428", "2": "0.205823", "4": "0.18850857", "5": "0.081064895", "6": "0.20299543"}}
