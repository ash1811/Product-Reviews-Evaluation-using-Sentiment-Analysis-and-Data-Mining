{"text": "We have two cordovan leather chairs where, especially on the welts, it looks scuffed and was getting worse. We called the manufacturer (Ariz Leather), and they said that I must have health conditions that do that to the leather! (Turns out that that is a standard answer.) Getting no satisfaction from them, I looked here, bought the cordovan dye and used it on both chairs. Perfect! The scuffs are gone, and I didn't have to pay some guy from AL to come out and do the same thing, but for $150!I wish I could say, \"no muss, no fuss.\" WEAR gloves when you use this stuff. It'll be Christmas before my hands come clean. A suggestion to Fiebing's: attach the dauber to the cap as a lot of shoe polishes do. This was really messy. The cover under the cap wouldn't come off without cutting, and within 15 seconds, my hands were stained. (Soap and a stiff brush will get most of it out.)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.037550054", "1": "0.2192489", "2": "0.26898327", "3": "0.12483491", "4": "0.24733245", "5": "0.06242381", "6": "0.039626572"}}
