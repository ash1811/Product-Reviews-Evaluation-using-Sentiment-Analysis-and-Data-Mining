{"text": "The price and some nice, but \"temporary\" features is what gives this watch 2 stars.  Other than that it would have to be \"0\".  I know for $12.92 what can one expect in a watch, but after having and wearing this watch for 3 months, the display went totally bye-bye!  Totally gone, totally useless!  It is suppose to be water-resistant, but apparently not fog-resistant.  This watch was never under water in any way, in the bathtub or shower, but it would fog under the crystal display when in high humidity weather or from hanging over the kitchen sink while doing dishes, etc., and I mean well above the sink and it would still fog considerably under the crystal display.  So, I'm not sure what they mean by water-resistant, because it is not.  Can't imagine how long it would have lasted if I actually had it under water.  So, this has been my second Timex sports watch in less than a year, and both have given up electronically.  Not a good track record in my book, and definitely not even worth the $12.95.  I guess unless Timex feels $12.92 and three months to disposal, which is the case with this watch.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14411382", "1": "0.19887118", "2": "0.2698917", "3": "0.08434718", "4": "0.10749452", "5": "0.104473256", "6": "0.090808325"}}
