{"text": "Even though these are men's I got them for my wife. They ended up being a better value than most of those offered in the women's section.  She absolutely loves them.  For me however, they insole is a bit too narrow, and I don't have very large feet.  I wore them for a bit and felt like my feet were tipping of either side of the insole.
