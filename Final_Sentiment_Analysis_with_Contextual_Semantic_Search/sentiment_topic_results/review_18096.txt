{"text": "I specifically bought this watch to wear while I am working at the hospital.  It has a second hand and is plastic - so washable.  I didn't want to ruin an expensive watch at work. It's much smaller than I imagined - so I wouldn't get it if your eyesight isn't the best.  The dial is maybe 2cm in diameter.  I, however, love small watches, so this is perfect for me.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.2693748", "2": "0.1569968", "3": "0.30051696", "4": "0.06825806", "6": "0.19614421"}}
