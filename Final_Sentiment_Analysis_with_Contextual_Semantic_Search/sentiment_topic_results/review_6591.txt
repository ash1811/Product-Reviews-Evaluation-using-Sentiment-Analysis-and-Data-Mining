{"text": "Have purchased Carhartt for years and recently have noticed the fit and the crew ribbing at neck have not been uniform. Different locations where made all have different issues. Purchase in question, color spinach is stamped &#34;original fit&#34;. No others have this and this fits the most different. Am comparing this to what I considered original fit when the product had tags. These are sized uniformly and the ribbed neck have held their shape after many washings. I've purchased the 6.75 oz. only when stated, when no mention of weight assume their not. Am not a happy camper.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10870102", "1": "0.3612639", "2": "0.10059058", "3": "0.06998804", "4": "0.1797844", "5": "0.059293456", "6": "0.12037863"}}
