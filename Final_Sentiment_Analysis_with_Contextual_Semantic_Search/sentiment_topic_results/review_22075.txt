{"text": "These are my first fingerless gloves.  I have some knit arm warmers which are okay but I didn't feel as if I had any grip on the steering wheel - thus the need for fingerless grippy gloves.  They are a bit bulky through the palms but it's not that big a deal, especially for the price.  I like the grippy things on the palm and I especially like not having to take off my gloves to use my iphone.  My hands and fingers are perfectly warm wearing these so far.  One interesting side note - I have no idea what these are made out of but my dog is absolutely fascinated with their smell.  He keeps trying to sneak off with them and pilfering them from the basket where I store them.  He doesn't chew them or even spend much time with them but he is interested enough to get into the basket and pull them out.  No idea what that's all about.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07121906", "1": "0.19537798", "2": "0.20323122", "3": "0.11322746", "4": "0.0921357", "5": "0.16915877", "6": "0.15564983"}}
