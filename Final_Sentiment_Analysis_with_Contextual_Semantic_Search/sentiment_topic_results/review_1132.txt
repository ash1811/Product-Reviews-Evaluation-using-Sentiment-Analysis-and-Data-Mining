{"text": "I've noticed some reviews stating these earrings were reminiscent of \"costume jewelry\". This is completely false. My mother, whom I purchased these for, had many genuine Swarovski crystal figurines in the house I grew up in. My sibling and I loved when the afternoon sun would light up the walls with rainbows refracting off the crystals. So, anyone familiar with crystals knows that light is an important factor in appreciating crystals. These earrings, when held in the light, are stunningly reflective and sooo pretty. They are still pretty when inside, but their true nature comes out when in the light.I'm very happy I purchased these for my mother this Mother's Day, and I will likely make purchases of other colors/styles of these earrings in the future. I recommend these for anyone desiring a pure, beautiful piece of jewelry..", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09399648", "1": "0.4420648", "2": "0.08723671", "3": "0.092443", "4": "0.07964716", "5": "0.06755735", "6": "0.13705447"}}
