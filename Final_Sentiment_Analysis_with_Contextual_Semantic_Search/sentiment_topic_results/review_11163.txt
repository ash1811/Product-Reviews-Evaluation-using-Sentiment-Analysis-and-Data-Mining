{"text": "I purchased my first pair of Doc Martins back in 1997 and I am just now needing to replace them.  Docs are the best investment in shoes because they truly last.  These particular boots are great for anyone who wants a pair of boots they can wear in warmer weather because they are not very thick or padded with cloth like a lot of winter boots have.They do take about a day or two to break them in, but once you do it is so worth it.  Docs are the best shoes for people who suffer from foot problems, like myself.  They are wide enough to fit comfortably, and the soles give support your arches need for a day on your feet.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.23593618", "2": "0.13751234", "3": "0.09663645", "4": "0.18875135", "5": "0.25412467", "6": "0.08469061"}}
