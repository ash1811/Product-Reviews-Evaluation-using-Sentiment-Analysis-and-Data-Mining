{"text": "Hanes comfortsoft woven waistband boxers fit me very well; and the quality of the fabric is much better than some other types of boxers they manufacture. I also like that these boxers gives you a pattern on them.Moreover, these boxers rarely bunch up on me. That's great. They are also permanent press; and this means that they can easily be washed in the regular wash and dryer cycles. No need to worry about the colors of the pattern bleeding onto the white items in your wash.Fortunately, the waistband is very soft cotton and there's no tag in the back that can feel scratchy! Therefore these boxers feel just fine around my waist. If you desire even more comfort you can wear an undershirt and tuck it in under the boxers so that you'll REALLY feel comfortable!Overall, I give these five stars. They are excellent boxer shorts. They fit me well and they almost never bunch up when I wear them. Moreover, the fabric feels great!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.30489528", "2": "0.10779569", "3": "0.13352807", "4": "0.08439925", "5": "0.0782527", "6": "0.2888539"}}
