{"text": "This is probably the best toy I've ever bought, and I didn't even really use it! The gun does not come with any shots so buy a pack or two with your order. I knew this when I placed my order and didn't get any shots because I had different plans for it. The hammer pulls down just like you'd want it to and rotates the barrel to load another shot. The whole this has a few fake plastic screws on it but most of the parts are actually just fused together in production with the exception of the handle, plastic painted like wood, which has a single screw. Since I didn't get any shots I can't say much about the range or accuracy of the gun. What I used mine for was a costume prop. First I unscrewed the handle and popped it off, then using a Dremel tool I carefully separated the two halves of the butt of the gun and gently pried the two apart. The inner workings are actually a little complex for a cute kid's toy and I was impressed. After opening it I gutted some parts and installed a flag that would pop out the end and say \"Bang!\" as part of my Joker costume. The gun put back together really well and now I have a fun prop on my shelf until I wish to wear my costume again. The orange tip does come out easily if you open it up, but once closed again it wont budge. I do not recommend removing the tip if you're going to have this thing outside of a display.I'm thinking about getting another, this time with some shots to shoot at my house mates.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15967427", "1": "0.17540714", "2": "0.1485854", "3": "0.08131519", "4": "0.12637866", "5": "0.19471751", "6": "0.11392182"}}
