{"text": "I was a little concerned that some reviewers received their wallets which didn't appear to be well made or that had cheap non-leather inserts. That may have to do with which seller they went with as well as the price. Mine was one of the higher priced wallets. My particular wallet, in the Apple color which is pretty close to the picture, maybe a tad darker although not by much, seems to be well made, checkbook cover inside is also leather and removeable and I love the buttery feel of the leather. Very soft. The coin portion has two compartments, one each for coins and bills, and roomy enough.There are two ID windows and I count 16 card slots although the product description states there are 17. They might be counting one of the ID windows. Then there are 3 bill and receipt pockets as stated. You can stuff the wallet and it closes pretty easily. All in all, I'm very satisfied with it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1317826", "1": "0.21494956", "2": "0.2747204", "3": "0.0598533", "4": "0.13601084", "5": "0.059142753", "6": "0.12354057"}}
