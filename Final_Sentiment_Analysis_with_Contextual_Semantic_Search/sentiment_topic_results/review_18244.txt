{"text": "I bought this to replace a DW5600 that I lost. Great watch that is almost as rugged as the DW5600 and much cheaper. This watch is simple and easy to use and easy to read. The menu is a no brainer. I actually like the band on this watch better than the one on the DW5600. It seems a little more pliable and is more comfortable to me. I also like that the buttons are a little larger and easier to press. Some people don't like that but I guess its a personal preference. I like the shape better than the round or square G-Shocks. I don't know why, maybe its just different. The red line about the glass is kind of nice too. I do wish Casio would start putting slightly larger digits in their displays though. I'm getting older and the eyes are not as good as they used to be.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.216308", "1": "0.056720506", "2": "0.27826735", "3": "0.20449826", "4": "0.104535654", "6": "0.1371585"}}
