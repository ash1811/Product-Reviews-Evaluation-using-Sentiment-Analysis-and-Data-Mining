{"text": "The grip dots started coming off after the 4th time I wore them. Wore a hole in the heel after 2 months. This is the first pair of socks I have ever had wear out! I have other ToeSox brand with grips on them that I purchased directly from ToeSox before these. They still have all the grips on them and show no signs of wear.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12426289", "1": "0.20173445", "2": "0.099415116", "3": "0.18036316", "4": "0.20895442", "5": "0.18079832"}}
