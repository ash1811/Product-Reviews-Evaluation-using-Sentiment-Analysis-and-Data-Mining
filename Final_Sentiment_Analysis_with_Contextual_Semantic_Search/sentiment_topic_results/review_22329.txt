{"text": "These are perfect to wear with Vibram Fivefingers. They are light wright enough to fit comfortably, launder nicely and keep their shape, and they also keep the Fivefingers clean. While I favor the grey color, I also own several pairs in black and white.They fit like a glove and work despite I have long toes. I have yet to notice any signs of wearing in certain spots such as the heel which is usually the first place to go. I am pleased with these socks and the quality. Though these are a little pricey, these seem to be worth the price because they are well made.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1536867", "1": "0.31110513", "2": "0.0576608", "3": "0.14258581", "4": "0.1469654", "5": "0.15659025", "6": "0.031405922"}}
