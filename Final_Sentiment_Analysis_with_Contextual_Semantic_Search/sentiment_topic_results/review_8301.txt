{"text": "I have read reviews where people complain about these jeans being too tight and low cut . . . I'm not sure what they are complaining about.  These jeans have a very long rise and are quite baggy.  If Levis reduced the length of the rise I think they should reduce it further.  The fit is roomy though the seat and thigh which is nice for me since I find 501's a bit tight on my legs.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.026501661", "1": "0.38691637", "2": "0.03909744", "3": "0.09559206", "4": "0.17571168", "5": "0.12763244", "6": "0.14854838"}}
