{"text": "I bought this after buying 2 Majamas Easy Bras.  It was less expensive but looked very similar so I thought I would give it a try.  You really do get what you pay for!  The material is very thin and is not supportive at all for larger chested women.  It was extremely small as well even though I purchased a medium.  It rode up very high in the back and I could barely get it on.  I returned it immediately.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.24412055", "1": "0.27174148", "2": "0.045077994", "3": "0.28465724", "6": "0.1474063"}}
