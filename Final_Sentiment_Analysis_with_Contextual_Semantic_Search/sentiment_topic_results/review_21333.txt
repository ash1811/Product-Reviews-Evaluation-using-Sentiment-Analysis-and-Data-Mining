{"text": "I did not purchase this band until 32 weeks. I really was not having any issues with pains before then and didn't see the point. At 32 weeks we took a family, week long, vacation to Disney world. Having been there many times before I knew that it was going to be an absurd amount of walking and would need extra support. The extra lower belly and lower back support that this band gave was incredible. I literally spent close to 8 hours a day on my feet and had no back complaints(my feet were usually screaming by the end of the day, but thats another story!) I chose to wear mine under my clothes right next to my skin, had no irritation from the band at all, slight marks at the end of the day. But no welting or sores as others have mentioned. I would not recommend this for extended periods of sitting however, I did notice that sitting for longer than about 20 minutes was uncomfortable. It was easy enough to get on and off though so I didn't mind doing that if we were going to sit for a while. I was able to wear mine in the exact position of the pictures with no problems, but everyone has a different shape so it may take a few tries until you find the best spot for you. I was at the lower end of the medium weight range when purchasing and I felt like it fit me just fine. I currently(34 weeks) still wear it on the smallest setting, but will probably bump up before my due date. One thing I found helpful to keep it from &#34;rolling&#34; was to wear the hook portion in the front. That section is thicker and won't roll down on itself like the all elastic section might. Has also been helping me a lot with hip/groin pains the last few weeks.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12993337", "1": "0.102253266", "2": "0.020242378", "3": "0.21548893", "4": "0.1099242", "5": "0.15385082", "6": "0.26830706"}}
