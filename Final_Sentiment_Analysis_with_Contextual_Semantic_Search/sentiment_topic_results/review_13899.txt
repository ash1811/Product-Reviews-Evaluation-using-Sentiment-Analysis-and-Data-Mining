{"text": "I normally wear a Seamaster, but wanted a cheaper watch to wear when traveling, being outdoors, etc. I find I wear it much more often than that and it has earned a place in my rotation. It's simple, accurate, sharp looking, and the small band doesn't create a problem since I have normal sized arms. I suppose those that can't fit can easily swap out the band, but I like the canvas / metal eyelet styling of it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.2215356", "1": "0.31369287", "2": "0.1697692", "4": "0.054735456", "5": "0.15095001", "6": "0.08588781"}}
