{"text": "I bought this as a pre-Valentine's Day present for myself and am glad I did. I have long and slender fingers but although the ring is small it filled the front of my finger very nicely--because my fingers are long some delicate rings just seem to get \"lost\" and don't look like much no matter how nice they are, but this one is very much \"there\" in an understated way. The ring is flat and smooth and does not catch on to clothing, hose, etc., as a similarly designed ring might. I would love a ring like this in gold but in the meantime this is a nice and girly fun thing to wear from time to time and a new addition to my silver collection that I am quite fond of. I think this would be a special yet inexpensive gift for a girlfriend, sister, daughter, etc. which is almost guaranteed to bring a smile to the receiver.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12950057", "1": "0.45875362", "2": "0.042362582", "3": "0.059405997", "4": "0.18239251", "5": "0.1251514"}}
