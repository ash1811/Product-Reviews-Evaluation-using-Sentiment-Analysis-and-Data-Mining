{"text": "I purchased my size last year in the Coquette.  They felt like two sizes up.  These are very wide also.  If you don't mind them slopping around on your feet, get them.  The soles are very thick and sturdy (at least on mine they were).  Several other write-ups  said the soles did not last.  I can wear them outside and we are rural with loads of dirt and scrub brush and dust with no problems.  I gave them three stars because I don't care for the open back and the extra large size.  It also said in several write up's from Zappos and Department Stores to order a smaller size.  Just not my favorite slipper and I have the Dakotas, Ansleys, and Rylands that I like much more than the Coquette.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03419819", "1": "0.13351265", "2": "0.11744076", "3": "0.2634476", "4": "0.10774053", "5": "0.25286633", "6": "0.090793915"}}
