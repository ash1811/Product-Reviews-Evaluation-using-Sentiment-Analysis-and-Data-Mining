{"text": "I have very... round breasts, but I'm a D so I need support.  I had the same &#34;pointy&#34; experience - if I loosen the straps I get no support.  If I loosen it too much I go from pointy, to saggy material.  The edge has this itchy looping to it, the rings are relatively flimsy and all together it looks uncomfortable and poorly made. It is really uncomfortable on me, not to say it wouldn't work for some people.  I think that this bra fits some people that need some &#34;uplifting&#34; but those that may already have it, well, we might as well start vogue-ing.  That's what I did.  Got a great laugh out of my husband, then I put it back in the box, and returned it.  If I wore it for a day there is no doubt in my mind I would be knocking things off counters and running into stuff with my &#34;torpedoes&#34;.  No amount of camisole, t-shirt, or any other outer covering could hide this shape - felt like if I had a vintage dress this bra would have shaped me perfectly, albeit uncomfortably (as they stuck out so far...) as it is, I have no sassy vintage dress to wear this bra with, and I have been fitted recently.  This was an utter failure.  But I purchased another playtex bra, Playtex Women's 18 Hour Seamless Smoothing Bra #4049, which is an absolute win.  If you arent into pointy boob, but you are into support, that one might work for you too.  So I guess as they saying goes, you win some, you return some.  :)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.068529084", "1": "0.3688962", "2": "0.21411435", "3": "0.16400069", "4": "0.029354177", "5": "0.038850173", "6": "0.11625531"}}
