{"text": "I hurt my foot recently and needed some shoes with good support. I had another pair of merrells that were more of a mary jane style and like them VERY much. These however, are too hard to slip on (I have a slightly high instep.) And if you are wearing socks, the stretchy part sticks to your sock, and by the time your foot gets into the shoe, your socks are strangling your toes. I tried making my socks too-long, then shoving my foot in these, but it still didn't work. Plus after I got them on, it felt like the top of my foot was held too tightly, but the sides were slightly wide. I even have slightly narrow feet (not a true narrow size) and still found them difficult to put on. Once on, they were just a little clunky and not bendable enough for my taste. I have tried to wear them a few times, but couldn't wait to take them off. Not painful, just annoying...almost like wearing a hard ace bandage all day. I was disappointed because I did need the support of a shoe like this. And half sizes aren't always easy to find in this brand. I guess I will just wear my other pair more often. bummer.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06979585", "1": "0.17629455", "2": "0.11654803", "3": "0.16018483", "4": "0.1370118", "5": "0.2117395", "6": "0.12842546"}}
