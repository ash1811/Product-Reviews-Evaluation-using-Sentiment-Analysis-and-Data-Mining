{"text": "I bought these for hubby for Christmas and he has been very pleased with them. He says they are very warm. The only drawback is the sole is not rubber. It is the type that has a thin layer of fabric on the sole ontop of the rubber. Other than that, very pleased with the purchase.UPDATE June 2011 - These slippers finally wore out and needed replaced. So, they lasted almost 5 years (!!!!) with everyday use, inside and outside. I think that was a GREAT lifespan for the price and for the wear and tear they endured over the years! I replaced them with an identical pair of course.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13104472", "1": "0.13310751", "2": "0.038563006", "3": "0.16894142", "4": "0.092974596", "5": "0.33713135", "6": "0.09823739"}}
