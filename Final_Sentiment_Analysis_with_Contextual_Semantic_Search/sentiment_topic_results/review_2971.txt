{"text": "This bra help up my extra large girls (44DDD) really well especially since there is no underwire.  The fit was true to size which was another excellent feature.  The only drawback is when those 18 hours come along it starts getting a little uncomfortable, but for it's time for bed anyway.  I am very happy with this bra and the comfort straps really are comfortable.I would recommend this, especially for full figured gals who are tired of underwires stabbing them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07322858", "1": "0.34058616", "2": "0.17739059", "3": "0.13441803", "4": "0.0886242", "6": "0.18270577"}}
