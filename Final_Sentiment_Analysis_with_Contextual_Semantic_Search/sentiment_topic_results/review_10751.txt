{"text": "I'm as intrigued as the next person who swears by &#34;paring down&#34; their fishing/hiking/hammocking/camping/canoeing/kayaking &#34;load of gear&#34;.but honestly...I found out that I don't mind a few creature comforts. If fact I like a full sized toothbrush and I am not gonna eat only freeze dried food for days on end to save weight.  haha - that's just me!This folds up roughly the size of a coke can...perhaps even smaller.  It doesn't weigh a lot, and it works great.The netting is dark...but when the bugs are just swarming like crazy...and I don't particuarly feel like getting out the can of deep woods OFF....(because...creature comforts - remember - I AM carrying my can of bug spray!)  anyway....sometimes I can just take this set out of my fishing bag...and I'm at least isolated from the worst of the bugs.The &#34;Original Bug Shirt&#34; is a far better product and one that I love.  But it's also a full shirt and hood, it costs many times what this does,and it's heavier and packs down larger than this simple/smaller solution.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19024955", "1": "0.11768907", "2": "0.07410686", "3": "0.09500071", "4": "0.14028093", "6": "0.3804318"}}
