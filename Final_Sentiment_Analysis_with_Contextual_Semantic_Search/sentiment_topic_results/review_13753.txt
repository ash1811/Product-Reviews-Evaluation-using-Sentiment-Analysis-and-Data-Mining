{"text": "This is my fourth pair of these flip flops. My other pairs are still in great shape. I just saw that Amazon was having a sale and couldn't resist. My new pair feels a bit stiff next to my favorite worn pairs but I'm sure they will soften up. The amazing thing about Reefs is the arch in the footbed. I wish Reefs made shoes too!  And I love the thin straps. The black pairs look 'dressier' with the thin straps.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.059781283", "1": "0.28922808", "2": "0.24196112", "3": "0.21628687", "4": "0.15533695", "6": "0.034215104"}}
