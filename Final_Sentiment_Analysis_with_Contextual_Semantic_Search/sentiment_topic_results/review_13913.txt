{"text": "I love this product.  I bought the lesser expensive model (without a chronograph) several years ago, and finally bought this one because it just looks so nice.  It's great.  I get compliments on it frequently.  It's certainly not something I'd wear with a suit, but it's perfect for wearing around the house.  I wear the other model for working around the house.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.5858262", "2": "0.08266211", "5": "0.06820211", "6": "0.25102028"}}
