{"text": "Typical outstanding Carthart quality.  The actual color of the hat is darker than the picture.  The one size offered fits a normal sized head.\"Carhartt Work In Progress (Carhartt WIP) is the avant-garde way of living the Carhartt brand, reshaping the outstanding Carhartt legacy.In 1889, Hamilton Carhartt founded the Carhartt company in Detroit. His first products were work overalls made of denim fabric and duck, commonly called canvas. This later became Carhartt's trademark fabric. Since the early years the brand became dedicated to providing \"Best In Class\" apparel, tailored to meet the highest standards of quality, durability and comfort.Founded in 1994, Work In Progress initiated a distribution network for Carhartt across Europe, introducing a selection of classic products from the original work wear range into a new market. Success was immediate; the authentic Carhartt products quickly became popular with both fans of traditional US heritage garments and with the nascent European urban culture scene.The first product range designed exclusively by Work In Progress for Europe followed in 1997. Since then, under license and never without the expressed consent of the company HQ in Dearborn, Michigan, Carhartt WIP has carefully adapted, re-interpreted and re-fitted work wear cuts for the demands of an active life in the urban environment, remaining true to Carhartt's core values: quality, durability and comfort and becoming the globally respected contemporary brand that is today.\"  Quote from the Carhartt website.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11685142", "1": "0.2527783", "2": "0.13287063", "3": "0.2561672", "4": "0.04911321", "5": "0.14014888", "6": "0.05207039"}}
