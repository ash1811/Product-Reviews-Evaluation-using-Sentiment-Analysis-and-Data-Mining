{"text": "This is the second time I've purchased this shoe. First pair were amazing; extremely comfortable and casual. After years of wearing it through the sole i decided to purchase another pair that's how much I loved the shoe. Well after a week of wearing the shoe the part between the sole and toe had ripped and the shoe became unwearable. Felt like SOT could not return the shoe after a week of use, and now I feel like I can't trust buying this shoe anymore.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03979892", "1": "0.4021371", "2": "0.21483178", "3": "0.2077115", "4": "0.033350978", "6": "0.09924466"}}
