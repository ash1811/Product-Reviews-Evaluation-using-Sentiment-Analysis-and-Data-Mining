{"text": "UPDATE 2014:  Everything comes back to Rolex because nothing is worth anything on the market so this watch is still a lot of fun.  Looks great, but is not weighty feeling as the real thing.  Still a very decent watch.  If people are looking at it thinking it is a Rolex, so be it.  It does fine as a watch.I always liked watches because unknowingly my dad had an Omega Deville automatic and I didn't even know it.  He bought me a Seiko automatic years ago to play with- I broke the band and it was fat so I didn't like it.  Then the Casios came out- I had a new calculator lcd watch every few years.  So maybe 10 years ago I bought a nice Swatch that unknowingly was modelled after the Omega Speedmaster of Apollo fame.  Then I lusted for the now infamous Tiger Woods Tag.  I never got those expensive watches, but became curious about automatics when I needed to time something by the seconds for work.  I thought, I'll get into analog watches and so I came upon what every expensive brand, even Omega, has tried to duplicate: a good looking Rolex Submariner.  I read review after review and lo and behold, this Invicta 8926c is the most accurate imitation, but I think it exceeds it because, Invicta itself has history in Swiss watchmaking.  Id say it is one of the most famous/infamous copies of what is known as the best looking watch by many.  The Japanese movement in mine is accurate to +5 seconds per day, which is incredible.  If I store it upside down at night, the accuracy improves!  Obviously, the quality control is slightly lacking- my midnight luminous dot is slightly offcenter and the crown adjustment is difficult to engage easily (I have to reverse turn it to hear a click, then wind it shut).  All in all, a very cherishable watch in the same vein as the original, Rolex Submariner, with a modern history, story if you will that is much worthy of any watch admirer.Edit: January 2013:Being so much more aware of watch brands now, I see how important the Rolex Submariner is- every brand has a \"likeness\" to it.  Still, the Invicta 8926C is a great homage to it and a very fun watch because it looks so much like the real thing.  I don't know if I would spring for a real Submariner at this time because the last time I bought an expensive toy, Apple was at 8.  If I put that $ into Apple, I would have $3 Million.  I just got another Rolex homage, the Invicta 9401 GMT.  Another winner.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2336021", "2": "0.33960438", "3": "0.07568934", "4": "0.13040663", "5": "0.11081305", "6": "0.10767093"}}
