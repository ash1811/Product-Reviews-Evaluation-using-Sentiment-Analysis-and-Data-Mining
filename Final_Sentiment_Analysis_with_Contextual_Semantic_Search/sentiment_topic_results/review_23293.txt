{"text": "These stones are bottom of the barrel in quality. Add in the fact that they are advertised as being treated, and you have a recipe for separating your hard earned money on \"disposable jewelry.\" The diamonds are definitely not attractive, with major flaws and not a good buy at any price. This type of material should not be sold on Amazon because it supports dubious practices of jewelers to sell inferior grade stones to the public thinking they are getting a good buy. These are not. Educate yourself against these practices and buy a diamond book. They are selling a few on here which I have found to be of great educational value.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15386218", "1": "0.34097636", "2": "0.10100928", "3": "0.089495055", "4": "0.046965875", "5": "0.18335822", "6": "0.08433303"}}
