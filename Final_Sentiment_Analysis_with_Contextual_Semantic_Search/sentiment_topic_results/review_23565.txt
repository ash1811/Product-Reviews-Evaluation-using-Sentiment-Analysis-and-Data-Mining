{"text": "The style is very close to the original. Other than an immaterial difference in the sole, they are exactly as I remembered from the ones I had 30 years ago. How many products can you say that about? Roomy, cushy, warm boots to sink your feet into after taking off your ski boots - heavenly. These boots are not designed for hiking or long walks, but they work great for walking the dog in deep snow. Your feet will stay dry and warm. I only refrain from 5-star due to the undersizing. I am a long-time size 8. The boots sized 7-8.5 felt like they were 1-1/2 to 2 sizes too small. After receiving the next size up, I am quite happy - better too big than to hit your toes on the end.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1774755", "1": "0.11769069", "2": "0.085835904", "3": "0.12196466", "4": "0.24558094", "5": "0.08832859", "6": "0.1631237"}}
