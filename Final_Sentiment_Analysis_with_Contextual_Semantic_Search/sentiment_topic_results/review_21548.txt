{"text": "I bought these for my son as one of his stocking stuffers this Christmas.  He has loved playing with them in the tub. I would think you could use them outdoors in the summer as a water toy.  They are well made and it is a really cute idea for kids who love to make music and get clean at the same time.  I would recommend these to any parents who don't mind a little bath time music.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.110788144", "1": "0.34832993", "2": "0.105516635", "3": "0.15273425", "4": "0.052497562", "5": "0.10643759", "6": "0.123695865"}}
