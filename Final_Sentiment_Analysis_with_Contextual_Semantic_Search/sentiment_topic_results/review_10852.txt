{"text": "I love these slippers.  I had a similar pair that got totally worn out inside from rough heels so I looked on the bottom of them to see exactly what they were and that's how I found these.  I wasn't crazy about the embroidered flowers on them but they are only house shoes so I can live with it.  Slippers are the only thing I wear in the house so they have to be comfortable and these fit the bill.  I'm not really feeling an arch support like one review said but I have high arches so maybe that's why.  I love that the size goes from 6.5-7 as those are the sizes I wear in shoes and they fit great.  I like the gray color as it's not as slipper looking as pink or baby blue.  I do wish they came in black.  Thanks Amazon, once again you came through for me, love my new slippers.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.15151255", "2": "0.13835227", "3": "0.43703473", "4": "0.015826786", "5": "0.08400461", "6": "0.17060521"}}
