{"text": "Following the suggestions of previous reviewers, it was easy to position the band properly and push the pins out. In my Citizen watches, the removable links were marked with arrows indicating the direction in which they should be pushed out. After discarding the extra links, putting the pins back was easier by holding the band vertically in the narrow slots on the tool - using a very small screwdriver positioned on the pin and lightly tapping the screwdriver head with pliers. Again be careful and insert the proper end of the pin first.The first watch I did (mens) had a wide band and without proper light, it was difficult to position the tool's pin on the watch band pin. The second watch with its narrower band was easier because I could see better.I noted that the pins were not so easy to push out or tap in. Bare hands and a small tipped screwdriver or paper clips will not do.The tool itself is cheaply made and the plastic ring holding the turn handle broke loose a few times. I also broke one of the tools pins (they gave 5 spares).
