{"text": "Was very pleased to find this brand and selection readily available here on Amazon. Broad range of sizes, colors and styles from the same manufacturer is great. Sure, like most nylon stockings, they'll run, but no more easily than most. Comfortable and have a wide inset panel in the back. Appropriate under slacks as well as skirts and dresses. You won't likely be in a hurry to take them off but can wear them all day and evening. I've already placed a repeat order and expect to continue to do so several more times as the need arises.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06557154", "1": "0.2812546", "2": "0.09041057", "3": "0.25194472", "4": "0.07160741", "5": "0.14160894", "6": "0.0976022"}}
