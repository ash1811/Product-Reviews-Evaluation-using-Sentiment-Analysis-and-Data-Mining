{"text": "I'm a regular jogger, so shorts in the right length and weight are crucial to an enjoyable running experience.  While I understand that shorter shorts are best, I prefer shorts that go just above the knee.  It's been difficult finding such shorts in my price range ($10-$15), and most of the shorts I find now in stores are basketball ones that go past the knee and sometimes beyond; these are just not acceptable for running or gym workouts.I stumbled upon these on Amazon and, with my Prime account, the price was just right.  They're a soft cotton fabric that looks like they'll have some weight, but the shorts are surprisingly light.  They also have pockets, which is a plus even if I don't use them all the time.The times that I've used them jogging my legs don't retain the sweat as much as other shorts force them too, which is great when you're jogging in hot summer afternoons (especially since it can get real muggy here in the Windy City).Recommended!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.35747808", "1": "0.106886275", "2": "0.061743602", "4": "0.1748522", "5": "0.12691051", "6": "0.16984704"}}
