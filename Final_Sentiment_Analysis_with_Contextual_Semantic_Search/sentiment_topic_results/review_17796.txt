{"text": "PROS:> Up close, it is well finished and looks great.  It does not look cheap, but appears well made and well assembled.  As they say in the garment industry, it \"gives good hand.\"> It is easy to see and easy to use.> It's a good size.  I wanted a bigger watch, and it is that.> It's a great value, delivering the big G-shock look and feel for only a few bucks more than cheapo plastic watches that break.CONS:> The digits on the main time display are small, particularly when considering the size of the whole face.Overall, I am very pleased.  The watch is what the description says it is, and its look and feel in real life exceed the pictures on Amazon.  It is too new for me to comment on its durability, but many other reviewers have that covered.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18019685", "1": "0.22783366", "2": "0.16625187", "3": "0.14059532", "4": "0.09983603", "5": "0.021119129", "6": "0.16416712"}}
