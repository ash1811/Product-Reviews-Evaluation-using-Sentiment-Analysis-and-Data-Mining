{"text": "My first attempt at buying shoes through Amazon and bought too large....Not a problem though as they fitted my daughter!!We both have size E wide feet and I am over the moon the sizing I now have down pat gives me shoes that are perfect in width.In Australia I am a 8.5 and Amazon shoes are the same size. With the added bonus of the E fitting I am in shoe heaven!!These are soooo comfy and cool for summer.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.043567408", "2": "0.34078285", "3": "0.14911051", "4": "0.18055497", "5": "0.17647728", "6": "0.10573858"}}
