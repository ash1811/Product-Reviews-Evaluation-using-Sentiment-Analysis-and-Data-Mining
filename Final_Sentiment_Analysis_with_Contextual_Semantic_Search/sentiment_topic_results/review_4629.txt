{"text": "This is the shoe I always prefer to wear for the last five years because the leather is very soft and confortable.I do urge everybody to verify and confirm the size before ordering because sizes deffer from company to company.The difference probably only 1/2 inch so no need to worry that much, if size is lettle large just expose the shoe to the sunfor a few days or a week and the leather will shrink 1/2 inch or less.  I did try this with a shoe I ordered 1/2 inch larger andnow is fits perfectly.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.094125144", "1": "0.24963261", "2": "0.18654579", "3": "0.22314304", "4": "0.11512164", "6": "0.12856495"}}
