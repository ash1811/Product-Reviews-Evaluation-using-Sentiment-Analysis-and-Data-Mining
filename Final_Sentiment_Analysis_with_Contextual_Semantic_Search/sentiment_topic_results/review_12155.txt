{"text": "I travel a lot and so I some times have to wear my socks more then one day before a wash, these socks are AMAZING. They keep my feet warm and dry on cold wet days and cool and dry on hot days. They are the perfect blend of wicking wool and soft silk, the elastic keeps them up, they do not bag and they wash well. They are well worth the price, even if you can only afford a few pairs they are the only socks you will ever need.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.1892022", "2": "0.05083175", "3": "0.07271479", "4": "0.1639945", "5": "0.43581936", "6": "0.08410316"}}
