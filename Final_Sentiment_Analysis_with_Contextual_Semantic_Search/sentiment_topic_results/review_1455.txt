{"text": "I had an older version of this bag in high school and it lasted through several years. I purchased this one for a recent trip with my kiddos. I loved having all the extra pockets and sections to seperate their stuff. Zippers are of good quality and open/close easily. Love the pattern on this one. Pads are very padded for comfort and nylon is very sturdy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0431555", "1": "0.35234672", "2": "0.08965889", "3": "0.11237723", "4": "0.1334779", "5": "0.14085491", "6": "0.1281289"}}
