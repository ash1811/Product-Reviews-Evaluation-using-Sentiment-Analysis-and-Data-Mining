{"text": "This rain jacket was bought for a camping trip. My husband found it both lightweight and durable. Would purchase it again.It fit well and packed well, too. He is a larger guy, the larger size did not have the wrist issues noted by other reviewers. It was rainproof for camping in the mountains this summer. Still going strong.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.2026757", "1": "0.11795612", "2": "0.17170362", "3": "0.08014166", "4": "0.1288541", "5": "0.29432344"}}
