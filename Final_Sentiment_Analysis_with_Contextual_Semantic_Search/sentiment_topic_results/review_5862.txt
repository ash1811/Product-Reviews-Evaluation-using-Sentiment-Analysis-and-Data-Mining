{"text": "First: it got here quick! It was in it's bag which was in a small box, then that was in a bubble wrapped bag and put in a 12\"x12\"x5\" box of bubble wrap. Lol. It was so big that I couldn't figure out what I had ordered. Got a huge laugh, it was in perfect shape when I got it, not all bent up like a couple reviewers said. Maybe that's why they do this now. It's beautiful! Hardly know it's on, great buy! Might get the earrings too!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14708875", "1": "0.4504614", "2": "0.03867825", "3": "0.14814478", "4": "0.094919614", "6": "0.11744866"}}
