{"text": "I like this earring holder, and it was relatively inexpensive. It works very well for my french-hook earrings. Post earrings are OK, but it's a little bit tricky to pull them off without tipping over the whole thing. However, it's a huge pain to hang up any earrings with the clasped french-hook (the kind that has a hook, but also a back that snaps into place). I basically ended up leaving them unclasped and draped over the edge - it looks like they'd fall over easily. I couldn't get any of my hoops onto this thing - not the hoops with the post-back, hoops with a snapping back, nor the hoops that make a perfect circle. I have big ones and small ones, but I couldn't get any onto this thing.THE GOOD:-Works well with french-hook earrings-Inexpensive-Works with post earrings-Folds up so it can be easily moved.THE BAD:-Doesn't work with hoops-Isn't particularly attractive-Hinges squeak-Doesn't work well with Leverback hooks", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16948883", "1": "0.22970913", "2": "0.17693162", "3": "0.17777975", "4": "0.04002484", "5": "0.15470016", "6": "0.05136567"}}
