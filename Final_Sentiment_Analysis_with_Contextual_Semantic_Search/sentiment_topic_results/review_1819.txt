{"text": "I bought these tights to wear to yoga class, which is an air conditioned space.They are easy to put on, long enough for my 5' 6' body,  did not lose color on washing ( 2 times so far),and opaque enough to hide underpants. I liked the higher rise  ( vs the new  lower rise style).  I did want a slightly  tighter ( maybe more spandax)  and  also heavier tights and that is  why I gave them  3 stars.  However these are fine and if they continue to hold up  I will wear them during the colder weather  with skirts.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.085710704", "1": "0.18984237", "2": "0.1329984", "3": "0.15147932", "4": "0.21030109", "5": "0.22700098"}}
