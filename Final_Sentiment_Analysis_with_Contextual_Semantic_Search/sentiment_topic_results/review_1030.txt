{"text": "This is a very nice business looking shoe.  However, it really almost looks as if it's a black patent and not an overall leather looking shoe.  Teens won't touch this one, however, if you're looking for something to go with a tuxedo, then be sure to try these!  They fit true-to-size, look amazing on, and just a very neat, pulled together look.  The soles are made well, probably would last about 2 years if you wore them on a daily basis.  However, again, these are more for going to the opera or conducting an orchestra than they are for wearing to work.  Recommend, based on your needs.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14949572", "1": "0.24816862", "2": "0.23546657", "3": "0.1185432", "4": "0.056715082", "5": "0.1265187", "6": "0.0650921"}}
