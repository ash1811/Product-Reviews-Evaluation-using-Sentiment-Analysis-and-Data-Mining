{"text": "This is not your grand daddy's Carhartt.  I gre up in the 70s and 80s in the sticks.  Every farmer, mechanic and outdoor worker wears Carhartt. There stuff is just over the top well made. People own Carhartt jackets for like decades. So I just moved to Miami where tropical storms come out fast and the rain volume is rediculus.  So a breathable rain jackets sounded great and I trust the Brand. When I received it I couldn't believe how in style it looks!  It's actually very nice looking , sporty even.  And as far as being Carhartt well made?  They got even better. This jacket looks great is extremely well made.  I have a feeling I'll never buy another rain coat again because this one doesn't look like its going to die in my lifetime.  Also it's not just some jacket. There is a ton of actuall design to it.  I love it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09344765", "1": "0.36232635", "2": "0.2545079", "3": "0.1516659", "5": "0.03766734", "6": "0.09824517"}}
