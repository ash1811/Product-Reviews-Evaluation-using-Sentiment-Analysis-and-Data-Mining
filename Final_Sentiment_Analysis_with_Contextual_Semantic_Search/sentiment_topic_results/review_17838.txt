{"text": "This watch is great.  Attractive, easy to use, nice price.  What's not to like??  Very pleased.  If you're wondering whether to get this, just get.  You'll be pleased.OK- I'm revisiting my review.  The watch conked out after a little over a year.  I changed the battery but the connection somewhere is shaky and it's time to replace this.

Under the circumstances I'll generously give this a 3.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1793858", "1": "0.23459432", "2": "0.26079336", "3": "0.07503283", "4": "0.15389563", "5": "0.049069893", "6": "0.04722812"}}
