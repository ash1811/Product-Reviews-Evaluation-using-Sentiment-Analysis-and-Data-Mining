{"text": "I intended to buy this style, online, but had a feeling I might want to try them on at the store first.  SO GLAD I did!  The mini is super cute, but does not work for me at all!  I could not get my foot into the boot.  I have a high instep, and a somewhat inflexible foot, and tried two different sizes (8 and 9) and simply could not get my feet into the boot!I ended up buying the Mini Bailey Button instead, because the button allowed me to get my foot into the boot.Also, a word on sizing on both Minis...they run large!  I have worn a 9 or 9.5 for years.  Sometimes I can even wear a 10.  I decided to get these in the 9 because I understood they run a bit large and stretch.  The 9 was loose, so I thought about this and consulted with the salesperson, and we tried an 8, which fit perfectly.  My toes are at the end of the boot (but not pressing out) but it is not tight, and since they stretch a bit, I think the 8 is the size to go with for me (as it happens, I have another Ugg boot in a 8 too!).  The 9 would have been too big once the sheepskin was flattened from wear.I like the style of these, but you may need to size down, and if your foot is like mine, you may need to go with the Bailey button for ease of getting the boot on and off.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12520991", "1": "0.21680573", "2": "0.048376527", "3": "0.16584557", "4": "0.17955655", "5": "0.08796586", "6": "0.17623988"}}
