{"text": "After owning two pairs of Minnetonka boots and knowing the market prices I felt these were an amazing bargain and I was NOT disappointed! These shoes are so soft and comfy with that slipper feel but with slip grip rubber soles that let's me wear them out doors. I'm sure I'll purchase again in another color! Highly recommend!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.049264412", "1": "0.37608427", "2": "0.1549648", "3": "0.11195958", "4": "0.15746337", "5": "0.09831662", "6": "0.05194693"}}
