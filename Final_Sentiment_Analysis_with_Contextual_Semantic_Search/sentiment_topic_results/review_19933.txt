{"text": "I have two pair of these in black.  One is for work, the other for my workouts.  So supportive, comfortable, edgy.  Really a staple of my wardrobe.  Glad Keen offers half sizes.  These really are true to size, so if in doubt, go to the half size.  For some Keens I wear a 9 (sandals, etc., w/o socks), but glad I got the 9.5 in the Presidio.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12267763", "1": "0.18463215", "2": "0.09746547", "3": "0.36541265", "5": "0.09824841", "6": "0.12758441"}}
