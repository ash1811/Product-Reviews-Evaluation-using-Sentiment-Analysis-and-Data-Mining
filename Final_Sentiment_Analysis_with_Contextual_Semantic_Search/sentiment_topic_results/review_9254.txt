{"text": "It's hard to find good quality these days, so I was especially pleased with the materials and workmanship of the TAMARAC Slippers.The soft leather uppers, real shearling linings, and the \"Romeo\"-style elastic side vent help make these slippers amazingly comfortable -- and the cushioned rubber outsoles assure years of durability.As others have noted, the sizes seem to run small. I wear a size 10 Florshiem Shoe, and a size 11 1/2 New Balance Running Shoe -- so I gambled and ordered a size 11 TAMARAC -- which fits perfectly !!All-in-all, the TAMARAC Slippers are an excellent blend of style, quality, and value.Amazon's low price and fast delivery make it a done deal !!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13564157", "1": "0.22269994", "2": "0.17014185", "3": "0.20605336", "4": "0.07907633", "5": "0.060716186", "6": "0.12567072"}}
