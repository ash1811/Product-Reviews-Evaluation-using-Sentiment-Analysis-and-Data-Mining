{"text": "When i got this jacket i assumed that its for really cold weather because of the thermal lining.Its what i consider a 40 deg jacket maybe even lower if you layer something underneath.If you are looking for one that can handle colder temp i would suggest a quilted or parka lined Carhartt jacket.I have owned this for about 1 1/2 years now and it still look as it did when i bought it.I didnt give it 5 stars mainly because the zipper can be a PITA at times and the thermal lining is thin and not comfortable if you are wearing a short sleeve t-shirt.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14017248", "1": "0.34345835", "2": "0.16817042", "3": "0.16210267", "4": "0.061840463", "5": "0.12164954"}}
