{"text": "I love the look of the dragons and I love Havaianas.  The first pair of these sandals I purchased was a men's and fit perfectly with plenty of flip flop room.  The second pair I purchased was a women's in the same size and I have found that the women's are not as wide as the men's and the place where the strap meets the shoe is also not at the same spot.  This makes the women's sandal rub my feet more, which is not good.  So if I have a choice, I will always choose the men's in the same size.  I have to admit, sometimes the colors and patterns in the women's are much nicer so I may still order a women's if the sandal is beautiful.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.4957537", "2": "0.26608235", "3": "0.12421123", "4": "0.10569513"}}
