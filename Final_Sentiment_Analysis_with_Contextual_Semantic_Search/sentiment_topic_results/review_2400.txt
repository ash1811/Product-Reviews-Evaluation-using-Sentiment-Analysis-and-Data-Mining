{"text": "These are excellent sturdy, comfortable, good looking work boots. The construction of these boots is first rate, solid stitching, and rugged lace eyelets. I like the slightly darker tan color of these boots.There is a bonus black engraved Caterpillar bulldozer on the heel. I like that touch a lot. CAT is visible at the very top of the boot. The yellow and black is not obnoxious at all.These are rugged insulated boots. They are not safety boots with steel toes.There is a slightly cheaper alternative to this boot, the Cactus 6\" work boot, (Cactus 6'' Classic Boots). I purchased both Caterpillar and Cactus boots. To me the Caterpillar boot is better, but slightly more expensive. If you are very cost conscious, then the Cactus boot might be a better choice.I like this boot a lot. The CAT logo is cool to me. I expect these will wear like iron and last a long time.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04686891", "1": "0.21727414", "2": "0.09997761", "3": "0.16612579", "4": "0.21910407", "5": "0.12439943", "6": "0.12625009"}}
