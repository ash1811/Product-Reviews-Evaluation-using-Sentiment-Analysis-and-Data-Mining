{"text": "the Casio Men's MQ24-1E analog watch is like a friend who doesn't put up with small talk. It doesn't give a rat about life's deeper questions like \"why are we here?\", \"what happens when we die?\", or \"what is today's date?\" it doesn't have any of these answers, because it doesn't care. it cares about one thing, and that one thing is the current time. it doesn't even care if it is AM or PM. Hell, it doesn't even have numbers on the dial. you have to figure that stuff out for yourself. it's made of plastic, because nothing says \"i do not care\" like plastic.black plastic.it costs $10. if you buy a $10 wristwatch you are either so old that you think a high-quality watch should cost less than a low-quality beach-towel, or you do not care about the quality of your watch as long as it tells the time. Even if you get one that doesn't keep good time, it cost you $10. You spent more money on coffee and lunch yesterday.Way more.I bought this watch, and i couldn't be happier with it. I think it's at the bottom of a suitcase in my closet, but I'm sure if i went and looked for it, it would still be keeping perfect time and not caring about any of my other time-related questions.I won't though.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.19591126", "2": "0.18766543", "3": "0.07246252", "4": "0.1512027", "5": "0.23339956", "6": "0.1569689"}}
