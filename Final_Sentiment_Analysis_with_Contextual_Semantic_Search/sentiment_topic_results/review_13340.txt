{"text": "These are nice shorts- they are cheaper in price so do expect them to be made a  bit more cheaply you get what you pay for. That being said they are what I expected nice, comfy casual shorts.  Great for either around the house, outdoors stuff, working out and things like that which is what I needed.  A tad larger than expect but not to the point I cant wear them and more than likely will be fine after some washed.  Overall I do like them and would order more of different colors", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21817648", "1": "0.27072218", "2": "0.0839073", "3": "0.13568905", "4": "0.041543506", "5": "0.104847", "6": "0.14511445"}}
