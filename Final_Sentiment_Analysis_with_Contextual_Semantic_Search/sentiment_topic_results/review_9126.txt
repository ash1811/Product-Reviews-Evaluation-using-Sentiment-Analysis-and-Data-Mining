I am female and wear a woman's size 9 shoe, but I had to get these in a men's size 9 which fits perfect. I double checked the gender when I got the replacement pair (originally ordered size 7) and they say men's size 9, so be warned.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15248407", "1": "0.24845426", "2": "0.15688679", "3": "0.2295738", "6": "0.20622723"}}
