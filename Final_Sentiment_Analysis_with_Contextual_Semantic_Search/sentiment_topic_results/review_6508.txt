{"text": "Bought one pair 7-9 size, I'm 8.5. Wore with leather boots. Fit great, not tight in the toes but not so loose either. Great cushioning. Wore them for most of a 35 day trip. Washed up well in the sink, dried fast if I wrung them out well. Would purchase again for sure.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.38470796", "2": "0.29177344", "3": "0.07062806", "4": "0.09112591", "5": "0.15307465"}}
