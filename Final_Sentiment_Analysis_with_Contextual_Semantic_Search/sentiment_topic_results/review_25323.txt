{"text": "I wrote an extensive review for the Waterproof Moab, so I'll keep this one short.  The main thing I want to concentrate on is the sizing.  I wear size 11D in most shoes, but often go with a 10.5D in Merrell's.  However, the Waterproof Moab was so small that I went with a 11.5D, which fells big, but I wear them with heavy socks.  The 11D just seemed to small.With the Ventilator, the 11D seems slightly larger, though.  It's still a little small on me, but not so much that I think I need to size up.  My toes do touch sometimes, but the toe box is generous and they're not uncomfortable.  Unfortunately, neither size seems to fit me great, so I had to choose and the 11.5D just seemed far too large with the Ventilator.For the record, I don't think my feet could fall in between sizes more then they do with this shoe, and I don't know why it happens, because they're very spacious.  Overall, it's a great shoe and I really love it, but just wish the sizing was better for me.Update: Well, several months later and I wish I had gone with the larger size.  The 11's still feel big enough with the uppers, but unlike the larger Moab waterproof version, they strain my legs after wearing them for a while.  I'm not sure if my foot is just a little too big for the footbed or if the sole is different with the Ventilator, because unlike the waterproof version, the same? Vibram soles make a lot of noise while I walk,  and just feel hard and cheap.  The waterproof Moab's feel great, but the Ventilator was killing my ankles.  Strangely enough, my feet are fine and it's just my ankles/legs that hurt, but again, I don't have any of these problems with the Moab waterproof shoe.I also find the Ventilator very hot.  They may even be hotter then my waterproof Moab's, but that may be because they're a tighter fit.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17149207", "1": "0.18277414", "2": "0.12281545", "3": "0.23217559", "4": "0.14414972", "5": "0.041728593", "6": "0.10486443"}}
