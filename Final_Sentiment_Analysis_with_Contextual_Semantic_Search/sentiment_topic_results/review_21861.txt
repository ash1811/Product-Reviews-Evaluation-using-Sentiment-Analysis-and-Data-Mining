{"text": "I read the reviews before buying and a lot of what they said it correct, but I have to question the size.  As soon as I opened the box it came in, it looked VERY big.  I checked the dimensions and it is too large to have as a carry on with any airline.  This is what I wanted it for.  It is even larger than the dimensions listed in the product description.  It is well built and attractive, but will have to be checked if on air travel.  I'm a little disappointed with the product description.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21583433", "1": "0.044271626", "2": "0.0733753", "3": "0.2103993", "4": "0.1100644", "5": "0.20323904", "6": "0.14281599"}}
