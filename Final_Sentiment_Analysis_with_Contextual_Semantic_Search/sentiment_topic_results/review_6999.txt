{"text": "The fit is slightly odd. Narrow in the toe and wider in the back. The back strap has little utility because the belt really can't tighten the strap against the heel. Others have commented that the shoe is 1/2 size too large and others have described true to size. Given the weight of this shoe which feels like the weight of a boot, I suspect the intent was to wear thick/boot socks with this shoe. You can buy your usual size if you wear thick socks, go down 1/2 size if you want to wear stockings or bare feet. Haven't walked far in these shoes but they feel reasonably comfortable, not too high of a heel, for shoes that are definitely all about style.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.019007828", "1": "0.2826979", "2": "0.26472792", "3": "0.23285665", "4": "0.092345245", "5": "0.106122926"}}
