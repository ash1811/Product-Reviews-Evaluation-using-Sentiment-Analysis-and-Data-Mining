{"text": "Made in China. Sigh.Mine is \"Spruce\". A rich Olive Drab...Has five pockets: Two exterior on the waist. One exterior left breast. Two more interior mid torso.  All the outside pockets secure with zippers. The two lowers have a rain flap!  The upper single pocket has a self sealing zipper. My seven inch Nook just fits this pocket!  The interior pockets secure with Velcro tabs. There's a hood that snaps on and off.The idea behind the pockets for me is to get more items OUT of my backpack. I pack light.I was told in the Army that clothing [uniforms] were for protection more than style. So true...This jacket does not fail to be protection!  Bigger is better. The more material the better. Yes, they run big.Typical Carhartt quality tho Chinese made. All stitching/seams, construction, fit and design are very good.I was going to wear a long sleeve shirt under it but I think for most cold days here and on vacation it will be enough!Heavy. Washable. Quick dry. 100% Nylon and Polyester.I wish my field jacket in the Army had been this good.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07689258", "1": "0.19926278", "2": "0.16859418", "3": "0.097307146", "4": "0.08490488", "5": "0.14653845", "6": "0.22650003"}}
