{"text": "don't get me wrong I love the shoe - I purchased the Taupe - for some reason the right shoe fits comfortable the left sits slightly lower over my big toe and its actually the stitching that gives me grief - but hey, I purchase shoes based on price and look - the material is quite stiff and NOT being leather I'm unsure if things will get better with wearing - I think the 1st few wears will have to be for sit down events - I'm normally 8.5 in MIA shoes but this particular shoe to me feels a little narrow compared to other MIA styles. The ball of the shoe tends to be a little behind your natural ball perhaps too far back giving a sense of instability - I constantly feel like I'm going to topple forward so if you're not a veteran of high heels I'm thinking this might not be the best shoe to start stepping out in - based on my last sentance these are NOT for use with alcohol, sloping surfaces, lengthy walks, or dancing .... just sit or stand and look pretty !!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.40318337", "2": "0.3084386", "3": "0.055228226", "4": "0.16700692", "5": "0.061502814"}}
