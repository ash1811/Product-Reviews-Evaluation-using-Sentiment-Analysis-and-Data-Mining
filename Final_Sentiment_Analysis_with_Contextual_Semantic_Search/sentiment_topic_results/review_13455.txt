{"text": "I just bought these shoes in pink, because you wouldn't believe how hard it is to find pink shoes!!!  I was a little confused because it says \"light pink/med purple\" but that must be a typo because they're all pink just like the picture.  The only thing I don't like is the really shiny vertical stripe across the top of the shoe...but I think it's growing on me.  Anyway, these shoes were true to size and were really comfy.  Sort of feels like I'm wearing my fuzzy slippers to work :-)  I already had some very similar shoes by Sketchers, so I knew what to expect.  They seem pretty sturdy and well made.  A pleasant surprise.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0320887", "1": "0.23170607", "2": "0.16972362", "3": "0.1608861", "5": "0.20663372", "6": "0.19657616"}}
