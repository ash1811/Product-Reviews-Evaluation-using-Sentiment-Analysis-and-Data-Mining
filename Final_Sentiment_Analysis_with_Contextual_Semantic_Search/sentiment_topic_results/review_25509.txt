{"text": "I was so excited to see these; they are exactly what I need.  I hate wearing bras and any way I can avoid it I will.  These are perfect for certain types of tops where either you can't wear a bra with them, or those tops where I can get away without a bra but need some nipple coverage.  When I first got these I tried them on without a shirt, and after a little while the edges started to peel a bit so I was worried it wouldn't work.  But then I tried them wearing a top for the day, which seemed to help keep the edges in place a little better.  They still peeled slightly, but it was OK, overall they stayed stuck pretty well.  (I'd give them 5 stars if they didn't peel at all.)  The top I wore them with was loose and double layered, so I'm not sure how these would work with tighter fitting single layer tops - I can see these might be somewhat detectable under a thin snug lighter colored top.  I'm an A cup, but I'd imagine these would work on any size.  Maybe my size/shape was what caused them to peel slightly, not sure.  They are pretty sticky, sort of magically sticky.  After I wear these more I'll update this review if I have any more feedback - this is based on only one wearing.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.050238974", "1": "0.25862017", "2": "0.030362677", "3": "0.40358335", "4": "0.0321223", "5": "0.12955277", "6": "0.09551978"}}
