{"text": "What I love about this watch:1.  Simple to set both analogue and digital time (don't believe the naysayers)2.  It is lightweight and the velcro strap fits your wrist perfectly3.  The hands, once charged in front of a lightbulb, luminate brighter than my Timex4.  The night light works great and it actually helps charge the hands5.  The watch is waterproof so I won't have to take it off in the shower, washing the car etc6.  Dial is easy to read7.  World Time is handy, as I have relatives overseas in different countries8.  Telememo for 30 phone numbers and it's a breeze to input the data9.  3 Alarms and an hourly chime including snooze alarm10.  Timer and Stopwatch11.  The price and the lookSo, I guess I love everything about this watch, I hardly notice I'm wearing itjust a perfect work watch, I should have bought this model years ago.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.082805544", "1": "0.1552063", "2": "0.16966382", "3": "0.027199836", "4": "0.24468696", "5": "0.045212798", "6": "0.27522472"}}
