{"text": "I love my Baggallini messenger bag.  Just ordered my second after one of the zippers wore out on the first one I purchsed (after 5+ years of daily use, the bag itself is still in good condition).  This is an amazingly utilitarian bag made of very strong fabric with many sections and pockets to hold your essentials and more.  And the cross-shoulder feature with the padded strap is so comfortable, you hardly know you have it on.  I highly recommend this bag for hiking, shopping, going to the park, as a convenient grab-and-run diaper bag, or anytime you need to have your hands free.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14329256", "1": "0.1649383", "2": "0.06616354", "3": "0.17545372", "4": "0.14357094", "5": "0.22988631", "6": "0.07669461"}}
