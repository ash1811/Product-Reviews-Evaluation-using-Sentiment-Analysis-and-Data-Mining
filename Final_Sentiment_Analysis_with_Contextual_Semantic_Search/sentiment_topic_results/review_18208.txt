{"text": "As for me, being a &#34;dinosaur&#34; and &uuml;ber geek/nerd from the 80's, this is the perfect watch! I had one of these back then and I am happy that Casio's calculator watches are still available. I wish they were made in Japan and not in China but I could not see any quality flaws compared to the vintage Japanese versions. The case has the right size, the strap is super soft. You don't feel this watch on your wrist and it is flat enough to not snag with your shirt's sleeve. The calculator works perfectly well - no problems with pushing the buttons, the alarm is surprisingly loud.I am in the watch business and I have certain testing equipment at hand. I have tested the watch for it's water resistance and it passed a combined 0.2 bar vacuum and a 2.0 bar pressure test but that doesn't mean it should be used for water sport activities. It means that it will easily survive any accidental contact with water, sweat or dirt. Accuracy: The watch was timed to +0.44 seconds per day (= 13 sec/month) and since the module has a trimmer, I was able to improve the accuracy to +0.18 seconds per day (= 5 sec/month) at body temperature so now this watch BEATS ANY OVERPRICED (prone to magnetism and shocks) SWISS LUXURY WATCH by far! The 3 Volt Lithium battery usually lasts for approx. 5 year depending on usage of the alarm feature. And you won't get mugged for this watch so wearing this watch actually contributes to your health! And if someone is making fun of you for wearing a geek watch just tell them &#34;The geek shall inherit the world - one day you will work for me&#34;! Haha!Go and order one for yourself as long they are available - you will be happy with it! :)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.0592753", "1": "0.3392939", "2": "0.19662818", "3": "0.098547384", "4": "0.09469169", "5": "0.088385455", "6": "0.12317805"}}
