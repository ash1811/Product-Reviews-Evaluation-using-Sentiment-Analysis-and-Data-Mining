{"text": "We were just about ready to get in the car, in good old Texas 100 degree heat (!)to do some shoe shopping for my husband.  He knew exactly what he liked and wanted in the same style of sandal that he has always worn. I suddenly asked him, hey, let me try Amazon first.Not only was this pair just what he was looking for, it was even on sale.  We bought this and another pair in a different style that fit the bill perfectly for what he was looking for.Workmanship is great, and they fit just fine.  Now I have to go do a search for the type of tennis shoes he likes here!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16534352", "1": "0.30413347", "2": "0.13792211", "4": "0.23166381", "5": "0.051480163", "6": "0.10684783"}}
