{"text": "After reading the description and the glowing reviews I really expected something special for the price. What I got was a foam pad with a thin plastic cage for the heal \"cup\". Literally the heal cup is actually strips of plastic forming a cage with air gaps.  The heal cage is not pictured in the Ad but represents the only \"technology\" in these inserts. For me the cage heal  dug into the sides of my foot and actually aggravated the my plantar faciitus.I returned the product without a hitch and received a full refund. For the price I expected a fairly sophisticated layering of materials building up a stable platform, moulded heal cup --what you get is surprisingly less. Of course with foot pain the best advice is try it --it may work for you. It doesn't take much to make a difference. You can always return it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12113453", "1": "0.108879864", "2": "0.062353253", "3": "0.07768074", "4": "0.21178432", "5": "0.22723013", "6": "0.19093715"}}
