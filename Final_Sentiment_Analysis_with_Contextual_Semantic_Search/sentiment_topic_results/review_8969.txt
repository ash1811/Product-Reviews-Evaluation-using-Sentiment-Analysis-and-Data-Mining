{"text": "I actually take an E width in a shoe but decided to try these in the 9.5D.  They are a little tight across the top of foot which was expected as even EE boots are tight there.  I will use a form stretcher at the spot and they will feel fine.  I found these on a closeout at a fantastic price via Wholesale Deals so could not pass them up.  GREAT SHOE at a GREAT PRICE!  On top of this they were received within three days.  &#34;THANKS AGAIN AMAZON&#34; for a great deal.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14400688", "1": "0.25143495", "2": "0.121308796", "3": "0.23087417", "4": "0.13850991", "5": "0.07587099", "6": "0.037994303"}}
