{"text": "Good for harsh winter conditions.I like this mask the best of the ones I've had (half face masks, 2/3s, 3/4s, and a few full face similar to this one.)It's really soft and comfortable to wear, while protecting me from the cold. It does cover the neck which is a plus as I usually do unzip my jacket a bit to get some of the steam out from the core while boarding down the slopes.Doesn't really get sweaty, and if I get a bit sweaty it's usually pretty good to wick it off.One down side is that it's not good with snow or rain. It will get soaked if it starts snowing on you. But that's to be expected with any cloth.I recommend if anyone needs. I also prefer this 3 hole mask over a single large face hole masks which I also have some of.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08648228", "1": "0.22190198", "2": "0.1364342", "3": "0.17125028", "4": "0.10917214", "5": "0.13841364", "6": "0.1363455"}}
