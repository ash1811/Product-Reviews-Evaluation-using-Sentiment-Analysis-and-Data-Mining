{"text": "Even though this bag is marketed as a small duffel, it's still pretty large. I'm 5'4 with an average frame, and it's basically the size of my torso. I'm okay with the size, but if you're looking for a smaller duffel, you may want to try something else.I like that it has a hard plastic on the bottom inside so the bag retains its shape. The shoulder strap is super convenient. My only gripe is that it has no pockets. None inside, none outside...nothing. A small pocket to place my phone and gym lock would be nice, but for the price I paid I can't be too upset.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06936923", "1": "0.27843484", "2": "0.07759564", "3": "0.26096493", "4": "0.06306816", "5": "0.09658426", "6": "0.15398295"}}
