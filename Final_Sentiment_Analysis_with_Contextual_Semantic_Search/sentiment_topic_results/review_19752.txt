{"text": "I needed some sweats to sleep in when i go camping so i bought these. They fit great, have pockets which is nice, and the elastic is snug without being uncomfortable. The elastic is clutch because I don't want my warm air escaping when ever i move. Great quality for the price too. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a casual pair of sweats.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14517677", "1": "0.50263995", "2": "0.05159598", "4": "0.093007125", "5": "0.1548729", "6": "0.048615053"}}
