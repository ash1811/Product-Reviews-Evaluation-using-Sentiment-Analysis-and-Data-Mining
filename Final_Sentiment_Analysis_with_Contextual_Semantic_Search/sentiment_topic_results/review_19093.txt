{"text": "This box looks nice and seems as if it would be sturdy and hold up, but unfortunately there's not quite enough depth for my husband's watches.  Most of them tap the glass when the lid is closed (they're not overly large watches, mostly 43mm) and when stored in the bottom drawer they scrape the top as the drawer is being closed.  If you have smaller watches (my Michael Kors women's watches fit perfectly, but we had planned on sharing the box), this would be perfect. We're going to keep looking for a box we can both share.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.091518104", "1": "0.33516914", "2": "0.19822207", "3": "0.15783988", "4": "0.11949835", "5": "0.095054366"}}
