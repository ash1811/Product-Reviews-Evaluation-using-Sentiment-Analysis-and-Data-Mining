{"text": "I love the color of this shirt. It doesn't have all the bells & whistles that some of the other Devon & Jones shirts have but well worth the price & plenty of length in the waste. It's a simple button up shirt. Nice quality of fabric...as always with this brand:)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.43547547", "2": "0.0684678", "3": "0.20967095", "5": "0.10075521", "6": "0.17317015"}}
