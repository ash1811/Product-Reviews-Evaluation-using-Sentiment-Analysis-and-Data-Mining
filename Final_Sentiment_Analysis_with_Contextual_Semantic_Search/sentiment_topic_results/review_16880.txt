{"text": "I have worn Keen sandals in the past and the first pair I owned was for hiking and kayaking in the Western States.  They are very durable and comfortable in most every situation.  I purchased this pair to have a \"dress\" pair of sandals that could be worn to outdoor get togethers in the heat of the summer.  The lining for your foot is very comfortable and the leather and construction seem to be top notch.  You spend more for these on the front end but will have years of enjoyment in wearing them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1727818", "1": "0.24193268", "2": "0.05430819", "3": "0.10195374", "4": "0.23868632", "5": "0.046595406", "6": "0.14374188"}}
