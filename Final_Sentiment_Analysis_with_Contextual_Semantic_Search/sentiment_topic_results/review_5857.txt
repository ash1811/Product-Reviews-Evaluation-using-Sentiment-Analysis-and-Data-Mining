{"text": "This is a wonderful value in the Jewelry category.  I purchased this for my girlfriend to wear at a formal party, and it really worked out well.The price is a very good deal considering the artistry, and the flower itself is just the right size.  (I was worried it might be a little small, because things look a lot bigger with the zoomed-in closeups on the website, but I was not disappointed.  If memory serves it was about the size of a half dollar coin).The other reviewers are correct: the chain itself is a little delicate, but it does the job.  The focus of this piece remains on the pendant.Overall a fine addition to any jewelry collection.**Update** Amazon now lists a pair of earrings which match this pendant.  I have not purchased them, but they look to be miniature identical versions of the flower pattern.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16544962", "1": "0.19491091", "2": "0.07993437", "3": "0.2786543", "4": "0.1156335", "5": "0.035047453", "6": "0.13036986"}}
