{"text": "Let's see, this is the third pair of these particular shoes. They fit great and wear well. While I have a narrow foot and usually wear AA or Narrow shoes, I usually just buy the B withdth Easy Spirit and they work fine. But this time I did find them in Narrow which I bought. They fit true to size. They work fine but I think the toe box is a little too narrow for me and next time I'll go back to the B width. Excellent wearing shoe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.034437705", "1": "0.48355347", "2": "0.2609581", "3": "0.09617077", "4": "0.05646019", "5": "0.065551385"}}
