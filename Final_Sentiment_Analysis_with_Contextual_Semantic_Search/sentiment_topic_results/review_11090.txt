{"text": "I like these. I wanted something that wasn't too flashy to wear on a regular basis, and I'm allergic to most of the earrings I currently have. I can wear these all day comfortably. They're subtle but not tiny; any bigger and I'd feel a little uncomfortable with them. The back is a little flimsy, and I do worry about losing them. Overall, I'm very pleased with the purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.24777767", "3": "0.29832628", "4": "0.0931455", "5": "0.22126096", "6": "0.13152486"}}
