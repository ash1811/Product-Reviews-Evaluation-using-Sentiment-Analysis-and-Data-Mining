{"text": "As a new professor, I decided that it was finally time for me to own my first watch. I wanted something simple and not too flashy. I've received a number of compliments on this watch already...and people are consistently surprised and impressed when they learn that I bought it for around $15. I'm not going to claim that it looks or feels like an overly expensive watch but it definitely doesn't look cheap. I think that it's an incredible value and I'm extremely happy with my purchase.Some other reviewers mentioned that they've had issues with scratches on the face. I actually just swiped my watch along a concrete wall the other day and there are now a few scratches on the places watch face. It's still perfectly easy to read the time but I will be trying to buff them out this evening. I will update this review once I do this, in order to let other potential purchasers know how concerned they should be about scratches.Overall, great watch; great value.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08578932", "1": "0.23537402", "2": "0.23579289", "3": "0.13658696", "4": "0.072384916", "5": "0.15759638", "6": "0.07647553"}}
