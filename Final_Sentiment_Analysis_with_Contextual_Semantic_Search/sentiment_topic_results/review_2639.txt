{"text": "After reading all good reviews, I bought this pair of shoes.  It looked okay and felt okay when I walked around the house.  So I wore them today at Legoland all day, and my feet were not very happy at the end of the day.  First, I felt the springs on my heels, and my heels became sore in the middle of the day.  Second, the sides of my small toes were hurting as well, both feet, by afternoon.  I cannot figure out why since nothing really felt hard on the side of the shoes, but regardless, they were tender after a long day of walk.  It felt like I am wearing a pair of dress shoes when they are supposed to be comfortable walking shoes.I do not understand how $100 shoes are made such that I feel the springs on my heels?  I actually felt round shape of springs on my heels.  Can't you believe it?  The company cannot put thick enough padding?In terms of my small toes, I bought wide shoes.  I had enough space on the front so I cannot figure out why the side of my toes hurt.I am very unhappy.  Since I wore the pair outside for one day, I cannot return them, and it cost me $100.  It is very expensive shoes to be thrown away after one day of wear.My suggestion: they look okay, but they are not good for walking unless you are perfectly fine walking on dress shoes for all day.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08278373", "1": "0.28868404", "2": "0.18762797", "3": "0.104917675", "4": "0.09131222", "5": "0.068141", "6": "0.17653337"}}
