{"text": "I'm a fan of these type of Skechers shoes.  These particular ones had a bit of a rub spot on the outside of one of my feet (a problem I've never experienced before with any other shoe), but that went away as I broke them in.  They run a little big so I'm glad I ordered a half size smaller than usual.  Otherwise very comfortable!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12108294", "1": "0.15222146", "2": "0.22411874", "3": "0.45112303", "5": "0.043486156"}}
