{"text": "I was surprised that this set fit me so well, as it is a one-size-fits-all. I don't really like the placement of the care/material tags on each piece, but with a steady hand, you can cut them off without ruining the fishnet. The fishnet isn't of the highest quality, it does snag easily, but for the price this set is well worth that little downside.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.47315758", "2": "0.100506164", "3": "0.194523", "4": "0.04755917", "5": "0.06456326", "6": "0.11475538"}}
