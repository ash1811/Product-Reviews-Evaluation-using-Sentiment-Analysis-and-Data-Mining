{"text": "PROS:-I have not had any trouble with these panties bunching up or causing \"wedgies\".-The pack included 2 solid white pairs and 4 pairs with very vibrant colors/patterns.-The waistband is low enough to work well with low-rise pants.-The waistband is comfortable.CONS:-Wash these before wearing them. If you wear them right out of the package you will get all kinds of lint and loose cloth stuck to you.-The panties are a little tight around the leg holes. Not to the point that I will not wear them, but there is minor discomfort after wearing them for several hours.-I don't like how the colors are assorted and you cannot choose them. Although I do really like some of the colors I got, however I would have preferred not to get two pairs of solid white panties.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12941417", "1": "0.15211521", "2": "0.16137125", "3": "0.30161542", "4": "0.117039315", "5": "0.11344392", "6": "0.025000734"}}
