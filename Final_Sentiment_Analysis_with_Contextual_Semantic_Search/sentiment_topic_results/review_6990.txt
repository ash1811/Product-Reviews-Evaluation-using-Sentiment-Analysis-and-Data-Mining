{"text": "great fit the zipper does stick out some but i mean you either get a crappy zipper that sticks alot and breaks or you get one that is solid and sticks out. i was worried it would be too big because of the few bad reviews. i weight about 170 and im 5.5inch tall but it fits like in the picture. this is gonna keep me warm. very warm. i love it. Its more than i expected. looks really great. also there are two different coats in the pictures but the one i got is the on with the three faced hood. really nice! ive paid more for some other brands but the quality of this garmet is unbeatable. Really good jacket!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14767559", "1": "0.39371744", "2": "0.11426704", "3": "0.22261828", "4": "0.08588223", "6": "0.033450827"}}
