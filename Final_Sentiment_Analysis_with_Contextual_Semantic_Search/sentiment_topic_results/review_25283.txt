{"text": "I am tough on hiking shoes.  I hike in the desert mountains around Phoenix almost daily, especially this time of year.  The Merrell brand of hiking shoes and boots have always held up.  These Moab ventilators seem to be very well built.  The are a little bit short....but not enough to go up to a half size larger.  I am hoping they will break in easy and maybe even relax a bit in the length.  I look forward to updating this review when I get a few miles on them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.18601185", "1": "0.0990668", "2": "0.19247217", "3": "0.25778672", "4": "0.07384619", "6": "0.18795168"}}
