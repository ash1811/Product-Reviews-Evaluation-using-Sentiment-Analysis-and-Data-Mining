{"text": "Out of the seven choices listed for this product, one is listed as coolskin and one as warmskin, one is listed as deluxe, and the others are just listed as colors.  From the photos, it looks like all of the ones just listed as colors are coolskin, but it doesn't say.  I bought both the coolskin and warmskin.  I have no idea what the deluxe is.  I was charged a flat rate for shipping ($6.28) for both of them, so buying multiple ones at a time makes more sense.  Both of the ones I bought are black, and the seam isn't noticeable at all to others, like the lighter colors would be, per the online photos.  The black ones also make you look like a ninja, which is cool.The warmskin is thicker than the coolskin, meaning it will keep you warmer.  The thickness also makes it harder to put on, as you can't easily move it around on your head.  It's not stretchy, and is a tight fit for me, with the 7-1/2 size melon.  But it wasn't uncomfortable.The coolskin easily slips on, like the Spider-man mask in the movies.  It is very stretchy and comfortable, more comfortable than the warmskin.  But the coolskin also has the vertical seam rubbing against your lips.  The seam also goes along the top of your head vertically, but you don't notice that wearing it like you do at your mouth.  I tried flipping it inside-out, and it was basically the same problem regardless.  The warmskin has no seam rubbing against your mouth, as it is covered by the inside liner.  But the coolskin seam isn't a big deal.Both the warmskin and the coolskin can be pulled down past your chin, in case you don't want your nose and mouth covered, and they retain their shape well when put back over your nose.I took off one star for the warmskin because of the tight fit, and one star off for the coolskin because of the seam, but overall, I really like these products, and I recommend them.  I bought them so I could ride my bike in the winter without having to readjust the bike helmet straps, and they are what I was looking for.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10898491", "1": "0.16320875", "2": "0.07221119", "3": "0.31062296", "4": "0.1335382", "5": "0.028294519", "6": "0.18313946"}}
