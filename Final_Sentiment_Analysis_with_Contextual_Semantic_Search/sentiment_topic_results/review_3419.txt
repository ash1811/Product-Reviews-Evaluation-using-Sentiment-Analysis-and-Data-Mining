{"text": "Overall this is a great bra.  It lifts and shapes just right.  It's not perfectly comfortable though, and gets worse as the day progresses.  It's still MUCH more comfortable than your average underwire, don't get me wrong, and I will still wear the crap out of it.  It's just that I definitely want to take it OFF at the end of the day, whereas another lift bra I found, I could sleep in.  I would still recommend this for sure.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3771148", "2": "0.10276116", "3": "0.3239192", "5": "0.06188894", "6": "0.12747467"}}
