{"text": "I like the idea of this, it's a nursing bra and tank in one, but it actually runs a bit small on me (I wear the size Medium Bravado Body Silk Seamless nursing bra).  So I'd get a size up if I was to buy another one.  I'm satisfied but not over the moon about this one, and I do LOVE my Bravado seamless bras.  Oh, and the nursing snap/attachments are different/more annoying than on their bra - I like the clip on the bra much better.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.080227904", "1": "0.041857585", "2": "0.18288186", "3": "0.3475464", "6": "0.34139207"}}
