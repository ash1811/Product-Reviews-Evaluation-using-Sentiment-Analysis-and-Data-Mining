{"text": "I RECEIVED THE WALLET ON TIME. I JUST LOVE IT. IT IS VERY ROOMY. HAS ALOT OF SPACE FOR PLENTY OF CREDIT CARDS. IT HAS SEVERAL SPOTS FOR CASH. I CHOOSE THE BLACK ONE. THE WALLET LOOKS EXPENSIVE AND IS A VERY NICE QUALITY. YOU EVEN GET A CALCULATOR FOR CHECKBOOK PURPOSES. IT IS WORTH THE PURCHASE PRICE.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19721304", "1": "0.32533485", "2": "0.32218307", "3": "0.066459715", "4": "0.07957365"}}
