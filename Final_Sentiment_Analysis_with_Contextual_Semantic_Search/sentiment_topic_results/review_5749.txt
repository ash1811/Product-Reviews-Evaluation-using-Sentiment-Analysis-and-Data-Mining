{"text": "I like the Beefy-T and have worn them a few years. Hanes has been a good brand for me but I wasn't that happy with this batch, I bought 3 of them. They say they're \"preshrunk\" but something went wrong here, I washed them in cold water, as I do all new clothing, and they SHRUNK! How the heck does that happen in cold water?
