{"text": "I've owned this watch for over six months, now and I am very pleased with it.  Like most citizen watches, it keeps impeccable time.  The size of the dial is just right--not too big, not too small.  I like the canvas band.  It looks great and has held up quite well.  The Luminous hands and numbers show up well in the dark.  If you are looking for a good traditional military-style watch, you can't go wrong with this one.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.28067896", "2": "0.2926602", "3": "0.27854997", "5": "0.06283027", "6": "0.07844124"}}
