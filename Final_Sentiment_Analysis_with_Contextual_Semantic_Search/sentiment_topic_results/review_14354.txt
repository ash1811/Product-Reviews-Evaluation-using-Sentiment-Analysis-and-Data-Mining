{"text": "I had to buy new tins of shoe polish this week to get my shoes up and running for the Autumn/Winter months. This polish is still the best out there and does a great job on my leather shoes...I polished my shoes last night and had someone actually tell me today that my shoes looked brand new even though they are two years old.I don't ever want to live without this polish !! It lasts forever, it does a fabulous job and you can't beat the price...I'm glad I stocked up, it sure won't go to waste  !!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.076608405", "1": "0.16817012", "2": "0.21876667", "3": "0.18239658", "4": "0.12023705", "5": "0.1545757", "6": "0.07924545"}}
