{"text": "I bought this watch many years ago at a Service Merchandise chain store.  Anybody remember them?I found through the years that it goes through batteries at the rate of about one a year, often less if the alarm is used.  Other than that, the watch is comfortable, accurate, and it an excellent value for the money. My wife accidently threw the watch away while it was on a cluttered desktop about 2 years ago, and I replaced it with one from Wally Mart, although there it was about $75.00.  The battery lasted less than a year, in fact it needs one now.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.030715335", "1": "0.23489377", "2": "0.18258744", "3": "0.21886909", "4": "0.13893454", "6": "0.19139212"}}
