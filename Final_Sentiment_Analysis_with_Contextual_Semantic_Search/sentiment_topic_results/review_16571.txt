{"text": "I've recently lost about 50 pounds and have about 20 more to go. I didn't want to invest much money is a bra that probably won't fit in a couple months. Heck, I wasn't even sure what size I am currently. I made a guess and ordered this bra since I figured I'd only be out $25 if I was too far off. But I must have guessed correctly. This bra is incredibly comfortable. The \"girls\" are fully supported (no cleavage popping out of the cup) and the straps don't dig into my shoulders. And on top of that, it's actually very cute too! I'm back ordering a second one. And I'll be back again once I hit my target weight. So much for blowing 50 bucks on bras! :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.033067957", "1": "0.2601168", "2": "0.15719707", "3": "0.23861754", "4": "0.1270697", "5": "0.12151998", "6": "0.06241096"}}
