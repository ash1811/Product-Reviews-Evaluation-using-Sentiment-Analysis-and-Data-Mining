{"text": "My best friend recently gave me a pair of the Geisha Blue Clog Sloggers in size 8.  I told her I feel like the little Dutch Girl in my blue shoes.  I absolutely love them and am wearing them as I write this.  They are extremely comfortable.  I also have Sloggers Boots, which are great for yard work and if I were to get another pair of boots I would choose 1/2 size larger for ease of getting on and off, and also another pair of Midsummer Shoes, which my son calls my Hippie Shoes because he thinks it looks like a marajuana plant on the front.  They are all wonderful, water proof, and attractive.  I have an ongoing pink \"Betty's Bag\" for little presents I find for my best friend and she has a \"Gwen's Goodies\" bag for me.  We may go weeks or even months sometimes without seeing each other so that when we do we always look forward to not only seeing each other but to our treats.  These Geisha Blue Sloggers are my best July treat.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08202324", "1": "0.18467398", "2": "0.15450427", "3": "0.1724209", "4": "0.11025959", "5": "0.15892199", "6": "0.13719602"}}
