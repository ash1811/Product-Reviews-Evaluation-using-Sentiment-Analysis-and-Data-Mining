{"text": "I've purchased Hanes crew socks for many years. The last time was around five years ago (I buy a large quantity at once). These are not the socks they used to be. The cotton is half as thick everywhere and the so called cushion area is a joke. It's no stronger or thicker than the rest of the sock, just a different color. These are also very tight on my leg and I haven't washed them yet so they will shrink even tighter. I would advise trying another style or brand if you are looking for comfort and durability. I know these won't last five years.
