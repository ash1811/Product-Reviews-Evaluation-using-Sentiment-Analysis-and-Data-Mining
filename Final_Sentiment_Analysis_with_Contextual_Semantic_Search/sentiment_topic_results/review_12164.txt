{"text": "I bought these to fit over my Born shoes.  These shoes are little boxy in the toe and I was worried that these overshoes would not fit but the fit is fine (size 11 1/2 shoes, bought the XL overshoes).  I worn them in the ice and snow and slush while in Wisconsin during the holidays and they had good traction and protected my shoes.  You do notice the extra weight these add to your feet but nothing terrible.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03752062", "1": "0.19850251", "2": "0.24170677", "3": "0.11059736", "4": "0.16140428", "5": "0.109241776", "6": "0.1410267"}}
