{"text": "This is the best storage case I've ever found for my bigger or wider rings or even my thin banded rings. It even works for cigar band rings! It is extremely well-padded - even the top has some padding.  I put my big hoop earrings on top of the padding (where there are no rings) to protect them and keep them from getting bent.I bought 2 ring boxes from this company. This is the less attractive one (the other is wood), but I wish I had bought this one in a larger size. The other box can only be used for thin band rings or post earrings.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18307485", "1": "0.32105577", "2": "0.09444961", "3": "0.18509834", "4": "0.08131291", "5": "0.07102665", "6": "0.06398186"}}
