{"text": "I've heard/read so many great things over the years about Easy Spirit and really liked the idea that this walking shoe was available in C/D width.For me, however, the Avia walker is better simply because the sole has more cushion.  On my feet for hours at a clip, I also added my usual tri-comfort and ball of foot inserts just because.  So far, my feet are much happier.I could have saved these Easy Spirit's as a secondary pair, but the Avia's also cost a couple of bucks less.  I'll give the Avia's a couple more weeks before deciding on whether or not they are my \"new\" shoe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.059064522", "1": "0.10913865", "2": "0.13813312", "3": "0.16333325", "4": "0.3380051", "5": "0.08636558", "6": "0.10595976"}}
