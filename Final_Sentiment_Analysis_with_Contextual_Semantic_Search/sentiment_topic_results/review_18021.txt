{"text": "Bought this 'cause I like Analog watches and the Casio brand, and wanted a retro-look brown case with white face. However, as a previous poster noted, it is way too complicated. I pride myself on setting up any of the 5 or so  Casio watches I've owned without using the manual, but not this one!Also, I don't like the velcro band as it looks cheap, but some people may not agree. Also, the light function is not a good as other Casio watches.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2426981", "2": "0.2595221", "3": "0.1025413", "4": "0.060537625", "5": "0.15465966", "6": "0.17683695"}}
