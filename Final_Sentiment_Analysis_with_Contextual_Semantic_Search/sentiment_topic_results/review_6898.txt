{"text": "Update - Bought two more pair of the same size. Received them both at the same time. One of the pair fit and one didn't and both tags were the same but one was obviously not marked correctly. Went through the process of returning and they don't supply a prepaid return label. I'm going to have to pay to return the pants. Not sure that I will buy any more through this vendor.I don't stray much from Lee Dungarees but I needed a hearty pair of work jeans. I am very pleased with these. The feel good and are comfortable. My only issue is that the belt loops are off compared to all the other jeans I have. I wear a phone clip and like it to be pushed against the belt loop on my right hip. These loops are right over the pocket. I either have my phone over my pocket or if I move it then it is almost around my back.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0530065", "1": "0.2170476", "2": "0.069955476", "3": "0.20846727", "4": "0.13960283", "5": "0.14677095", "6": "0.16514935"}}
