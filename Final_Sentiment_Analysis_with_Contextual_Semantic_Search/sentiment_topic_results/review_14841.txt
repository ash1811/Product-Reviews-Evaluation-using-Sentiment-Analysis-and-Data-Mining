{"text": "For some reason, this product just didn't hope to do what I thought it would do. I bought another bandeau bra in which my nipples showed through, so I looked for a bra with removable pads to fix that problem. This product just didn't do it for me. It wasn't as comfortable as the other bandeau I had purchased, and I found the material somewhat scratchy. Also, I am a 34C and the Medium fit me quite well, except when it came to the removable pads. They kept slipping to the sides and I kept needing to re-adjust them, which is really awkward to do in public. I wanted to like this product, but it fell short of my expectations.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10562189", "1": "0.29482156", "2": "0.05043229", "3": "0.12151194", "4": "0.1832123", "5": "0.127661", "6": "0.11673901"}}
