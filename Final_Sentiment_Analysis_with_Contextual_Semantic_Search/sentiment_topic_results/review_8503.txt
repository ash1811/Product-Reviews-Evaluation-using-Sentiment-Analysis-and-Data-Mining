{"text": "I got it because it came in an extra wide. I found them comfortable and also well ventilated. They are inexpensive. I use them for walking or driving. I like Reeboks in general. There is one problem with these and other Reeboks I have had. This is why only 3 stars. The innersole lining seems to deform during wear forming a lump behind the big toe or in other places. I do not know if it is the piece directly beneath the foot or some material under it but it is uncomfortable to have to walk on this lump. It is as if something beneath the liner is detached and bunching up. It is annoying but  might only happen to me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20398909", "1": "0.2854472", "2": "0.04559298", "3": "0.12986526", "4": "0.2318034", "6": "0.100546554"}}
