{"text": "I've always loved Birkenstocks, and they will always be my favorite sandals. I gave them 5 stars because they fit great, delivery was timely, they use quality materials, and I managed to get them for &#60;$100.My Pros-They go great with shorts or pants.-Improve posture.-Wide array of shades/colors to choose from.-Can be dressed up or down.My Cons-Keep them dry (if possible) they're not flip-flops.-If you have a dog (and a chewer like me) be cautious. Dogs love these.Just don't get the denim ones.
