{"text": "I use to have some beefy T's back when they were better quality and the thickest/most comfortable cotton shirts I have ever worn. The fit perfectlly too and looked awesome!These new ones, not so much.Pros:-Fits alright, not like it use to (Size: Medium)-Still thicker than most of those silk-like POS's you find now-a-days. (but not by much.)Cons:-Collar no longer fits snug-Bit more athletic size-A LOT THINNER than they were before.I might buy some more considering the price and the selection I have offered is better than any other clothing store, but that's all.2 Stars for gimping out on your product Hanes.
