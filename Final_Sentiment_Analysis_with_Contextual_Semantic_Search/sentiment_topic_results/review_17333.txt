{"text": "Until I found Carhartt big men's clothes here on Amazon. I had been shopping at a large Big & Tall Men's chain store. The chain store items were expensive and the quality was just OK. The Carhartt products feel like the same quality you would find when shopping for regular sized items, and they look great. The Carhartt clothes seem to have been cut for big sizes (as I've had issues with some larger sizes fitting well.) Rather than just expanding a pattern designed for regular sizes and making it larger.So far in the past month I've bought five shirts and a jacket, all of these items are 4X and fit great. The size might be a little larger than other 4X clothes, but I appreciate the little bit of extra room.The materials seem to be above average compared to the Big & Tall chain stores I've shopped at in the past, and again the prices are much better. At the store we normally shop a shirt like this with this, with a similar type of fabric and buttons, would be closer to $35-$40 than $25. And then the quality would probably not be as good.I bought the 4X Port colored shirt and love it. I've been told that the way it fits looks very good, and I like the feel of the fit and material.If anyone asked me about Carhartt men's clothes I would not hesitate to recommend them.Over all a high quality product at an outstanding price!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.023242155", "1": "0.3472329", "2": "0.0331614", "3": "0.14474334", "4": "0.15480143", "5": "0.12652908", "6": "0.17028965"}}
