{"text": "They are very water proof, very comfortable because of the large toe box. They are a bit warm and do no breath as well as some hiking shoes but that's to be expected considering your feet will stay dry even when standing in water as long as it does not come over the top. They do wear kind of quickly because the soles are not a hard composite. They do have great traction due to the softer compound. I wear a pair out every year or two. I am on my 4th pair I have several in different conditions i.e. yard work only pair, work pair, and a pair I try to keep in good enough shape to be worn casually.
