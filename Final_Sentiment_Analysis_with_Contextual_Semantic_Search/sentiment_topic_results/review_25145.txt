{"text": "I agree with a prior reviewer who stated that these pants are particularly good for tall, thin guys.  I ordered the 32x36 size and have been very happy with the quality, the fit, the comfort, and the color.  I've never seen Levis like this and hope the company decides to continue manufacturing them.  The zippered pocket on the left is a nice extra as well.  Definitely worth every penny.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3639801", "2": "0.09361123", "3": "0.104808465", "4": "0.0781165", "5": "0.23364857", "6": "0.122257315"}}
