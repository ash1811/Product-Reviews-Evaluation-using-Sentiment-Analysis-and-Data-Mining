{"text": "Items have not been used yet.  I bought these for, my yet to be born, grandson.  I found the fabric very nice and thick and soft but the design was already cracking even before washing.  I gave it 3 stars because of the fabric quality and because I embroidered over the design anyway.  As they have not been used, I do not know how they will hold up in the wash or if the snaps will hold up (as one review said the snaps all broke - hoping this isn't so).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.17111085", "2": "0.12766427", "3": "0.13343652", "4": "0.04409838", "5": "0.34546694", "6": "0.17470823"}}
