{"text": "I bought this brush two years ago and have used it ever since. It is without a doubt the best brush I've ever had for polishing dress shoes. The bristles are soft and have a luxurious feel to them. With an appropriate shoe polish, I can get my wingtips and such to a pretty glossy level without too much effort.The wood handle is very comfortable, at least for most guys. I suspect that most women or guys with smaller hands might find it to be a bit too large and uncomfortable (I wear a size large in gloves, which might give you a basis for comparison).But...$19??? That's a pretty stiff price, even for an outstanding brush. I paid  $8. Of course, I monitored Amazon's pricing for awhile to make sure I got a good deal. Unless uou're awash in cash, I suggest you do the same. Check the alternatives on Amazon and look up the prices for this brush on the Internet. I suspect that you can get either this brush or something comparable for a lower price.The pricing, of course, does not take away from the overall excellence of this brush, and I highly recommend it--at a lower price.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.3027321", "2": "0.16293", "3": "0.23391487", "4": "0.088616036", "5": "0.09830075", "6": "0.11136602"}}
