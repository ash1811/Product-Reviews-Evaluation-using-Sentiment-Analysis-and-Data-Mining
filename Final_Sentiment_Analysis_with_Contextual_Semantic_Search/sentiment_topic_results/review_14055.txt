{"text": "I am a fan of the Eco-Drive solar-powered Citizen line of watches after my brother got me one for the holidays a year ago. The one he got me, the Calibre 8700, has 3 chronometer displays and is only about 35 mm bezel (watch face) width. It is also difficult to set as each of the 3 chronometers has its own directions so I am constantly consulting the manual. In contrast, the Professional Diver Watch has a huge masculine bezel face, almost 50 mm. A very bold and masculine look, especially with the black rubber strap, as opposed to the shiny metal bling that I personally find distasteful in a men's watch. Even more importantly, the Diver Watch has no chronometer displays and this makes changing the time and date easy to use. You pull out the crown to the second click to set the time; to the first click to set the date. That's it. So easy to use and so bold to look at. I only have one criticism: The rubber strap is big and lacks flexibility so you have to sit the watch in its case or else it will fall over and get scratched. Also the strap is so rigid that it is very difficult to remove it from your wrist. But on balance this is my favorite looking watch, especially for the price, around 185-225 on Amazon, depending on the sales, and for any man looking for a bold and masculine look over the \"pretty\" the Professional Diver is a great choice.Update: I still love my Citizen diver's watch and have found another bold, masculine automatic watch that requires no battery: The Invicta Corduva 3448, which I purchased for 171 dollars, about 30 dollars less than I spent on my Citizen. With a 52 millimeter bezel, its face is even bigger and bolder than the Citizen's.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.20953137", "1": "0.17790298", "2": "0.28111887", "3": "0.076888874", "4": "0.087092794", "5": "0.014887738", "6": "0.15257733"}}
