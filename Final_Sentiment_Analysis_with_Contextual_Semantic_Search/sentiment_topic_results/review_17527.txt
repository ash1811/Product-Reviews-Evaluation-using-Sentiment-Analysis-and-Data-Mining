{"text": "I wanted to wait a few weeks before writing a review. I have worn this watch daily and use the alarm to remind me to take medication. It's a great watch. Takes a couple of minutes to read the manual and learn to use the alarm and stop watch features, but it is much more straightforward than other chronographs I have owned.  The velcro band is comfortable and light weight and works fine. It is attached with watch pins to the watch so it doesn't add extra bulk to the watch as do bands that cover the whole wrist. The band is much more comfortable than I thought it would be. I wear the watch for all my daily activities including gardening and it's comfortable, accurate and light weight, easy to read, and looks good. It's a great watch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07305641", "1": "0.32991105", "2": "0.17834036", "3": "0.1235063", "4": "0.19853441", "6": "0.09425898"}}
