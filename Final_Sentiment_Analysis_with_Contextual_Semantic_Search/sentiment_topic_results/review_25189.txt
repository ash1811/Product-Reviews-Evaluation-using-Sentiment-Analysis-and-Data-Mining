{"text": "My title tells what I really think of the new briefs. I believe they have changed to cheaper material because my older ones are thicker. The material on these may be the kind that shrink easily.  This is why I buy them in a larger size and for my legs. I will find out when I wash them.  Steve Harvey, on TV, said that he buys the briefs that cover the thighs because they look more decent, but I don't think I could get used to them and they cost more money. Followup: After washing the briefs, they prove how thin they are and have also shrunk some. Like many products now, they have slowly and slyly cheapened things. Food and clothing are not what they used to be!  The ingredients were changed on Aramis shaving cream, so I no longer get a good shave. I mentioned it to Macy's etc, but they did not care!I have since switched to something cheaper.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.05568154", "1": "0.32083437", "3": "0.10208319", "4": "0.29489738", "5": "0.13848351", "6": "0.08558768"}}
