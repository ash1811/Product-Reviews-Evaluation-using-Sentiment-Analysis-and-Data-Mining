{"text": "Arrived quickly and as pictured.  The material is thin but for the price is reasonable.  My legs are on the thin side and so these socks aren't tight but the elastic at the top keeps them from falling down since my thighs are normal sized. If you have super thin legs & thighs then they may be a little loose.  The first pair that came had a hole in one of the socks but when I contacted the seller, they promptly responded and sent me a replacement pair.  It would have been better if there were no holes in the first place but the response was quick and easy.  Thanks! will buy again", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.116413735", "1": "0.2976828", "2": "0.15929675", "3": "0.1851247", "4": "0.03602436", "5": "0.062422875", "6": "0.14303485"}}
