{"text": "These are the original high quality Keen Sandals. Heavy gauge sole, strong construction, compressible foot bed for comfort. After being to the store yesterday where they have a display of new Keen sandals I was appalled at how poorly constructed the new version is...the plastic is akin to the stuff they use on flip flops, the upper construction enters the shoe a full 1/4 from the edge, overall a cheap shadow of these shoes. Hopefully Keen will not go the way of so many other shoe companies and cheapen their shoes to the point of undesirability. You may want to consider an extra pair if you hope to find them again in the future.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.24200152", "1": "0.09071883", "2": "0.18210588", "3": "0.12619443", "4": "0.18382242", "5": "0.027223852", "6": "0.1479331"}}
