{"text": "I purchased this to alleviate my SPD pain and back spasms.  I'm almost 23 weeks along in my second pregnancy and have been in pain for over 6 weeks.  I do plan on working until my due date, but at this point I'm not sure I'm going to make it from the pain I'm experiencing and I was looking for some relief.My son was 10 lbs 4 oz and really destroyed my skin (and to answer the questions everybody always has- it was a vaginal birth, no diabetes, and I was under my pre pregnancy weight in a week).  I am apparently not blessed with elastic skin so I just have a loose blob of poochy skin hanging below my bellybutton from my first pregnancy.  I am not a plus sized woman, nor do I have rolls anywhere else on my body, but this belt just pushed all that skin up and left me with a disgusting muffin top.  I am a medical professional and don't have the luxury of wearing sweat pants and t shirts all day, so this was not going to work.I ended up returning this and ordered the maternabelt stretch instead.  It actually covers the whole belly and gives you really nice support.  I'd recommend that over this.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10612423", "1": "0.24884641", "2": "0.103363", "3": "0.22234", "4": "0.13465689", "5": "0.13557762", "6": "0.049091827"}}
