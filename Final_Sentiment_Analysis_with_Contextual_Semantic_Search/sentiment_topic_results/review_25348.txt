{"text": "CZ's look much better than these unsightly stones. I looked at the reviews and did some homework on the diamonds. It turns out that I2-I3 are bottom of the barrell compared to flawless. Add to the fact that the disclosure of treatments,(laser drilling,coatings,baking,radiation, or doublets) and you can very well get a pair that looks even worse as you clean them in your sonic cleaner. I would not advise anyone who knows what to look for in a diamond these earings, or any other that has a warning statement of being treated to enhance clarity. Buyer beware. Buy the book, \"How to buy a diamond\" by Fred Crueller and never get ripped off by online sellers.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.29021397", "1": "0.15900756", "2": "0.14101076", "3": "0.14007835", "4": "0.18364139", "5": "0.057739183", "6": "0.028308772"}}
