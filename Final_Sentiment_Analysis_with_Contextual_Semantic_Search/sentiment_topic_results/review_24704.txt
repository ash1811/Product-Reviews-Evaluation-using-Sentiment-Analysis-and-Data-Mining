{"text": "I bought this shoe horn thinking it would make my life easier. While the quality is excellent and length is just right, I believe it has a big design issue!! while I thought that the spring would make wearing my shoes easier, it actually made it very difficult to control and put my shoe on, It's too flexible to stretch the knee of the shoe which makes the shoe always win the struggle.If you you're looking for a good shoe horn, I recommend going for a classic one that doesn't contain a spring. Putting a shoe on needs something that is very sturdy and rigid not \"FLEXIBLE\"", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.036412433", "1": "0.3217812", "2": "0.29117697", "3": "0.07686434", "4": "0.027866405", "5": "0.16876765", "6": "0.077131"}}
