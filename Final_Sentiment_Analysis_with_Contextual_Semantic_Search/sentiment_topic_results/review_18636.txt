{"text": "I bought a terrible quality shemagh of a different brand a while back. Dye ran, the weave was VERY loose, and it just felt like horrible quality. This one is WAY more like it. It's light and airy, like it should be, but substantial enough in the weave to serve the variety of purposes that most people hope to keep a shemagh around for. It filters particles, blocks sun and wind, wraps nicely, and is accurately measured. True to color, too. Which is nice. I was prepared for this to suck, and was very pleasantly surprised by how much it didn't. If I ever needed another for whatever reason, I would be perfectly happy buying another of this same type.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16329643", "1": "0.3339896", "2": "0.21126112", "3": "0.072632864", "5": "0.08034478", "6": "0.13629891"}}
