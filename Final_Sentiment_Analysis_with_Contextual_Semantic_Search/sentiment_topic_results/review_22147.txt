{"text": "The material is good, but it does snag (if you touch Velcro or a sharp corner, the threads pull away).  The glove is sold as a liner, (works good for this), I would not use it without other gloves on top, the material is too delicate. The sewing and construction is good quality.  The sizing is good (a large size really is large) so you don't have to buy a size larger than usual.  I got the white, (I want to see when it is dirty, so I wash it as needed).I use this inside of thickly insulated bicycle gloves, it does keep my hands a little warmer, but not much;  if you only have thin gloves over top, you would notice a bigger improvement.  I'll continue to use these gloves, and would buy them again (even a little bit extra warmth helps my cold fingers).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.23431768", "2": "0.30276406", "3": "0.24455364", "4": "0.03651427", "5": "0.09008195", "6": "0.08945895"}}
