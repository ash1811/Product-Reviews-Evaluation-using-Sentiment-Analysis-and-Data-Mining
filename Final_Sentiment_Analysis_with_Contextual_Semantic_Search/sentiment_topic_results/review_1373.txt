{"text": "I actually purchased this pack from my local thrift shop, so I got it for a song ($3.99, I think.)  I've been buying backpacks, usually from LLBean, since my children were in grade school, and I expect quality packs to last a long time--the LLBean bags my kids owned lasted them from 1-10th grade without issue.  I've purchased Jansport bags for myself, and always been happy with them, and this bag is the best that I've ever had.  It's strong enough to use for travel as a carry on bag, and the telescoping handle allows me to pull it without hunching over or walking abnormally.  Zippers are industrial grade, and the amount of room in this thing is amazing.  Plenty of space for all of my books, notebooks, my laptop, my lunch and gym clothes.  Fabric, handles, reinforced corners and very smooth ride.  I think that this might be the last backpack that I'll ever have to buy--if it ever wears out, I'll gladly pay full price for a replacement.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3281116", "2": "0.09771003", "3": "0.23295692", "4": "0.11536259", "5": "0.2217659"}}
