{"text": "I might suggest the olive drab camo for any paintball games or other sneaky-sneakiness, but other than color, they're all fairly high-quality scarves by Rothco. I bought this one, the OD and the sand/desert camo patterns, and I like this foliage pattern the least.Not for the hipster really. They're a little too heavy and long for just a fashion statement.Plenty long enough to wrap your neck a few times, just right to wrap your face if you want to look ridiculous.Decent price and probably as low as you'll find anywhere.
