{"text": "As most already know, I dress in mens business professional attire for work almost every day.  I tried Bostonian once before and had a less than great experience with durability (one heel actually came off for no apparent reason but that was YEARS ago)  I inspected these shoes carefully upon arrival and found to my pleasure that the shoes seem to be very nice and have a high quality look and feel to them.  Best of all, when I slipped them on they were fairly comfy right off the bat.  I ordered an 11 D even though I size at 10.5 D.  Wear a nice high quality dress sock and you should be fine....wear the cheapo no padding version and you may be a bit loose if you order half sizes above your exact fit.  The proof will be in the pudding of course, but so far, so good!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1550138", "1": "0.22093631", "2": "0.14214964", "3": "0.14077836", "4": "0.07799245", "5": "0.16040388", "6": "0.10272559"}}
