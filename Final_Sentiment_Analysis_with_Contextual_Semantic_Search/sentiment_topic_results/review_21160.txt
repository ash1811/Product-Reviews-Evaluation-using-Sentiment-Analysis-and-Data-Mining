{"text": "I was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews on these costumes, but since I was just getting them for my 3 year old, I figured it was worth a chance.  These costumes were better quality than I was expecting, and my son absolutely loves them! He wears them all the time and loves pretending to be a super hero!  I think this is a great set of costumes for a reasonable price.  You can't beat this! I also love that they are one size and so he won't outgrow them immediately.  Perfect for little boys who like to play dress up and pretend to be super heroes!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14278537", "1": "0.42624998", "2": "0.13476814", "3": "0.110767975", "4": "0.10696102", "5": "0.07571352"}}
