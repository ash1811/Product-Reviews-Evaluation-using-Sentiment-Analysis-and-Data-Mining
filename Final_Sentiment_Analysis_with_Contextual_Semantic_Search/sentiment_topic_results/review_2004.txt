{"text": "I have bad feet & use Birkenstock high arch orthotics in my shoes. Merrells work so well since they have excellent mid foot support. Due to a nerve condition in my feet, Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome, I can NOT wear shoes with laces. Merrells are the ONLY brand of traditional shoes I have found that do NOT put my feet to sleep. They offer top of the line mid foot support at a great price. This pair is well made, but fit a tad bit big, but since I use orthotics, it worked perfect. The soles will slip on wet, but most shoes do. Highly recommend.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05951846", "1": "0.18239981", "2": "0.16123664", "3": "0.2696134", "4": "0.18306787", "5": "0.14183536"}}
