{"text": "I bought these socks for my Vibrams that I use indoor for elliptical and other gym workouts. Absolutely no complaints and prevents me from having to wash my Vibrams so often... have not tried them with my hiking Vibrams, mainly because I use those to hike in & out of waterfalls, rivers, etc and I'm assuming socks would make that a different experience. So still washing the hiking Vibrams after every use ...oh, and according to sizing it said I should order Medium, but was at the bottom range, so decided to order the small size to make sure the socks fit well in the shoe... Glad I ordered the small, fits perfect on my feet and in the shoes", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08509068", "1": "0.32078952", "2": "0.1092637", "3": "0.1872344", "5": "0.23167937", "6": "0.06363055"}}
