{"text": "This shoe comes with Rockport's supreme comfort and quality.  Rockport excels at bringing athletic shoe comfort to business and casual shoes.  Just be aware that this shoe runs short.  The shortness is not in the overall length but in the ball of the foot.  The natural bending point of the sole was behind the ball of my foot, making extremely uncomfortable at first.  I had to return mine and order up a full size larger. Also be aware the shoe has a steel shank.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15036486", "1": "0.054231934", "2": "0.2107128", "3": "0.054875083", "4": "0.29035908", "6": "0.23640609"}}
