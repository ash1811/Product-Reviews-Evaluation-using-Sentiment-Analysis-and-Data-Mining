{"text": "These are an extremely comfortable socks. Unfortunately these really do not fit size 5 as advertised, hence my 3 star review. I'm size 5.5 - 6, and these are way too large.  I still use them with my loose fitting winter boots.  However, I've purchased these specifically to use during my daily workouts. And it's very unfortunate that these socks are too large to wear with my sneakers comfortably.  I of course could just pull them up, but this makes the grey heal visible, and I've purchased them specifically because they are &#34;No Show&#34;.  This is a shame, since they truly feel very soft and comfortable.  For now I just wear them around the house and soon will wear with winter boots.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05082099", "1": "0.23322695", "2": "0.078222476", "3": "0.32449162", "4": "0.08978304", "5": "0.22118188"}}
