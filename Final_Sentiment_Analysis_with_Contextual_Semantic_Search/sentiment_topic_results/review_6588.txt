{"text": "I ordered these socks to replace some I had purchased a few years ago on a trip.  I could not remember the name of the socks, but when I read about Thorlo, I determined I had found them.  Indeed I did!  These are absolutely the best docks you can buy.  The fabricis so soft and the arch support is the best for long workouts.  Whether you are an exercise junkie our just one who enjoys a good walk,Thorlo should be your only socks.  They are either best and worth every dime!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.34529957", "2": "0.14369741", "3": "0.15817796", "4": "0.074402", "5": "0.21920907", "6": "0.055885863"}}
