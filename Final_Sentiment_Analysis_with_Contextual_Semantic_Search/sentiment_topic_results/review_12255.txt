{"text": "I use to love Dearfoam slippers, but now they sew the tag in such a way that you can't remove one side of the tag. I'm a sewer, so I use seam rippers, but still can't get the whole tag out. The tags are made with a really stiff, itchy ribbon type of material and I actually get blisters from them. I just can't wear their slippers any longer. One lady wrote that these are quite stiff and not as comfortable as the older style and I agree with that too. It's a shame that they've become for concerned with people removing their tags than the comfort of their customers.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.076683596", "1": "0.37196675", "2": "0.20906149", "3": "0.0821651", "4": "0.17393056", "6": "0.08376302"}}
