{"text": "I wore these for a wedding in which I was a bridesmaid. I had them on for about 10 hours, and at first they were fairly comfortable, but after about hour 7 I was ready to kick them off. The heel was fine, I ordered the wide size, and took the other reviewers suggestions and went half a size up, and I'm glad I did, otherwise they would've been too small. My main complaint was the sole section under the ball of my foot. It stops right at the toe line, and kept cutting into the ball of my foot with each step. If the sole went all the way to the toes, these shoes would've been perfectly comfortable. I might try some inserts to go over that part for the next time I wear them, that might help. Otherwise they are very lovely shoes, they look great, excellent height, and I had no trouble walking all over the lawn while we were all having our photos taken.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.104918934", "1": "0.28335747", "2": "0.079070844", "3": "0.14831002", "4": "0.1668917", "5": "0.11952609", "6": "0.09792494"}}
