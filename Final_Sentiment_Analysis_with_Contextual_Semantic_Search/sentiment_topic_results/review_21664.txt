{"text": "I've been wanting to get one of these for my niece ever since she discovered the one I still have from when I was little. I ordered a slightly cheaper one from a different seller who sent me the wrong product and I had to send it back, and it also looked super cheap. After ordering from this seller and receiving this box, I should have dished out the extra money to begin with. It's beautiful and looks much better made, and I know my niece is going to love opening this on Christmas day.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14369553", "1": "0.33099812", "2": "0.07515668", "3": "0.057163823", "4": "0.093955554", "5": "0.18763405", "6": "0.11139628"}}
