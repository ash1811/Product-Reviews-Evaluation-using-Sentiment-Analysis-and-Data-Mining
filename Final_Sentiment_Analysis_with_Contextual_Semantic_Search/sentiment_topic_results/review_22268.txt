{"text": "I tried these socks because I heard wool socks are supposed to be great for your feet. I also was curious about trying toe socks. So I gave these a chance. These socks feel amazing. The material feels great on your feet. The individual toe slots for these socks takes a little while to get used to. But they fit well and are comfortable. My feet feel very cool in these. A great product.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.39151815", "2": "0.05187052", "3": "0.06126437", "4": "0.1902358", "5": "0.29811153"}}
