{"text": "Got this for my 2 1/2 year old for sunny California days. Seems to be very comfortable for him, and it doesn't fall over his eyes. Shades entire face & neck, has vents to keep him cool, adjustable and will fit him for a couple more years. Great feature: the chin strap is a safety strap (anti-strangling) and gives way at 10 lbs pull. Easy to clean. Worth every penny!! You won't be disappointed.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06666122", "1": "0.21017607", "2": "0.19514756", "3": "0.17302063", "4": "0.13664562", "5": "0.21501854"}}
