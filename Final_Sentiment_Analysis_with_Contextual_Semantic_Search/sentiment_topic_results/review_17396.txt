{"text": "I bought these socks as 'unisex' socks and my shoe size is 13. I'm a teacher here in Japan and and get to (have to?) run around most of the day in my 'sock' feet. These socks are very comfortable, and it's easy to slip shoes on and off (many times) during the day. It's pretty muggy here in Japan, and I have had trouble with sweating feet in the past. These socks seem to 'breathe' enough to wick away moisture and they have enough cushion on the bottom help tired feet. It's my policy to never give a perfect score for anything, because everything  (even me) can be improved. However I'd be willing to go 4.5 stars on these socks. By the way they were delivered  before the scheduled delivery date. I'd have to give that a 5.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05931098", "1": "0.061586406", "2": "0.25789782", "3": "0.17703585", "4": "0.13318789", "5": "0.26312277", "6": "0.047858283"}}
