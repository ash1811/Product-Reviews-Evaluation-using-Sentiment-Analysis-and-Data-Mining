{"text": "Lee jeans have always fit me well, so I search them out when in the market for my next pair.  They sit at the waist and are a slimmer fit than many others, especially the &#34;relaxed&#34; style.  Be advised these jeans are NOT made with heavy denim.  I am dissapointed in this, and wonder how they will hold up, especially since I wear my jeans all the time and am rough on them.  Time will tell.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.15798737", "2": "0.3342261", "3": "0.08243141", "4": "0.3421572", "6": "0.07564391"}}
