{"text": "Nice and comfortable panties.  I always trust Hanes to make great-value panties like these.  They really do last a long time and stay soft and pretty wash after wash.  Even after wearing them for a long time they always fit extremely well.  A great value for your money considering how long they last.  Cotton panties are always my first choice for basic, everyday wear and Hanes quality (as well as Amazon's great service) has always exceeded my (get these panties and you will see why) expectations!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1438453", "1": "0.3617341", "3": "0.030492064", "4": "0.16462746", "5": "0.2690525", "6": "0.027730204"}}
