{"text": "I've worn leather sandals for years that ranged from $10 at Target that last about 6 months then fall apart to nicer Rainbows at $45 that last a year or so.  These sandals are by far the most comfortable I've owned and have lasted 6 months so far with no problems!  Great purchase with years of use to come!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.24979493", "2": "0.23886155", "3": "0.25383347", "4": "0.078070074", "5": "0.13976866", "6": "0.035578318"}}
