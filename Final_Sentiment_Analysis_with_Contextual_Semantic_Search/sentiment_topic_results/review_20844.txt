{"text": "I'm giving one star! All I've owned in flip flops like this are Havianas...this particular merchant sent me the same sizes, well one is 2 sizes too small...is that their fault no, they were marked wrong. I ordered 38's and got more like 36's. Otherwise the flip flops are like your normal Havianas..well made and durable and super comfy!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11872154", "1": "0.18916078", "2": "0.28006116", "3": "0.13942319", "6": "0.265258"}}
