{"text": "Hanes cotton briefs have always been my favorite undies to wear, so it actually pains me to give them a horrible review. I ordered 12 pairs of these, and out of the 7 pairs I have tried on so far, I ripped 4 of them off and threw them directly into the trash. Something has gone very wrong with the quality control on this product. Maybe they are making them with an unskilled labor force overseas, I don't know. But what I was sent were four packages of very obviously irregular briefs. The very first pair I tried on, they felt screwed up so I looked in the mirror. The side seams were noticeably different... one side was about 1/4-1/2 inch longer than the other side. I attempted to get through the day wearing them, but they kept twisting and giving me a wedgy on the shorter seam side. After wearing them for an hour, I took them off and threw them in the garbage. Unfortunately, I have now had the exact same experience with three more pairs. I had assumed that I couldn't return underwear, so I had thrown away all the packaging. Now I regret that. At least 50% of my order is defective product.I have to admit that this is not the first time I have had problems with this product. Years ago they were very high quality, but they slowly have gone downhill. The last time I bought them, a few years ago, I noticed then that a few pairs were not made quite right. They also didn't last years like they used to. After about six months, all the elastic started warping and little pieces of rubber started to stick out of the waistbands. Also a string would stick out of the waist occasionally, and if I attempted to put it, it would unravel around the whole waist. I chalked it up to a fluke batch, and ordered them again. I can see clearly with this recent Amazon order that this product is no longer the high quality product that it used to be. It is now complete crap, and I have spent my last dollar on them.Sorry Hanes... you lost a longtime customer.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06840103", "1": "0.3545609", "2": "0.10092876", "3": "0.13978465", "4": "0.10559018", "5": "0.086272135", "6": "0.14446232"}}
