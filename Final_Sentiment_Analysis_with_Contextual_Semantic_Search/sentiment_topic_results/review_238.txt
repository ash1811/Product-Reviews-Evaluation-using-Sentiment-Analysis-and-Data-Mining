{"text": "Looks good, feels good, well made. It can be difficult to find a good quality polo shirt with a pocket (to conveniently hold reading glasses or other small items) but this one fills the bill.  I bought several of different colors (greens & brown, I'm an earth tone) and I love them all. Great for looking a little extra spiffy at a technician job where most workers wear t-shirts.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.57139844", "2": "0.095802024", "3": "0.07060567", "5": "0.13135743", "6": "0.124447525"}}
