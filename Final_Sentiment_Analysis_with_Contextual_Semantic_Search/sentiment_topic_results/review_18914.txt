{"text": "I bought this for my husband after his other velcro-banded watch stopped working. He loves it! The wrist opening is a little small and he has to &#34;squeeze&#34; his hand through the opening, but other than that he has all praises for this watch. He mentioned that sometimes he has to check to see if he is still wearing it because it is so light and comfortable. Also, the date stamp on the face and the Indiglo light make it a perfect day to night watch. Highly recommended!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.055205204", "1": "0.35053766", "2": "0.23382908", "3": "0.092533074", "4": "0.12858771", "5": "0.13563676"}}
