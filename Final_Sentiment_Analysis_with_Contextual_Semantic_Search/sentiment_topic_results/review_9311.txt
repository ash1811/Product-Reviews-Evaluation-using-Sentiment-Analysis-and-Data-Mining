{"text": "My husband wanted a pair of shearling slippers for the winter. After looking at some that are mega-expensive in big-name stores,  I looked online and found this pair. It was reasonably priced and they looked just like what he wanted, so I went ahead and bought them.  He wears a Men's size 10 1/2 - 11, so I got these in 11. They fit him we'll and are super warm. He loves them! I highly recommend these slipper booties.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03836368", "1": "0.22139363", "2": "0.11251593", "3": "0.07177762", "4": "0.3020184", "5": "0.12902643", "6": "0.12490428"}}
