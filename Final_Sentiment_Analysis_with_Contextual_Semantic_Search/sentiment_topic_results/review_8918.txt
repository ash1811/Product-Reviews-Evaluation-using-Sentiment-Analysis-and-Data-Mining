{"text": "These shoes run small. I have an 8C (wide) foot, and I bought a 9C/D (wide) and they were so tight/small that my toes went numb within a few minutes. I worked with them for a full shift, of which I had to remove them several times to let the feeling back into my feet! No arch support at all.
