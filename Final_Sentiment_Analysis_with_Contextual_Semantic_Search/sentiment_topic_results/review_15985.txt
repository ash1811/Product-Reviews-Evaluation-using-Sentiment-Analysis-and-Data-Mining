{"text": "Took advice from other reviewers and bought a size bigger than what I normally wear. Got the sandals and had to immediately send them back for replacement because they were way too big for me. Got the one size down replacement and have been wearing them for 3 months. Never chafed, never a blister (unlike other flip flops). My one complaint is that even at my normal size they are still too big. I can wear them but they are quite loose and the pad sticks out an inch beyond my foot. My guess is that because these are completely open and NOT closed shoes that it is possible that I wear a 7 in this type of footwear (never purchased this type on-line before; just tried some cheap ones on in a store and bought them with no attention to size LOL!) I haven't worn a 7 shoe since I was a teenager a VERY long time ago. So, I'm thinking about ordering another pair in a 7 and keeping these 8s as a spare...or give them to someone. They haven't worn a bit and are extremely comfortable. Best casual flip flops for the money.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14182699", "1": "0.2648479", "2": "0.22730996", "3": "0.13547926", "4": "0.04436052", "5": "0.10194057", "6": "0.0842348"}}
