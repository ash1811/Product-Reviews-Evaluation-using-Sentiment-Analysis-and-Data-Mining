{"text": "Most carhartt pants are too high waisted for my husband, but these fit the bill.  They are a very competitive price on amazon and fit right for the man that doesn't want his pants under his chest.  He likes his pants just under his belly.  He's 50.  We ordered the 32 length which is his usual size and thought they were too long when we got them but after washed, they are a great length and none too short.  Just right.  He's glad carhartt is finally seeing a market for the below waist fit.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.059657812", "1": "0.42850372", "2": "0.075892374", "3": "0.09197917", "4": "0.063744895", "6": "0.27695757"}}
