{"text": "Firstly, these pants are a bit small in the crotch.If you wear pants and they are small in the crotch, then you know how that feels.  I don't have to explain, it is my disdain.  Pants of quality that don't fit right are a travesty.  That is what these pants are like.Also, I would say don't get the twill.  The fabric is slim and the upper leg and crotch area don't give much room, so no stretchiness.  I feel a bit restricted.  Wearing these in my chair at work I thought they were going to burst, leaving me exposed.  I might break these in a bit, but first off they are uncomfortable.Had I been at the store and tried these on I might have passed, just a heads up.My Advice:Go to a retail and pick these up, they may fit better.  Not for the winter months either, these are some thin cotton my friend.But they do look pretty okay; however, they fall off my ass.  I find that weird, especially since they are too tight in other places.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06284233", "1": "0.45805293", "2": "0.14330445", "3": "0.11687663", "4": "0.059310548", "5": "0.08738064", "6": "0.07223249"}}
