{"text": "Normally I'm very thrifty, so purchasing these socks is taking a leap of faith in the Thorlo brand name.  Fourteen years ago when I first married my husband I found his socks to be a little lacking (holey instead of holy).  So we purchased a wide variety of socks, the sport socks were Thorlo's, which are still going strong!  Yes, they are pricey, but if you are dollar cost averaging, you actually come out ahead in the long run.  My husband has very muscular calves and these new socks do not cut off his circulation, they are also extremely soft and have nice cushioning on the bottom (not too much, just right for dress shoes).  We will wait and see if these have the longevity of the sport socks.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.059025474", "1": "0.085008994", "2": "0.15833294", "3": "0.20231207", "4": "0.18507402", "5": "0.22240576", "6": "0.087840736"}}
