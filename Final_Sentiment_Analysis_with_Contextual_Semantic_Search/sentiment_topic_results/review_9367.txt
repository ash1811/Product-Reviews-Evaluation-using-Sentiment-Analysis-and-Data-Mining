{"text": "They are nice pants but they do not wear well in the seams.  I'm a short fat guy and I buy two pair at a time, I wear them two days in a row, 5 days a week (mandatory dress code) and they always wear through in the inseam on me.  However they are very comfortable so maybe thats the price for comfort.  I go through two pair every 4 months.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.115102805", "1": "0.32321376", "2": "0.07966257", "3": "0.20484765", "4": "0.103111014", "5": "0.1704708"}}
