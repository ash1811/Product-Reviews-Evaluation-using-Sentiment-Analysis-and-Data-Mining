{"text": "I expected more out of these.  The fabric is very thin & after just one washing and never used,  they've already started with a small hole in the seam.  That shouldn't happen and is not a sign of high quality.A plus is the lack of a tag-so no scratching. I washed & dried (low heat) in the usual fashion  prior to first wearing, but I have to say, I'm quite disappointed by the quality. On inspection, there are a lot of redundant threads on the inside.  Fit is good overall-but they run small.  (flimsy) Not nicely made.Honestly,  a six pack of cotton underwear at Costco is a better value, better fit & higher quality.  ([...]) . I paid almost $20-$12.45 plus about $7 for Shipping & Handling.  Not worth it!  So I expected more.
