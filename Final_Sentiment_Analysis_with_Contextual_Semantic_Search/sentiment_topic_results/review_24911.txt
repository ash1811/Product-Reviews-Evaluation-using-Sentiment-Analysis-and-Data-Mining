{"text": "This is my third pair of these insoles.  I started using them 2 years ago and they are great.  They were recommended for my high arches.  Each pair of insoles last through about 2 pairs of running shoes so they're well worth the money.  I think these have made a noticeable difference and I recommend them to anyone who runs because the insoles that come with your running shoes are nothing more than a piece of foam.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1790904", "1": "0.073941335", "2": "0.2121714", "3": "0.18390326", "5": "0.2708357", "6": "0.07627692"}}
