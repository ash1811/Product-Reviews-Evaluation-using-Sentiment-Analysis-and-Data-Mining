{"text": "I love the way these sandals look, fit, and feel. I was able to wear them straight out of the box with no problem. Now after several uses though I really like these shoes I am not completely happy with them. They don't have enough support on the arch of my foot. After a simple five mile day hike I return home with aching soar feet and heals that I don't have with other shoes. Though I really like them and will continue to wear them for this price I will not be purchasing them again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.26244614", "2": "0.09312884", "3": "0.16020331", "4": "0.34281844", "6": "0.13480519"}}
