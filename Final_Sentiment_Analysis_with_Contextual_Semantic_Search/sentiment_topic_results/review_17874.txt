{"text": "My new watch is wonderful - now that I got the watch band adjusted.  I have a small wrist and the normal adjustments weren't enough.  I contacted Casio and they sent me instructions for removing links.  Fortunately for me I have a talented husband who was finally able to figure it out and remove the links to make it fit.  I can't read the time as easily as I thought I would be able to.  The black face makes it a little difficult.  But for the money - it is a great little watch!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05223494", "1": "0.17045514", "2": "0.1806057", "3": "0.27905127", "4": "0.13282442", "5": "0.10044157", "6": "0.08438695"}}
