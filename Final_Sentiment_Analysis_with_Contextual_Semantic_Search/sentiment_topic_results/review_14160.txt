{"text": "I received this robe for Christmas a few years ago and it's just awesome. It comfortable and is still in perfect condition. I especially like how these robes are very absorbant. I've had a few in the past that were heavier, but really didn't absorb anything.In fact my SO liked it so much that she stole it from me for over a year. Well, this Christmas I got her one and now we are both happy :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.087319635", "1": "0.2477418", "2": "0.07846383", "3": "0.28846475", "5": "0.1449718", "6": "0.14841685"}}
