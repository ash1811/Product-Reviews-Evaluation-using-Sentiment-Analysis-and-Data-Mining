{"text": "I tried this one and it looked wonderful! My husband absolutely love it. It fit my curves perfectly. I am 5'6 1/2 170lbs. I was worried that it would not fit but it fit great. My only complaint is that it ripped when I tried it on. I purposely took off my wedding ring that it would not snag! Unfortunately it did. I received the product on time which is great. Hope this helps!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.056545068", "1": "0.44151744", "2": "0.04166811", "3": "0.111502625", "4": "0.05104076", "5": "0.18329442", "6": "0.11443157"}}
