{"text": "These are the nicest onesies out there I think.  The cotton is extreme soft, the fit is roomy and not tight, the construction on them is excellent.  I highly recommend this brand.  I do machine embroidery and they embroider out beautifully as well.  I can't say enough good about these - you'll enjoy them and so will your baby.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.059897285", "1": "0.41236413", "2": "0.1980865", "3": "0.12132272", "5": "0.068518765", "6": "0.13430044"}}
