{"text": "These shoes fit well, a little tight at first because of the lining, but quickly conforms to your foot.  Love that they are so nice and warm, no socks needed! Just wore them shopping, right out of the box, and came home with no blisters or other problems. First time in a long time that I've been able to do that! The soles are very thick but the shoe doesn't feel heavy while wearing them. They seem very well made and I expect them to hold up for several years.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12185614", "1": "0.27521065", "2": "0.10319157", "3": "0.16380809", "4": "0.13973795", "5": "0.16347554", "6": "0.032720067"}}
