{"text": "I have tall sons with big (and in some cases wide) feet. My oldest wears a size 16 and the next one wears a 15. You can't walk into brick and mortar stores and get shoes for feet that size.Even though my younger 3 boys don't have huge feet yet, I still choose the New Balance brand over others. New Balance size ranges, quality, and pricing are consistently reliable.Amazon is the best place to get New Balance shoes at the best price. Forget about other websites and hassling with coupon codes, slow shipping, and difficult returns. Amazon's free returns and Prime 2 day shipping make buying New Balance from Amazon a no brainer. No penalty if you guess the wrong size.This shoe, in particular, was great for both of my oldest sons. Black is perfect to disguise dirt and scuffs. They wear these daily to school, or just to hang out with friends. This is a great sneaker that can be worn with just about anything.
