{"text": "I got this for a day of walking around at the San Diego zoo.  Very cool, did not have the sweaty hat problem like I did with my baseball caps.  At almost $40 a cap, it really hurts the wallet when they shrink and don't fit anymore.  I don't see that happening with this $14 hat.After wearing this hat a couple of more times in really sunny days, my shaved head would turn a little red.  It appears that the very top of the hat up to the first stitching line is thinner than the rest of the hat, to where some sun can still penetrate through. I guess not a big deal for those that have hair to protect them.As for fit, I wear a sized 8 to 8 1/8 baseball cap and the size XXL fits me just fine.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.053237405", "1": "0.19073802", "2": "0.036211085", "3": "0.25211287", "4": "0.16562638", "5": "0.14479299", "6": "0.15728128"}}
