{"text": "I bought this watch in 1997 and in 2006 i gave it to a diver friend and he still have it, no battery change, no service, nothing,is still as accurate as ever. I hear that after 20 years the battery still retain more than 80 percent of the charge and they last 25 years, this is really the way to go. Forget about automatics,only collectors buy that or kinetics or whatever, Eco Drive are the best in diving watches or any watches, even Seiko is finally making solar models now, and by the way they are extremely accurate. Now i have another Citizen Eco Drive Promaster, whatever you choose they are all great.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16283093", "1": "0.0641903", "2": "0.16828083", "3": "0.22301657", "5": "0.11180572", "6": "0.26756606"}}
