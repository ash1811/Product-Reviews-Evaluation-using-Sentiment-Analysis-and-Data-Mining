{"text": "Thank you Amazon for carrying products in my size without gouging me on the price!  I'm 6'6&#34; and 280lbs.  Finding jeans locally is impossible unless I go to the big and tall store, which to be fair I AM big and tall.  The problem is that the prices at these stores go WAY up because they know the products are harder to find locally.These Wrangler jeans fit as expected and are very comfortable.  The black versions look good enough to wear in all but the most formal settings.  The jeans hold up very well and I can usually get a good year plus out of each pair before they need to be retired.  Overall very satisfied with the price and quality.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06642662", "1": "0.31282166", "3": "0.12995587", "4": "0.14460312", "5": "0.17804444", "6": "0.16578841"}}
