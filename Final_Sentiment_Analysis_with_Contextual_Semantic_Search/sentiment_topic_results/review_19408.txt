{"text": "I love this tshirt.  The fit is good.  My gripe is the fabric developed a hole (not near any seams) after just one wash before I even wore the shirt.  I'll darn the hole but while I like the Bella shirts (I have a few of them), the fabric quality seems to be consistently not up to my reasonable expectations.  Really, fabric shouldn't develop holes from just one wash.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.043185316", "1": "0.14180312", "2": "0.26316229", "3": "0.11796367", "5": "0.28556347", "6": "0.14442417"}}
