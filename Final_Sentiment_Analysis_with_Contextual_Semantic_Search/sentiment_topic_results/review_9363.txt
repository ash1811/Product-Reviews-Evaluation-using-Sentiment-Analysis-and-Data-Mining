{"text": "I've been wearing dockers for a lot of years.  I've grown accustomed to the fact that eventually they begin to fray at the edges and repeated washings will accelerate that process.  That's fine.  However, with this new batch of pants I've noticed that after the very first washing there is fading at the bottom of the pant legs and along the waistband.That is too fast.  I expect these pants to be able to stand up to many runs through the washer before the edges begin to fade.  I did give two stars because they truly don't wrinkle which is immensely helpful.  But I'm really disappointed how much of the color faded from the edges after just the first washing.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.26924136", "2": "0.18848957", "3": "0.23269342", "4": "0.11378562", "5": "0.12682961", "6": "0.066613816"}}
