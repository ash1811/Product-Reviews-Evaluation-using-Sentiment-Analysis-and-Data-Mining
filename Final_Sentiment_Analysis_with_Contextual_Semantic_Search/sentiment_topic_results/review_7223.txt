{"text": "When you find a well constructed product, you purchase again.  These t shirts are very well made and stand up to laundering while maintaining their shape.  The pocket doesn't sag and the heavy gauge keeps me warmer on cool mornings.  I have a pair of white ones and liked them so well I purchased a pair of black ones.  The t shirts are soft and the neck rib hasn't stretched out of shape or sagged.  Some t shirts get that threadbare underwear look after a few washes and it is. Disappointment.  These perform much better.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3519735", "2": "0.04226122", "3": "0.10862719", "4": "0.20467189", "5": "0.14089257", "6": "0.14863409"}}
