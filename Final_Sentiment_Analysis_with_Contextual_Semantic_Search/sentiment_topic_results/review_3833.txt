{"text": "Before the naysayers try to come after me for being a marketing rep or getting kick backs (I wish) let me first say I AM NOT.I've used every type of wallet (nylon, leather, nu-buck, aluminum, plastic, etc.) and every configuration you can think of; and not just US versions. I was looking for a wallet that would be slim and not bulky but still allow more than 3 or 4 cards and a couple bills.This wallet will allow for 6 cards (if you double fit them), license and insurance cards as well as plenty of space for a few bills. Even adding a few business cards it's still slimmer than any other wallet out there.I've bought both the mahogany and the black versions so I can use the color to match what I'm wearing. They tend to last many years. I purchased one from Amazon in 2006 and only purchased the black and brown replacements last year (2010) from a cheaper site. That's not bad since I have used them every day and am putting more than the 3 or 4 recommended cards.Check you vendors and prices but you won't be disappointed.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07575697", "1": "0.30431768", "2": "0.3214624", "3": "0.050801374", "4": "0.059658837", "5": "0.07026723", "6": "0.11773548"}}
