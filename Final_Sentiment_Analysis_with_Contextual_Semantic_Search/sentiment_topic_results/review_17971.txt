{"text": "Just arrived, here are some quick thoughts. Most of this is off top of my head as I set it up.  Might be a bit random.  More later when I get to know this thing.  The watch's face is far too shiny, can't see anything if there is overhead fluorescent lighting.  Amazing.  I've used several generations of these Casios and know the UI pretty well.  It is improving but still a pain in the ass to setup.  The hand setting is still pathetic, takes forever to go ahead on the analog side by 11 hours and god forbid if you miss.  Oh did I mention there are no analog numbers on the face (1,2,3...). Unbelievable.  We have 5, 10, 15, why ? Is this because people can't read the time any more and they need the numbers ? The big display is the digital time, I somehow thought it would be the date which is why I bought this cause the other casios hide the date in small unreadable displays.  Looks like the watch design is so tied to the band that replacing the band is going to be impossible.Initial rating is 3 stars, I'm using it reluctantly while thoroughly disappointed.Update on 2013-05-25I return here while shopping for a new watch.  I have used this for over 1.5 years.  I finally have given up.  It is hard to read, the face is unreadable as it reflects light in any indoor setting. The lighting is OK at night, worthless in the. The feature to turn on the light when you move your wrist works occasionally.  Worthless.  The face scratches far easier than any watch I have ever used. The date is obscured by the minute had every hour when I look for the date when taking notes.  The functionaly for timing all over the world is a mess and gets in the way of doing anything else with the digital portion of this watch.I give up, I'm moving on.  Downgrading to 2 stars.  Can't believe I used this for so long.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08727246", "1": "0.16270559", "2": "0.17963767", "3": "0.22868071", "4": "0.15041183", "6": "0.18908973"}}
