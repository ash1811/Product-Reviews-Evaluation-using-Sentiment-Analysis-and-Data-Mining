{"text": "There is no doubt that Citizen has really made some very clever watches with the driven Eco-Drive brand. They have been definitely worth their money. But yet, there are some that are worth it, but can also be better. That is the case with this canvas strap Eco-Drive watch. It looks elequent from the face and easy to setup. Yet, the problem isn't with the watch, it is with the wear of the strap. It can easily tear with time, and it would have to be replaced. Yet, there are some watches that work better than others that Citizen have made, and this is one of them. If you are looking for a sporty Eco-drive, than this would be one worth trying.Price: BConvience & Setup: C+Overall: B-", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06662839", "1": "0.0804317", "2": "0.30026633", "3": "0.34651053", "4": "0.07735444", "5": "0.08696743", "6": "0.04184121"}}
