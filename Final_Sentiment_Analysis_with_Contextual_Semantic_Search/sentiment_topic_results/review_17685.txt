{"text": "I love it!I love it for several reasons, but the main reason is that it's very light but still metallic. I hate heavy watches, but this one is light as a feather. And I love metal straps because they are quick to put on. And then I love it because it has both a digital and an analog face and has the great range of usual functions of a digital watch.To me Casio embodies inexpensive and reliable watches. If you lose it, it's not gonna kill you. In fact I have several Casio watches all over the house so I never to look for one when rushing out the door. In fact, they are so reliable that my $20 Casio watch from 15 years ago is still working.The only negative I have about this watch is that it's hard to change the time. In fact it's so counter-intuitive (press A five times???) that I've had to open the instruction manual in order to change it, and with DST this year coming at a different date, I've had to manually change it, and it's no fun, especially the analog hands which you don't have a knob to wind, but have to advance it digitally.But overall, my verdict is that Casio is reliable and cheap, and there are hundreds of styles to choose from.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0789521", "1": "0.080983154", "2": "0.16498467", "3": "0.17842971", "4": "0.18629359", "5": "0.11293958", "6": "0.19741723"}}
