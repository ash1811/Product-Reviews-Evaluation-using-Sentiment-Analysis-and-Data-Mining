{"text": "We wanted to take our child's car seat with us and were not allowed to use it on the plane. This backpack worked well. The only scratches on it were from when a friend thought it had wheels (I had read the wheels were not sturdy). We were also able to shuffle a few items into the bag to keep our weight limits in our luggage (shhh) so that our child could travel in comfort with a few favorite things. I was pleased with the product and would use it again. We fit our Britax Marathon into this cover.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.059808", "1": "0.08743188", "2": "0.15900089", "3": "0.21899855", "4": "0.14877658", "5": "0.22545215", "6": "0.10053195"}}
