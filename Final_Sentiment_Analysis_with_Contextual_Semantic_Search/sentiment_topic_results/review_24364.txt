{"text": "The most comfortable, snug, warm winter hat I'll ever need, and it all comes in the form of Carhartt's acrylic hat. The instant I put it on, my head felt completely safe from any elements that mother nature could throw at me-- and considering I'd just shaved my head days before, that's saying something.Unfortunately the fine people at Carhartt decided to put their ugly, goofy logo RIGHT in the middle of the hat, making you look like a billboard for the company as much as a satisfied customer. Still, a small price to pay for comfort and warmth during these winter months. Literally a small price to pay, as this was one of the cheapest choices on Amazon and I STILL love the quality and feel.In conclusion, I can already tell this snug, well crafted, cozy, form fitting hat will serve my cranial needs for many days.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.109804615", "1": "0.40152562", "2": "0.09113789", "3": "0.15870257", "4": "0.124597766", "6": "0.11221042"}}
