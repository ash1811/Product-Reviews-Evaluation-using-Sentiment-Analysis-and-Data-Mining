They are very grippy, fairly easy to put on and take off, and don't break like most stretchy versions of cleats.  I walk every day in Maine winter snow and ice and these are a far better choice than Yaktrax.  STABILicers Lite are are good second choice.These are a good choice if you have to take your grippers off and put them back on regularly, rather than just leave them on a particular pair of boots.  The nuts on the bottom also seem grippier on ice than teeth-type cleats.  One thing I'm not crazy about with these is that they attach to your boots with nylon straps and if they're not positioned just right, the cleats can slide off to the side of your boots.  It can be a little difficult to fit the straps just right, too, because they're a bit stiff.All in all, though I do like these, I don't consider them the Holy Grail of cleats.  I'm still looking for that.  Kahtoola Micro-Spikes will be my next experiment.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07990172", "1": "0.3964932", "2": "0.11741091", "3": "0.07063919", "4": "0.067149475", "5": "0.21995008", "6": "0.048455406"}}
