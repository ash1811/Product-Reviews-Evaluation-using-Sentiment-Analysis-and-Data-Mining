{"text": "First off, I thought it was a pretty bra and fits nicely. It's lace so I didn't think it'd feel like silk but the fabric is a bit rough (for a bra) and I was concerned that it might be too abrasive against the girls.  So far it's fine but I'm not out jogging in it. I wear it for full days and no issues.  I'm a fan of the Olga line overall but this isn't my favorite just because of the fabric that's against the breast.  They could have lined it with a smoother fabric.  Otherwise, it's a nice bra that will last about a year (fairly average for a bra in this price range).", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14433132", "1": "0.17213085", "2": "0.07676402", "3": "0.22881842", "5": "0.25562504", "6": "0.11972774"}}
