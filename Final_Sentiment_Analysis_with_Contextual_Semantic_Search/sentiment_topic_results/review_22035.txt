{"text": "This jacket arrrived fast and in perfect condition. It's not a very thick jacket but made of good quality. Perfect with layering a long sleeve and hoodie on underneath. Love that I could find it in a tall size!! Would say it's perfect for cold temps just not snowboarding or anything like that :) Great work coat as you can actually move around in this one compared to the normally bulky carhartt jackets.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03409802", "1": "0.39596903", "2": "0.23327051", "3": "0.11676246", "5": "0.103823595", "6": "0.11266401"}}
