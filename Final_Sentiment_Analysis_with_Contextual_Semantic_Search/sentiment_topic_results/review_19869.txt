{"text": "I bought this jewelry box for my 3 year old daughter who is amassing a large collection of play jewelry. As of now I have it all in a random box just to keep it all together. Having had one of these jewelry boxes as a little girl, I thought my daughter should have one too. I know she will love it because it's silvery outside with pink inside and it's cute and girly and has fairies all over it. She will also get a kick out of the music and twirling dancer. The jewelry box is sturdy and very cute. I got it very securely packaged and it is in perfect condition, ready for me to wrap for Christmas. Very happy with my purchase - it was a good price too! Thank you!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15790074", "1": "0.4016956", "2": "0.17527598", "3": "0.07468459", "4": "0.08628622", "6": "0.10149999"}}
