{"text": "This is the perfect bandana  ( I bought the green cammo woodland just like the ones from US ARMY basic training as they are worn out after washes )  The price is perfect EXCEPT for the shipping which was MORE than the item if you buy just one to begin with.  These also make great craft items and costume embellishments or a cleaver hair-do tie. I will buy from this place again. 100% cotton so they will fade and shrink as usual with wear. 5 stars.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.110027365", "1": "0.4522377", "2": "0.111975126", "3": "0.12731892", "4": "0.0816917", "6": "0.11356707"}}
