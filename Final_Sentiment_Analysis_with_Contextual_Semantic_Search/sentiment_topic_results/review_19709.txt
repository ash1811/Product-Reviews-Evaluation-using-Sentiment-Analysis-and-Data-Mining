{"text": "I've had this watch for 6 years - it's my every day, every situation watch.  I am *mean* to watches - hairspray, sunscreen, bug spray, gardening, sports, swimming, sweating.  I use the timer/stopwatch.  I use the alarm.  So, my darling husband wanted to get me a \"nice looking\" watch for mother's day -- I requested (and received) another one of these!  I'll try to keep it nicer.This is a great watch.  Wear it, abuse it, forget it's on.It's not itchy and it doesn't pull your arm hairs. It's easy to set and use.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.028273582", "1": "0.21013057", "2": "0.2909036", "3": "0.21291058", "4": "0.12070845", "6": "0.13463902"}}
