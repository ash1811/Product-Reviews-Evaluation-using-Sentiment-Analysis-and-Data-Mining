{"text": "Until now I have not gone with Under Armour due to sizing (the products are designed for those under 6 feet tall).  After receiving two of these, I can tell you that the sizing issue has not been resolved.  I also ordered Long Sleeve cold gear from another site that came today and those are perfect.  Not sure why under armour does not make longer versions of their heat gear tops.  I would gladly pay a few extra dollars for the right fit.  These are going back.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.2862921", "2": "0.14590935", "3": "0.13572446", "4": "0.17600405", "5": "0.18114555", "6": "0.07180707"}}
