{"text": "Wow, I was reluctant to pay over $70 for these as I have two pairs of Keens but I wanted a new style of rugged, go anywhere, do anything, get wet, get muddy summer sandals and these are perfect! Cuter and more feminine than any Keen sandals (keen styles can be unisex) and more open looking. In addition, they hide my toes (I lost a toenail due to a horse incident) and protect them too. They can get wet and seem tough so far. I wear them all the time, they have been immersed in the ocean completely, have been in deep sand and hiked on rough trails. I will say that they are not as supportive as Keen but for general summer wear they rock. They fit well into my backpack too. These shoes run true to size and I'd say they are maybe on the more narrow side but not enough keep my sort of wide feet out of them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10568705", "1": "0.13851893", "2": "0.16586028", "3": "0.1374236", "4": "0.15614669", "5": "0.08573712", "6": "0.21062635"}}
