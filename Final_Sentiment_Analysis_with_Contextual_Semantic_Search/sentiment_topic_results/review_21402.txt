{"text": "This is a shoe for travel, I read other reviews and decided it was what I needed for a visit to Easter Island.Sand, water, rocks, hiking, slick rocks and such, heat, comfort.  Wow these are just great for everything and my feet are happy at the end of the day.  Remember to put suntan lotion you the tops of your feet as mine are now look like a checker board from the sun.  I took them on to Thailand and even in the city they were great.  You can't go wrong with these sandals.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.26742786", "1": "0.14122176", "2": "0.13188626", "3": "0.10277889", "4": "0.08220663", "6": "0.27135873"}}
