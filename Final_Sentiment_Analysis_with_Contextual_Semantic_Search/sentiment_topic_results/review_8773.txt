{"text": "Ok sock, does produce the most lint I've ever seen in a sock. Scared myself the first time I took them off. They do fit pretty good and are a very warm sock. Have probably washed them 20 times now and am just getting a little lint at this point. Will try another sock before buying these again but they are not terrible.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18982244", "1": "0.3418444", "2": "0.096493125", "3": "0.13406941", "4": "0.042671375", "5": "0.19061655"}}
