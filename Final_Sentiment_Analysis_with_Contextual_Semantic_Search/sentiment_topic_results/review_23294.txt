{"text": "The price was the only thing that was good about these earrings.The earrings arrived very quickly and nicely packaged, but the quality of the diamonds were very poor. They looked dark and gray and not much sparkle. The white gold looked like pewter, not even silver gray. The picture on the website made them look clearer and shinier, which these were not!I will return them immediately.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.3037748", "1": "0.37146184", "2": "0.046685755", "4": "0.09611013", "5": "0.04528729", "6": "0.13257408"}}
