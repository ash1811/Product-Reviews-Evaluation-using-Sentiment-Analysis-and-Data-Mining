{"text": "I don't what has gotten in to me lately, because I do not listen to country music, ride horses or go to rodeos..... but I have developed a real love for cowgirl boots.  Now that mine have arrived, I can add that the reviews for these boots are accurate.  The leather is not very shiny when the boots arrive.  I took some neutral polish to them and buffed them up into a very nice shine.  Now they look like red shiny lipstick.  Which is just what I wanted.  My Ariat boots are a bit more comfortable.  I cannot feel any cushioning in these boots like I can definitely feel in my Ariats, but that is not to say these boots are uncomfortable.  They feel fine. When I felt with my hands I could feel some cushioning in the instep. I went half a size up to a 9.5 and that worked out fine for me.  I did that because the shape of these boots in the toe is definitely not the shape of my foot.  Going half a size up resulted in a good fit.  The boots are a bit narrow in the instep, which surprised me.  I have narrow feet so that was no problem for me.  The insert that comes with the boot acknowledges that the instep might be a bit tight initially for some people.  They suggest  talcum powder or wiggling your toes (honestly!) if it is a snug fit.  The soles are very polished, which I guess some people might like.  Until the soles get roughed up a bit it seems like there will be less traction and it would be easier to slip.  I would prefer my cowgirl/Western boots to be made in the USA, and I would pay more for them if it cost more to produce them here.  They're cowgirl boots for gosh sakes!  These boots are made in China.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08086839", "1": "0.04035742", "2": "0.14847825", "3": "0.2418733", "4": "0.22525226", "5": "0.05056993", "6": "0.21260048"}}
