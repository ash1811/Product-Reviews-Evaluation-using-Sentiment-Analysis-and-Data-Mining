{"text": "I've never bled like I did with these shoes. I commute to work which consists of taking 2 trains to the city everyday. After about 15 minutes of walking I limped into the closest drug store to buy a box of band-aids to cover the cuts on both my feet. Never in my life have I ever experienced pain like that before with FLATS of all shoes. I immediately returned them that evening when I got home. Luckily I had an extra pair of shoes at work but the damage to my feet was done already. NEVER AGAIN will I buy her shoes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.060366627", "1": "0.2477977", "2": "0.20017727", "3": "0.18377066", "4": "0.13656123", "5": "0.05180209", "6": "0.119524464"}}
