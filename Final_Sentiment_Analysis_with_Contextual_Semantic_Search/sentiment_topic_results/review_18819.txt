{"text": "This is a very nice, rugged watch at a very affordable price for a \"Swiss Made\" watch. The Wenger model 72900 is a very well made watch for the person with a modest budget.The dial is white with large, green, luminous numerals and bars. This is certainly very easy to see for someone such as myself who now wears bifocals. The minute and hour hands are black with luminous inserts and contrast well with the white of the dial, making them very easy to see. The second hand is a very easy-to-see red color and ticks precisely, hitting the center of numbers or bars - always a good sign of quality manufacture. The face also includes small 24-hour numbers for those on military time. The case is a an attractive, glare-free brushed stainless steel. The stainless steel back is nicely polished and etched with the Wenger Swiss Army logo as well as it's \"Swiss Made\" and 100m water resistance designations.The band is a very soft, brown leather that I found comfortable from day one. There's no \"break in\" time for this band. It's very nicely stitched and has two \"keepers\". It fit me perfectly and still does. It even comes in a nice aluminum \"tin\" with registration and instruction manual.This watch is a no-frills, simple and - to my mind - attractive watch at a very modest price. I haven't found anything yet that I don't like about it and give it five stars!Edit: 8/4/2012 - The watch stopped working after owning it for about a week. I thought perhaps the crown had become snagged on something and pulled out a little bit, thus stopping the watch movement. I reset the time and pushed in the crown and it began working. Unfortunately, it has quit twice more. I am returning it to Amazon for an exchange. We'll see how the next one does.Edit: 9/4/2012 - Amazon stood behind the product it sells and exchanged the defective item for new one. The new watch has performed flawlessly since I got it about a month ago and have no qualms. It does pay to buy things from Amazon as opposed to their affiliate sellers because Amazon generally stands behind its products better and makes returns/exchanges very easy to get done quickly.Edit: 2/4/2013 - After six months, the replacement watch has served me flawlessly. It is quite accurate, gaining only 9 seconds per month - quite good for a quartz watch. It seems reasonably rugged and the band wears well. This is a nice, swiss-made watch for the money.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.061415866", "1": "0.12754415", "2": "0.21697167", "3": "0.21370186", "4": "0.13407747", "5": "0.1138185", "6": "0.13247052"}}
