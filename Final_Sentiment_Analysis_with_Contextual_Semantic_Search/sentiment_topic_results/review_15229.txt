{"text": "I have in my drawer a pair of Hanes Comfort Soft underwear I bought from a local big box store about 3 years ago.  They are soft, comfortable, and breathe fairly well.  Unfortunately, these new Hanes \"Comfort Soft\" [NOT!!} underwear may resemble the old ones in a picture, and both are called Comfort Soft, but in real life they are simply HORRID.  The material is so rough I feel I could use them to hand scrub heavily stained pots and pans.  The problem is they are using such a rough fabric, that it is extremely irritating to my skin.  In addition, this product does NOT breath at all.  I found myself waking up with so much sweat in all the wrong places, that I had to slip off my underwear in the middle of the night and fling them across the room.  In addition, because they use such crappy material for the body, the wrap around on the waistband is just about as rough as any waist band I have ever felt.  There was no point in even wrapping these waist bands.I will NEVER buy a Hanes product again!After having tried several brands that are being sold today, I have finally found underwear that IS good.  If you want soft, comfortable underwear that breathes properly, you want Stacy Adams underwear.  It is my #1 choice.  Eddie Bauer isn't too bad either, but if I could give Stacy Adams underwear a 10 star rating, I would give Eddie Bauer underwear probably a 7 or 8 star rating, depending on the particular item selected.  And, of course, Hanes underwear deserves a ZERO star rating, in my opinion.  (Fruit of the Loom = 1 Star, just in case somebody is wondering... Merona USED to sell underwear my size, but stopped.  The Merona underwear I have left would get about a 4 or 5 star rating.  I've checked out Merona underwear at Target, and it still feels like the stuff I bought when it was available.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07328423", "1": "0.37220567", "2": "0.07242228", "3": "0.19308454", "4": "0.0684377", "5": "0.10652497", "6": "0.11404061"}}
