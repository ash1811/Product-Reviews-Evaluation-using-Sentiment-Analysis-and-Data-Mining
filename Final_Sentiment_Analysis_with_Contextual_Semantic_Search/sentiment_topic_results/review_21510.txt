{"text": "Getting the size right can be tricky on this shoe. I did order it 2 sizes up as others recommended and it was perfect. The lacing system is terrific. My feet feel secure but not restricted. Works really well with my Zumba moves. I love the lightweight canvas. I had tried the leather ones, but they were much heavier (and more expensive). Glad I got these. A quality product.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.23209193", "1": "0.1968049", "2": "0.18180239", "3": "0.14512756", "5": "0.16939813", "6": "0.07109496"}}
