{"text": "I love my Keen's sandals but can't quite wear them in winter, so I ordered the Presidio shoe based on the reviews. They went back almost right away...they seriously hurt my feet! I wore them around the house for a little while but found them rubbing my left foot just below the ankle, and they had TOO MUCH support for the metatarsal area. Way too stiff with a very hard insole. My feet were aching badly. It felt like I'd been wearing those Dr. School's wooden clog/sandals we all used to wear in the 1970s!!I swapped out the insole with a gel insole to get some cushioning, and that didn't help. Then I ordered the PowerStep inserts that I have used in less supportive sneakers, and they did not work at all. Four different insoles and my feet ached every time.If you don't have problem feet, these may be fine for you, but if you need firm but gentle support, I wouldn't recommend them. My Clark's mules and clogs are considerably more comfortable and supportive.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08764305", "1": "0.19819522", "2": "0.12745808", "4": "0.2383299", "5": "0.0653346", "6": "0.28072467"}}
