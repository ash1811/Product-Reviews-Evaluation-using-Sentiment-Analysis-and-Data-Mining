{"text": "These are very comfortable socks. They should be good for all seasons. The material is well made, and I don't think they will start to rip, tear, or get holes in them anytime soon. They extend reasonably high on the leg...so If you don't like that than these are not for you. Will be purchasing again if I need some more socks.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1848046", "1": "0.2907188", "2": "0.058537945", "4": "0.10727539", "5": "0.14246616", "6": "0.21045421"}}
