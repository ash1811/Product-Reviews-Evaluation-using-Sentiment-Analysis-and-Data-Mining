{"text": "I bought these flip flops because they looked nice.  Only after I ordered them did I realize there were bottle openers built into the soles.  How cool is that?!?!  When they arrived, I had to put them on and pop open a beer.  It worked like a champ!  I haven't worn flip flops in a very long time, so my between-the-toes weren't used to the leather strap.  I'm hoping the leather softens up and my tween-the-toes toughen up so the discomfort goes away.  The soles are very comforatble.  I would definately recommend these nice looking beer popping flippety flops.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.020193873", "1": "0.36455816", "2": "0.21473306", "3": "0.111636095", "4": "0.051885385", "5": "0.16796023", "6": "0.069033176"}}
