{"text": "My mom likes Playtex 18-Hour and she was always looking for Underscore on JCPenney and when it doesn't say Underscore specifically, she wants nothing to do with it. Well, I got this in black and in white for her on Amazon and she fought me every step of the way saying it's not the same. I kept telling her the picture looks exactly how she likes it with the soft foam comfort strap. Some bras now are being made without the foam that fills the straps. When these came in the mail and she saw them, she was very pleased and I proved her wrong lol. I've purchased, movies, makeup,cds, pjs and a swim suit for my daughter who's 3 now, etc. The prices can't be beat and is by far one of my favorite places to online shop.
