{"text": "I'm on my second pair; these are my &#34;default&#34; shoes for anything other than sports and dance.--Correctly sized according to those metal things at the shoe stores. There is a tendency for shoe manufacturers to go up a size because people always return shoes too small but rarely shoes too large. Correctly sized, these shoes will allow very little room in the front which is what you want.--Comfortable for long walks with very little break in required.--Real leather!--Comfortable and grippy soles.Now the bad: these shoes wear quickly and because of the hollow heel can be hard to resole. On the other hand, $35 for a new sole versus $50 for a new shoe...My previous shoes lasted about 3 months before wearing through under the ball of the foot. However, I'm hard on shoes as I walk to work every day and I have a standing desk.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05802241", "1": "0.23664834", "2": "0.2589683", "3": "0.2160674", "4": "0.05951825", "5": "0.124051094", "6": "0.046724185"}}
