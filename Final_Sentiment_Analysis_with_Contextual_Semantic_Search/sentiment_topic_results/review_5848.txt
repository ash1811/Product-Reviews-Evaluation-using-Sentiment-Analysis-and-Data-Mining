{"text": "ORDER ONE SIZE UP.I am very small and petite: 110 lbs, 5'1\". I usually wear a size 2 womens, or XS (or a size 3 juniors). I ordered a \"small\" in this item thinking it might be too big because a small in ladies is still usually too big for me (I usually have to order XS). Well, not this item. It was just right fit even though I ordered one size up from my norm. So I hope it doesn't shrink.HERE'S MY CONCLUSION:If you are very tiny like me (size 0-2), I would order a small.If you are small (size 4-6), I would order a medium.Just a suggestion from extrapolation from my own personal experience with my size only.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2546203", "1": "0.2594308", "2": "0.13400513", "3": "0.16286391", "4": "0.046724122", "5": "0.031668395", "6": "0.11068731"}}
