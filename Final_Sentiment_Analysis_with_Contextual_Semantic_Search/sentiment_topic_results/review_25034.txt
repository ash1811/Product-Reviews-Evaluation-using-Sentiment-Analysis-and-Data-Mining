{"text": "I like my Keen sandals, I really do. They have travelled through Asia, Central America and many other places with me. However they really are the 4X4 with Swampers of the sandal world. The covered toe is a great part of their design, but it's also plain UGLY.So when I saw a picture of the coconut sandals it was love at first sight. Yes, they have a covered toe, but these really have a much more feminine look to them. Much more Saturday afternoon cafe after a walk through the local park than full jungle slog like the Keens.Buying shoes sight unseen for me is a huge risk due to the shipping costs to New Zealand. However I am really happy to say that my gamble has paid off. I have feet that are wide at the front, but narrow ankles. I'm also borderline between a 7.5 and an 8. In this case I went with the 7.5 and it's great fit lengthwise, but certainly it's taken a day for them to wear in a little to give my little toes a bit of comfort. But being leather I'm really happy about them wearing in, and they are already very comfortable.I'm looking forward to getting a lot of use out of these sandals!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07533491", "1": "0.2965829", "2": "0.15924887", "3": "0.08554084", "4": "0.07669054", "5": "0.19876066", "6": "0.10784124"}}
