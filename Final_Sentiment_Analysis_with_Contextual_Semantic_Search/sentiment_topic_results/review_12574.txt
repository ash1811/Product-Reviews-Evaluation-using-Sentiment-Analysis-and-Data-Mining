{"text": "First of all I would like to say that if you want the most comfortable shoe, get Clarks. I have always wore Merrells for over seven years and Clarks beats them in quality and comfortably. These are amazing shoes and my feet are no longer tired at the end of the day. The next day I loved these shoes so much I purchased two other styles.I have to be on my feet about 5-7 hours a day as I am an Admin at a huge public school with concrete tile floors. This causes feet problems so I have to find the prefect shoe. I have worn all the big name brand shoes such as Clark's, Rock-port, Merrill's, ECCO, Sketchers, Timberland, Johnson and Murphy....... For the money and more importantly for the comfort, I love my Clarks Men's Escalade Slip-On, Brown, size 10M. The Clark's are as good as or better than my personal favorite comfort shoe, Merrill's or ECCO Men's Helsinki Slip-On.I have just received my second pair of Clarks Men's Escalade Slip-On, size 10M and are these \"True to Size\"???  YES!!!  I have read several reviews on most men's Clark's, and reviewers indicate otherwise. They say to order a size down or at least a half size down. I type the word \"size\" in the reviewer key word search box and overwhelmingly reviewers have said to order a size down because the shoes run large to size listed. Clarks Men's Escalade Slip-On.I must go against several helpful reviews that indicate they run large and order a size down. If a size 10M fits you in any brand of shoe, then order a pair of Clark's in size 10M. I highly recommend this shoe for quality, comfort and style.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.26835746", "2": "0.28470692", "3": "0.05395844", "4": "0.16359945", "5": "0.12009494", "6": "0.106964394"}}
