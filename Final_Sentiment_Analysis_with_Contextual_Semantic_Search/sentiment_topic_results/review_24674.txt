{"text": "The most amazing flip flop a guy will ever wear. I wear a size 12 in other flips, but got a size 13 in these. Right out of the box they felt awesome - a few days of wearing and they were AMAZINGLY AWESOME!  They are so darn comfortable it is unbelievable. Plus the styling goes so well with both shorts, or in the cooler weather a pair of jeans.Don't waste money on more expensive flip flops when these guys go the distance. Remember guys, order one size up for best fit.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06701295", "1": "0.36879802", "2": "0.10519269", "3": "0.09549578", "4": "0.14109698", "5": "0.10558443", "6": "0.11681917"}}
