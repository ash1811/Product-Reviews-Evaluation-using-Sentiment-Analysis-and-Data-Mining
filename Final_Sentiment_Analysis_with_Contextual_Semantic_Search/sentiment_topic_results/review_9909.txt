{"text": "I bought this watch as a watch to wear when I'm not wearing my more expensive gold plated watch.  I figured that I could get robbed wearing the gold watch since it's hard to tell if it's real gold or not.  This watch would be excellent for an urban environment or taking an overseas vacation in case you are robbed and they take your watch you aren't losing any significant amount of money.  You wear a Rolex and you'll be sorry.  I plan to go to Thailand and Brazil wearing this watch.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.082901284", "1": "0.162431", "2": "0.34724346", "3": "0.12035501", "4": "0.07079763", "5": "0.21332252"}}
