{"text": "I was wary of buying boots online but am happy to say that these boots fit true to size. They are a bit loose in the ankle as stated in other reviews but after a couple of days getting broken in they seems to fit better. These are comfy, well made boots and I am happy with my purchase (they look great with both jeans and skirts)!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.062421855", "1": "0.39740694", "4": "0.2392589", "5": "0.19058773", "6": "0.10188545"}}
