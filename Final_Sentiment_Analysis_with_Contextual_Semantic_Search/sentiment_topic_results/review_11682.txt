{"text": "There is nothing bad to say about this product.It is beautifully designed, constructed to the highest standards and when you call the manufacturer with a question, you're likely to get one of the people who designed it.Unfortunately, because of a balance problem, the STABILicers don't work for me and I have to go back to Yak-Trax. I'll explain more below.The product is, in my estimation, a masterpiece of engineering and manufacturing.Seventeen cleats (studs) are ranged around the sandal-like device. They are steel and replaceable with a screwdriver or small coin. There is also a traction pattern molded into the underside of sandal to further strengthen your foot's grip in snow or on ice. The upper platform has a traction pattern as well to keep your shoe from slipping around. Sturdy Velcro equipped straps hold the sandal on the toe of your shoe and around the back of your foot and ankle. The construction is absolutely top-notch. Getting these on and adjusted is easy.In terms of traction, from my short experience, I'd call them nothing less than amazing. The manufacturer warns against using them rock climbing, as well as driving, climbing ladders and indoors.But some kind of balance problem precludes me from using them. The cleats are set in from the edges by about one-half an inch and including their base are about a half-inch high. As a result, my right foot is prone to bending at the ankle which could result in a nasty fall for me.I don't consider this a problem or fault with the STABILicers. In fact, the engineering of putting them in about a half-inch means that the cleats won't be ripping out the edge of the sandals.I really wish I could use these because they are the best slip-on  foot traction device I've ever seen.Jerry", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.06417378", "2": "0.120495595", "3": "0.22355574", "4": "0.11744388", "5": "0.30585295", "6": "0.1661247"}}
