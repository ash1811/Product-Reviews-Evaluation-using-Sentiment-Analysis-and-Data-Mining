{"text": "I wish I could have worn this bra!  It looks so comfortable.  My normal size is 42D, so I ordered the 42D/DD.  It was WAY too small.  I could barely get it on.  I gave it to my daughter who wears a 36C, and it fit her fine.We larger women are already uncomfortable enough.  I wish Spanx would make this bra in true plus sizes.  I know we probably need more support, but I'd love something comfortable just to wear around the house.  What appealed to me about this bra was that it has no hooks in the back, because those always itch.  Oh, well.  If I ever lose weight, I'll try the bra again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04722248", "1": "0.33348295", "2": "0.118491024", "3": "0.32737386", "4": "0.048096083", "5": "0.04934746", "6": "0.07598614"}}
