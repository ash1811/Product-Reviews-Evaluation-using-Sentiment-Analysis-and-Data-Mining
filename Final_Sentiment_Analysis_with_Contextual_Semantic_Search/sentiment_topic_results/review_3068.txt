{"text": "I HATE underwires... I mean, I really hate underwires.  They don't last very long for me at all, usually less than a month. The first time I ordered this bra, I was skeptical, because it's really hard to give a DDD size lift... then if there's lift, after a month of normal wear and washing, the straps are stretched out and slipping off the shoulders, which is probably the only thing I hate more than an underwire bra.  This bra gives me the lift I need, without underwires poking me, AND the straps stay where they are supposed to and does not dig in to my shoulders, or twist and turn and feel like it's cutting me.I'm a teacher, so I'm up and down and moving around all day long,this bra keeps everything where it's supposed to be, and it's comfortable enough to put on at 6 in the morning, and go all day, through after school commitments, and Friday night football games... some days I'm in it for way more than 18 hours, and it IS that comfortable.After about a year there is noticeable sag, but, the straps still stay up, and at this price, I don't mind replacing them.Amazon has by FAR the best price available on these bras.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16344333", "1": "0.30893067", "2": "0.08016196", "3": "0.12307955", "4": "0.03827624", "5": "0.17575757", "6": "0.11035069"}}
