{"text": "The shirt is great! For the price you can't ask for more! For me though I found it a bit too short. If I move too much a little stomach will show :( I ordered XL and I really don't think it's XL...seems a bit small. I ordered the same shirt from another brand and it's twice the size as this one. I haven't dried it in the dryer so I don't know if it'll shrink... I'm not going to try :)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.05073574", "1": "0.37587452", "2": "0.08570839", "3": "0.33714923", "4": "0.059862778", "5": "0.046744753", "6": "0.043924592"}}
