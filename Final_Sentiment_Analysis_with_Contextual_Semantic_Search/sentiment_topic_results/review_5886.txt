{"text": "I was sent the wrong size, a large instead of a medium. I requested to return the item to trademark via Amazon.com. Amazon sent the return request to trademark. Instead of receiving return authorization, I was sent a request to give them a five star rating! There was a link to review this item so I am.If this matter is resolved shortly, I will change my rating. It seems like a very good product!  I've been using a pair of rubber boots from L.L. Bean. I can't put my shoes inside, it's made for just feet.  They were on sale for the same price.  The tingly's would be better for hiking or very long walks, I think.Update:  Return/exchange process very difficult!  If I didn't already have a pair of rubber boots, I would be mightily disappointed! Because of continued difficulty, I won't exchange them, even though, I would've really liked to have had these boots.Update again:  Amazon quickly remedied the situation by refunding my money.
