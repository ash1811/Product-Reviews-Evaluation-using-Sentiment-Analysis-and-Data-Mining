{"text": "This jeans came as ordered and were exactly what I thought they were suppose to be.  The only problem that I saw with these jeans is after wearing them for the day, the material \"strechted\" out and were a LOT bigger than when I put them on that morning.  I would probably not purchase these pants again.  I live an active life and do not need or desire to have pants that end up something that I am pulling up to keep on at the end of the day.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19188932", "1": "0.4155673", "4": "0.081092805", "5": "0.13972218", "6": "0.16376632"}}
