{"text": "I really love Keen sandals.  No problems wearing them straight out of the box.  I have four pair now but I prefer the 'Whisper' model to these because the Newports are a little bulkier looking.  Not really a problem, though. Depending on the shoe make, I wear either an 8 or 8 1/2, but Keens seem to run a little small.  I ordered size 9, the only size 9 shoes I have, but they fit great.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.041756783", "1": "0.36958647", "2": "0.13780996", "3": "0.27094278", "6": "0.1732406"}}
