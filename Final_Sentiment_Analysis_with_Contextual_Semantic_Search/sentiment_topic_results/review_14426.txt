{"text": "My old Rockport black walking shoes finally wore out, so I replaced them with a pair of M7100s.  I ordered the same size as the old ones and found the new ones fits just the same.The quality of the shoe construction seems good.  The shoes were a little &#34;stiff&#34; when I first wore them but after a day of office work they seemed to already be &#34;breaking in&#34;.Rockport has always been a good brand to me and I'll continue to wear them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.12813464", "2": "0.1344905", "3": "0.27352387", "4": "0.1481685", "5": "0.1992694", "6": "0.113231406"}}
