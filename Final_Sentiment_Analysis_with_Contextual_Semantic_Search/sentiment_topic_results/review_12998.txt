{"text": "From fall to spring, I pretty much live in boots.  By the time warm weather is upon us, my boots are pretty ratty looking.  I've tried every kind of cream and polish and finally tried the Lincoln.  It is far and away the best polish of all.  My Danner's were covered in salt and chemicals.  I cleaned them up and applied the Lincoln Stain wax and after two applications, they shine like new.  Nothing will bring your shoes or boots back to life like Lincoln.  Now a word of caution.  If your footwear has white stitching, this will discolor it.  If this is not acceptable to you, get the neutral.  If you do not mind darkened stitching, Use this.  Two more words of advice.  First, use good quality tools, get a good dauber, a good brush and a good buffing cloth.  It will make the job much easier and you will get better results.  Second,  it can help if you warm your boots up, either by placing them in the Sun or by using a hair dryer.  The pores of the leather will open up and you can really work it into the leather.  If you don't happen to have one handy, no problem, but it does help.All I use for all my footwear is lincoln now", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10222629", "1": "0.2254651", "2": "0.1810503", "3": "0.053967804", "4": "0.063896514", "5": "0.24076238", "6": "0.13263157"}}
