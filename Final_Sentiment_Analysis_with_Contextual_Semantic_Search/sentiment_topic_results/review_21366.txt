{"text": "Im 32 weeks pregnant (8 months) and i had bad cramping from my round ligiment pain for the past 3 weeks. It turns out my son is VERY VERY VERY low lying which was causing TONS of stress on my ligiments which in turn causes painful cramping. I asked my midwife is there anything natural i could do instead of taking medicean for the pain and she reccomanded me getting a belly band or support band to take the stress off my ligiments.I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg on something that i would only use for about 2 months so i went on Amazon.com. Here i found an EXCELLENT belly band that came more options then XS-M which i had been running into. It even came at a great price.After i got it within 3 business days (it was delivered on a saturday, ordered on a thursday) i popped it on and my cramping VANISHED in 10 minutes. I FELT AMAZING. It's VERY VERY comfortable, i always forget its on, VERY true to size, the large i got was a tad big which was great just in case i had to grow a little more, and machine washable. It has clamps like a bra and you can put it on with a left or right hand. It doesn't sweat or put any strain on your stomach and it DOES support your back. My back pain vanished as well.I spent a day out with it on. No one noticed it was under my dress, and no one could feel it when they rubbed my stomach. I didn't have to stop because of cramping and it was so comfortable. I even slept in it that night which relieved pressure on my sore sides.I recommand this to ANYONE with back, side, lower stomach or ligiment pains. THIS IS NOT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.22810082", "1": "0.16467129", "2": "0.19274026", "3": "0.34038275", "5": "0.047687594", "6": "0.024095587"}}
