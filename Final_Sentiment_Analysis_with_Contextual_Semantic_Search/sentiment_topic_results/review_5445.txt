{"text": "This Hanes hoodie is a quality item.  It was a comfortable fit and moderately heavy item.  The dark chocolate color goes well with brown, or tan, jackets, or by itself.  The drawstrings secure the hood nicely around the head.  I really like it and it was fairly priced. http://www.amazon.com/Hanes-COMFORTBLEND-Fleece-Pullover-Chocolate.  I usually buy a size larger, in case I want to \"layer\" over other clothes (especially for cold weather, e.g., a thermal shirt and an outside  shirt).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.38391456", "2": "0.12198085", "3": "0.17126346", "4": "0.10234166", "6": "0.21426325"}}
