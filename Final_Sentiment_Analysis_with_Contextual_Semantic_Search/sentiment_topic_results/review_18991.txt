{"text": "I ordered this watch because I had the same model watch for a couple of years and loved it.  Then tragedy struck -- I dropped it on a tile floor and broke it.The watch his sturdy and attractive.  The numbers are easy to read and the hands are very clear and glow in the dark.  The Indiglo feature is a big part of what makes this watch great because you only need to push the button to see the time at night.The only thing I found disappointing was that the other watch had the date also and this one does not.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09497828", "1": "0.13283502", "2": "0.25660583", "3": "0.12409869", "4": "0.21221258", "6": "0.17621647"}}
