{"text": "This shoe is prettier in person.  That little hint of orange-red across the top is a nice accent next to the rich brown.  I love that it comes in wide, but trust me the W is not too wide as I believe another review pointed out.  I'm probably more of a C- and it will require some break-in wear( why only 4 stars) but I feel sure it will be fine.  I think it's a nice workplace shoe, but would look cute with jeans too.  The heel height and shape are comfort oriented.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12281748", "1": "0.23252547", "2": "0.2890803", "3": "0.2623469", "4": "0.03392678", "6": "0.056433093"}}
