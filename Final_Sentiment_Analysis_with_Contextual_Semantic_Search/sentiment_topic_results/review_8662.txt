{"text": "This will be replacing another casio wristwatch, which is still working but somewhat scratched. I have good experience with casio wrist watches. I was able to adjust the time and store a few data which is all I wanted to do. Only 25 data capacity. The instruction booklet letters like the watch keyboard if you will, are tiny, one almost needs a magnifying glass to read them. Other features which is new to me is the auto light. When you tilt the watch in your wrist from the horizontal position the back light lits up automatically. Overall a good everyday watch. Reasonably priced.This is an update. When I use the data function I used the tip of a pencil to use the keyboard because the numbers were tiny. I found out that the tip of my finger works just as well. I replaced the plastic strap with the stainless steel snap on strap from my old casio watch. It looks much better and putting it on is a snap.This is an update. I set multiple alarms through the day and I now don't need the alarms and I wanted to turn the alarm off. I could not seem to find it in the manual, so I called customer service of Casio and they hang up on me before I could finish my question. next i googled the problem, there were helpful answers but not for this casio watch. but what learned from the customer forum was that this watch has a module no. 2888 written on the front of the small manual, google the no and I was surprised that one of the owners of this watch referred to the specific page in the manual where one could find the  instruction for turning the alarm on and off.  page E-34. Thank you fellow owner of the watch.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.029971713", "1": "0.19245897", "2": "0.18576357", "3": "0.081737734", "4": "0.29714134", "5": "0.115262955", "6": "0.09766367"}}
