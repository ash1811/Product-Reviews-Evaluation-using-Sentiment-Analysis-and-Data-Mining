{"text": "2 problems with this costume. 1.  The mess in one of the eye openings in the mask was not attached. Had to get the hot glue gun out and do some repairs. 2.  The sash that came with it is only 26&#34; long. Fortunately my grandson is slim but we didn't have much sash to work with. I think he will wear the costume without it. I guess for $11 you can't expect much.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.31701958", "1": "0.112288095", "2": "0.0475319", "4": "0.36330432", "5": "0.15230173"}}
