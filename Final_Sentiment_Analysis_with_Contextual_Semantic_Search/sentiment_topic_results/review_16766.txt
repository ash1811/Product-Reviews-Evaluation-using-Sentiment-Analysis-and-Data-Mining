{"text": "This watch looked good in the pictures, the dial is slim, and it is perfectly adequate, but the strap is short and looked cheap upon arrival. Not a bad watch, but not great. I ended up returning mine. I would recommend viewing this model in person before buying to make sure you like it. Thank god Amazon makes returns easy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24071859", "1": "0.12020624", "2": "0.18952492", "3": "0.14893259", "4": "0.08247247", "6": "0.21427861"}}
