{"text": "I use these in the winter months and have a regular pair (non Goretex) for the warmer months. These do keep your feet warm and are waterproof which is nice. The side zip is probably the best invention when it comes to boots, lace your boots up real good once and you're done, use the side zip the rest of the time. Overall it's a really high quality boot, they're a bit heavy but don't have that &#34;boot&#34; feel to them, I can run in these perfectly fine. The toe box looks really good when polished up. Bates makes great duty boots, highly recommend them and I'll come back for my next pair. My non Goretex Bates are 3-4 years old and still holding up great, they show wear and tear but for regular duty use they're excellent.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.2758083", "2": "0.106733404", "3": "0.2560887", "4": "0.20131375", "6": "0.15595761"}}
