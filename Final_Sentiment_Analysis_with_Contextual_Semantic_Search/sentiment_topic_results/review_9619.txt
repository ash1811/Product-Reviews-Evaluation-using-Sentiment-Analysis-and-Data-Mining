{"text": "I bought my first copy of this watch a year or so ago and the date function never worked right; it moved forward every *other* day instead of every day.

I'm still using it because it keeps accurate time and I like that it lights up, but having an incorrect date displayed can be a bit confusing.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.3300552", "1": "0.16202216", "2": "0.14940952", "3": "0.120341726", "4": "0.12364947", "6": "0.11126447"}}
