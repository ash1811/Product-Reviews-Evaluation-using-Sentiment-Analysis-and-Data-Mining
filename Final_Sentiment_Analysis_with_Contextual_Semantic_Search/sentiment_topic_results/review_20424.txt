{"text": "I've had this watch for several months now and I really like it. The second hand is nice for timing things, and it is very easy to read the time. It's also very simple so it doesn't compete with other jewelery. However, as other reviews stated, this watch is VERY small. My writs are almost exactly 6 inches around and I wear this watch on the third-largest size, so it definitely wouldn't go more than ~6.5 inches around your wrist. Other than that, it's very nice, delicate, and simple.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14460072", "1": "0.0893192", "2": "0.23709178", "3": "0.2133787", "4": "0.10165241", "5": "0.10049469", "6": "0.11346253"}}
