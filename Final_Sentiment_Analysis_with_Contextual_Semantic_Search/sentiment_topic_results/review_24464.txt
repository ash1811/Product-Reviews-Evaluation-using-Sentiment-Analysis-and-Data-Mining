{"text": "I bought this for my 11 year old, 90 pound 5 foot tall daughter in the extra small and it fits her well.  We both like it because the wider straps allow for a bra without being so wide that they restrict movement like cap sleeves.It washes well (I drip dry it) and was cheaper than locally.Bought again, now she is 13 and five foot four and 105 pounds.  Bought the medium, which fits fine, is perhaps just a tad big, but I would not go down a size.  The material is a little different than the first one, having a bit more stretch but she likes it even better.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11288572", "1": "0.33119944", "2": "0.12377378", "3": "0.119898535", "4": "0.14888649", "5": "0.0991434", "6": "0.064212605"}}
