{"text": "The Skagen Mens 233LTTN is the watch I have been looking for, for almost 6 months. Until it arrived two days ago, I still didn't know if the reviews were spot on, they were!. I had read all the reviews about how light, thin, and sharp  the watch was. I also read about the closing latch, which didn't mean to much to me for I have used this kind of latch before.When the watch arrived, it was exactly what I had been looking for, absolutely thrilled. The watch is as sharp and stylish as any I've seen, it's clean, sleek design, which fits neatly under your shirt, along with the beautiful blue dial is nothing less than stunning to say the least. For those of you who have been contemplating this watch, if you can still find one, get it asap. The closing latch is nothing to concern yourself with at all. It's something you get used to very quickly, and believe me it's well worth it. This was everything I had been looking for and then some, very pleased.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13179271", "1": "0.19695146", "2": "0.22701046", "3": "0.14016767", "4": "0.110760234", "6": "0.19104402"}}
