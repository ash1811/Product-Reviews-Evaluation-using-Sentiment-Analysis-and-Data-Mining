{"text": "I don't know where I would be without it. I'm a one-handbag gal. I use this all of the time. It holds everything and is extremely well organized, I know where my iPhone is, my dark glasses, my pepper spray, my drawing pencils, my medicines, and of course my wallet, also by Kipling. I wanted this handbag for the longest time. I can fit my Filofax in it, I can fit a drawing pad or journal, or overnight clothes and extra clothing for the next day. Maybe not all at once! My keys are always at hand. The grabby handles are how I get it out of the car, but I wear the over the head strap for carrying it around and just carry it off my hip. (I'm not hippy.) It could not be better looking or more practical. Love the black for me. I do wish I had bought red accessories, as the black ones are hard to find inside the purse. Do make a note of that!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.091373816", "1": "0.11703012", "2": "0.2515037", "3": "0.1775142", "4": "0.07892389", "5": "0.1296921", "6": "0.15396221"}}
