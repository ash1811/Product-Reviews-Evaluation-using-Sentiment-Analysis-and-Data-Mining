{"text": "This fits cards and money and keys... if you take them out of your wallet and don't have a bulky key ring. Great cross-body design and plenty of pockets for organizing your stuff (though again, it can't be very much stuff).The only complaint (other than maybe being a tiny bit bigger), is that when I wore it with a silk-like blouse, it destroyed the delicate fabric where the metal on the strap (the thing that allows you to adjust the length) was rubbing against it. This could happen with any cross-body bag though if you wear it with a delicate enough fabric.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03404938", "1": "0.29411536", "2": "0.18765655", "3": "0.07039451", "4": "0.18840216", "5": "0.13304172", "6": "0.09234034"}}
