{"text": "I am a collector of different watches with different price points. I own cartier, rolex, invicta, patek about 60 others. Skagen is an inexpensive brand that is done with good taste. It looks like it cost way more than it does. I like all sorts of watches heavy, thin, dress and sport. This one is just a cool watch with an air or elegance and good taste.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14781535", "2": "0.27964142", "3": "0.043856565", "4": "0.12870596", "5": "0.28472638", "6": "0.111473486"}}
