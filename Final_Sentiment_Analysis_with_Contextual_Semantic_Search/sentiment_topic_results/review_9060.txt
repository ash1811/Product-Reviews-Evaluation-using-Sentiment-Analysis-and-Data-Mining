{"text": "I followed reviewers advice and went with 8.5. I almost always wear 9 but in leather items, I wear 8.5 and that worked great for me. I got the cinnamon/tribal one for about $90. If you are the type of person who likes wearing socks and shoes with lots of support, you probably won't like these. I am the type that likes Burkenstocks, moccasins, always flat shoes with no socks, or just barefoot so these work well for me. They took a while to break in and I got some small blisters for the first few weeks but they feel great now. Very sturdy. I love them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17551915", "1": "0.1400565", "2": "0.19152442", "3": "0.0883415", "4": "0.08146129", "5": "0.14927061", "6": "0.17382653"}}
