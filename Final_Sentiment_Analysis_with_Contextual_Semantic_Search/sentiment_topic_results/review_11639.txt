{"text": "I ordered these sweat pants for my 12-year old daughter to wear for PE class on cool days. They are a very generic (unisex) fit and absolutely unflattering. I realize sweat pants are not generally a fashion statement, but these sagged at the backside unless the waistband was pulled up to her chest. These went straight back to Amazon & we will be ordering a few more pairs of the Soffe Football capris. Much cuter & better fit for girls!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19036064", "1": "0.23645906", "2": "0.13120909", "3": "0.23351234", "4": "0.14341952", "5": "0.061703168"}}
