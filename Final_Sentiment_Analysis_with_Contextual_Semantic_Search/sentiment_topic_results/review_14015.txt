{"text": "3 stars for having Eco-Drive! I feel like this is one of the few instances where the picture looks better than the real product. Although not very pricey in the first place, this watch has a cheaper look than any of my other Citizen/Seiko watches around this class. One nice point however, is that I like how small it is compared to my other diver watches. It goes against part of what makes a lot of diver watches divers, but it's nice to have  something a little smaller and lighter on your wrist in the ocean every now and then.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.079680316", "1": "0.23958735", "2": "0.2554295", "3": "0.19702797", "5": "0.07728483", "6": "0.14806934"}}
