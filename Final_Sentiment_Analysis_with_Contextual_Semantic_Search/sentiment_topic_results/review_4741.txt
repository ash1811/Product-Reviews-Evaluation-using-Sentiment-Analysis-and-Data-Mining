{"text": "I am 6'5&#34; tall and have long arms, so I have to order tall sizes in anything that has long sleeves or else the sleeves are way too short, So, I found this Carhartt shirt, and was glad to see it came in tall sizes.  Unfortunately, as is often the case, manufacturers don't seem to take into account that every tall person isn't a BIG person, so the best I could do was Large/Tall (the smallest size offered) when I really need a Medium/Tall.  Therefore, although this shirt does the job okay, it really is too big.  But anyway, it's close enough, so I'm keeping it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13383864", "1": "0.2620247", "2": "0.14787862", "3": "0.056074042", "4": "0.25584224", "6": "0.14191265"}}
