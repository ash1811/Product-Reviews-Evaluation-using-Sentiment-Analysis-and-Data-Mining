{"text": "I've been eyeing Frye boots for years, and finally bought a pair. I'm glad I did! The fit is great, they are comfortable and sturdy, and the leather is beautiful.I am normally a 6, the these were true to size. They were a bit difficult to pull on at first, but I'm glad I did not size up, as the sole was the correct length. It becomes easier to put them on over time. The only thing that I would note is that they are slightly narrow for me, but my feet are on the wider side. If I wear these all day, I get blisters and pressure on my pinkie toes, but it's otherwise not an issue.The support in these was a selling point for me. I have high arches and have two pairs of kid's Fryes, and they are not even comparable. They are flat and have thin soles, while these have a great footbed and sturdy heels.To sum it up, I would definitely recommend these boots. The quality is fantastic and I expect them to last for many years.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16844343", "1": "0.25450137", "2": "0.08892012", "3": "0.22763303", "5": "0.14855094", "6": "0.10937724"}}
