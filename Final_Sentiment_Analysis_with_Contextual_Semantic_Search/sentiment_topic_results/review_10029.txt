{"text": "Bought this because I've purchased the same model for the past approx. 20 years. It's a workhorse. It will survive a decent amount of manual labor but beware it -is- entirely plastic and not designed to last forever.Doesn't lose time. No excessive drain on battery from features like Indiglo, which it doesn't have.No date.Basic watch, comes recommended for anyone, man, woman, child.
