{"text": "I had my eye on this tote for quite a while before taking the plunge and buying it.  It arrived promptly yesterday and I am very pleased.  It's a little bigger than I thought, but that's ok.  I've been wanting a tote bag with top zip to take my stuff to work, as sometimes the little one I have can get a bit packed.  I love the rich dark red colour, which should hide any dirt.Sometimes I have stuff and it's literally spilling over my bag, and I really wanted the \"perfect\" bag to replace it.  What I like are the numerous inside pockets - there are quite a few pockets inside the outside flap, including 2 little pen holders and slots for credit cards, etc (I hardly think I will be using all those though).  There is also a zipped inside pocket, as well as a couple open pockets inside.  There is also a large pocket at the back on the outside with a Velcro snap, as well as 2 side pockets, which I guess can be used to hold umbrellas and/or bottles.This bag will also double nicely as a weekend bag, and I'm sure all these pockets will come in handy then.I have no hesitation in recommending, and I hope it lasts a very long time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17171377", "1": "0.28276324", "2": "0.22748615", "3": "0.19901407", "4": "0.07546818", "5": "0.041273944"}}
