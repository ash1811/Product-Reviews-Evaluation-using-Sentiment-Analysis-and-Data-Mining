{"text": "I am certain that I will get a lot of use out of this shirt. The blue and black shirt is just as it appears in the listing, bold and bright, while being tasteful. I am glad that I read the reviews before I ordered. I purchased an XL and after I washed it, it was an M. Order at least two sizes larger than you wear. Also my shirt arrived in a well taped up plastic bubble wrap envelope. I assumed the envelope contained a small fragile item in multiple layers of wrapping so I used scissors to cut into the flap of the envelope and nearly cut my new shirt. Take care opening it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1428247", "1": "0.2222228", "2": "0.11316096", "3": "0.25331482", "4": "0.10163624", "5": "0.08118596", "6": "0.08565449"}}
