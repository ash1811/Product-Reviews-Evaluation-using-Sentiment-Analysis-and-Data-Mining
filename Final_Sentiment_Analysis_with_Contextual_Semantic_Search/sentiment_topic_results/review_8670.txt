{"text": "I grew up with Casio watches in the 80s. This is an awesome throw back, but it's also the best \"don't care, just need to tell time and date\" watch. It's ridiculously light and thin so it doesn't get in the way. I have small guy wrists and this is smaller than \"manly man\" watches but larger than girl watches. Perfect for me. I also have the F-51W and that isn't as nice to wear. This does NOT have buttons that stick out so it's very comfortable and don't poke your skin, and the band is super slim. It makes for a very light watch.And I am here to confirm that yes, the Casio F-28W can be taken into the pool. I've swam and dove into 9feet deep water many many times with this watch and it has been no problem. I've never tried pressing the buttons while under water so I can't speak for that. But hey, it doesn't have any functions so there isn't any reason to press the buttons anyways.*edit*I've swam with this for probably over a hundred times now at an Olympic pool with chlorine. I also just did a mud run race with this yesterday. Still going just fine, no scratches or damaged wristband.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12750138", "1": "0.17636308", "2": "0.13383184", "3": "0.08084964", "4": "0.2318757", "5": "0.109549485", "6": "0.14002882"}}
