{"text": "Someone meant well buying these and my son truly loves them. Learning how to fill them and understanding the science behind them is truly great. The sound they make seriously gives me a headache whether he is using them appropriately or not. I highly advise if you buy these you plan on them for outdoor use. Also it is easy to accidently suck up water using them by mistake (or intentionally) so if you are going to use them I highly suggest truly non-toxic soap or plain wateer in a clean tub.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20331837", "1": "0.24323022", "2": "0.07386745", "4": "0.3304049", "6": "0.14353284"}}
