{"text": "I can not say enough good things about this bag. It is spacious and roomy. Lightweight when full compared to other bulky bags. Believe the reviews. Even if this bag is not \"full\" it still looks good and is functional with all the pockets. I have got to have pockets for everything.I have at least 9 different Kipling bags. Three of which are from 1994 and 1995. They have held up so well over the years that people still mistake them for brand new. They can hold up to a jet set lifestyle or everyday laid back casual style. The material makes them easy to pack in a suitcase or fit into smaller lockers. I am a Kipling fan for life!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.23488039", "1": "0.33344412", "3": "0.2291343", "4": "0.1253215", "6": "0.07250635"}}
