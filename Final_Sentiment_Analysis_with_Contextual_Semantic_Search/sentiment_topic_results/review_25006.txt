{"text": "I have many versions of these insoles. Some were very expensive and custom built by professionals. However, these ready-made insoles will be used more often because they easily fit shoes which have removable liners;they were quickly cut to fit for the toe area. They are NOT as supportive as the more expensive insoles; but,they will be used for travel. They are lightweight and can be removed in airports if necessary.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11863454", "1": "0.4373811", "2": "0.22173429", "3": "0.0858378", "4": "0.12772426"}}
