{"text": "I need a basic water shoe for an upcoming trip to Jamaica. I went with these mostly based on price and other reviews. I am normally a US 9M and purchased the 8M in these. They JUST fit. I'm hoping once they are wet, they will give a bit. They seem like they will have good traction and they are comfortable for the most part. I can see how most reviewers are frustrated with the insole coming out or bending. I'm pretty sure that will be an issue with me as well. They do look good on the foot, not big or bulky. Other than that, I can't write much more until I actually where them as intended in a few weeks.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06899263", "1": "0.3730991", "2": "0.21320952", "3": "0.056676492", "4": "0.13797693", "6": "0.14733389"}}
