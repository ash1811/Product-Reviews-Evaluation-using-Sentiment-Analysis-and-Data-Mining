{"text": "I love them. I wear a 9 & saw they only had an 8.5, but ordered any way & couldn't believe it--they fit! I am very happy with them! Want a black pair, too! Great buy.Some say they don't do great in the cold, but they aren't snow boots. They work great for me, only look a little different then picture, but I still adore them. Was iffy about buying boots online--but this purchase was worth it. LovE the chocolate brown pair that I got. I live around GA & they are wonderful & keep my feet toasty--all you'd need was so e snow covers for boots if u were in the snow & you'd be fine. Would recommend :) .", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.1967749", "2": "0.13704002", "3": "0.18574658", "4": "0.12540264", "5": "0.19330704", "6": "0.1594892"}}
