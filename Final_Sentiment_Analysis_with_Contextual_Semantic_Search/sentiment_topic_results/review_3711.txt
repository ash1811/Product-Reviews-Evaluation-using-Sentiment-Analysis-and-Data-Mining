{"text": "I was looking at this watch to buy for myself as a holiday present.  My husband ended up coming into my home office and asked if I wanted it .  I said yes, and glad I did.  It can be worn as a dress watch or casual.  I usually need a second hand, which this does.  It keeps very good time and looks good with my gold bracelets.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19381222", "1": "0.23885103", "2": "0.10110621", "4": "0.25597417", "5": "0.12655215", "6": "0.079345696"}}
