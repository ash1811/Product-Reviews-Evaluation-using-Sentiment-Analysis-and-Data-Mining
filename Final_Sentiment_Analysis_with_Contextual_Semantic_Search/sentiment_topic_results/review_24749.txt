{"text": "I've been wearing this type of shorts for quite a few years and have watched as brands such as Russell and Champion started making theirs off-shore with a corresponding drop in quality. The Soffe shorts are a nice heavy fabric that is fairly soft and have a nice wide waist band. I also bought a pair of Anvil at the same time and they are not nearly of the same quality.
