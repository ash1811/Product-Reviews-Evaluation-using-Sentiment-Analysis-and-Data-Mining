{"text": "I had read several reviews of this boot and many reviewers had commented that the fit was too narrow, or that the calf was too tight, etc.  But I think they are perfect and very comfortable!  I have very wide feet, and I ordered my usual size in these.  I also have athletic calves, so many boots don't work for me.  These boots were a tad tight on my calves with leggings on, but they loosened up in about an hour of wear.  These are the cutest boots and go with everything.  I LOVE them!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.34068176", "2": "0.06432691", "3": "0.19693837", "4": "0.26556313", "6": "0.12597595"}}
