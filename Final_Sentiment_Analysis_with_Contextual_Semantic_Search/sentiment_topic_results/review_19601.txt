{"text": "This bra is the perfect, full coverage support bra. Although I have owned a number of other supportive bras, this is by far the most comfortable, and it fits nicely and smoothly under my clothes. The support is not just preventing your breasts from migrating southward (though it does that well), but it also provides effective support against bouncing up--holding them in place even if you run up the stairs, turn sideways quickly or get on an amusement park ride. That is a huge advantage. Most other bras I own, even high end ones and other Le Mystere ones, do not effectively control the upward bounce.I noticed another reviewer complained about itchiness. I own several of this bra, and yes, some do itch at first. It's not unique to this bra. With sensitive skin some of the fabric chemicals used on many bras are uncomfortable. Don't let it deter you from owning this amazing bra. A quick rinse in Woolite is enough to fix the problem if you experience it (again, usually true to any bra except very cheap lace which this is not).I should mention that there are a couple things this bra is not. As you can see from the picture, it is full coverage with thick straps--not right for every outfit. It also does not make your breasts look bigger or smaller, just perfectly shaped.My bra size has fluctuated with pregnancy and weight loss. In my experience, with the straps correctly adjusted, this bra fits perfectly to size.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.023692291", "1": "0.1126689", "2": "0.13921833", "3": "0.31559557", "4": "0.1878872", "5": "0.11627188", "6": "0.10466578"}}
