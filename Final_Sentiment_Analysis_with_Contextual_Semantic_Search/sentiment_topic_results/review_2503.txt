{"text": "I love these shoes for work but they are a bit pricey.  I bought a pair in black and navy - bye-bye $135 plus tax.I wish they came in a brown but the nearest they have is taupe or bronze and they are rarely available in my size... 9W.  The \"bronze\" has been unavailable in my size almost a year.They are fairly true to size but still take a bit of wear before they are comfortable.They tend to pinch on the toes and I've had to treat several painful blisters as a result.I like the arch support and the small heel.The only drawback apart from the price is that the lining comes loose very quickly and then slides around inside the shoe which is uncomfortable and annoying.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09355464", "1": "0.25959542", "2": "0.107237376", "3": "0.17328751", "4": "0.041055683", "5": "0.14915185", "6": "0.17611751"}}
