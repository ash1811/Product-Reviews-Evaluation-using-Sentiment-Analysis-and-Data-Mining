{"text": "I got the Boston Soft Footbed Clog in Mocha suede, in my regular size of 39, and actually believe they are worth the money.  I love these shoes.  I had previously purchased my first pair of Birkenstocks, the Arizona (soft) sandal, and those took 3 weeks to break in because of the strap closest to the ankle.  It hurt from the motion of walking with every step.  My patience was rewarded, and those are now comfortable, but these clogs only took a week to feel like a part of my sole.  (pun intended!)  It is not unusual for me to wear them 13 hours straight, and I prefer keeping them on to going barefoot around the house.I looked at these at a local store, and the Mocha color didn't look like simply dark brown.  It had a greenish hue, very beautiful.  That was really why I chose the color.  However, I ordered these online, and they do not have that special hue.  They are dark brown/chocolate.  The extreme comfort has made me unconcerned with the color not being what I expected.  My guess at this point is that the Boston style is the best Birkenstock made, and I only wish that I could wear them year 'round.  My feet can't tolerate much heat, and I don't think wearing suede in the rain or walking through puddles would make for a durable pair of shoes.  The suede spray seems to be for stain resistance, and I don't think that means waterproofing.  So for me, the Boston is a shoe for cold and dry weather, and I don't wear socks with them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.02582416", "1": "0.34604892", "2": "0.054533545", "3": "0.1696079", "4": "0.039740052", "5": "0.20867334", "6": "0.15557207"}}
