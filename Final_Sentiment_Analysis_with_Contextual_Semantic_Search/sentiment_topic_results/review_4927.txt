{"text": "I must preface this review by saying that I don't swim wearing this watch, so water resistance is of little importance to me. I also take it off for contact sports (who wants to be rude enough to smack their partner in the face with a watch?), so I haven't really tested its shock resistance. That being said, the watch is comfortable to wear, easy to use, and has a good selection of features. I have had no trouble with buttons or straps wearing out or fading in color. The only thing that I would add would be another interval timer.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.029919494", "1": "0.3071495", "2": "0.2288419", "3": "0.04135548", "4": "0.14997649", "5": "0.15086994", "6": "0.09188721"}}
