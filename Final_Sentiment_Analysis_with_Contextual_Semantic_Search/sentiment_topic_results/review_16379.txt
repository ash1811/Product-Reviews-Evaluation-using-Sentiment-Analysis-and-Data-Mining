{"text": "These flip flops covers the length and width of my feet but they don't fit on easily sadly, I have to squeeze into them. I normally wear size 13 sneakers for a just nice fit and 14 for a little more room, I now wear boots everyday from Bates and they're a size bigger, while these flip flops are just nice, the length of the strap isn't long enough for me to put it on or take it off easily.I can't really return it as I don't live in the USA and it takes quite a bit of time and locally, my feet are huge and therefore hard to find flip flops in my size. The only comfort I can take in getting this pair of flip flops is that I'm only using them when I shower at the office or when my boots are soaked and I'm air drying them in the office hence I do not wear the flip flops often. I wish that the strap was adjustable which would have been a lot better.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.090166755", "1": "0.29137", "2": "0.1156955", "3": "0.13710631", "4": "0.19491926", "6": "0.16826794"}}
