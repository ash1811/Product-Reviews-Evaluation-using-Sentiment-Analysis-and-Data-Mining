{"text": "I bought this for my fiancee, who wanted a more \"rugged\" watch to wear when he's out working on our garage expansion construction project, among other things.  This watch fit the bill perfectly.  The thick rubber band doesn't get scratched up, and he says it's comfortable when he's working.  It's held up quite well under his punishment.  Also looks good when he's not working quite so hard.  Would definitely buy again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09420731", "1": "0.41682294", "2": "0.13474102", "3": "0.11256573", "4": "0.15049846", "6": "0.087897815"}}
