{"text": "Have worn Acorn slippers for years; they last and last!  Comfy, sturdy, warm and easy to wash.  We've noticed the fit has gotten a little smaller, now that they are made in China.  Two things we would like--better sizing, a slightly narrower fit or sized in narrow and wide, as well as, individual sizes, not multi-sized AND even though they are cushioned, more would be better, with a little arch support.  We like the tex moc and polar moc styles the best.  Don't ever want to be without them!  We love them!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2131646", "3": "0.350823", "4": "0.14212544", "5": "0.17509653", "6": "0.11376279"}}
