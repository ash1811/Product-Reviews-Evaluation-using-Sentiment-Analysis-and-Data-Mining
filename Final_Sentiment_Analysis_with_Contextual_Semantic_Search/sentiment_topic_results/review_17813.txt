{"text": "Have had many good Casio watches.  Even the $20 watches are great. However, when I received this watch the digital display is too faint.  In order to read it it clearly, I have to turn the watch to the side. Perhaps it languished in a warehouse too long and battery is dying.  Will send it back and try to get refund. Had the display been better I would have kept this watch and probably given it a good review.  Update 9.18.11: I sent watch back to seller who credited my credit card with purchase amount and shipping.  I have since bought another  G-Shock on Amazon and am awaiting its arrival.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14434238", "1": "0.2186272", "2": "0.23572925", "3": "0.06884975", "4": "0.1030259", "5": "0.16412771", "6": "0.0652978"}}
