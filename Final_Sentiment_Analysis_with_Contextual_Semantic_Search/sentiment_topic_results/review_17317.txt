{"text": "This is my second pair of Birkenstocks in this style. I think that there is a unisex version and a women's \"fashion\" version, and this one (black suede) appears to be the latter. My other pair has more shape to the shoe, and the suede is thicker and less soft but sturdier. This new pair is kind of floppy and doesn't stay \"open\" when you take the shoe off.  These also cost considerably less than the other pair. I still like them, they are just as comfy, but I but doubt they will last as long as the unisex version. They do run large and wide. I ordered my usual 39N and had to punch another hole in the strap to hold them on. Thicker socks make them more comfy too.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.023317838", "1": "0.30276093", "2": "0.19059812", "3": "0.3090879", "4": "0.07041513", "5": "0.03425461", "6": "0.06956549"}}
