{"text": "This is a great head scarf. I ordered black/white, and intend to also order the tan/black. The description says it measures 42' by 42' but, after washing and drying (without any fading or bleeding), mine measures 45' by 45'. It can be tied about the head as a regular head scarf, about the neck for warmth, or about the face to protect from blowing sand, blazing sun, pollen, etc. For instructions on how to tie, there are several good videos on YouTube.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09314967", "1": "0.085706756", "2": "0.27803758", "3": "0.10202124", "4": "0.17362544", "5": "0.14099258", "6": "0.12646672"}}
