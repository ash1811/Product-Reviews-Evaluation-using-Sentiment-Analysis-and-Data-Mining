{"text": "I have owned some form of this shoe for many years. Due to some painful foot issues, there are very few shoes that I can wear comfortably, and these are probably my favorite. I wear these almost every workday and I do a decent amount walking during the day. I wish they would last a little longer... I tend to get a new pair every 8 months or so. I find they usually wear out at the top inside of the heel (Achilles Notch) or the rubber starts separating from the sole. Since they are not super expensive, I am willing to re-buy them because they are really super comfortable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.099599026", "1": "0.27221662", "2": "0.10737917", "3": "0.10210681", "4": "0.06884552", "5": "0.27925652", "6": "0.07059631"}}
