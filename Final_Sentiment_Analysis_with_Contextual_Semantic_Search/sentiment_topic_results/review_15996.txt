{"text": "I purchased these flip-flops due to the high number of good reviews, and also to test out the brand. However, after owning them a short while, I feel they are overrated (or perhaps I received a knock-off or defective pair). The good: The fit is fine (they probably run about a half-size smaller than most flip-flops in the U.S.) The style is okay. They appear just as they do in the picture. I don&#8217;t find them particularly stylish, but not unattractive either. They are quite comfortable (which is stated repeatedly in the reviews and is the main reason I purchased them), but not much more so than other flip-flops I own (they are a bit thicker than most, while still remaining light on the feet).The bad: The material of the flip-flops tends to attract pet hair and dust particles (not the fabric part, but the rest of it), which collects quite badly along the sides when wearing. This seems odd, considering they are intended as foot gear&#8230;most walking surfaces contain these elements. Also, the dye in them bleeds onto the feet, which bothered me a lot because it made them seem very cheaply made. I have never encountered this problem before, even with cheap flip-flops I have purchased at local stores.Overall, I didn&#8217;t find anything that would keep me coming back to this brand in the future. I will continue to search for a shoe brand I can fall in love with. Until then, I will likely stick with Skechers (one of the best brands I have found so far).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05173981", "1": "0.306828", "2": "0.12277846", "3": "0.18458813", "4": "0.09071245", "5": "0.15843685", "6": "0.084916286"}}
