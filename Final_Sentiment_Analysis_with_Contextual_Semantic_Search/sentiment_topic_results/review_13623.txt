{"text": "I received this shoe in very good time from an Amazon marketplace partner. the quality of the product is very high, stitching was good, the overall construction was superior, and then foot-bed and sole made for a very comfortable shoe, right out of the box. Many new shoes have a break- in period, but these Sperry top-siders were instantly comfortable (most likely due to the cushion insert in the foot-bed and the sole construction. the sole is thicker than the standard boat shoe, and is better suited for walking on hard surfaces all day. time will tell about their longevity but my initial review is that they are excellent shoes, suitable for business casual, with jeans, or shorts.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12475414", "1": "0.18775454", "2": "0.23316756", "3": "0.12611736", "4": "0.087091394", "5": "0.21466725", "6": "0.026447786"}}
