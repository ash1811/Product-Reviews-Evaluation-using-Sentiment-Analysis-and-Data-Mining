{"text": "My daughter really enjoyed this costume.  It comes with several pieces, including a small attached cape (can be tricky to get on), gloves, and rubber like belt.  The belt itself is a magnet for dirt and gets dingy and grey very fast.  But the material is neat - shiney and thin so it helps create the Batgirl illusion.In all, we liked it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08150943", "1": "0.1468017", "2": "0.31226802", "4": "0.09399844", "5": "0.18680935", "6": "0.17484513"}}
