{"text": "I am not a runner.  I am a novice walker.  My little toes naturally tuck under the toe next to them and have ended up with blisters on them.  This makes wanting to walk a challenge.  Those blisters hurt.  I decided to try these socks, thinking the separation between my toes would help prevent blisters.  I've only worn them a few times, but so far, so good.  They seem to be doing the job.They are a bit of a challenge to put on.  They are foot specific.  The little red label goes on the outside.  You can also look for the heel pooch to help you determine the bottom.  I find it is easiest if you put the big toe in first and then work the next one in and so on.  The more I do it, the faster I am getting at putting them on.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17966568", "1": "0.2802099", "2": "0.091401435", "3": "0.2178136", "4": "0.03709259", "5": "0.07017131", "6": "0.12364547"}}
