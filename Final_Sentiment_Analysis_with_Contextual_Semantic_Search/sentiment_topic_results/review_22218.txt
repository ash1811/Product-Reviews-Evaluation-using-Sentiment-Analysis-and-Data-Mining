{"text": "So this sock is a little expensive, which is why I deducted 1 *, I would love to be able to buy a 3 pack in the $20-25 range. That said, I love the sock. It is just enough extra padding that, IMO, has really helped my comfort level in completing my long runs in my half marathon training. I run 90% of my runs in Vibram Bilika LS size 46, and didn't have any problems until I started getting to 10 miles and beyond. The problems weren't significant, it was just the overall soreness of my feet was back that reminded me of my first runs in the Vibrams. I also sweat a lot, so I think the moisture was leading to rubs on my feet. This sock has led to a dryer run and a noticeably more comfortable one, while still feeling essentially barefoot.The fit is as expected, I wear a Large and while the toes look tiny they stretch comfortably over my rather large toes and then fit in my shoes snuggly. One thing I'm concerned about is durability. I could see my toes sliding in the wrong slot and easily tearing this sock a part if I'm in a rush one morning and don't take the extra second to ensure the proper lineup. I also can't speak to how many runs they'll last. But after two runs totaling around 18 miles I can say I'm very pleased with what I've had so far. If they are able to last then maybe the $10 price tag will be worth it. WIll update when/if they bite the dust.P.S. this is a copy and paste from my Performance Lightweight No-Show sock review. I think I like that sock better, but they are really tough to differentiate from. I guess it really boils down to I like the look (or lack thereof) of that sock better.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.066946805", "1": "0.24916482", "2": "0.08517091", "3": "0.19113894", "4": "0.21656431", "5": "0.18866283"}}
