{"text": "since my son started wearing shoes Crocs have been the brand for us. it is thanks to crocs that i got him to even wear shoes! the color is vibrant and yes red is his favorite color. they fit perfectly and give him a better sense of independence (which it seems is very important for a kindergardener)as he can get them on and off on his own. now he needs to learn to tie his shoes! thanks crocs!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.26525775", "2": "0.21763733", "3": "0.18334016", "5": "0.27136558", "6": "0.05505706"}}
