{"text": "These CK briefs are of very high quality, and the material of which they're made is very silky and soft.  Hopefully, they will perform as claimed for a while, but only time will tell.  I bought a 3-pack of VERY similar CK briefs (just not as silky and soft) at Costco for around $22.00.  The difference in price makes me wonder if I paid way too much for these.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12003941", "1": "0.20714113", "2": "0.0754779", "3": "0.18405785", "4": "0.21652147", "5": "0.10794311", "6": "0.08881911"}}
