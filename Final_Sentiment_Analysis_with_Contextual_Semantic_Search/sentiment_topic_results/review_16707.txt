{"text": "I give these 4 stars and not 5 because the calf strap needed to have an extra hole punched to fit properly. However, these boots are great otherwise. They fit exceptionally well. I wear a size 6.5 and find these to be incredibly true to size. I also find them to have a very large calf circumference. I wear a designer petite size 4, but have snowboarder's calves. They measure 15&#34; ! Finding boots that fit well in both the foot & calf are always a challenge because of this. I would highly recommend these to anyone with a similar problem. Take the chance and actually buy them in your size. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. If you have a calf larger than 15&#34;, I would highly recommend the Nana Pole Climber boots. They also fit larger calves and run incredibly true to size. Hope this helps someone out there with muscular legs!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.26019007", "2": "0.15533116", "3": "0.21736373", "4": "0.14064497", "5": "0.10671949", "6": "0.11750555"}}
