{"text": "I saw these at a store and liked them but they didn't have my size.  I want a semi-casual pair of black shoes that will go well with jeans and maybe something similar, but not necessarily dressier pants.  What I liked is the toe is not too pointy or blocky and the shine/sheen was fairly dull which is what I want.  Assuming these are just the same I'm fine ordering them but want to be sure.  How would some of you rate the shine on these?  I have a dressier pair of black shoes that are a bit shinier so I'm hoping these are like what I saw in the store, a low to no luster black shoe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3554093", "2": "0.25915545", "3": "0.17560159", "4": "0.10238654", "5": "0.07450235", "6": "0.030190412"}}
