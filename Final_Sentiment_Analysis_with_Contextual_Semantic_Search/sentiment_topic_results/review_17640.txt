{"text": "Plus: Watch arrived on time.Cons:  Watch is for husband as part of a surprise along with another watch. First glance at it, disappointment is the only word to describe how I felt. The watch doesn't look as nice in person as the picture even though it is the right product.I have a feeling that it is not 100% new, because the manual was not placed at the right section and the watch hands were already moving. Generally a new watch would not come as such to prevent the battery from being drained.I may have to give this to hubby early instead and if he doesn't like it as a generic watch to wear around, then I will have to return it.I will update again after getting a closer look at this watch later.Update 1/9/2013:I upgraded from 3 stars to 4 because I gave the watch to hubby last night who seems to like it more than me. When he removed the plastic off of the dial, the watch did become better looking in my opinion. Hubby said it is a cheap watch so he doesn't have to worry about scratching it like his other watches. The band length is good and fits his wrist fine.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10722181", "1": "0.23382816", "2": "0.2269693", "3": "0.12099235", "4": "0.06481888", "5": "0.14641473", "6": "0.099754795"}}
