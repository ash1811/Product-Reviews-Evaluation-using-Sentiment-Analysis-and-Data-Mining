{"text": "I really like this watch.  I thought it was bigger than it is (38MM) and I am used to watches that are bigger.  However I have come to like it as it is lightweight and easy to see the time.  I did replace the watchband with a Timex Velcro band and now I like it even more.  The Indiglo light is really nice and works great.  It has lost about a second since I started using it over a week ago.  Great watch for the money,", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17793055", "1": "0.1414581", "2": "0.21136612", "3": "0.060874257", "4": "0.06951903", "5": "0.06820712", "6": "0.27064487"}}
