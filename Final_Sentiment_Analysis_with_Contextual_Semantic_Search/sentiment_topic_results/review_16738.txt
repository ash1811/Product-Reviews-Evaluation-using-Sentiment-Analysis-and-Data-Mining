{"text": "Levi stopped making my go-to jeans a couple of years ago, and I've been looking for some new basic jeans ever since. Nothing really fit right until I tried these, and WOW! These look and feel great. I'm not constantly adjusting the waist or shimmying around in them. They just feel effortlessly nice. I'm 5'5&#34; and ordered the short length, and I'm not stepping on these at all. I ordered two more pairs and couldn't be happier with all of them. I only wish they had some in lighter colors too!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.18718284", "1": "0.25064805", "2": "0.06805971", "3": "0.1911875", "4": "0.042284627", "5": "0.047902882", "6": "0.21273436"}}
