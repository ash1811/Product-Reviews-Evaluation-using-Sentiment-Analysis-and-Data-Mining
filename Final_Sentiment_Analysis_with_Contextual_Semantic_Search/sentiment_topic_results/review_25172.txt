{"text": "I tried these for the first time a month or so ago. My former 'go to' brand......the quality has been going down, the material thinner, and the reviews of recent purchasers were not looking good. Decided to give the Jockeys a try....reviews were very good. Yes, they are more expensive than my former brand, but so far I think they're worth it. I normally wear a large, and they fit fine.....they are a little tighter than a new shirt of my former brand......but they are by no means &#34;too small&#34;, I just noticed they were a little tighter (new vs new, comparing both brands). Will continue to order these (in a large) as my older shirts become worn and get 're-purposed'.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03961633", "1": "0.2811934", "2": "0.044109363", "3": "0.24952841", "4": "0.078678854", "5": "0.24826907", "6": "0.05860452"}}
