{"text": "Great tool.  I had no problem getting the backs off of our waterproof watches with this tool.  It is expense to get a jeweler to change out these batteries & now I only have to pay for the batteries.  This tool will pay for itself in now time.It is easier to use if you lay the watch face down on a towel.  Go slow positioning the tool into place & use the head of the tool rather than the handle.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2820102", "1": "0.14317122", "2": "0.319117", "3": "0.08634402", "4": "0.16117463"}}
