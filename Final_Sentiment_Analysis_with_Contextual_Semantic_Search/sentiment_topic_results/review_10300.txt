{"text": "I didn't bother reading the reviews until after the purchase.  I only looked at the stars.I bought two (2) 10/12's for an 11 year old boy who is skinny (I'll get measurements later), and these fit great.  Coat length and sleeve length is perfect.  There's a little extra in the midsection (for him), but that's because he's skinny.  It's fleece, so it doesn't stretch.  The midsection might be 'smaller' than most clothes (designed to fit any size), but these look like a good fit on him and he loves it.  If these are running small, I'm not sure where.  I certainly didn't have that experience.  It's his new favorite coat!The quality is great, and the price is awesome.  I'll update if there's any problem with wear.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04065919", "1": "0.39079615", "2": "0.02636724", "3": "0.17242925", "4": "0.085677646", "5": "0.16445255", "6": "0.11961796"}}
