{"text": "The belt works.  I think that's about what can be said.  Here are a couple surprises/negatives:- The belt is VERY long (I ordered the shorter length).  However, it can just be cut to size.- Its thinner than I expected.- Parts of the buckle are not finished well, and thus will rub against fabrics, causing wear spots.  Not as much on jeans, but especially on khaki/twill fabrics.  Not a major issue, but something of note.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13826795", "1": "0.27115598", "2": "0.17098016", "3": "0.16791542", "4": "0.057930622", "5": "0.18997598"}}
