{"text": "I bought this for my hubby for Fathers Day. It's perfect for him. Enough compartments that he can store electronics, his wallett, money, music, and other stuff separatley. I like that there are two drink holders on the sides. The only thing I don't understand are all the straps  - but it's probably just for when you go day hiking and since this is more of a &#34;travel&#34; bag we don't need all the extra straps - but if we do go day hiking it will come in handy.The shoulder pads are really nice too!  They are padded and have a countoured shape for men's shoulders.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13614884", "1": "0.1996242", "2": "0.1335637", "4": "0.09584499", "5": "0.2782074", "6": "0.15367423"}}
