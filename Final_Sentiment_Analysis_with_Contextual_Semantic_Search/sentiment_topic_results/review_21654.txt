{"text": "I love the bag design. Just wish it was a little larger for medical purposes. It barely fits all my medical stuff, but as a regular purse it would be fine. There is no lining, bottom insert or pockets either. I recommend getting an organizing insert for it. It's sturdy however and the adjustable strap and the closures are good and strong.
