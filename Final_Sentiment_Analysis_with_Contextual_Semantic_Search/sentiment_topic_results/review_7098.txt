I have always had to wear sports bras because of my comfort level of not wanting to feel my breast against my skin, getting all sweaty and sticky. This is the FIRST bra EVER to be compatible for my twins and I. Iv gotten so comfortable with this bra on, I ordered multiples, so that I NEVER have to go with out wearing a bra now.
