{"text": "This shoe walks me! I guess that means that most other shoes fight the natural ergonomics of human stride, heel to toe! It is impressive! But beware, Merrell shoes run SMALL!  I wear 9 1/2 to 10. This shoe fits me at 11 1/2!  I have a very similar Merrell low top hiking shoe; but it is size 11! So for mail order, MAKE SURE RETURN IS FREE! Otherwise you will have to pay as I did to return for correct size. This shoe came as an Amazon purchase from ShoeMall!  ShoeMall said I was not their customer so they do not pay for return shipping. Amazon paid what ShoeMall would pay = $7.00, but the cost with FedEx was $15.80 to return.  OK!  I love the shoe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16989164", "1": "0.09739717", "2": "0.25799876", "3": "0.23305719", "4": "0.1382277", "6": "0.10125474"}}
