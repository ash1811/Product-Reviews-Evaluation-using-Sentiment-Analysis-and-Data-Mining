{"text": "Having just gotten Carhartt's pocket-T's and finding the Large just right, I bit the bullet and bought the twill shirt to wear over the t's for early morning hikes and walks in what has been a very mild winter.Pros: The material is heavy, but moves with you. In other words, it's not a jacket, but a heavy shirt.The twill is extremely comfortable. It is very soft, yet you can tell that it's \"sturdy\" and will wear well.The Large fits over a heavy T, but fits perfectly without being tight around the middle.Cons:  The sleeves are about an inch short. I have worn a 16x33 in a long sleeve shirt for over 30 years. This is about a 16x31.5, BUT if I had gotten the Tall XL, the cuffs would cover my hands. (See their sizing chart.)This is not a box cut as the photos show. It's meant to be worn inside the pants. Not a deal breaker, but disappointing.The label (nylon) stitching at the neck scrapes and chafes. It had to be carefully removed.Will I buy another? Maybe, but I can't say for certain. If it shrinks in the wash, probably not because I don't want to go through the process of trying an XL. If it doesn't shrink and the shorter sleeves don't \"bind\" when buttoned, I probably will. Stay tuned for washing results.ew", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07053454", "1": "0.43457568", "2": "0.086657286", "3": "0.090150736", "4": "0.09436233", "5": "0.068644315", "6": "0.1550751"}}
