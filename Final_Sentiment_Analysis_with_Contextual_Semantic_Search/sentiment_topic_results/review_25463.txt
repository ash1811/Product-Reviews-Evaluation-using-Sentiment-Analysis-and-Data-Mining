{"text": "These are very nice looking Moccasin's, made of good quality leather and very soft inside, easy on the feet. I like the nice leather smell. The inner sole comes out if you need to wash it, which is a nice feature. I like that string was used for the laces, because the leather laces always tend to break after a while and these strings will not. I wear these on my feet all the time at home and love the way they feel on my feet. I will definitely buy another pair, just like these, when these get replaced. I have been wearing these for months now and they are still like new. The string can be tightened to make slipper tighter if needed. Buy a pair, you will love them!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08961461", "1": "0.31652084", "2": "0.15866473", "3": "0.21335368", "4": "0.09256205", "6": "0.12685618"}}
