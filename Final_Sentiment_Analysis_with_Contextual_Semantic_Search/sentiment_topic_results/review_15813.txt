{"text": "When I saw this I knew my mom would love it. it's totally unique. I was worried because some of the reviews make it sound like garbage.This is not my impression at all.The item has a good weight to it. My only complaint is because it's top heavy it tilts forward.When it arrived we had to take the chain off to get the stones in. So I don't see how the stones can \"fall out\" because the chain keeps the locket closed. It appears to me the locket is designed to hold 3-6 stones.After I helped her put the stones in (which took a delicate touch) she put it on and has been wearing it since. No problems. She just loves it. It's elegant but casual enough for everyday.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.30940062", "1": "0.1853227", "2": "0.07821295", "3": "0.13227552", "4": "0.15462461", "5": "0.05912272", "6": "0.08104088"}}
