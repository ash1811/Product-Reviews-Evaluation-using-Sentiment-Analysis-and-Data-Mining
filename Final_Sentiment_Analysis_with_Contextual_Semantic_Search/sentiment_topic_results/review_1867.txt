{"text": "I love these shoes! I bought the standard brown ones and I must say the color is duller and more earthy than it appears in the picture. I was afraid of them being obnoxiously bright. As several other reviewers suggested, I bought these in a half size down (9.5 US) than I usually wear. I noticed that the shoes were initially slightly tight around the ball of the foot. This problem subsided after breaking the shoes in for about an hour. They're perfectly comfortable now and have about a half inch of extra room on the toes for me. No complaints in the sizing department thus far. I was very weary of paying almost $40 for a style of shoe I can find for $15 at Target, but given the quality of this item, I have no regrets. These shoes are sturdy and look unlikely to fall apart after 6 months of wear and tear.My order was delivered in a timely manner, I have no complaints about the pricing, quality, or delivery of this product. Will most likely do repeat business with this seller.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.28898585", "2": "0.2923993", "3": "0.09490793", "4": "0.11079874", "5": "0.09866457", "6": "0.111852184"}}
