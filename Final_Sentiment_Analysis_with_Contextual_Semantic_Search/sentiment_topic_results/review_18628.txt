{"text": "Another great shemagh. I own these in several colors. Remember to do the triple-dip when you first get it. Fill up a bucket or large pot with enough warm water to submerge the scarf. Give the scarf a couple squeezes under the water and let it sit for 20 minutes. After 20 min, wring it out in the sink and replace the dirty water with new fresh warm water. Submerge the scarf again and soak for another 20 minutes. Repeat this process one more time and air dry over your shower curtain rod, or on a clothesline.This process will help bleed some of the fresh ink out of it so it won't stain when wet. It will also help to soften it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08655354", "1": "0.14848733", "2": "0.23428746", "3": "0.065087825", "4": "0.13881792", "5": "0.20990404", "6": "0.11686194"}}
