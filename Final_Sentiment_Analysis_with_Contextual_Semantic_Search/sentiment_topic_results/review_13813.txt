{"text": "This is an awesome watch.  Great dive watch, great automatic watch (winds from the movement of your wrist), great BIG watch.With a stainless steel bracelet or a rubber strap, this is water resistant to 200m, with strongly luminescent markings on an orange dial, and a unidirectional bezel.  The orange was selected for visibility at depth, and the bezel that rotates in one direction is a hold over from the days before digital dive computers.  The large dial also aids visibility.It uses an excellent and proven movement from Seiko, the 7S26, the basic movement of the Seiko 5 series of watches.  \"5\" for the five traits; 1. Automatic, 2. Water resistant, 3. Shock resistant, 4. Date, 5. Day.  For someone who wants an automatic without paying Swiss prices (or wants to avoid Invicta and their issues), this is an excellent choice, as it would be for someone buying their first automatic watch.  No kidding, this movement keeps time as well as the workhorse of Swiss movements, the ETA 2824-2.This watch is a big watch.  We're talking one serious hunk of steel. About 43mm diameter and 11mm thick, this is pretty darn big, and carved out of a block of steel, so heavy also.  This might put some folks off, and some folks might go for it for compensations' sake, but I like a watch like this for outdoors, working out, and other tasks that would put a lesser timepiece in mortal peril.I'm sold, this thing rocks.E.M.
