{"text": "I really wanted to like this but, it's like wearing two pieces of elasticized tissue paper: it is soft and comfy I guess (thus the 2 stars instead of 0), but a bra is supposed to support and this bra provides NO SUPPORT. It is basically just a simple thin cloth so I am stunned why the high price for such a simple product and surprised Medela would come up with such a low quality product. I have a big bust (DDD while nursing) with a very slim torso. I bought the large and this thing rides up super high in the back, while the cups fit just barely. No idea how this is supposed to be a sleep bra, because the lack of support means the boobs move around as if I was naked, shifting the nursing pads, etc. Get a Bravado bra instead - they are all AMAZING!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07399466", "1": "0.38785625", "3": "0.13223921", "4": "0.11703095", "5": "0.058299858", "6": "0.22826837"}}
