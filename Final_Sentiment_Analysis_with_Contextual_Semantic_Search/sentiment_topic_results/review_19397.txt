{"text": "I bought this women's hat even though I am a man because I have hard time finding a mans hat that is small enough to fit me. This hat is very well made and does an excellent job of keeping the sun of your face and neck. With a little Scotch Guard it works well in light rain also. Like another reviewer mentioned this hat does run small and only the only adjustment is from small to smaller. So if you have a large head this hat probably won't work for you. If you have a small head and are looking for a well made hat that does an excellent job protecting your face and neck I highly recommend this one.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05432265", "1": "0.40390915", "2": "0.07609252", "3": "0.37080154", "4": "0.06802353", "6": "0.024533227"}}
