{"text": "Trained & competed in a half marathon using Thorlos after FitSocks and other in-vogue &#34;thin&#34; running socks resulted in blisters & hotspots.  Comfortable, padded and blister-preventing.  I do recommend wearing these when getting fitted for shoes- they're thicker than standard socks, and may (depending on your foot) require you to go either a half-size up or to a different width (e.g. from a &#34;regular&#34; shoe to an EE).These have a LOT of padding, so they may require some adjustments on your part. Worth EVERY PENNY, though. I just did 13.1 miles on an extremely hill-heavy course and came out without a single blister or hotspot.  They also wick the moisture away from your feet, so they're everything you could want in an exercise sock.  Highly recommend these for anyone doing distance events, who is an average or large-frame runner/walker, or who is breaking into either new shoes or a new start on distances.Last point: WASH & DRY THESE ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE PACKAGE.  If you don't, you'll wreck the socks and have blown $12-15 for nothing. The washing instructions preserve the socks' ability to help your feet- following them is absolutely worth the effort!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0977519", "1": "0.10610735", "2": "0.23302479", "3": "0.051425796", "4": "0.24791126", "5": "0.13059154", "6": "0.13318732"}}
