{"text": "Reviewers who have said the watch looks better in person are right. It looks great on Amazon, but looks even better in person. It is an eye catcher for sure. Looks classy and substantial like a man's watch should. I took just a few minutes to review the booklet that came with hit on how to set it, and it was not that hard. Have not messed with alarm yet, but shouldn't be too hard.  Looks great with a suit/tie or shorts/tee/flips.  The eco-drive is just cool. This watch looks tons more expensive than it is. It feels substantial on your arm, but not blocky heavy. Good size. Very happy with it.UPDATE: May 2012: Still like the watch. Still looks great. VERY HARD to move time ahead and back in timezones and when time changes etc. BUT once set, it's awesome. The looks and style still outweigh this small issue. Others may \"get it\" and be able to set it fine back and forth. May just be me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2651209", "1": "0.09638767", "2": "0.12296045", "3": "0.12203782", "4": "0.12082744", "5": "0.1023297", "6": "0.17033605"}}
