{"text": "When Champion used to make socks for Costco (\"Elite\") they were the best, most comfortable socks I had ever owned. They made my  feet so comfortable I'm sure I could have worn my boots to bed. But Costco switched to a sock made by somebody else, and Champion dropped the \"Elite\" line. The ones I just bought (just like another reviewer said) are thin. Too thin. They might be O.K. for a tennis shoe, but never for a work boot. I did get excellent customer service from Champion, and they even sent me a check for 10 bucks as a sort of refund. By the way, the Kirkland sock from Costco is terrible, but that's another story.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.022487618", "1": "0.21871693", "2": "0.26682246", "3": "0.065196745", "4": "0.12963757", "5": "0.23406485", "6": "0.06307386"}}
