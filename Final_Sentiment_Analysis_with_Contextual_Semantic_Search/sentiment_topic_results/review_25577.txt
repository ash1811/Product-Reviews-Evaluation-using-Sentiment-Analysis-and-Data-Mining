{"text": "I am VERY picky about my socks. I usually wear the thick, fuzzy slipper socks everyday, but I needed socks to wear while working out. I bought a couple other sets, but ended up ditching them. One set had a nylon feel to them (*shudder*)...I HATED how they felt on my skin. Another set was too thin. These have been absolutely perfect!They do shrink down quite a bit after washing, but I wear a 5.5 - 6, and they're still just a little big. Doesn't bother me at all, though. They're the perfect thickness, they're super soft, and they barely show above the top of my sneakers. From now on, these will be my 'Go-To' socks!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.032131482", "1": "0.36680314", "2": "0.12957953", "3": "0.07198968", "4": "0.12047727", "5": "0.19229311", "6": "0.0867258"}}
