{"text": "I walk several miles most days, and these shoes are working out fine for me.  I've had them a couple of months, and they're holding up well so far.  They did need a breaking in period of a few days.  They're not the cutest shoes in the world (kind of clunky-looking) but they're supportive and my joints and heels don't hurt like they have when I've walked a lot in other shoes.
