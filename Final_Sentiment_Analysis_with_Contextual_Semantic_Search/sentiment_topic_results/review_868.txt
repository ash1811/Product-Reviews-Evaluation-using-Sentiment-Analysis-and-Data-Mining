{"text": "I have been wearing Island Pro flip flops for the past 5 years and thought they were the best ever because of their arch support.  But now these Reef's take the cake.  Sizing is perfect, I wear 7.5, got 8 and all is good.  I got a fat foot so it took like 3 days of break in to fit comfy but that's all good now.  And how can you not love the bottle opener.  I took one off to open to two Budvars and both times it was flawless.  The sole is similar to a sneaker (indoor soccer or volleyball). I'm hooked on the Reefs.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.30168283", "2": "0.14709032", "3": "0.35109404", "5": "0.19244388"}}
