{"text": "This good quality pouch is a useful addition to my range kit for holding loose ammo and small accessories. The two pockets are accessed through flaps that are secured with metal twist locks, which makes it unlikely anything will easily fall out if properly closed. The larger pocket is big enough for several hundred rounds of .22 and I can easily get my whole hand into it to reach all the way to the bottom. The smaller front pocket is good for holding my multi-tool, ear plugs, and other useful items. The belt loop is well stitched and large enough to fit on my thick belt.Recommended!CFH", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1793179", "1": "0.29501647", "2": "0.0854146", "3": "0.13170508", "4": "0.15495676", "5": "0.07229383", "6": "0.08129534"}}
