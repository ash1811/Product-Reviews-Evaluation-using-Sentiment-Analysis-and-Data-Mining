{"text": "I needed something inexpensive that tells time.  This watch is attractive, and the band is long enough for my somewhat larger wrist.  So far it's keeping time, and the controls are easy to use.  My only quarrel is that if I pick it up at night to see the time, chances are only 50-50 that I'll get it right side up and hit the light button - if I pick it up upside down, I've changed the display from a 12 hour clock to 24.  But that's a minor irritation.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11412727", "1": "0.2657195", "2": "0.14531785", "3": "0.22154741", "4": "0.076214395", "6": "0.17401455"}}
