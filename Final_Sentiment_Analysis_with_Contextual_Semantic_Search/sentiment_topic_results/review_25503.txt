{"text": "This product is great!! I am a small B and I don't like wearing padded bras so I had been troubled for years about my nipples standing up when it's cold out. I was so excited when these covers arrived and I put them on immediately. It was really easy; just peel and stick! They are amazing! I've tried on white and colored tight tanktops and they don't show, they work great for white blouses and dresses as well. These pads are made of really soft silicone (as soft as my boobs) and are translucent so they are not visible under light colored clothing. The center of these covers are slightly over 1/8\" thick (my personal guess) and taper towards the edge so you can't see them at all even under tighter clothing. I wore them for 4 hrs today then removed them (ouchless!) and washed them with a little bit of hand soap, let them air dry, and they were sticky and ready to wear once more. This is one of the best products I have ever purchased for less than $[...]. Incredible. I will always hang on to these covers!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10800872", "1": "0.23659699", "2": "0.06332761", "3": "0.12088476", "4": "0.106560454", "5": "0.20939086", "6": "0.15523063"}}
