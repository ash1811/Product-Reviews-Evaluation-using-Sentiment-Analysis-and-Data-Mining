{"text": "I just realized my last pair (same size, same color) was bought over 5 years ago. They may be a little out of style, but when a piece of clothing lasts 5 years of being a mechanic, don't settle for less. Serious, I wear these twice a week, 10 months of the year. They are my go-to on weekends and outings. I wash them every 1-2 days of wear, and the old pair was awesome. 5 stars just for a $35 pair of shorts (back then) lasting longer than any pair of slacks or jeans I own.My current gripe: These are outta style homie. They're big, like 99 JNCO's big. They waist is small. I am a 38 waist in all my other jeans, and a 40 in dickies. They also have very small belt loops, so you'll have to forgo the studded belt. (yes, I still have mine) So yes, they have a quirky fit, but they feel amazing. This actual pair had a horrible smell from the starch or something; a few washes or campfires will take care of that. The cell pocket is still gigantic, and my favorite of any of the 'cell-pocket' on clothing. The color on the Navy is very accurate to the picture too.So ya, I'll keep wearing them just cause I'd rather only buy clothes every half-century. But I'll wear these like basketball shorts: only when I ain't out to impress anybody, and necessity must trump style.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.02413381", "1": "0.26998338", "2": "0.080554426", "3": "0.11578693", "4": "0.16450173", "5": "0.15997526", "6": "0.18506442"}}
