{"text": "Cole Haan shoe owners...the LARGE shoe tree fits perfectly for the 9.5 Mens size.These have a powerful cedar scent that will leave your shoes smelling nice.  They absorb moister well and maintain the shape of my nicer dress shoes well.They are solidly contracted and have a strong spring inside the shoe heel to keep tension on the toe.  I would recommend these to anyone looking to keep their shoes looking and smelling nice.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09223193", "1": "0.23254716", "2": "0.31811997", "3": "0.17497963", "4": "0.02924954", "5": "0.03362234", "6": "0.119249456"}}
