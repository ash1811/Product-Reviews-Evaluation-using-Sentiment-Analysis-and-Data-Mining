{"text": "I love the jeans. They are comfortable, high quality, and good looking.I personally thought they were a bit expensive for what they were worth, but the price changes for Amazon items all the time, so it really depends. (Also, I'm not a huge clothing shopper, so I don't know what the \"usual\" price).The jeans arrived like you would find them in a store, with the measurements in a clear plastic sticker along the side of the pants, and the brown tag on the back.I don't think these jeans are \"incredibly amazing\" or \"fantastic\" but I do think they will last a long time, and look great.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.096156694", "1": "0.339131", "2": "0.05918901", "3": "0.1257223", "4": "0.18130365", "5": "0.13715895", "6": "0.06133842"}}
