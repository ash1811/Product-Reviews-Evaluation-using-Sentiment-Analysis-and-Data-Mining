{"text": "I really love the look of the costume and I was so excited to wear it, except the second I tried it on, the zipper gave way. It was the perfect size/fit, too, but the zipper teeth were just too small and the metal zipper piece came away from one side. I had to do it up with safety pins :(I usually wear about size 2-4, and ordered a medium on recommendation of the other reviews and it was perfect. This definitely runs small (I'm 34 bust, 26 waist).It's great material, great quality, but without the zipper it all falls apart.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.115195625", "1": "0.35980058", "2": "0.06489898", "3": "0.15904045", "4": "0.073768295", "5": "0.122070916", "6": "0.10522512"}}
