{"text": "These shoes look really nice, fit nice, feel great on the feet.  So, what is the problem?  DEFECT IN MANUFACTURE - the rubber sole on one shoe developed a light spot, this became a &#34;blister&#34; very quickly, blister broke open, large hole and long, jagged tears grew from each side.  ONLY WORN INSIDE - I returned these and will not buy this brand again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20073661", "1": "0.2580783", "2": "0.22796395", "3": "0.11702336", "4": "0.07511007", "5": "0.06517862", "6": "0.05590912"}}
