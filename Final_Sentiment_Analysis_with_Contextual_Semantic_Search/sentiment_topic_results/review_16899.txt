{"text": "I was a little concerned when I bought these due to some of the negative reviews, but the cuffs are great. They're not fussy or difficult for me to get on- soft enough to open up a bit, but durable enough that they're not about to be easily bent out of shape. The edges aren't sharp or painful either. The bag they come in is pretty useless to me, but I didn't buy the earrings for the bag.Overall: good cuffs for the price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20887318", "1": "0.3828534", "2": "0.07973655", "4": "0.15824766", "5": "0.13415217", "6": "0.032453712"}}
