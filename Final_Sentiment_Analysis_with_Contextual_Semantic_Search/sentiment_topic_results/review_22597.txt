{"text": "I ordered a little larger bc all the reviews said they run small and they aren't styled to fit tightly.  They are a little long, but I have not washed them, so that is bound to change.  They are cute, comfortable, and casual, but maybe a little to casual for work.They were inexpensive and shipped quickly, although I am a PRIME member and get free 2 day shipping. I would order these again!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17773643", "1": "0.33269858", "2": "0.13292398", "3": "0.1537621", "4": "0.08696213", "5": "0.11224403"}}
