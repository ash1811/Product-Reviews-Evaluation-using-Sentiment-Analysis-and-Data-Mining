{"text": "I put on this bra and could not quit giggling.  My breasts took on a life of their own.  I think someone else mentioned the cone shape - they weren't kidding.  They were surprisingly perky for a wire free bra.  However I knew this bra didn't quite hit the mark when my husband walked in and asked what had happened to my chest.

Not my cup of tea.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06907871", "1": "0.2584688", "2": "0.16557793", "3": "0.19736776", "4": "0.11046124", "5": "0.065601036", "6": "0.1334445"}}
