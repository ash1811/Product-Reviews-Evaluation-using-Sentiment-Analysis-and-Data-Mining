{"text": "The cons:  The hem on the top and the pant bottom was unraveling out of the package with a long string attached.  I love the feel of the material and how it fits.  I am large breasted so I am always concerned it the pants will be too big.  There is a nice elastic on them and they fit very nicely.  I am 5' 3&#34; and the length is perfect.  If I had paid more for the pajamas I would be upset with the hem coming out.  But as it is I am just going to mend them before it all comes out and enjoy the great night sleep I have in them.  They do not bunch and I can turn easily.  A little see through so I would be uncomfortable wearing them in front of my son.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06822878", "1": "0.4208887", "2": "0.109798834", "3": "0.16659771", "4": "0.11482168", "5": "0.070914224", "6": "0.04875013"}}
