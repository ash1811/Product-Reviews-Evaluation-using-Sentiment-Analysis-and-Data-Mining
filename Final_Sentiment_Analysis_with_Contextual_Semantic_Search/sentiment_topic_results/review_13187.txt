{"text": "Bought this twice - Once in infant size and then for my one year old toddler. Great swim-diaper that is not bulky at all; white so it suits both sexes; and cheap enough that you make your money back just going a couple of times to the pool - one pack of swim diapers costs about the same, if not more, and they do not sell those all year round in stores near me.... Plus that side opening - golden! If they ever do decide to poop - think quick access without pulling the poop off over their legs (sorry to be so explicit, but hey if you are a parent, you know exactly what I am talking about).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1475041", "1": "0.19001392", "2": "0.15551552", "3": "0.12958926", "4": "0.11947779", "5": "0.20119752", "6": "0.056701846"}}
