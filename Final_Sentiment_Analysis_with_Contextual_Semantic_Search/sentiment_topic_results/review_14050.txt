{"text": "Being a Citizen Eco-Drive, this watch is well made and slick as expected. I really like the Eco Drive line of watches. The detail on the dial as well as the external detail is very nice for the price range. This model is obviously a serious diver design and it is actually made for diving use. It is a fun watch to wear every day if you choose to but I will warn this is a VERY heavy watch. Because of the weight of the case and the fact that it sits very high off of the wrist causes the watch to shift. You will know you are wearing this watch all day without a doubt. I use this as my fishing watch. If I every get it wet I do not care, it is tough and built for activity!With the crown on the left side it is not prone to catch on things but with the thickness of the case it will still be very capable of hitting objects if you are not careful. The crystal is well protected as the bezel rises above the crystal surface and this will help prevent scratches.I have a small wrist so this one is pretty animated when I move around but I love it. This spring I plan on catching a lot of fish with this in tow.
