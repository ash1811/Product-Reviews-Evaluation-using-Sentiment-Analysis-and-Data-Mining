{"text": "I've worn this watch daily for work for several years.  It's strength is the thinness.  I don't like jewelry, and don't like the feel of a watch.  For that reason, I've been buying titanium watches for many years.  This is just as light at a fraction of the price of my Seikos.  The watch looks and wears well.  The only thing i don't like is that the band is sectional with a double hasp.  I prefer the one-piece design with the accordion expanders - the sectional/2-piece bands have to be held in place and clasped by the same hand at the same time.  I wouldn't recommend the 2-piece band to those with arthritis.  However, the watch looks and works great.  recommended.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18901676", "1": "0.16283315", "2": "0.24827279", "3": "0.3512666", "6": "0.04356228"}}
