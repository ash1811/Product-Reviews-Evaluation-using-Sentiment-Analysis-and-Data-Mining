{"text": "Bought 2 of these in the Forest Green for a St. Patty's Day party.  these are a medium weight sweat, solidly built, good cuffs on sleeves and waist.  Not tight.  the sweat itself fits a bit large, but for me it is very comfortable.  If you want it to fit tight on the body, you might want to size down.  I dno't want it tight, so I ordered my regular size and the fits is just right.  Color on screen is about right - this is a very dark green.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.21603201", "1": "0.3958613", "2": "0.06559186", "3": "0.14634556", "4": "0.099309295", "6": "0.07367839"}}
