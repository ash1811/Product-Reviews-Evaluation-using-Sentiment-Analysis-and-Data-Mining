{"text": "I have tried many shoes during my lifetime but I keep coming back to New Balance for comfort, functionality, and durability.  These ML574's are another in a long line of quality athletic shoes.  I like the comfort.  There are no &#34;hot spots&#34; in the shoe, and they feel very comfortable when I walk or run.  The shoe is made of durable materials.  The leather side panels and toe guard give protection and support to the foot, and the toe strap prevents the big toe from coming through the top of the shoe (a faulty design seen in many running shoes).  The tread is not excess, so the shoe has functional comfort.  My last pair went for 7 years before having to be replaced, and I expect these will do the same.  I will purchase another pair of these now because I like them so much!
