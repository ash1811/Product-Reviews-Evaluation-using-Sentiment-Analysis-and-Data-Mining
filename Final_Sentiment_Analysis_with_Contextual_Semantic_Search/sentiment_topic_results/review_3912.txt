{"text": "As others reported-- the padding on the bottom goes flat within days. I had difficulty keeping them on my feet if I didn't take the time to scrunch my foot ALL the way in (meaning I couldn't just slip them on and run off), and the soles are NOT non-skid (though pretty sturdy, I felt comfortable stepping outside in them). Also they're so fuzzy on the inside, it traps all the dirt and grossness off my feet and they get stinky within a couple days, and I can't wash them that often (they have to dry overnight).All in all, a disappointment. I plan to try a ballet-style slipper next.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.102670945", "1": "0.21723093", "2": "0.1858728", "4": "0.21975201", "5": "0.14525497", "6": "0.12669724"}}
