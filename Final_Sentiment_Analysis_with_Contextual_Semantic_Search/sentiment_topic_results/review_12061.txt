I take care of all my jewerly and with this necklace especially. I'm very disappointed  because it's not very cheap and I've to buy another chain now. I don't know how many stars gave my son to this purchase because I didn't make know him about this defective chain.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14585315", "1": "0.28306052", "2": "0.1010183", "3": "0.20022771", "4": "0.14393038", "6": "0.12223776"}}
