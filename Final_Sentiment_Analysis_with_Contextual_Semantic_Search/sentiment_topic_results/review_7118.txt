{"text": "These were replacement shoes. My first pair I now use for running around doing errands because after four years of zumba they split on the mesh sides. I am forced to always wear black socks with them. These new ones fit just like the old. They are light, flexible and stable on a wooden dance floor. I can glide, jump and stomp in them. Love my ZUMBA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12815233", "1": "0.123944856", "2": "0.20575489", "3": "0.13021754", "4": "0.09196649", "5": "0.18237549", "6": "0.13758844"}}
