{"text": "Great cotton feel when I received the product. Vibrant and patriotic colors made up this bandanna.  I wore it to gym and had one the best boxing matches with it on.  When I returned home after Old Glory saved my eyes from sweat, I threw it in the wash with my wraps and mild detergent.  I washed on cold and noticed as soon as I pulled it out that the colors ran from the red.  It's very disappointing and they won't wash out.  Now the whites on my flag have a red-pink hue to them.  I'm a proficient clothes washer so I don't believe this was due to user error.  These colors ran.  Perhaps wash by hand next time.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07053841", "1": "0.12533598", "2": "0.18683702", "3": "0.089768775", "4": "0.08920234", "5": "0.3776181", "6": "0.060699362"}}
