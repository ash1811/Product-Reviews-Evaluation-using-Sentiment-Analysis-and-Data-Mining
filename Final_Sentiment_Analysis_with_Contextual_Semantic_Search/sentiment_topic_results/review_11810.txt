{"text": "I've been wearing Speedo Men's Surfwalker Pros as casual footwear for years.  They never fail to live up to the task.  I used to buy &#34;sand shoes&#34; from target, but I'd go through a pair every other month.  They were cheap, so I didn't really mind their lack of durability.  The Speedos cost more, about twice as much, but they last much much longer.  If I only walked on sand, instead of the mean sidewalks of Miami, I'm sure they'd last, like, forever.  I get about six to eight months of wear from each pair, and I buy two pair at a time, so the convenience of getting new ones each year to year and a half is worth it.  And, they fit great and have great ventilation.  Tough shoes that look cool and are cool to the feet.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03307321", "1": "0.26327106", "2": "0.22622426", "3": "0.22438557", "4": "0.066111244", "5": "0.100828595", "6": "0.086106084"}}
