{"text": "My Brother-in-Law asked for hiking socks last Christmas.  After reading the reviews, I selected these.  I saw him in July and he went on and on about these socks (he was even wearing them at the time).  He said they are very comfortable, warm in the winter, cool in the summer and retain their shape.  He requested them as a gift again this year.  Who knew socks would make such an impression??!!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18961787", "1": "0.31334266", "2": "0.17253159", "3": "0.057508174", "5": "0.25881985"}}
