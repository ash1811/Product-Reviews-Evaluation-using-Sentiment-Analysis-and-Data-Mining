{"text": "I was invited to a birthday party for my future brother-in-law, who happens to like anything having to do with dragons. So I thought I'd check out Amazon to see if I could find a dragon t-shirt to give him for a birthday gift. I found several but this one seemed to be the standout. I liked the dragon image and reviews vouched that the shirt was a good quality. I showed my fiancee a selection of dragon t-shirts who then chose this shirt right away as well. Great. The fabric feels smooth and doesn't have a thin or chintzy feel to it. At the party everyone oohed and ahhed over the shirt. It was a hit! My fiancee's brother-in-law is not a big talker. The only words he said after he unwrapped his gift were \"I'll dry this on a hanger,\" but we could tell by the look on his face that he really liked it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12692852", "1": "0.20574464", "2": "0.18206736", "3": "0.0334577", "4": "0.19009897", "5": "0.09627716", "6": "0.16542567"}}
