{"text": "These socks are a nice color and felt great on my feet.  Trouble is, you get hole after hole in a short time if you wear them often.

I'm going to try Wigwam's or Gold Toe socks next time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08956116", "1": "0.22892678", "2": "0.07705817", "3": "0.13042235", "4": "0.10288099", "5": "0.19810924", "6": "0.17304127"}}
