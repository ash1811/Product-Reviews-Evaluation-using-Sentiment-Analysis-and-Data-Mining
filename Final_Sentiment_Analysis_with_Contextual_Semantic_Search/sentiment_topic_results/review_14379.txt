{"text": "Love my new Sherpa bag, aptly named because I do not pack light. The sleeve to go over my roll on handle is the best idea, and so convenient. I am able to carry both my iPad and Kindle in their cases within the bag. Due to vision problem, I have to have different glasses for different activities, this works well to carry those as well. I ned several medications, the case for those goes right in the bag. I have a small day purse that I keep inside to grab and go at my destination. The bag is lightweight even with all of my needs, shoulder straps are correct length and comfortable, and short enough to slide right under the plane seat.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13131325", "1": "0.1779814", "2": "0.14659859", "3": "0.13136932", "4": "0.16152316", "5": "0.093204744", "6": "0.15800951"}}
