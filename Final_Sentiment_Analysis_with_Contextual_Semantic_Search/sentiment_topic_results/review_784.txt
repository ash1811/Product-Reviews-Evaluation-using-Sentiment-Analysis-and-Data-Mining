{"text": "I have a very small frame and wear a 32D.  I have a number of underwire Wacoal bras with foam cups that work very well for my size, but this bra is painful to wear.  When I first tried it on, I thought I would like it.  By the end of the day, I was regretting the purchase.  The wires are sized for a much larger framed person than would be able to wear a 32, so the wires dig up into the flesh under my armpits.  The bra is very pretty and the band size is consistent with my other Wacoal 32D bras.  The disproportionate length of the wires makes the bra too uncomfortable to wear.  I may try to return it, but I don't think I will be able to now that I have worn it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09161621", "1": "0.11088776", "3": "0.40327117", "4": "0.096258014", "6": "0.2930996"}}
