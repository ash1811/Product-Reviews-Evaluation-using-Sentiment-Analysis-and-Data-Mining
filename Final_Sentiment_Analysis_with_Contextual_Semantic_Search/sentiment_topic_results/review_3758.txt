{"text": "Wow, these are just SO comfortable to wear.  I've worn so many different kinds of shoes over the years.  A $400 pair of dress shoes may have some comfort when on your feet for ten hours, but these are just like walking on air.  I've put on a few pounds and my feet are not as forgiving as in my youth, but these are some of the most comfortable footwear I've ever worn!  In a weeks time I've had three strangers stop me and ask about them, and another two have said, they own 'em and yes, it isn't just me, these Merrell Jungle Mocs are truly comfortable.  I've never recommended shoes before, but I'd recommend considering these for real comfort.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06788599", "1": "0.16318706", "2": "0.16121301", "3": "0.2335764", "4": "0.15683238", "5": "0.1403436", "6": "0.076961525"}}
