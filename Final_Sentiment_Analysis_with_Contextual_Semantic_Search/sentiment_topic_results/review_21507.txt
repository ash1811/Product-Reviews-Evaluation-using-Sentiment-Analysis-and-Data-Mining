{"text": "I use 8 or 8 1/2 sneakers, wide width. I always have problems with sneakers because I have very flat feet- no arches. I hated to buy sneakers because it takes me a looong time to find one I can be comfortable with. I end up with painful ankles, knees and back. I have to admit I am overweight: 5 ft tall, 175 lbs., which doesn't help. My friend recommended Bloch Women's Dance Sneaker. I was reluctant at first because I have been disappointed time and again, but I know I can't give up. She suggested to get a larger size (it was also recommended online at Amazon). I don't find the price exorbitant because I have spent more than that looking for the right fit. I bought size 10.5 medium/average (Bloch doesn't come in wide) and kept my fingers crossed. It was fantastic! I didn't feel pain after a rigorous exercise! I would definitely RECOMMEND the Bloch sneakers to anyone! Be sure to order the correct size- it may not be easy to do because each person's feet are shaped differently. I got lucky! Maybe because I have wide feet and it's size 10.5, the shoes looked like a \"boat\" to me, but I didn't care- I'm after COMFORT. I'm debating buying another one to use outside, but my friend said it's strictly for dancing/exercise. The sneakers were delivered in good time and in good condition. I definitely recommend the Bloch sneakers for price, quality and timely delivery.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03795612", "1": "0.2490116", "2": "0.079687744", "3": "0.09981871", "4": "0.258853", "5": "0.17709051", "6": "0.09758225"}}
