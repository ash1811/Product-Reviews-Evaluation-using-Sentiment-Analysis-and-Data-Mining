{"text": "Seriously, they're socks. I can't get too excited about them for a review - the best part is that Amazon carries them and ships them straight to my house and I don't have to deal with \"Walmart people\" to get a decent pair of socks that don't cost an arm and a...foot.The ones Walmart sell have red Hanes logo, these are gray/silver. I don't know what that means. Other than that, I can't really tell the difference other than these are new, and my other pair are old enough to be tossed.Forklift upgrade to new!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.1034863", "3": "0.30370095", "4": "0.33832243", "5": "0.12242534", "6": "0.12582274"}}
