{"text": "I have really high arches and have tried several types of insoles. These are ok, but I had to go up two sizes from what the chart says about my shoe size to get the arch location in the correct spot. Luckily, I'd read the reviews here to know the sizing might be off, so I easily returned the ones that didn't fit my arch. I just trimmed the ones I kept to fit into my shoe. The same is true for me of sizing with Powerstep Pinnacle Maxx, which I prefer to these because of their higher arch. The Powersteps are also a bit more padded, but it's really the arch that makes the difference for me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07591808", "1": "0.21346904", "2": "0.198686", "3": "0.33031765", "4": "0.08071199", "5": "0.050704796", "6": "0.05019244"}}
