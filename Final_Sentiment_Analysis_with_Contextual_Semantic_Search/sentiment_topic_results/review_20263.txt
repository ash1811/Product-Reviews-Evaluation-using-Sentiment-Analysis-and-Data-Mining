{"text": "I was about to buy a cheap set of cedar shoe trees but these Allen Edmonds were just a few bucks more.  I bought one in XL and L since my shoes vary in width and also about a 1/2 size in length, depending on the shoe.  Well the sizing chart really is pretty good.  There is also some leeway in the design of the shoe since the front toe area is split in two.  I have no problem using any of these sizes for my 11-11.5, D and EEE dress shoes.  The smell of cedar is really a bonus but the real deal is that these trees flat out work.  Straightens out the creases in no time and keeps the shoes in top notch condition.  Highly recommended!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17132498", "1": "0.27611604", "2": "0.22174495", "3": "0.113730416", "4": "0.09436178", "6": "0.12037405"}}
