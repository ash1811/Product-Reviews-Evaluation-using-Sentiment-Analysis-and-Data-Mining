{"text": "This is perfect for someone looking for a basic watch. I'm outdoorsy and don't usually like wearing watches because of them catching on sleeves and such, but this is almost small enough to avoid that. My favorite things are that you have easy buttons, modes, and that the hourly alarm can be turned off, which was a major selling point for me (I hate beeping watches in classrooms or meetings...)The color isn't too bold, either, which is perfect because I'm generally not a pink kind of girl.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09824924", "1": "0.34060717", "2": "0.20215942", "4": "0.21831623", "6": "0.13456245"}}
