{"text": "Ordered for my 12 year old son, who wanted for airsoft games.  He loves them and they fit well.  He's a big 12 year old and I ordered an adult small.  They fit good in the waist, but are long - nothing a little hem won't fix.  Nice product and match all the other universal digital camouflage.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.42441168", "2": "0.040776733", "3": "0.1325295", "4": "0.046350464", "5": "0.28209904", "6": "0.06961948"}}
