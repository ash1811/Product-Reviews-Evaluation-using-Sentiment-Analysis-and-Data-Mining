{"text": "my baby started wearing them at 3 months (12 1/2lbs) and stop wearing them by the 4th month (14lbs).  He only used each bodysuit once or twice at most.  They are not height to weight proportionate.  Although they still fit around the belly, they do not fit lengthwise, so they keep pulling down and keep the chest/shoulders bare.I did like that they are thick, but unfortunately, they did not fit my baby for more than a couple of weeks.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.083160296", "1": "0.39980406", "2": "0.073802136", "3": "0.3446161", "5": "0.047569267", "6": "0.0473816"}}
