{"text": "First off I have had trouble finding rain boots for my 1 year old. I found these and I am so happy I will never look back. My son is a size 4. So I ordered a size 5. They fit beautifully, with room to grow. These boots are so well constructed and sturdy. These are better made than any rain boot Ive seen in any local retail store, adult included. The colors are brilliant. They were easy to put on. My son had no trouble walking in them. And the tread on these boots will make them useful in the mud and even snow. I am so happy. I will be buying Western Chief over and over as my son grows. So so pleased. Thank you for such a wonderful product!**Please note: all the bad reviews youve read, have come from 2011. Most of the 2013 reviews are outstanding!**Update: it is now the beginning of November 2013. And these boots are proving themselves, invaluable.  Every time my son wants to \"go\". He goes straight for these boots. They are still easy to slip on and off. They have been through many a rain puddle and mud and garden and chicken coops and rocks (just to name a few) hehe. They are holding up beautifully.  If I could add 10 stars I would. My 18mo son is now a size 5 and hes still only about 22lbs. And they still fit him perfectly. VERY HAPPY! Cant wait to buy more.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.15932891", "2": "0.055232946", "3": "0.2457981", "4": "0.2437922", "5": "0.22032228", "6": "0.0730966"}}
