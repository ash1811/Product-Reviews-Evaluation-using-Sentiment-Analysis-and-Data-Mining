{"text": "I own the the Waterproof Breathable Jacket - J175 -  as well as this one, and love this jacket more!  It has deeper pockets and seems more insulated. I feel like I am wearing a blanket, it's so warm! It also gives you a presence when you wear it - it has a great look!  I highly recommend this one.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.061091363", "1": "0.42333063", "2": "0.2649953", "3": "0.1583046", "4": "0.08199229"}}
