{"text": "My husband needed a work boot for around-the-yard heavy work and we were excited to find such a great deal!  These boots are extremely well-made and very comfortable. The fit is a bit large (he normally wears an 11 1/2, but we purchased an 11 per other customer recommendations.  The 1/2 size down was a perfect fit.  Non-skid sole has already been put to the test in a mud slick - two others went down, he didn't even slide.  Good, solid, dependable work boot - highly recommended!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.059709746", "1": "0.2311345", "2": "0.13048969", "3": "0.29915866", "4": "0.20531014", "5": "0.07147113"}}
