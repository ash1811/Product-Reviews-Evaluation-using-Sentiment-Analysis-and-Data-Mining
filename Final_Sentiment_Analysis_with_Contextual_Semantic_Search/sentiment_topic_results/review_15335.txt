{"text": "I wear my high-top chucks until they have holes everywhere so I know my size and style.  These were cheaper than the chucks on the converse website so I took a chance and am happy that I did.  They are the same ones I get every time, perfect size, perfect fit.  They are just as comfy as always, needing only one double-socked wear to break them in.  I love them. &#9829;", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.049118504", "1": "0.07431428", "2": "0.24810065", "3": "0.13356736", "4": "0.13842148", "5": "0.20219015", "6": "0.15428756"}}
