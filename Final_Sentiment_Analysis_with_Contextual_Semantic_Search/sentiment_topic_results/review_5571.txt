{"text": "The shirt sizing is good. And that's where the pro's of this shirt end.I didn't expect a whole lot at this price, but I got hosed on this one.I will tell you that the material is woven so thinly that the shirt is very close to being transparent. I haven't washed the shirt yet, and maybe I shouldn't. It seriously is what most would refer to being thread-bear. I have shirts 10 years old that have been worn and washed numerous times and they are in better shape than this shirt is new.I wouldn't take possession of the shirt again if it was free plus $25But that's me.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.2636211", "1": "0.14356428", "2": "0.08372721", "3": "0.15806857", "4": "0.10435469", "5": "0.09945673", "6": "0.14720747"}}
