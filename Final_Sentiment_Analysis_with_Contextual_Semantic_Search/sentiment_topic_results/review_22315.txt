{"text": "I have purchased Injinji socks before and loved them, so my expectations were high. These socks lived up to my expectations. These socks are very comfortable. Size small fit my size 7.5 feet perfectly. They are original regular weight (not lightweight). I like black color that goes with everything.  These socks feel like a very high quality product!Size info for for small size: men shoe size 5-7.5, women shoe size 6-8.5The socks reach about an inch above my ankle, they fit the toes very comfortably without loose material. I get blisters between my pinky and fourth toe when I walk, but I never get blisters when I wear these toe socks. They get even more comfortable after a couple of wearing as they seem to remember the shape to your toes.I am attaching a photos showing the socks on my feet.  I highly recommend these socks!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.089085266", "1": "0.3639641", "2": "0.12140659", "3": "0.061247252", "4": "0.06328266", "5": "0.14061493", "6": "0.16039924"}}
