{"text": "These are not work jeans; Don't buy them if you are looking for durable heavy duty jeans. They are also a slim fit jean, but not tight. I find them to be very comfortable with just enough style without being extravagant. They are also a great value, unlike some other jeans named after certain petroleum distillate. I also love that I can order my exact size, which is rarely available at dept stores. I ordered the &#34;Quartz&#34;, which I would consider indigo with a faded look resulting in depth and texture to the color. My only complaint is that the pockets aren't deep enough. I have a brick type smart phone (same size/shape as iphone) that fits, but if I sit down it pushes into my hip uncomfortably. I would still buy them again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09834176", "1": "0.37168592", "2": "0.058570743", "3": "0.054214407", "4": "0.1930192", "5": "0.12990367", "6": "0.094264284"}}
