{"text": "This is a basic sleep bra or lounging nursing bra or even not nursing.  It's super soft and comfy, and stretchy.  That's the purpose.  This is not for tons of support as you want to be comfortable enough to sleep in it.  Just enough to hold the girls.  Even when done nursing and if the girls remained large, in hot climates this helps keep sweating to the minimum.  Breathable cotton, and a touch of support to assist gravity from pulling them all the way down.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.105739065", "1": "0.049841467", "2": "0.109973006", "3": "0.4317997", "4": "0.10750943", "6": "0.19202013"}}
