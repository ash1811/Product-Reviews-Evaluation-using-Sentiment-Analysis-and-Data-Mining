{"text": "I bought this leotard for my daughter.  She's between size 6 and 7, so I ordered size I (6-8).  It is fine for the price.  The length is correct, but it doesn't fit her body all over the way her other leotards do.  In some areas, like near the armpits, it fits too loosely.The shell is made of 90% nylon and 10% Spandex.  The lining is 90% polyester and 10% Spandex.  My daughter has some cotton leotards, which I think are more comfortable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16982196", "1": "0.2304981", "2": "0.10257333", "3": "0.17488463", "4": "0.18381971", "5": "0.040030334", "6": "0.0983719"}}
