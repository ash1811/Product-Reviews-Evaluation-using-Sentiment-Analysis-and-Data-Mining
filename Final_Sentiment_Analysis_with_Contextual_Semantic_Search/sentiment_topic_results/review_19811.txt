{"text": "I wear this watch everyday no matter what I am wearing. It is just the right size for my small wrist. Most watches look to large not this one. The display is easy to read and of course the indiglo is a bonus.Just a follow up on the review that I originally gave. The watch is still going strong and I love it. It is a perfect fit for those of us who have small wrists. Great watch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12391403", "1": "0.09295195", "2": "0.28111264", "3": "0.26785737", "4": "0.11682736", "5": "0.1134679"}}
