{"text": "My son needed a &#34;big boy&#34; backpack to carry his IPad and binder for school.  This is a very durable pack, nice guy color with comfy straps and lots of pockets.  He is happy with it but did complain about the zipper flaps. (material covering the zippers) I just fold it back for him.  He was used to a flimsier, cheap backpack so this one is definitely a little stiffer.  I'm sure this pack can take a lot of years of heavy use.  The price was good compared to so many other packs I looked at that had a padded pocket for laptop or iPad.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.44008404", "2": "0.30489624", "3": "0.040637635", "4": "0.18468699", "5": "0.024468027"}}
