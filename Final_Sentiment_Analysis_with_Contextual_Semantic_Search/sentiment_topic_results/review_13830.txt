{"text": "There are a lot of reviews of this watch on Amazon. The positive ones reflect my experience so far.( about one month )Keep in mind that this watch is heavy and thick. This gives it a high center of gravity. It moves around on your wrist. ( It might be good for hitting a villain in the nose, however.)The 7s26  movement cannot be hand wound as with many other automatic watches. This means unless you wear it every day, you will have to reset the time, day, date each time you wear it. The movement does have a good reputation for durability. It has mixed reviews for accuracy, but my life is imprecise anyway.I'll  update this review in about 12 months.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24131207", "1": "0.038510602", "2": "0.21826659", "3": "0.10206051", "4": "0.10390941", "5": "0.24765405", "6": "0.048286762"}}
