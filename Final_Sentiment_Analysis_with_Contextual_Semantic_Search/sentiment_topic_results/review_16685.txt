{"text": "Last year we had the &#34;stiff&#34; version of these tap shoes made by the same company. They never did get them &#34;broken in&#34;. My daughter complained them constantly and never wanted to wear them. She always took them off during class. But, these shoes are nothing like that. They're very flexible and she never complains about these hurting her feet. They've broken in nicely. But, she never complained even when they were still new. I will buy this shoe again. Never going back to the &#34;stiff&#34; version!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2397971", "2": "0.17303771", "3": "0.09411596", "4": "0.16522111", "5": "0.26325363", "6": "0.061768297"}}
