{"text": "Although I haven't really put these jeans through the &#34;Ringer&#34; yet, they fit great.  I'm between a 34 & 35 Waist and it's just nice to be able to have a comfortable pair of jeans.  I know it wouldn't hurt if I lost 10Lbs either but until I do these are very nice.  Wish some of the other colors had this size in stock.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19333084", "1": "0.4256194", "3": "0.11473333", "6": "0.25092924"}}
