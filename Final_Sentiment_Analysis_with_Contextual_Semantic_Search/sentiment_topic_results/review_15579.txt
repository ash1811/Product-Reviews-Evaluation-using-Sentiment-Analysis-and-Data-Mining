{"text": "This shoe is fabulous. Nice soft lambskin leather. This pointy toe is the most comfortable. there is no discomfort when walking at all and i am 300lbs and the heel sustains me quite well. i wear size 11 with regular shoes and sandals but a 12 in closed to shoes. this is very sleek and professional an yet comfy and stylish enough to wear to church or to hang out.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13499033", "1": "0.16892655", "2": "0.26586324", "3": "0.15249997", "4": "0.123978324", "5": "0.07257029", "6": "0.081171304"}}
