{"text": "I can't say anything bad about these Crocs except maybe they a little more than what I would want to spend. They are great for kids. Easy on, easy off, waterproof, cushiony.

School and daycare have a no open-toe shoe policy so I buy these every spring for my kids.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.17727806", "2": "0.22912878", "3": "0.34036347", "5": "0.20934993", "6": "0.0359287"}}
