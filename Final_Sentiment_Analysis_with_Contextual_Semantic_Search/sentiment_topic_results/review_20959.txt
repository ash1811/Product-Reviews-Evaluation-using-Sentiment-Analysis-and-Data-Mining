{"text": "I got this ring very quickly from the seller. I was a little surprised to see that the color was more of a gunmetal color vs. a silvery color. It still is a nice ring for the price and material. However, I wanted a little more polish. My husband thought the Carbide material was \"cool\" though. I'm not sure if it fits larger, but it did on him. that is the difficulty with purchasing rings on line. Oh, and the domed/\"comfort fit\" was accurate. You may like this product. It was too borderline so back it went. The return process went smoothly, too. I would buy from this seller again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10125592", "1": "0.40534493", "2": "0.09912272", "4": "0.17308874", "5": "0.05996191", "6": "0.15871215"}}
