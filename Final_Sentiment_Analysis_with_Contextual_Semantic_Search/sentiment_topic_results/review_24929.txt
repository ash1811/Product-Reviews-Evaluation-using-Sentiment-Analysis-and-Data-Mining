{"text": "I have tried a hard plastic arch support that was too firm even under the insole for support of my narrow feet with high arches and they were seemingly too controlling for running. Some pronation is reasonable when running. The green superfeet  insole has a firm plastic support under 2/3s of the insole yet not near as firm as a plastic arch support or an orthotic. In addition, there are four openings in the plastic support that allows portions of the insole to come through providing more cushioning. The  great benefit is the relative light weight, not having an orthotic device under an insole and the fact that all though relatively firm initially, they break in and feel comfortable. I wear a size 10 and the size E fit my shoe perfectly without trimming. They are not  over controlling allowing some benefit of the normal slight roll that is natural when running, which I think is a great benefit. Well worth the purchase, I'll buy another set as the need arises but they do last a long time.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1371496", "1": "0.11068313", "2": "0.115108974", "3": "0.19287808", "4": "0.24153258", "5": "0.14476517", "6": "0.05788249"}}
