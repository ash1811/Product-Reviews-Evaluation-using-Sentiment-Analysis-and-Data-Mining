{"text": "First of all if you have a short torso and small boobs than this outfit is for you. This is not really made for women whose cup size is C or larger. Don't get me wrong it's a cute outfit but again if you are big busted there is no way you can fit in the top part and it's really meant for somebody who has a short torso. I really don't like the way it's made but otherwise it's cute but just not on me. When I modeled it for my friend he liked it but said that I wasn't &#34;comfortable in it&#34; I agreed and promptly re-gifted it to somebody else.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08181853", "1": "0.23672354", "2": "0.16199742", "3": "0.14488418", "4": "0.22467893", "5": "0.061634395", "6": "0.088263"}}
