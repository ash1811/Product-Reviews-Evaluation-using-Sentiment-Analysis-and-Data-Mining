{"text": "These heel adhesives are life-savers when it comes to ending irritation from back-of-the-shoe friction.  They are soft and cushy, and fit snugly with a strong adhesive.  They also work wonders if the shoes in question are just a tad loose.  One word of caution: don't use these on shoes that are already very snug or tight, because they do take up some real estate, and may make your shoes unwearable if they are already small!  Other than that, however, I highly recommend them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03279443", "1": "0.24793038", "2": "0.2165445", "3": "0.16351368", "4": "0.13144037", "6": "0.20451528"}}
