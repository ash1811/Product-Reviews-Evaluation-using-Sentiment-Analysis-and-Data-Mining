{"text": "I really like my Gildan shirts.  I got light blue and a pink one later, and neither was  more intense than shown....altho it was a while ago, I think the blue one might have been a bit lighter than I expected, but definitely not darker or more intense.I got XL which is often tight for me in ladies shirts (I am cursed with a gut problem and thin hips so men's shirts are OK but often have that \"tight\" spot across the breast. ) but was surprised to find this shirt runs big and the xl fit perfectly, non tailored, loose but not baggy, definitely a women's shirt  as a men's shirt of similar fit would have that fatal tight breast zone, requireing some strategic stretching.The COtton is very soft when you first unwrap the shirt, and medium weight. With no fabric softener it was a bit rougher after washing.  You can't see through the shirt, so I guess it is not \"shear\".  It is NOT a sexy, hourglass shaped, clinging to every curve, short short ladies t shirt.  I buy men's and ladie's t's, so for me this is not such a shock as for other shoppers. I would like a shorter sleeve, but other than that this is a loose fitting normal t shirt, long enough to tuck in if you choose, but hitting in a fairly attractive part of your hips for wearing out...ie, not the fattest part, but not showing your waist or butt cleavage if you have to bend over.It is possibly a bit too unisex for some t shoppers, but I can get away with this under a jacket in Court, so don't knock it.I have never had to return a Gildan shirt for it being too small or too big or any other problem. This model is loose and only slightly tailored for the ladies, but still attractive, especially with the sleeves shortened a bit or rolled up.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.024962448", "1": "0.43825468", "2": "0.05076482", "3": "0.10800052", "4": "0.14201353", "5": "0.04708868", "6": "0.1889153"}}
