{"text": "The quality of this product is good as one would expect for Lee brand jeans. The color is as pictured. The fit was right-on. Delivery was prompt, and the price was good.  I was especially excited to find the odd 29&#34; length available. My jeans usually ride low so the cuffs drag the ground. With the inch shorter length, these fit perfectly.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.107352756", "1": "0.4164589", "3": "0.09544156", "5": "0.21377063", "6": "0.15922923"}}
