{"text": "At a 40D in Playtex Land, the bra is a little large.  I haven't usually worn Playtex bras as their sizing is so very different than other bras.  I generally wear, in most brands, a 38DD.  I thought if I went up a band size and down a cup size, I'd have the perfect bra.  Well, the cups pucker a bit with this experiement.  Still, the bra would be okay under bulky sweaters, so I am keeping it.  I have since tried on the 40C version of this bra, and it fits much better, although still not 100% T-shirt worthy.  I'm still getting it, it's close enough.  This does do a good job of lifting, which is pretty darned impressive with no wires.  Love the comfort and has re-introduced me to Playtex, in general, which I'm finding makes a very decent bra at a great price...just be sure to go to Playtex and see their sizing chart.  You won't be the same size as you've been anywhere else that I've come across so far.  But, hey....the bras fit no matter what the size is called, and buying a few won't break the bank.
