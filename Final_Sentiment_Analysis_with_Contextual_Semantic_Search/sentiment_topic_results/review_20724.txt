{"text": "Timex Kids' Color Indiglo Hearts Stretch Band Watch #T7B111 - I have been wearing these kids' watches during the summer for several years. They are inexpensive and have cloth straps, so when the straps wear out, I feel no regret about tossing them and buying replacements. I got several in different colors to coordinate with my wardrobe. When the weather cools off, I put them away until next summer. They've been very reliable and easy and cheap to get the batteries repaired, including at Wal-Mart.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.1400727", "2": "0.29588145", "4": "0.21459378", "5": "0.16402923", "6": "0.17956036"}}
