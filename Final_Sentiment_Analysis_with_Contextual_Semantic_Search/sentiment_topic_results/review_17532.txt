{"text": "I bought this watch but not at K-MART, I like it very much, it has the quality of a $100 watch, I'll match it up with one and this Casio can compare to it for 2/3 off that price!  If you have very large wrists this is the watch for you as the band is very long.  One thing I would like to say is that the photo does not do this watch justice, in the photo it looks plain ugly but when you get it in person you'll feel much better about it.  It's a great deal for the price and the quality is something to admire as well.  The 10 year battery can't be beat not to mention it being 10BAR.  Casio makes great inexpensive watches and I've had one ever since I was a kid, I hope they keep up the great work into the future.Dial is extremely easy to read I've had watches in the past that cost $200 that wren't as clear to read as this one!  I don't know how Casio does it but they do, much much better than their competitors which I need not name.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.38761654", "2": "0.21983427", "3": "0.22907843", "4": "0.08507172", "6": "0.07287317"}}
