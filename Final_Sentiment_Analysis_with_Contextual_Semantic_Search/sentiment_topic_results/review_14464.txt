{"text": "I've worn Rockport Men's Margin Oxford shoes in various colors for many years. I'm delighted Amazon now carries them. This shoe is as comfortable and foot-supporting as your favorite running shoe, but they're stylish enough I can wear them to work at the office. When I know appearance is especially critical, I may switch to a more formal-looking shoe, but these are my everyday go-to shoes. Fit was perfect. They're so comfortable, I wore them to work the next day, right out of the box, no break-in necessary. Highly recommended!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09260279", "1": "0.16489345", "2": "0.24328525", "3": "0.08353543", "4": "0.25533462", "5": "0.09682265", "6": "0.0635258"}}
