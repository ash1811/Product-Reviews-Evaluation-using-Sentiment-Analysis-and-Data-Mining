{"text": "I've  been wanting some new slippers for quite a while.  Up to this point, I have not had good luck finding any slippers that fit me well or that I can say that I truly liked.  The Acorn Polar slippers, however, are the best slippers I've owned so far.  When I first put them on, they were a little too snug, but after breaking them in, they now fit just about right.  I like the fact that they don't flop around on my feet too much, something all of my other previous slippers have done.  There is some slippage on the heel, but it is not as annoying yet as other slippers I've owned.  I don't wear them with socks, however, and I do have very narrow feet, so I'm a little hard to fit.  Time will tell how these will hold up over time, so I can't address that just yet, but they appear to be made pretty well.  I expect to get quite a bit of use out of them.  The main thing is, they beat wearing socks around the house and they keep my feet nice and toasty.  Overall, I think the Acorns are very decent deal and I think I've finally found some slippers that I'm going to be satisfied with.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05349479", "1": "0.21974826", "2": "0.07742412", "3": "0.22195742", "4": "0.12680565", "5": "0.059709642", "6": "0.2408601"}}
