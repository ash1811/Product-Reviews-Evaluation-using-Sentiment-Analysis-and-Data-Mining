{"text": "I'm hard on a watch and the primary reason I still wear one, is that I love the alarm feature.  It's an old fashioned analog alarm that rings every hour or every 12-hours, depending on how you set the stem.  Nice loud chime and it lights up at night, to boot.  I've had more sophisticated and much more expensive watches, but this one suits my simple needs.  I can set the alarm using the outer ring or the setting stem.  It's easier to gauge time in 5 minute or even 20 minute intervals, unlike how a digital watch works.  Water resistant and very durable, I usually end up buying a new one in 2-3 years, even before the battery wears out.  I tend to scratch the crystal and I rub off most of the ring detail in that time.  Then, I just buy a new one and change out the expandable wrist strap I prefer to the leather band that comes with it.  I don't go diving with this watch, but it gets wet a lot and I never worry about dropping it or losing it.  No other watch works the same way - I like this one!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1254371", "1": "0.21926007", "2": "0.20760942", "3": "0.1166447", "4": "0.15315486", "5": "0.050597403", "6": "0.12729646"}}
