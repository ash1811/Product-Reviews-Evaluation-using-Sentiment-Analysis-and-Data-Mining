{"text": "Having wide feet and arthritis makes it difficult to find comfortable shoes - but these are amazing!  I purchased them in white micro fiber stretch, extra wide - I can actually wear these for a day out running errands and forget I have them on!  They are easy to clean with a damp cloth and a bit of Comet.  When they were really dirty, I put them in a gentle cycle with cold water and set them in the sun to dry.  I found that the laces were a bit too short to tie loosely (with swollen feet) so I purchased longer ones.
