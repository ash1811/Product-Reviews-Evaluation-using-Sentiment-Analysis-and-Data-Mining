{"text": "This is an elegant watch and looks much better in person than in photos. It is classic and basic, but beautiful in its simplicity and easy readability. It looks good even at black tie functions and could be mistaken for a watch costing 10x as much. Keeps time as well as expensive watches. It is thin and light and the band is an extension of the simple watch. The basic black and white theme carries throughout. I do not even know I have it on it is so light. I like Casio and Timex watches and this one is a real winner. The fact that I can wear it in the shower and it dries very fast is an added bonus. It is water resistent.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08760949", "1": "0.18563673", "2": "0.23262526", "3": "0.13540913", "4": "0.09580443", "5": "0.07657036", "6": "0.18634458"}}
