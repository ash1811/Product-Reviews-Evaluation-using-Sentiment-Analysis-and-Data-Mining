{"text": "I bought a pair of Acorn Polar Moc, the day I tried them on, I convinced my husband to get a pair for himself too.  The shoes were shipped on time.  My husband loves them! His regular shoe size is 10 to 10.5, he bought size Large. Since he likes to have a little extra room for slippers, the large size fits him perfectly.  The shoes are very cushiony.  They don't really provide much arch support for people with high arch, but my husband says they are good for his flat feet.  All in all, IMHO they are perfect indoor shoes for cold winters...", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.059033766", "1": "0.19380552", "2": "0.096678935", "3": "0.39838356", "4": "0.14179221", "5": "0.053647906", "6": "0.056658138"}}
