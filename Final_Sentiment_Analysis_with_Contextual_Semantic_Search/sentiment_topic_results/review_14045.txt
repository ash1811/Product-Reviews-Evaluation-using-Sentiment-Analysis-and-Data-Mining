{"text": "I gave this watch a 2 after owning it for almost 2 years.  The watch out of the box worked great for about 6-7 months then stopped running. I have always been careful to be sure the watch was in plenty of light to stay running. The watch has been in water but no deeper than 20 ft. If I hold the watch directly under a lamp the second hand will move but as soon as I remove from the direct light it stops.  The watch is under warranty but when reading the warranty instructions I tried to contact one of the locations listed only to find out that it no longer serviced Citzen watches. I did find one location that would service but I had to pay shipping both ways and might have incurred a charge for any work not covered by the warranty. Additionally if the watch was unrepairable they would not send a replacement watch. It is a shame because I really like the watch but currently it is just sitting on my desk until I find a way to inexpensively get it repaired.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07754492", "1": "0.14980273", "2": "0.40259215", "3": "0.06797197", "4": "0.1392936", "5": "0.12320062", "6": "0.039593972"}}
