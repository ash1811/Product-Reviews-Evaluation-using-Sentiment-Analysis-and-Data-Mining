{"text": "I was discussing survival techniques with an Army officer who recommended Thorlo socks for warmth. I bought some for that purpose, for power outages, cold Winter weather, etc., and never have wanted any other kind since. They last for years and I wear them every day, Winter and Summer, usually without shoes since I work from home, sometimes with shoes on 3-mile walks. These are everything I want in a sock. I highly recommend them.Be careful to choose the right color.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.28237596", "2": "0.20877776", "3": "0.14561981", "4": "0.09327748", "5": "0.15319641", "6": "0.11382964"}}
