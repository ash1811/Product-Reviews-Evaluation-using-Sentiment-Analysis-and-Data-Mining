{"text": "I've bought men's jeans in a size 30-34 depending on how I would like them to fit.  I bought a 32 because I wanted them to be a little loose but not have that fully relaxed look.  Maybe I don't remember how 501's fit but these are more like a 30 and won't fit over my thighs.  My goal is to lose weight...lol, but I didn't want these to be tight jeans so I'm a bit disappointed.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.35719192", "2": "0.11041852", "3": "0.21508168", "5": "0.15341972", "6": "0.15589513"}}
