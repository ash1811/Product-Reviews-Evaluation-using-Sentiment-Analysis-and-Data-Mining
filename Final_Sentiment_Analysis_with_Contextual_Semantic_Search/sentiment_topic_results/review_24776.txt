{"text": "These are great. Generic (no brand tags) but high quality. Nice thickness of cotton (very thick). Pretty soft. Not basketball length, but a little long.One reviewer mentioned that they shrink so you should buy a larger size. I bought the XL navy ones. They shrunk a little, but are a little bit baggy on me. The waist can stretch pretty wide.I ordered a L black (my real size). They shrunk a little, but they fit great. That is a great size for me.Incidentally, the shorts are labeled 100% cotton, but there is stretchy material in the waistband, so for some reason our laws allow cotton products to contain some stretchy material.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10740826", "1": "0.29761285", "2": "0.013698562", "3": "0.19627777", "4": "0.19362098", "5": "0.114333324", "6": "0.07704823"}}
