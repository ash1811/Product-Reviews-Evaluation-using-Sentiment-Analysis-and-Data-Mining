{"text": "I usually take XL but wanted some extra space so I ordered an XXL.It fit like a medium or large, too tight so I figured I'll it to sleep in. Next day was getting dressed and if I wear it underneath a blousy top it wouldnt matter since it being tight wouldnt make a difference, SO WRONG! One of the straps came torn in the middle of one strap, leaving it hanging by the front and back so I can no longer use it to sleep but I cant use it period. The material iscrap. I would think twice if your interested in purchasing. I did get a refund tho. But I really  needed tanks and had planned on ordering more. :(", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14783153", "1": "0.28804737", "2": "0.13004811", "3": "0.1415112", "4": "0.05900984", "5": "0.12875511", "6": "0.1047968"}}
