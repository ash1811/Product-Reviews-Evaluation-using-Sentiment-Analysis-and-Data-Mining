{"text": "Normally I'm not a huge flip flop person and certainly not for walking a lot. But these are absolutely wonderful. I've had one pair for several years and have only just worn them out. I have walked across lava beds in these, so they are definitely sturdy. They mold to your feet beautifully after 15 minutes of walking or so and provide support and comfort even for fairly long days walking around. I generally hate toe thongs and they rub my feet raw, but that never happens with these even after walking all day in them. I can't recommend these enough. They are more comfortable than even the more expensive sturdier ones offered.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07717538", "1": "0.24836785", "2": "0.15718254", "3": "0.18281183", "4": "0.10829082", "5": "0.146922", "6": "0.07924957"}}
