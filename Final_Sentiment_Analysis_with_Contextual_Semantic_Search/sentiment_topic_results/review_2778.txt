{"text": "Quick delivery brought my much needed white keds to me. I had my old pair for 7 years and they were falling apart. These are my favorites and I love the new keds logo showing on the side of the shoe rather than on the back. Very cool for keds! What else can I say, for 40 years +, keds classics have been there. I couldn't wait as a 7th grader back in the &*$@'s for my first pair and ditching those orthopedic white oxfords saddle shoes! Oh happy day! Been wearing them ever since. Now they come in a rainbow of colors (and new styles, too) but the white keds will always be a classic in my wardrobe!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04023192", "1": "0.12673578", "2": "0.18883961", "3": "0.2194792", "4": "0.13103549", "5": "0.20093742", "6": "0.09274061"}}
