{"text": "Pros: I love the line of 4 hook-and-eyes at the back - it's really supportive and doesn't pinch. I wish all bras were so well-constructed.Cons: The band runs a touch big and the cups are easily two sizes larger than expected. My 34DD - my typical size - was almost comical in size - the box in which it arrived was huge. The bra itself looked like a piece of furniture. Also, the cups pointed slightly outward - like chameleon eyes. This may have been a function of the poor fit.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.2534095", "1": "0.2059103", "2": "0.043748237", "3": "0.2831894", "4": "0.08829931", "5": "0.036693823", "6": "0.08874947"}}
