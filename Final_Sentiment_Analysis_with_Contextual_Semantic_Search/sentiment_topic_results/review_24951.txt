{"text": "(this is more of a review for the BLUE superfeet which accommodates for people with flatter feet)Oh my goodness, where to even begin. Let me first start off by saying I work in security and sometimes I stand on my feet for upwards to 12+ hours. I wore some crappy Dr. Scholl's stuff I found at CVS or something, and they didn't really help at all. These things are a miracle. Upon reading reviews and watching videos about this product on youtube, I found out that the most important thing is the HEEL on these superfeet products, then the arch. Your HEEL must fit correctly in the heel cup. I read on their website that if the heel is too small for your foot go up one size. I'm size 11 shoe but I got the 11.5-13 or whatever it is to accommodate since I kinda have flat feet. Also, I got the blue because again, I have somewhat flat feet. There's still an arch but it fits perfectly for me. I feel the green one would have been way too much of an arch. I simply ripped out the default insole on my boots and trimmed the blue superfeet the same size and put them in and it was set. They are amazing. No more pain in the ankles, knees, and feet after work, at least it's not close to being as bad as it was before superfeet. I will buy this product over and over again.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.029044295", "1": "0.14155795", "2": "0.21205503", "3": "0.17985602", "4": "0.11089135", "5": "0.16011482", "6": "0.16648056"}}
