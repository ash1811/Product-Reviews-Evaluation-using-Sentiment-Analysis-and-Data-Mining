{"text": "I absolutely love this bra.  There is zero show through, and it fits seamlessly.  Wear the nude color under your tightest white top and you still won't see the bra or what's beneath it.  It's padded for support, not for size (at least on the larger cup sizes).  Support is unparalleled, and it's very comfortable.  It's by far the best bra I own.The best part is that it comes in a wide variety of cup sizes, many of which you (unfortunately) won't find through Victoria's Secret or other common retailers.  Very highly reccomended!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.028407194", "1": "0.17312294", "2": "0.13388732", "3": "0.3202092", "4": "0.17254743", "5": "0.1455906", "6": "0.026235335"}}
