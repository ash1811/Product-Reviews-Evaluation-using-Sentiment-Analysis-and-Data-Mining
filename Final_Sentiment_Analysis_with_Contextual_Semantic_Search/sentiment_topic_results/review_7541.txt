{"text": "I bought this shirt for my husband to take family photos in a casual outdoor session.  It is a nice shirt.  Soft and moves nicely.  I love the color it is pretty true to the photo (burgundy).  It fits nicely he is true to a large size.  There is nice range of motion in the shoulders/arms.  It seems durable and like it would stand the test of time if he were to do yardwork etc in it.  I really like it and would order more in the future.  Great price.  Amazon can't be beat!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16249132", "1": "0.5222502", "4": "0.11763355", "5": "0.10257107", "6": "0.0893226"}}
