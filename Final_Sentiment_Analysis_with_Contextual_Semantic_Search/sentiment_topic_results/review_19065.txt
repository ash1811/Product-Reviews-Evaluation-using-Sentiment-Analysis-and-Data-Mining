{"text": "Well ill tell you what happen,  I work in Afghanistan and came home for R&R after 3 months.  My wife is always surprising me one way or another when picking me up at the airport.  This time I walked out to the parking lot and she was standing waiting for me wearing a knee high Jacket.  My first though was &#34;God I miss her&#34;  Second though was &#34;aww I guess she didnt do anything special for me this time&#34;  That was untill I got about 10 feet from her and she opened up the jacket and was wearing this!!  Now when I tell you I got excited to see her thats just an under statement!  I was speechless!!  I love my wife and I hope she never stops doing these crazy things for me!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09500431", "1": "0.10533375", "2": "0.24451405", "3": "0.08206772", "4": "0.3079885", "6": "0.16266589"}}
