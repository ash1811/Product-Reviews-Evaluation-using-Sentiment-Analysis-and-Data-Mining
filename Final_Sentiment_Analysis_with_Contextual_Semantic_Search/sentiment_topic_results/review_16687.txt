{"text": "I purchased these sneakers for my wife, ordering 1/2 size larger as recommended  by other reviewers. They were promptly delivered. My wife loved the looks and feel of them. Unfortunately they were too small. I returned them to seller as instructed. That is when I realized that they did not come from Amazon. I requested a larger size or refund. The seller credited my charge card minus 7.50 restocking fee. I contacted seller and told them they were not at fault for the sneakers being too small, but I should not be charged a restocking fee because they could not send me the right size. I got a &#34;sorry, but too bad&#34; reply from them.  So beware, when purchasing from this seller,  They do not have free return shipping.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15454891", "1": "0.14401083", "2": "0.1677863", "3": "0.23145078", "4": "0.13108623", "6": "0.16859537"}}
