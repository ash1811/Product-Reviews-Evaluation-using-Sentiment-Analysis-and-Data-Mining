{"text": "I bought this shoe(9.5 W, chocolate nu buck) because of glowing tributes on this and other sites. The shoe felt great on trying it on initially. I agree with other reviewers that the supplied thin PU insole is laughably thin, and non supportive, creating a false aura of roominess and comfort which does not stand up to(pun intended) prolonged non-recumbency. It DOES NOT have the ADIPRENE insoles that most other Rockports do. The unusually THICK TONGUE covers most of the dorsum (Top) of the foot....and competes for room...you have to open up the laces wide to accommodate it, or your arch top will start hurting. I tried a comfort insole, but it left little room for my toes. I banished the shoe to the back of my rack. Recently(after 3 months), I revisited the shoe, and remembered my previous travails. I trashed the insole first. Then I progressively stuffed paper napkins into the toe and ball area, leaving it overnight for a few days, to stretch it. Finally I equipped it with a my favorite spenco insoleSpenco Polysorb Cross Trainer, Women's 9-10 / Men's 8-9. So, after a few days of foot & heartache, and a few hours daily D&C; (dilatation and curettage), the shoe is very usable and comfortable for my 12-18 hour duties as a physician. In the mean time, I discovered and am using a pair ofClarks Men's Wave.Tract Lace Upwhich are very comfortable and supportive without any modifications for my purpose of prolonged walking and standing.Addendum: some musings after 18 months of occasional use: 1/6/1014,I have worn this shoe about 50-60 times, and they look and feel great. It has a wide flat platform, and is great/stable for standing, but not as good as some other more modern designs for prolonged walking. The nubuck leather (color is more medium tan rather than chocolate as advertised) has maintained its finish, thanks in part to initial treatment withKiwi Suede and Nubuck Protector, 4.25 ozand occasional use ofKiwi Suede Nubuck CleanerI reach out for these shoes when I want a tan colored shoe that I will wear all day. They fit a little high around the anke, and I tend to use them more in spring and fall, when it is not rainy. With my sporadic use, and some TLC it seems they will last forever.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.057210945", "1": "0.08301607", "2": "0.28238204", "3": "0.17581746", "4": "0.060755238", "5": "0.1185208", "6": "0.22229742"}}
