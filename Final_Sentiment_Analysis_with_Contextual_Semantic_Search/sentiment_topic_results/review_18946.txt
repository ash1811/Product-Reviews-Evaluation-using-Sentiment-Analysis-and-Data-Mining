{"text": "As a tall fit person, it is very hard for me to find jeans that shows my form without being too tight and uncomfortable. I have worn Levi's 511 skinny jeans my entire life and my experience has been great. However now that I am older, my taste for skinny jeans has gone away and I decided to look at other models from Levi's for a more comfortable slim fit. Since it is hard to judge online, I went to my local Sears to try on different designs to see how the fit and comfort were. After trying many different ones, I came across this product the 514's. The fit is quiet amazing, the waist and thigh area has a slim fit but as you go down, the pants become much more loose, giving you more comfort and leg room. The designers did a great job creating jeans that are very comfortable but also has a great slim fit appearance.Now, nothing is perfect. Even though the appearance and fit is great, the durability is very poor. I wear jeans almost everyday and over a month I have worn these pants probably about 6 or 7 times casually. I did not put these jeans under any rough usage, however the pants started to tear and opened up around the groin area. At first I thought it was a defective pair, so I went and exchanged for another. However I experienced the same situation with the new pair and decided to just move on.I do believe these are great pair of jeans for someone who is just looking for jeans for the weekend, however if you are someone looking for an everyday pair of jeans, I would advise you skip this one.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.0957935", "1": "0.3260774", "2": "0.16529663", "3": "0.037201248", "4": "0.18201849", "5": "0.055342663", "6": "0.13827008"}}
