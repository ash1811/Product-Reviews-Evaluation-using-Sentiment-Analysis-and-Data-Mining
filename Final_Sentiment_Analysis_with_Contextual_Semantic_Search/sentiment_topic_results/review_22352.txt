{"text": "We were keeping bandaid company in business bandaging every toe due to my hubby's bad feet causing blisters whether it was golf, working, exercise equipment...you name it.  He started a new job on his feet for entire shift...walking.  First day home, blisters even with bandaids and new socks made for the man on his feet..  We put our heads together and looked for something that would separate the toes and here we are..... a sock with toes.  Tried one pair as didn't have much faith in item.  Well, guess what...three months later and 6 more pair of these socks....NO BLISTERS.  So far only one pair got a hole after two times wearing them.  Returned them and new pair sent.  Anyone with &#34;bad&#34; feet should try these.  Very satisfied.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14488818", "1": "0.26653305", "2": "0.1624171", "3": "0.14654589", "4": "0.09626356", "5": "0.14873211", "6": "0.034620065"}}
