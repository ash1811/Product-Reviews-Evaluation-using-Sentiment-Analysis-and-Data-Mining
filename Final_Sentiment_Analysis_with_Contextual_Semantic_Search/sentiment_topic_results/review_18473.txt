{"text": "I've been wanting these forever but they are so expensive in certain colors. I finally found the pink on sale! I absolutely love them! I usually wear an 8.5 in most athletic shoes but I ordered these in an 8 and the fit is great. I also have a slightly wide foot and I was worried about the width but fear not, they are fine.I recommend these for anyone looking for a comfy casual shoe. I am a happy camper!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06804324", "1": "0.23695305", "2": "0.119561635", "3": "0.11337978", "4": "0.2285249", "5": "0.14955066", "6": "0.08398675"}}
