{"text": "This is a great swim diaper. Unlike the disposables which come up way to high, this hits right at the belly button. The snaps on the side make removal a little easier.  It has just a little bit of absorbency which is perfect in case of pee on the way to the pool. It fits my slim 14 month old perfectly although some reviewers have noted that these are too snug on the legs. These seem to have better construction than disposables and I believe they'd likely contain waste better although we haven't had that situation yet. Overall, I would buy these again.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11165573", "1": "0.15245928", "3": "0.15419126", "4": "0.14835021", "5": "0.1896854", "6": "0.24103631"}}
