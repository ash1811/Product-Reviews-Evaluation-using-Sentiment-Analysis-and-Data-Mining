{"text": "This jacket is a different style than some of the other carhartt's such as the camo series that hasn't been around a long time.  The hood on this was a couple inches shorter than the other carhartt I purchased.  It doesn't quit cover the face, so sent it back.  I haven't run in to that style hood since the 90's when carhartt was cut smaller.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.055990074", "1": "0.4085245", "2": "0.16750146", "3": "0.11635596", "4": "0.17587608", "6": "0.07080283"}}
