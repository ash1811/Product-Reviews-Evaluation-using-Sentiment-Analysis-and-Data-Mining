{"text": "THE UGGS ARE GREAT. WELL MADE AND VER COMFORTABLE TO WEAR. THEY RUN A LITTLE SMALL. I WEAR A 10 1/2 USUALLY SO I GOT AN 11. WITHOUT SOCKS THEY FIT PERFECTLY, WITH SOCKS, A LITTLE TIGHT. THAT BEING SAID, WHEN THE SHEARLING PILE INSIDE THE SLIPPER COMPRESSES A BIT,THE SLIPPER WILL ENLARGE A FULL SIZE, SO AN 11 FITS LIKE A TRUE 11. IF YOU PLAN TO WEAR THEM WITH SOCKS, I WOULD GET A SIZE LARGER THAN YOU NORMALLY WEAR.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.067296736", "1": "0.26687607", "2": "0.12230632", "3": "0.17190567", "4": "0.11502533", "5": "0.18718989", "6": "0.06939998"}}
