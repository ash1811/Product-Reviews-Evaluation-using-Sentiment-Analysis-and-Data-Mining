{"text": "This watch is tried and true. It is beautiful, functional, and sturdy. The back-issue is inconvenient but not a deal breaker. I've been wanting this watch for years but have waited to the cost was better. Wal-Mart is $68 plus tax, this is a good price as the watch was $78 just a few months ago. I recommend this watch.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.120501205", "1": "0.19417746", "2": "0.31253394", "3": "0.19838125", "4": "0.047588233", "6": "0.12203989"}}
