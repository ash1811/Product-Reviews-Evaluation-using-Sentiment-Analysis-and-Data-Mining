{"text": "These fit perfectly and have just the right amount of material around each toe to feel comfy. I am size 13-14 US and have rather wide feet, and these socks fit me fine. My Girlfriend wore a pair earlier and she says they fit her just fine, and her feet are significantly smaller than mine, so they have a great range of fit!I wear these when I wear my Vibram Five-Fingers KSO for Men... Highly Recommended for use whit Vibram Products.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.062444426", "1": "0.23118205", "2": "0.14085467", "3": "0.26158974", "4": "0.06257835", "5": "0.17590745", "6": "0.065443285"}}
