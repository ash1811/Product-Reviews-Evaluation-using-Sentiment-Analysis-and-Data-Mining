{"text": "I purchased 3 pairs of KEEN sandals, all 3 different styles. Of the three, this is the only one I must return. I hesitate to evaluate shoes for anyone else unless I'm talking about quality because I have lots of foot problems and very difficult to fit feet. I have plantar fasciitis, get cramps in my legs, feet and toes, have a narrow heel, bunions and hammertoes. The arch in the shoe, for me, seemed misplaced -- it was more forward, toward my toes and uncomfortable. Also the top was a little tight for me. Sometimes my foot swims in a medium width shoe, but not this one. Since I didn't wear it, I cannot talk about the quality. I'm enjoying the other pairs and can tell that they are more comfortable than the tennis shoes or clogs I usually wear. I'm happy I finally found this brand!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.028110644", "1": "0.30835646", "2": "0.16727047", "3": "0.18240862", "4": "0.19790623", "5": "0.060610265", "6": "0.055337347"}}
