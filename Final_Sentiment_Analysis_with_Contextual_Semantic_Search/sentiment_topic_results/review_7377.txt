{"text": "I own many different brands of work wear and I won't say Riggs is absolutely awful I will tell you there is better out there. Dickies, Carhartt and Walls are all better then Riggs. Riggs pants tend to run smaller then the other brands so they're not gonna fit as well. Plus you can really feel a difference in the construction and material. I would recommend you spend the little extra for the better made garment.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.042185742", "1": "0.29282045", "2": "0.12702885", "3": "0.23547965", "4": "0.21328047", "6": "0.08579321"}}
