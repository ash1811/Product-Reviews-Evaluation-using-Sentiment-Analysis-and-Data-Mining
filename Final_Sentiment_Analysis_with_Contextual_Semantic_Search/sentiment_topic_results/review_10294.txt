{"text": "The watch is actually 12mm thick per Tissot's website, not 10mm as listed by Amazon. The watch clasp is somewhat bulky as well. For these reasons, the watch interfered with my shirt cuffs too much. Also, the case is very shiny/polished, not matte as it appeared to me on the Amazon and Tissot websites. Otherwise, the watch looks very nice. Packaging looked new.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13716759", "1": "0.14339098", "2": "0.26229775", "3": "0.11611912", "4": "0.29985073", "6": "0.03730341"}}
