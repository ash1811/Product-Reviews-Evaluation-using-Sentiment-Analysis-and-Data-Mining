{"text": "It's clear that they put some thought and research into this hat.  I have had a few of these and this one is the best.  It is very light, which is nice.  It is very flexible: back-flap down or up, brim up or down, string down or up.  The use of velcro for the back flap makes it very easy to put it up, too.  If there is a downside it is that as light as it is, it still doesn't breath as well as a straw hat or even a cotton/natural material, so in 90 degree heat your head can get a little sweaty.  Overall, though, if you want to keep your head out of the sun, this one will do it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.14980216", "2": "0.094456114", "3": "0.2890612", "4": "0.21477799", "5": "0.11017942", "6": "0.13890816"}}
