{"text": "Not much point in going on too long. I wanted a nice pair of driving mocs and after looking at a bunch on Amazon I ordered these. The reviews mentioned that they were sized a bit small so I order a half size large. That works great as a wearing/driving moc, but if I wanted to wear them as slippers it would still be a half size too large. That is my only complaint! Otherwise they look great, feel great, and are very well made. A good value for a great moc.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2186557", "1": "0.2469998", "3": "0.38452724", "4": "0.035157662", "5": "0.04246798", "6": "0.06920531"}}
