{"text": "This is truly a very good watch.  Ability to keep time in 3 time zones (1 analog and 2 in digital window) is helpful. Rotating bezel is a live saver when leaving car on metered parking or any time when you are on a tight schedule.  It also looks good.  I would have liked it better without the compass markings on the bezel, as they are quite useless in a daily life, but clutter the watch face with extra markings.Cons:1. No back light. Really Casio?  Really?  You give me compass in case i get lost in a wilderness some bright sunny day, but dont give me back light so I can check time in the darkness, that comes to my part of the earth on a daily basis?2. Casio makes these solar powered watches with automatic time adjustment based on a radio signal.  Why not add those nice features to this watch and charge a bit more for it and give us a watch that looks good, functional and never requires batteries or time adjustments?I would have bought Casio's solar powered atomic watch, but it has stationary bezel and that was a deal breaker.Overal this is a great watch and I will keep it until Casio or someone else comes up solar powerd, atomic, anadigital watch with functional bezel.  Once that happens i will be a happy man.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13595735", "1": "0.30298322", "2": "0.15192014", "3": "0.15806583", "4": "0.059522096", "5": "0.14168291", "6": "0.049868453"}}
