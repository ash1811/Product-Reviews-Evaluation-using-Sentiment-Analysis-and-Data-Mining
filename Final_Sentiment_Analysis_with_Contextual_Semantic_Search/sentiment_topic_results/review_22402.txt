{"text": "This was a great product for a long time. So for a few years I put up with inconsistent sizing and having to buy a 5 pack to get 3 or 4 good ones.  I have compared them right out of the package new side by side, and they are never all cut the same size.  I'm now done with them.  I have worn the exact same size for years, but unfortunately Hanes does not know what \"exact same size\" means.  I bought 2 packs at Kmart today (April 2013) and both are going back.  They have now cut the length of the outer side seam from 8\" to 7\" and apparently believe that still constitutes a \"brief\".  I will never buy them again.  If I could rate them less than 1 star I would.  And by the way, it does no good to complain to Hanes.  They will send you some for free and tell you that if you complain again, you will be \"required\" to return the exact same free ones they sent you. It's a shame when a good product you have bought for a long time turns into something not worth buying anymore.  I will be way less likely to purchase any Hanes brand item after this.___________________(Try JMS (JustMySize), similar product with better fit)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11420158", "1": "0.32772598", "2": "0.057212163", "3": "0.18684302", "4": "0.060796313", "5": "0.10212001", "6": "0.1511009"}}
