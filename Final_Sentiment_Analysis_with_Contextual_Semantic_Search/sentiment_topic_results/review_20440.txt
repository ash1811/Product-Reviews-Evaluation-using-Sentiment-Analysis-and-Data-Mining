{"text": "I bought two sizes, 7.5E and 7E, planning to take back the one that didn't fit unless they both happened to fit (happens sometimes).Well, it turns out that the sandals weren't very comfortable at all.  The \"E\" wasn't wide enough.  There was good padding on the heel but the arch was a complete nothing.  It felt like my foot fell off at the heel straight to the floor.I needed to be able to walk in these so I decided to return both of them (I had only tried them on with socks, not worn them except for five minutes across my living room carpet).I went to Clarks' website, and they said you could return them to the store for a full refund as long as you brought your receipt, so instead of the Amazon return (that I would have to pay for) I took them to the local store.  The clerk was very condescending and said that they only take them back at the store if you have bought them from Clarks (which is not what it said on their website, or of course I wouldn't have made the trip, and yes I did check again after I went home).He said he could do an exchange, so I asked if he had any wide-width shoes in his store.  Of course not, they never do, that's why I buy them online.  He was just totally unhelpful and, as I said, condescending.  I don't understand why someone would want to alienate a potential future customer; guess he only cares about his store and not about representing the company as a whole.I did return them through Amazon, as usual with no problem at all.  However, I won't be buying from Clarks again, both because their wide width isn't wide enough and because of the combination of inaccurate website and snotty clerk.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16012786", "1": "0.35468584", "2": "0.040254768", "3": "0.18024795", "4": "0.0612344", "5": "0.04410763", "6": "0.15934157"}}
