{"text": "Purchased 2 pair for my husband last summer. The size was right on. Material is a medium-weight denim, easy to machine wash & dry. They are very durable for all his yard work and garage-shop activities.  However, if you live in a very warm climate (we don't) they may be a little too heavy for hot weather.  He loves the fit and all the pockets.  In fact, he liked them so well we ordered another 2 pair!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11451637", "1": "0.39096388", "2": "0.07539192", "3": "0.11014857", "4": "0.13841943", "6": "0.16722846"}}
