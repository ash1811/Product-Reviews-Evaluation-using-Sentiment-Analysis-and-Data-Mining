{"text": "I bought this watch in purple a couple of years ago after my Nike watch died. I used it as my casual watch.  It's great for pool or beach.  It 's also much easier to set than the Nike one.  You needed an engineering degree to figure it out.  Heaven help you if you accidentally push a button by accident.  You'd have to dig out the owner's manual to figure out how to get the time back.  Not so, with this one.  I recently ordered the charcoal/pink one and gave the purple watch to my daughter.  Highly recommend!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13442561", "1": "0.39483282", "2": "0.21285732", "3": "0.04693944", "4": "0.0624408", "6": "0.14579265"}}
