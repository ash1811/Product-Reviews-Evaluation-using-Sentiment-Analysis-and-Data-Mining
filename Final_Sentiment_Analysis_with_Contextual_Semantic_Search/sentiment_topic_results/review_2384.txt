{"text": "I have been wearing Dockers casual and work shoes for a couple of years now.  I've been wearing this particular shoe for about 3 months.  They are comfortable and I really like the all-season sole.  The shoes are solid, but the soles are flexible enough that I don't feel like I'm clomping along.  I used to have a pair of Sketchers, and they were heavy and clomped like crazy.  Plus, they were really stiff and never did feel like they got broken in, even after a couple of years of wearing them and the uppers wore out.Anyway, back to this shoe...I like the style, the color, and the sole.  I'm not sure why the folks at Dockers used the somewhat strange lace holders at the top of each side of the shoe instead of the traditional hole, except that maybe it keeps the laces from slipping,  I think they are minorly annoying, thus 4 stars instead of 5.BTW - I live in an area where we have warm summers and cold snowy winters, so the soles are a BIG selling point for me.  And since I walk to work I look forward to the added traction on snow and ice.As for fit, I bough them probably 1/2 size larger than normal because the last pair of Dockers I had pinched a bit in the toe-box, but these shoes feel fine, no crowding or pinching.  This is a good shoe for around $50.All in all a good shoe, and I'm glad I have them.I hope this was helpful.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07855556", "1": "0.30558518", "2": "0.15647464", "3": "0.14860499", "4": "0.033036385", "5": "0.18112727", "6": "0.09661595"}}
