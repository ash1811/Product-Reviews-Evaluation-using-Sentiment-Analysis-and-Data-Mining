{"text": "My husband has had a toiletry bag that he got when he joined the Army 20+ years ago, and it is still in fairly good condition considering it has been all over the world! But I felt it was time to get him a new one...at least to travel with...the old one can just be used for storage at home if he wanted to keep it.This Rothco bag is VERY well made. It is a nice thick canvas and the construction is awesome.It is large enough to hold my husbands toiletries and then some - it's pretty good size,  bigger then the one he's been using. I think it would take a lot to ruin this bag. The prices is GREAT so there's no complaints at all. I'm actually thinking of getting one for myself!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1088279", "1": "0.207966", "2": "0.1550269", "3": "0.2170386", "4": "0.22147803", "6": "0.08727383"}}
