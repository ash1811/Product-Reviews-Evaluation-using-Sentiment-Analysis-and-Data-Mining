{"text": "We purchased three different systems for walking on snow and ice and these are the ones we use every day.  The platform that you stand on keeps the pressure from the studs coming through to the feet.  If you've been lucky enough to get the exact size to fit your boots they can be secured very well and don't move around.  I have two sizes on two sets to fit two different types of boots.  Though the boots are the same inside size one pair is insulated for arctic wear and takes a bigger size stabilicer.  They add a bit of weight to your feet but this is not a problem walking. The studs, which can easily be replaced when worn down, are outstanding.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06812618", "1": "0.22328909", "2": "0.09496359", "3": "0.17931862", "4": "0.16309834", "5": "0.22485125", "6": "0.046352927"}}
