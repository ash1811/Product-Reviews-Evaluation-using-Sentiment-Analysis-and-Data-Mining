{"text": "This was a great deal on Amazon as far as price and quality of item. The shoes do run a little small so I would recommend you order a size larger then you normally take.  I ordered the regular size I take and they were a little too small but Amazon having a GREAT return policy was quick to send a return label and sent out a new pair in larger size. I loved these shoes and actually ordered a couple pair. You won't be disappointed!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08353459", "1": "0.28011864", "2": "0.1382321", "3": "0.26932308", "4": "0.12063504", "6": "0.10497325"}}
