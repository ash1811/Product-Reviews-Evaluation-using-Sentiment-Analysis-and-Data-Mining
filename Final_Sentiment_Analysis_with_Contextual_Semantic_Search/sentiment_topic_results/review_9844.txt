{"text": "Fantastic shoes that are both light and comfortable, yet the strps are very sturdy and not filmsy as with some sandals.  I received a couple of compliments about the shoes already and they fit very well.  I wear an 8 and ordered an 8 and 1/2 for room and the shoes are very roomy yet my toes are not sliding forward.  Would highly recommend this shoe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.060624767", "1": "0.5443473", "2": "0.16091722", "4": "0.0908589", "5": "0.13456509"}}
