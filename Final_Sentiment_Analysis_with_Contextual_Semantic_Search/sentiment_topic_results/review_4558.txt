{"text": "Amazing watch which I use on a daily basis. The time is large and is easily read and the date is just below that which is very useful in my job. The altimeter and barometer work great once they are calibrated correctly. Easy to use watch with three alarms that can be set quickly. The watch fits well and is very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.090623744", "1": "0.35169926", "2": "0.20942993", "3": "0.122248776", "4": "0.2175533"}}
