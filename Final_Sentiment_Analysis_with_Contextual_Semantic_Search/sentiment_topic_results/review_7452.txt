{"text": "I received this outfit yesterday and tried it on. The material was soft and comfortable. I'm about a size 10/12 and wear 36DD and the 1X was a little loose on me but still looked nice. The underwear that comes with the outfit are just OK, string bikini type panties. I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend it to others.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.5604788", "2": "0.15703043", "3": "0.18373731", "4": "0.044006288", "6": "0.046046473"}}
