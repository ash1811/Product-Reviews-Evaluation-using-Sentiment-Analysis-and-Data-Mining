{"text": "I really like to have thick, durable, cotton gym shorts, but it seems to be more and more difficult to find them. In local stores I see more made with polyester and othjer fabrics that I don't want. So I took the search online and found these. While I'm willing to put some effort and $ into shorts I don't think they should be particularly expensive. So far I would say these shorts are very good, they are a bit bigger than aferage and thicker too. The string looks like it won't break easy and the shorts look to be of above average quality. The pockets are ok but would have liked them to be deeper. Overall I'm giving 4 stars if they turn out to be extremely durable I may return to bump them up to 5.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22679375", "1": "0.25574818", "2": "0.056409143", "3": "0.19308895", "4": "0.09054016", "6": "0.17506474"}}
