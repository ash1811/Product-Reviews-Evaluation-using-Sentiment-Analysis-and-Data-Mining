{"text": "I got this to replace a non-automatic diver as I expand my collection. It's definitely diver-sized (read: oversized), so if you want something not so hulkish, look elsewhere. I recently picked up a Citizen BN0000-04H, which is much smaller if that's your thing. As far as this Invicta, it's now my favorite to take in the water (I'm still keeping my overall fav diver, the Orange Monster, on land). The rest of my divers have rubber straps, which I love, but the bracelet works well on this watch, adding to the heft. It took a week in the ocean unscathed and I'm hoping it lasts for a long time to come. The Rolex-like cyclops eye over the date is a nice addition and the lume works well.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.061418306", "1": "0.29369327", "2": "0.12454492", "3": "0.27669883", "4": "0.028467814", "5": "0.053595975", "6": "0.16158092"}}
