{"text": "This bra is so great it is supportive and hold you in all the right places.  I also bought the Tech fit one and that one is great too.  I usually wear VS bras and was measured as a 34dd very hard to find in stores, it was great to find it on here.  The only issue I have had was washing it, it says by hand which can be hard to do, mine went through the wash once and it did seem to stretch it out a bit.  Still worth it!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2807613", "1": "0.2092078", "3": "0.18683542", "4": "0.18581471", "5": "0.08124693", "6": "0.052798726"}}
