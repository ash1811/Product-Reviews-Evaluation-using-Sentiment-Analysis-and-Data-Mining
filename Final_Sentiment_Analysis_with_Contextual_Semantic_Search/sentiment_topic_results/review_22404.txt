{"text": "I have purchased these panties for decades because they have been so \"perfect\", and have also purchased them for my daughters for about three years.  I just bought two new packs and Hane's is definitely cutting corners on their product.  Holding up any one of the 10 pairs I just purchased, they are 1 1/4\" to 2\" shorter at the side seam than the old ones.  They should call these \"hipsters\" instead of briefs.  The cut has changed as well and the full cover for the bottom is also cut short.  I am disappointed and will not be buying them again.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16628361", "1": "0.20629683", "2": "0.028725183", "3": "0.19143385", "4": "0.20782231", "5": "0.19642083"}}
