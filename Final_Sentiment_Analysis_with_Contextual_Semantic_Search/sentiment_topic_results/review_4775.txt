{"text": "These are nice jeans.  They're not crazy-expensive, designer, \"premium-denim,\" but they feel good and feel quite durable.  As others mentioned, washing only once changes these jeans from off-the-shelf stiff denim to quite-wearable, comfortable jeans.  The length is maybe just a hair long based on sizes, but not by much.  Zipper feels good, pockets are slightly tight but not an issue at all.  I would recommend these, especially for the price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.196908", "1": "0.33786312", "3": "0.06250985", "4": "0.18392354", "5": "0.21209888"}}
