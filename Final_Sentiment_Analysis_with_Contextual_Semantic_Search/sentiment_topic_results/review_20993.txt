{"text": "I like to wear thigh highs in the summer time because my legs get really cold inside the office. I don't like pantyhose because they're not comfortable around my middle. (Is it just me, or are black tights much more comfortable and flattering around the tummy than pantyhose??)DURABILITY:  Anyhow, I have purchased about 8 pairs of these. I've tried some other brands, but I find that these Hanes are the best in terms of staying up. I have only once had a problem with the thigh high sliding down my leg as I walked down the street (which was incredibly embarrassing!!), and I realized that what happened was the top of the stocking was folded inside itself, so the silicone wasn't touching my leg.Otherwise, I've been able to wear these stockings out. I wash them in a mesh bag and then hang dry. I wear each pair about once a week, and they last forever. I have only had a few stockings that ripped to the point that I couldn't wear them. I do not have problems with runs, and I'm a little surprised by that. My desk at work has a little nail protruding, and I know that I hit it a few times as I'm crossing my leg -- but the stockings just get a little hole, and it does not spread out into a run.COLORS:  I am fair skinned, and I like to get either the &#34;Barely There&#34; (which looks like lightly tanned skin) or &#34;Travel Buff&#34; (which looks like untanned skin. I tried the &#34;Little Color&#34; but was very disappointed. That shade is too white (and again, I'm fair skinned to begin with), and it looked too unnatural. I wouldn't recommend that shade if you're trying to have the stocking blend into your skin, because if it looks too white on my pasty skin, I can't imagine that it would look natural on anyone!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1513647", "1": "0.27041602", "2": "0.07068982", "3": "0.27708745", "4": "0.10069754", "5": "0.035978418", "6": "0.09376604"}}
