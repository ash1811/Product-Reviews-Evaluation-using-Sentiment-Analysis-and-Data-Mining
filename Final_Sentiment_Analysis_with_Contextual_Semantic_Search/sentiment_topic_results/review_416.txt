{"text": "I am way too much of a non-neatnik to get obsessed over jewelry cleaning.  So I bought the super duper liquid versions of this product with the brush and the basket.  I used it once, put it away and haven't touched it again.  Too much work.  These, 25 Connoisseurs Jewelry Wipes, on the other hand, are for those who want clean jewelry with next to no work.  They are completely dry so it is impossible to make a mess.  You simply pull out a wipe, rub it on the jewelry and you are done.  Your jewelry is now clean.  If you look at the wipe you will see dark marks which are the dirt particles which were on your jewelry.  Rings are my favorite jewelry and these are especially great for rings.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05346954", "1": "0.3356854", "2": "0.18597098", "4": "0.081094034", "5": "0.12705544", "6": "0.2141595"}}
