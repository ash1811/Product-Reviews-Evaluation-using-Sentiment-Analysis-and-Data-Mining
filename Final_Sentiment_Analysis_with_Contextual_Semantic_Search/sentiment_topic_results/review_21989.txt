{"text": "If I understand the Dockers descriptions correctly D1 is tailored/slim fit, D3 are the relaxed fit and D2 are right in the middle.  I am of slim build so the smaller D1 size look better but I have trouble carrying my keys, wallet, and cellphone in the pockets.  D3 are a big baggy and are comfortable but look a little less professional.  I would recommend start with the D2 and go up or down depending on your level of comfort and desired style.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.093645565", "1": "0.31669483", "4": "0.26444477", "5": "0.072764955", "6": "0.24605174"}}
