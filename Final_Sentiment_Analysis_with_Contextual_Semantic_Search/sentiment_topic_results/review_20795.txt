{"text": "I purchased this for my grandson's 6th birthday.  He loved it!  He is tall and thin for his age and I was a little concerned that it would be too big for him, but it fit him to a tee!  The belt and holster that comes with the outfit is cheap.  I ordered the additional belt with the bully club, handcuffs, flashlight and radio to complete the outfit plus a metal badge.  Wish the costume came with the better belt, but I got this on sale and that helped.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14914073", "1": "0.24367486", "2": "0.21552423", "3": "0.06551775", "4": "0.11987357", "6": "0.20291734"}}
