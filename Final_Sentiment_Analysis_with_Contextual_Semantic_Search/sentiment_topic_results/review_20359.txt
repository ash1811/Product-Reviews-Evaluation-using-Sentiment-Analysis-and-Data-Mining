{"text": "I ordered 32FG (I am between a 32F&G in Panache bras) and when I first tried it on I was a little disappointed in the shape. The inner lining created an awkward shape due to it having extra space. But I decided to keep it and through it in the wash which solved the problem, so I would not suggest ordering a size down or returning if you end up with the same problem at first. For my size, this tank gives good support. I will wear out with only Lilly Pads on occasion, but I am supper modest and tend to use it mostly as an under shirt if I don't wear an added bra under it. This is the best nursing tank I have found.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12472952", "1": "0.22245982", "2": "0.10272599", "3": "0.3784681", "4": "0.03825579", "5": "0.050775297", "6": "0.08258544"}}
