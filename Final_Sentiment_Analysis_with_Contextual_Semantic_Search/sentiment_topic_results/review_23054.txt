{"text": "It says \"Government Contractor\" at the top of the product page. Being that the hat is made in China, you have to wonder what government is being referenced. Of course, in these times, maybe the US military is getting its gear from China. Nothing would surprise me anymore... except that this boonie hat is actually fairly decent quality. To be honest, I didn't expect much when I ordered this hat. Other than being dissatisfied with the way the hat was folded up and stuffed into a plastic bag (causing some very bad creasing that disappeared with time), I don't have any complaints with the hat so far.I bought this primarily to wear when outside working on my property and when loading or unloading my trailer. It does a fine job of keeping the sun off my face and shaved head while allowing a fair amount of ventilation. As other reviewers have noted, the gaps in the hat band are larger than standard US MILSPEC you might get from manufacturers like Propper, and the sizing does run a bit small. I ordered the XL, which would normally fit me loose, and got a fit that is a little snugger than I'd like. There's a couple stray threads, but the seams appear to be well sewn.All things considered, I think I made a good purchase; and if this hat proves to be durable, it will warrant a rating upgrade to five stars.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07506503", "1": "0.27396694", "2": "0.13066295", "3": "0.15985751", "4": "0.12306344", "5": "0.18577445", "6": "0.051609673"}}
