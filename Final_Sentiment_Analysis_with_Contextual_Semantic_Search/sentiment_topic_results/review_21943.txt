{"text": "I purchased this bra a few years ago from the hanes outlet store. I got one in a pretty, bright pink! I'm 34DD and run on the treadmill with these as well as high impact aerobics. There still is a tiny bit of bounce, but not enough to cause any discomfort.(FYI, I'm 40 and so... no self support left, if you get my drift.)I'm sure there are better sports bras out there, but the iron clad, supportive ones look soooo ugly.This one does smoosh a little, but not so much that I cant wear it out under my clothes. It fits tightly, but is very comfortable. (You have to have a tight underband to support large ones. The key is for the band to be wide so it does not dig in.) The underwires are well padded also.The wires on my old one broke last year, but now they have popped out of the fabric so I totally cant use it. Been looking around, but cant find anything supportive and pretty for under $50. (BTW, I dont like the racerback style because I have neck pain which increases from it.)I think I will just get this again. Too bad the pink is gone.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03498949", "1": "0.28265098", "2": "0.17881137", "3": "0.17570001", "4": "0.1549291", "5": "0.03170497", "6": "0.14121407"}}
