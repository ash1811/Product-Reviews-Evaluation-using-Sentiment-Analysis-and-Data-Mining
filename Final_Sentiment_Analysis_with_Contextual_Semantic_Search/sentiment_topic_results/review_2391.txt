{"text": "My husband got these boots 6 months ago and refused to wear them due to them being so hard. He wore them on the weekends to break them in but that didn't work. These boots are literally harming his feet. He has been wearing them about 2 months now and we are looking for another pair of boots. He is hurting every night when he come home and you can see where they are harming his feet,he says they won't bend at all. Breaking them in isn't the answer, he has tried everything. If the seller could have stated if these boots had any give to them would have been helpful. Really wish they had been like the old ones.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06694214", "1": "0.2609534", "2": "0.13327561", "4": "0.21872115", "5": "0.22585627", "6": "0.09153346"}}
