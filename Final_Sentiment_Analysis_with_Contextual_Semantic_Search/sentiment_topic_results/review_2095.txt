{"text": "I love these shorts - see my other reviews - but they do ride higher than you might be used to (LOOK at the picture - they're like right under the dude's belly button). That said, I love these...they're durable, I love the length at just about my knee, maybe a little below, and they fit great. Just a little higher than I'd prefer. If you like the length of these, but can't deal with the waist height, check out the plaid Dickies shorts - still longer, still durable, but less rough material and they sit a little lower.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.30733278", "1": "0.18510863", "2": "0.10182906", "3": "0.20906079", "4": "0.044308186", "5": "0.08833348", "6": "0.064027056"}}
