{"text": "I have several pair of Sanuk board walkers but this was my first pair of flip flops. after wearing these i hate my other flip flops. these are so comfortable; i hate wearing shoes in general but i wear these all year! (even when it's snowing-I've been wearing them around the house) I would recommend you buy at least 2 pair- you will need a neutral color because you will want to wear them with every outfit!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.055220306", "1": "0.44679675", "2": "0.21611565", "3": "0.048453443", "5": "0.1746817", "6": "0.05502946"}}
