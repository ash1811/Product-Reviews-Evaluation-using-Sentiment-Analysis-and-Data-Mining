{"text": "I was so happy I purchased these pretty heels. They arrived fairly quickly, boxed and packaged well. In fact, inside the pretty blue shoebox, the heels were individually enclosed in their own soft blue cloth bag and also enclosed was a large soft blue cloth bag with a adjustable string closure, with the brand name &#34;Fabulicious&#34; Premium Sexy Footwear&#8221; printed on it for use to store them in, which they do fit into nicely. The quality of these sexy pumps seem very good, the feathers are full and fluffy, the modest 3 &#34;heel part is shiny cloth covered, the insole is slightly padded, they do seem sturdy and are not cheap looking at all, I am also at a 1/2 size and I am glad I ordered the next size up as they fit perfectly. I have them on now and they are very comfortable. The heel is not too high but high enough to look sexy and feminine. I have not walked around too much in them, just around the house, as I probably would never wear them outside anywhere, But defiantly are very sexy bedroom slippers and they make me feel the same, very sexy!  I think they will truly enhance any of your sexy lingerie you are wearing or just for sitting around the house in your robe looking pretty. I think, they are really well worth way more than what I paid for them and I plan to buy a couple more pairs in different colors too! I would recommend these to any other woman as a must for spicing up your sex life! For this price you might want to order a few pair in different colors to go with your different bedroom outfits. As I am sure you won't regret buying them! I luv mine!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19177186", "1": "0.28232262", "2": "0.1372982", "3": "0.06268281", "4": "0.21362913", "5": "0.080636054", "6": "0.031659365"}}
