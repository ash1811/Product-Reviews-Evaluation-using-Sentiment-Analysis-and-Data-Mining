{"text": "Recently relocated from Sunny Southern California to the Frigid New England States!  This shoe is my most recent new weather wear (I am putting somebody at Amazon's kid through college)!  The purple is fabulous, the fit is perfect (even with the extra thick socks I reviewed an order or two ago), and the comfort is amazing.  I have never owned anything but Birkenstocks or stilettos so this sensible shoe venture is uncharted territory for me.  Chunky, yes; however, real Divas know how to get where she's going in sensible shoes. Gonna make them pop!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.051586688", "1": "0.12368992", "2": "0.13862057", "3": "0.120770775", "4": "0.123507306", "5": "0.38097066", "6": "0.06085408"}}
