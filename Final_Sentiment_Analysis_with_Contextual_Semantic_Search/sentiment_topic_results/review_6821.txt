{"text": "I purchased the \"backpack\" version of this bag after reading the reviews that the wheels on the rolling version broke easily. After using it for the first time, I somewhat wished I'd gone with the rolling one.This bag is sturdy with quality fabric and a surprisingly good amount of padding. We used it with a Graco Snugride on one trip, and it left room to pack a whole other bag inside. It will clearly fit a larger, full-size car seat. We felt confident gate-checking the car seat being it was so well protected.This bag is HUGE and awkward to carry through an airport. You have to constantly be making sure you aren't whacking someone with it as you turn, and you kind of have to wonder how silly you look. You also can't fit the car seat through the x-ray machine in it - at least not in the airports we were in.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06423858", "1": "0.31396186", "2": "0.2560923", "3": "0.04551415", "4": "0.04287449", "5": "0.21591365", "6": "0.061404973"}}
