{"text": "I bought the first pair on sale in a sky blue color, and loved them so much I invested in the red variety at full price...just bought pair number 3 in black, to wear on semi-professional occasions where I'll be on my feet for hours and need to be able to run (I work with the press, so speed is sometimes a priority...I have a pair of black Dansko clogs I occasionally wear for their comfort, but moving faster than a brisk walk is impossible in them).  I'm not sure which colors are currently available on Amazon, but I know this model is produced in at least five colors: moss green, brown, black, tomato red and pool blue.I have narrowish feet, size 8.5 and high arches...and this is literally the most comfortable shoe I've ever owned.  I've walked upwards of eight miles at a time in the blue pair and - here's another plus - they still look great, after a year and a half of fairly constant wear.These shoes cost more than sneakers, but I can absolutely tell you they are worth every penny.  The leather is sturdy and I've dropped a full glass of water on my toes with no splash marks left later.Seriously, I cannot say enough about this product.  My only worry is that Keen will stop making them.  If I ever see another pair on sale in my size I will invest in #4.I own several other pairs of Keen shoes as well (including the Bend, the Portola and the Tuscany)...and while I would rate those maybe an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10, the Presidio goes up to eleven.  Higher, really.  The fit is most like the Targhee mid, another Keen model of which I own more than one pair (try the purple ones, they're insanely cute.)One detail: They run about a half size smaller than marked.  I wear an 8.5 in most brands of shoe, but I need a full size 9 in the Presidios.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.020709755", "1": "0.40619838", "2": "0.15311567", "3": "0.21644121", "4": "0.056805365", "6": "0.1446535"}}
