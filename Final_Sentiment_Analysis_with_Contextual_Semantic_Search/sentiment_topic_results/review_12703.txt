{"text": "This was a great tool for teaching my children how to tell time.  Too many kids can only read digital numbers; you give them an analog watch or clock and they're lost.  I bought this for my five year old son.  He learned very quickly how to tell time on it.  He wore it 24 hours a day in the pool, sledding, running and playing. The lens got pretty scratched up and the wrist band stretched some, but it was a great watch... until he lost it.  I would strongly recommend this watch for young children.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13609211", "1": "0.18026401", "2": "0.2017351", "3": "0.1742004", "4": "0.0386182", "5": "0.19996984", "6": "0.06912038"}}
