{"text": "I bought the &#34;rigid&#34; color. Rigid comes in a very dark inky blue...for all purposes black. After a couple of washings the color is still quite dark but after a year of washes the color gradually goes from a dark blue to a bright blue with lots of white.Fit: 31 30. I have a slim/skinny build with muscular legs. However, I like my jeans to fit very closely from top to bottom and these seem to be the only Levi's that do that.I cannot recommend wearing a belt with these jeans as they only have five loops; the belt ends up riding over the top of the jeans. You'll need to buy jeans in precisely your waist size...which brings me to the point the Levi just doesn't do sizing except by &#34;ship and try&#34; method.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.032343376", "1": "0.26314405", "2": "0.2175807", "3": "0.32582554", "5": "0.10558405", "6": "0.053244572"}}
