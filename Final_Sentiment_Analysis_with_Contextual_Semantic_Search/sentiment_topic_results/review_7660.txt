{"text": "I was looking for a more reasonably priced alternative to my favorite bra in the world - Elomi Energise. This bra is supportive. Although, it does give you somewhat of a grandma-type shape. This is not really too much of an issue for me as I mainly just wear this bra at home (I work from home). It is comfortable enough to wear all day without too much of an issue. I do find that the band rolls and then becomes a bit itchy. This is a minor annoyance and one expected from a soft cup bra. It gives surprising lift given the fact that it is wire-free. It was stiff and itchy initially, but after &#34;breaking in&#34; and giving it a few washes the fabric softened and was more comfortable. I'm not going to say it is my favorite, but it is definitely a nicely constructed and supportive bra.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.053048808", "1": "0.2704038", "2": "0.07058511", "3": "0.25133324", "4": "0.096998185", "5": "0.18475458", "6": "0.07287624"}}
