{"text": "What a really cute comfortable pair of shoes and for me that is no easy task! I have wide wide feet and I'm diabetic which means they have to fit good or my feet really hurt. Now lots of brands claim they are wide or wide,wide but they are NOT and I end up walking on a seam!! not good for diabetic feet. I was afraid I was doomed to wear crocs forever (they are really comfortable but not cute!) I saw these and just had to give them a try.Boy am I glad I did. They are a perfect fit!! I love the fact that the insole can be taken out and replaced which I did with my diabetic insoles. They were measured for me at the medical supply to be a perfect fit and they fit in this shoe perfectly!!! from toe to heel and from side to side.Thank you Easy Spirit for a truely wide wide shoe!!These come in so many colors that I am just gonna have to have other colors.LOL:) Yes I recommend this product. I can wear an 8 but not knowing the sizing for this shoe I ordered an 8 1/2 WW. I could wear an 8 in these but like a little extra toe room. They arrived very fast.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10109504", "1": "0.2912405", "2": "0.032469798", "3": "0.20665267", "4": "0.10814254", "5": "0.20885722", "6": "0.051542234"}}
