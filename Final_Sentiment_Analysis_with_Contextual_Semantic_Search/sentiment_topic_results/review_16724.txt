{"text": "These cargo pants are so comfortable, they feel almost like sweatpants, yet look so much better. They're lightweight, but seem to be strong. I'm hard on my clothing as I'm active, and these pants have held up wonderfully. They look really good, and I plan on buying other pairs in different colors. I'm 6' 175 lbs and at first went with the size large. However, they were much too big. So I gave them to a friend I owed a favor too and is a much bigger guy than I am. I then ordered size medium and the fit is near perfect. There are plenty plenty of pockets and they fit nicely around my boots.highly recommend if you're in the market for cargo pants.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07747637", "1": "0.47146177", "2": "0.052035023", "4": "0.17301379", "5": "0.043389075", "6": "0.18041746"}}
