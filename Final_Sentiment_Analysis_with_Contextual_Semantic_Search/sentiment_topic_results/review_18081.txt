{"text": "Since I've very rarely owned a watch at any price level that didn't require links removed or set at the 2nd-to-last notch in the band, this Casio model is a treat. It's nearly child-sized in face/band length. Obviously this is not a positive for those disinterested in a low profile watch or with less absurdly dainty wrists. (But if you're used to 'normal' sized watches on a skinny wrist, it's so nice to not see the excess band wrapping around so far that it nearly hits the case..) It's super lightweight, the numbers, in typical Casio fashion are not in a wild font, and it's comfortable to wear. It doesn't look as cheap as you'd fear, even with it's rubberized band and plastic-y bezel. I struggle a bit when setting it as the crown is almost too tiny; with long fingernails it's tricky! The face is black so the dial is not as easy to read as its lighter face counterparts. I may have ultimately preferred silver tones to the gold ones offered, but for the price and the desirability of the size, no worries. Just beware that if you want a super easy-to-read watch in all lighting conditions or are not aware of the undersized measurements, you could be let down. If tiny and comfortable is your goal, this cannot beat! I have not had it long enough to vouch for durability, but frankly, at this price point, it's not a concern and is as hardy as one could expect.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.040116414", "1": "0.16230445", "2": "0.13434692", "3": "0.14387657", "4": "0.136726", "5": "0.1644162", "6": "0.2182135"}}
