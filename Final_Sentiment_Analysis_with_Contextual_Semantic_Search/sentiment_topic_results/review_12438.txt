{"text": "I wear 9.5M and since these are not offered in half sizes, I bought size 10 ebony (black). Well, they are 11 1/8 inches (or 28.2 cm) long, while they are supposed to be 10 1/4 inches long.  The width is alright, 4 inches.If you are between sizes and/or have low arch you will be better off by going down, not up.They come in a fancy heavy plastic shoe bag that is very unpleasant to touch and they smell bad straight from the box. The smell disappears after few days though. The bag is made primarily from tapioca root and supposedly uses less petroleum, energy, and water, so it claims to have reduced carbon footprint.  However, I really don't need this bag at all, since the shoes arrived in a carton box.I needed the flip-flops right away, so I started wearing them. I even washed them with soap by hand after working in the garden. They cleaned fine, but dried slowly. I did not use them around water yet.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09371904", "1": "0.24513546", "2": "0.052180886", "3": "0.31358248", "4": "0.17979294", "6": "0.11357138"}}
