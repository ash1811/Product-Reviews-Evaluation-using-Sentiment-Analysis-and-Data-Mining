{"text": "Looks a lot more expensive than it is- well worth the price.  The gold face is quite attractive and distinctive.  Keeps good time.  I use it as a beater watch- if something happens to it I'm not going to be out $300 dollars.  The digital functions are useful without the LCD being too noticable- stopwatch, calendar,etc.The only negative is the bezel- its not as tight fitting as more expensive watches, and its not unidirectional so i wouldn't actually use it for diving.One other thing to consider- Amazon frequently has watch specials with brands like Invicta or Seiko.  Under these specials you can get better watches for about $60-100. They won't have the functions of this watch, but will be higher quality and last longer.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.065181315", "1": "0.26946834", "2": "0.26719832", "3": "0.17009757", "4": "0.107932776", "6": "0.117765404"}}
