{"text": "I inherited my mother's beautiful gold and black dress watch which I love to wear - but on special occasions only.  I recently added a couple of black and black/white items to my wardrobe and wanted a nice looking black dial/black band I could wear as an everyday watch to go with these outfits.  Just got it so can't say how well it'll hold up but I was pleasantly surprised that it's every bit as pretty as the picture and I'll love wearing it.  So far I'd recommend it to anyone.  By the way, I expect that everyone would naturally know that for the price paid the &#34;diamond&#34; is little more than a chip enhanced by silver (?) surrounding.  For the diamond I didn't expect much but they've made it look very pretty...can't ask more for the price!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20853129", "1": "0.24586065", "2": "0.082833774", "3": "0.335241", "6": "0.12317647"}}
