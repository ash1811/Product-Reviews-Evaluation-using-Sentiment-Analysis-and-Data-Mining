{"text": "High Sierra backpack was as advertised and delivered on time. It met every expectation and I am pleased with it. It is very well constructed and is holding up well to daily use. If I have any complaints it is that it has Too many pockets. For my needs they could have better combined two or three of the large pockets into just one big one. But that is in general a minor issue. I recommend it. For the price the best quality backpack I found. Bought in black because I could not justify the extra money for colors...a couple bucks yes...but they wanted like fifteen dollars more in color.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.080778606", "1": "0.3543429", "2": "0.22053857", "3": "0.07433243", "4": "0.15706897", "5": "0.03080252", "6": "0.082136005"}}
