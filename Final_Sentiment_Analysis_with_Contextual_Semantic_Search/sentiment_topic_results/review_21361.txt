{"text": "My midwife referred me to this to help support my belly. I didn't like it because it never fit right with my pants/skirts.  It's hard to latch and doesn't stay in position well.  I do not like lots of layers on me so maybe that is why.  Quality is nice and sturdy and good fabric, just not comfortable.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07357507", "1": "0.60240936", "3": "0.07972056", "4": "0.0691711", "5": "0.09731032", "6": "0.07250855"}}
