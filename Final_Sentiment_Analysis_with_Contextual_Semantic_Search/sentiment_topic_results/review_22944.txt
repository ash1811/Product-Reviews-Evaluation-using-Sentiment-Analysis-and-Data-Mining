{"text": "Medium sized shorts usually fit me very well. I bought these in medium (in two colors) and the blue one fits me more loosely than the black one. So I think there is some inconsistency in sizing.Overall, my blue shorts fits very loose and it feels and looks like baggy shorts. The black one was little more firm but still somewhat loose fitting.As far as moisture wicking, I think these shorts do its job.Pros:1)Cheap2)Good enough quality, but not of excellent quality.3)Moisture wicking. These are made of polyester so it won't absorb your sweat like cotton shorts will.Cons:1)Very loose and baggy fitting. These are also very long (almost reaches to my knees).2)No structural reinforcements within the shorts. So I don't think these are built to last.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16155855", "1": "0.26843637", "2": "0.1508759", "3": "0.16148688", "4": "0.1250315", "5": "0.027392818", "6": "0.105218"}}
