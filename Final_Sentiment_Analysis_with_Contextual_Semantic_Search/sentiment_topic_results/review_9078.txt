{"text": "My feet are always freezing cold so I absolutely love these slippers.  They keep my feet at just the right temp. I do think they would be too warm for folks whose feet are not icy like mine.Regarding sizing, I ordered 1 size up from my usual (I got an 11).  I do usually keep my socks on with the slippers and the size I got fits perfectly with socks on.  They are snug, but I think that helps them succeed at keeping my feet warm.  They are fairly narrow but, since I have narrow feet, that's fine for me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.053153377", "1": "0.30646986", "2": "0.043013714", "3": "0.19876152", "4": "0.1747808", "5": "0.085943215", "6": "0.1378775"}}
