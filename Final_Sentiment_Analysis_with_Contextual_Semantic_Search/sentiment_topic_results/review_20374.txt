{"text": "I've had this chain for almost 4 years. It's shines beautifully  The twisted serpentine is very attractive.  This is a delicate chain.  It's approximately .5mm, so it's very thin. This is a nice chain to use, if you don't want to distract from your pendant. It also looks nice alone when wanting just a whisper of jewelry around your neck.  It twinkles.I found this chain to be strong. Recently my chain broke and I'm ordering another. I don't fault the workmanship for the breakage. It's very thin as stated in product description and I wasn't careful when cleaning with my polishing cloth.  I pulled too hard and snapped the chain.(No more cleaning my delicate chains when I'm nervous or pissed off)This chain link is stronger than most herringbone chains of 1mm and less, and I find it much more attractive the the basic box link. My chain never developed a lot of tarnish and it cleans to sparkling without a lot of effort....just be gentle when cleaning. Personally, I don't use liquid silver cleaner, but you could probably get good cleaning results by tossing it in the liquid for a few seconds.This chain doesn't scream silver.  I've worn this chain with both silver and white gold pendants. It blends great with either metal. The first time I wore it, the chain felt a little rough around my neck, but that feeling soon left.  I know I have enjoyed this chain.  With the price of gold soaring, I'm glad to get such a nice chain at a great price, which by the way hasn't increased since my orignal purchase.  Gem Avenue has a large variety of really good quality silver chains.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06765922", "1": "0.109372124", "2": "0.1134616", "3": "0.16737643", "4": "0.2130936", "5": "0.18850432", "6": "0.1405327"}}
