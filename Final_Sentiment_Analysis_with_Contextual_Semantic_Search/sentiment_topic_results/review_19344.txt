{"text": "UPDATE 6/13After thorough constant use and about 50 ocean dives, it still works.  i have replaced the band once.  It loses about a minute a week, but i can deal with that.  Great bargain!***Original review:Picture this:  a Rolex look, water-resistant for most SCUBA divers, self-winding, luminous dial, timing bezel, scratch-resistant face, and more.  Here's what the manufacturer says:Watch InformationBrand Name: InvictaModel number: 9110Part Number: INV9110Dial window material type: antireflective-mineralClasp:  BuckleCase material: stainless-steelCase diameter: 41 millimetersCase Thickness: 14 millimetersBand material: RubberBand length: mens-standardBand width: 22 millimetersDial color:  blackBezel material: black-and-stainless-steelBezel Function: unidirectionalCalendar:  DateMovement: japan-automaticWater resistant depth:  660 FeetHere's what the manufacturer doesn't say:1.  Remember that \"unidirectional\" means one direction.  It turns counter-clockwise.  After using an electronic watch for many years, I was worried about the bezel getting jammed with sand or salt.  There has been no problem.2.  The stem, screwed in through an \"o\" ring (I assume) to keep it water-tight, will slowly \"unscrew\" itself over time.  Check it every so often.3.  I wear this watch with the face on the bottom of my wrist, and the watchband on the top of my wrist.  I thought that I'd have to accept all the scratches on the face.  After 6 months, there is nary a scratch.4.  The illumination isn't as bright as I'd like, but I've gotten used to it.5.  I've been happy as a clam (pun intended) when diving with it.6.  The self-winding mechanism works perfectly with my normal arm activities.The only thing I would change is to have the rubber watchband be manufactured with a slight bend in it.  I have thinner wrists, so I have an extra 4.5 cm section of band sticking straight out, catching on my shirt (why not cut it off?  I need the extra length if I want to wear it on the outside of a wetsuit).Highly recommended as a bargain for the discounted price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.039344136", "1": "0.06382971", "2": "0.14366594", "3": "0.48176", "4": "0.052938055", "5": "0.10787378", "6": "0.110588424"}}
