{"text": "Not easy to put on and/or take off.My husband can't figure out how to put this watch on! I adjusted the strap and figured it out for him, with the help of the tiny picture in the \"manual\", but he's used to buckle straps, so this is not very practical for him. Otherwise it's a nice watch for the price. Perhaps next time we'll try a leather band.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.035573047", "1": "0.43081424", "2": "0.24450165", "4": "0.17797314", "6": "0.10336902"}}
