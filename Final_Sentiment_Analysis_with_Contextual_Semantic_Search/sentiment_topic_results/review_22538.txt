{"text": "This silver cleaner undoubtedly does its job well, and most of all does it with very little odor involved. Kudos for that.So why only 3 stars? Because the packaging really does not work for me:When I first opened the jar, the contents were under a clear seal that was absolutely impossible to remove without a tool. I had to use a pair of scissors to get a hole into it and even then was unable to simply peel it off. Gloves are very much recommended if one doesn't want skin to come into ample contact with the chemicals contained in the jar. In addition, I had a hard time closing the jar again. The lid kept catching the thread at an angle, and when I finally got it on straight, the chemical solution came up bubbling from underneath the lid upon attempting to screw it on tightly. I believe the problem is that the flexibility of the material used for the jar and the lid is simply too great. In order to screw on the lid, one must hold the jar and also use some kind of strength/force to get the lid on. That leads to everything bending slightly out of shape - just enough for the product to make a royal mess. I for one got the stuff all over my hands.I would normally be inclined to say that I just got a jar with a bad thread but with the odd flexibility jar and lid have, I just don't think so and believe the problem is with the design. As much as I despise the odor of theConnoisseurs Silver Jewellery Cleaner 8 oz., I think their jar is designed better. At least it used to be on my old silver cleaner I had from them.I don't think I will buy this product again although I do like its performance.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16297437", "1": "0.21542116", "2": "0.2624665", "3": "0.021587595", "4": "0.17437151", "5": "0.0796021", "6": "0.08357673"}}
