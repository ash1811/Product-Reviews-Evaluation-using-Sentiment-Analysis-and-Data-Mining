{"text": "I chose this bra because I've tried many over the years and was disappointed.  This bra looked like a good one and I figured I'd have nothing to lose by buying and trying one.  I'm so glad I did, because it's exactly what you see.  I where a 38 D and expected the support would probably not be there, it never is, and they ride up.  This one stays put on me and the support is like no other I've worn.  There's very firm hold and there's no slipping.  I will buy another for sure.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.062017564", "1": "0.28310657", "2": "0.083871014", "3": "0.34491408", "4": "0.1176377", "5": "0.037555326", "6": "0.07089773"}}
