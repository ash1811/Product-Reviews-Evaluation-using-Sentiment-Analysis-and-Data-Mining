{"text": "I love love love these boots. I purchased them for my 8 month old daughter who is not a fan of shoes. However, these are the only pair that stay on. She is just starting to crawl and the are perfect for crawling. I wish they were available in black because they are absolutely adorable with leggings or skinny jeans. I had purchased the riley roos but returned them when I saw these and I am so glad that I did. They are so easy to slip on and off.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08561549", "1": "0.18542963", "2": "0.16617988", "3": "0.07951799", "4": "0.41816223", "5": "0.061330486"}}
