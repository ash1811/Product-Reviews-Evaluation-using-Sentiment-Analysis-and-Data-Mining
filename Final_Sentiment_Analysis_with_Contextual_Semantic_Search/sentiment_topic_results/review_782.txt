{"text": "I am tall and need long pants (seam 33&#34;) but these are longer. Ok to wear to work in a hospital as scrubs if you are a very tall lady or a man about 6 feet but I was hoping to wear them everywhere and they are not made for that. Thin cotton which is good for hot summers in Arizona but I will need to alter them before I can wear them as casual pants for running errands like grocery shopping or hanging outside with neighbors.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.2512997", "3": "0.10413053", "4": "0.089757316", "5": "0.20974295", "6": "0.33825365"}}
