{"text": "I purchased the SE Watchband Link Remover Tool after a Google search for watchband adjustment led me to a Youtube video of the tool being used.  The removal of several links from my Invicta watchband was accomplished in a few minutes after I got the hang of using the tool.  The Youtube video was a nice help and I recommend viewing it before using the tool if you havent removed links from a watchband before.The Watchband Link Remover Tool comes with five replacement pins in addition to the one in the tool which is good because I bent three pins while I was getting the hang of using the tool.The tool is made of cheap plastic and so my expectations for the durability of the tool were pretty low.  But for the price, I really cant complain.  The use of the watch tool certainly accomplished the goal of removing the links from my watchband without the need to take it to a jeweler.  So, if you view the Link Remover Tool as a disposable tool that can be used once or maybe twice, you wont be disappointed.Overall, I was very pleased by the price and the results.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10924334", "1": "0.2471765", "2": "0.20893912", "3": "0.021646183", "4": "0.2033603", "6": "0.20738564"}}
