{"text": "There is no question that Citizen has really made some excellent watches to take on the go for anywhere you desire. I was very impressed with this particular watch. This Professional Diver Citizen Eco-Drive watch handles very well, and fits snugly on the comfort the wrist. I like the illumient hands and the features on the face of the watch. When it glows in the dark, it works absolutely brilliantly. The uni-directional bezel also handles well as you can simply turn it in the blink of a eye. My one of only gripe about the watch is the crown being a screw-down crown. It can be very difficult to take out, and can get stuck at times. Still, if you want to take a watch for any purpose, in the water while diving, or something completely different to wear, than this Citizen Eco-Drive would be for you.Price: C+Comfort & Setup: B+Overall: B 1/2-", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16632064", "1": "0.101081304", "2": "0.27519876", "3": "0.084768236", "4": "0.1768025", "5": "0.047224086", "6": "0.14860445"}}
