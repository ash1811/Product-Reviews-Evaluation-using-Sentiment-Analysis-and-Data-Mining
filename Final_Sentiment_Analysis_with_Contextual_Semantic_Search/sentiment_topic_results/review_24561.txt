{"text": "I haven't worn this leotard to dance class yet, but it seems to be just what I was looking for:  it's comfortable, it covers my derriere, and it hides my bra straps.  For reference, I am 5'7\" tall, 138#, 34/36C.  In street clothes, I usually wear a size 6, a small in ladies' clothes, or a medium in juniors' clothes.  I was kinda in between the medium and large on the Capezio size chart, and I'm glad I went with the large.  It is an excellent fit - neither too tight nor baggy.UPDATE:  I have this leotard in black, burgundy, and blue.  When I got sweaty, the blue bled onto my tights and stained them.  I have not had that problem with the black or burgundy, though.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09225391", "1": "0.15336844", "2": "0.12440703", "3": "0.32488278", "4": "0.054580536", "5": "0.14391702", "6": "0.10659029"}}
