{"text": "I purchased this hiking boot at another retailer because I wanted to try it on before I bought it and the cost was the same.  I found this shoe to fit well; I wear a size 8 and I bought this shoe in a size 8.  I often have trouble finding shoes that fit because I have a narrow heel but require a little more room in the toebox, and these shoes fit me well; I had no slippage on my heel and had plenty of room in the toe box.  I bought them for a trip to Sedona and they worked very well on the trails and rocks I encountered there.  I experienced no hot spots and they were comfortable throughout my trip.  I was extremely pleased with these shoes and am considering purchasing another pair for work (I am a nurse).  I would definitely recommend this hiking shoe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.057855133", "1": "0.5068696", "2": "0.18654703", "3": "0.099788144", "4": "0.04782155", "5": "0.03169656", "6": "0.06942201"}}
