{"text": "I usually buy wide shoes whenever possible but these boots are a little too roomy in wide.  That is with wearing hiking socks too.  This boot is very well made for the modest bucks I paid on Amazon.  As one of the previous reviewers suggested, I coated the leather with mink oil.  I would also suggest getting a 1/2 size larger than your regular shoe size.  All in all, a good purchase.  Great for hiking all sorts of terrain and crossing shallow streams.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1637698", "1": "0.25422645", "2": "0.1968803", "4": "0.14888762", "5": "0.086838275", "6": "0.14652608"}}
