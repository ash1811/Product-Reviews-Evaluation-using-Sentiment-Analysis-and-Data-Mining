{"text": "I bought my first pair of these socks 6 months ago. I loved them so much I now have 5 pairs. I use them only for wearing around the house, not for hiking. They provide great cushion. So far they are holding up great with no visible wear. I wear a women's size 6 shoe and the medium/Ladies size sock fits perfect.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.045018367", "1": "0.44104123", "2": "0.0813018", "3": "0.14245939", "4": "0.1139326", "5": "0.09923221", "6": "0.077014334"}}
