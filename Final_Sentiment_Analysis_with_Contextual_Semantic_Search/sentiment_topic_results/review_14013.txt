{"text": "Although the Amazon price was higher than one listing on Ebay, I bought mine here  because of Amazon's robust return policy..  I need a &#34;stopwatch&#34; function, actually an elapsed time indicator, for pre-dawn runs in town and backcountry skiing, and I also need to see the time of day - - both indications at a glance in all conditions of illumination.  Subdials and tiny digital screens are often too small to see quickly and clearly.  With a watch under several layers of clothing, finding and using G-Shock buttons with ice encrusted mittens is not practical.  The BN000-04H bezel is accurate enough for my purposes.  For times longer than an hour, I can remember when I began timing.  The stiff, positive bezel is reassuring, and its figures are easily distinguished from the time of day markings.  The watch is small, plain  and delightfully uncluttered.  The writing on the band was quickly removed with acetone.  My three other Eco-Drives have been tough and reliable, so I am pretty confident about this one.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20677766", "1": "0.1683586", "2": "0.15477034", "3": "0.03538895", "4": "0.14501238", "5": "0.13978088", "6": "0.14991121"}}
