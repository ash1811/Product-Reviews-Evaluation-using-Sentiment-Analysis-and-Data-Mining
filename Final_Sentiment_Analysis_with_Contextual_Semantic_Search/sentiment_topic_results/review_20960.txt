{"text": "The color in the picture is a little off. this ring is lot shinier but more of an old silver kind of look. It is a beautiful ring, and very heavy. I bought it for my boyfriend who loves it as well :)Totally worth the money I spent on it :DEDIT: so now its 10/17/11, and it seems the ring got a little scratched.. still nothing you can really notice though, unless youre looking for it. Still ubers shiny and really beautiful :)EDIT: Its 11/12/2012.. The ring still looks like the day we bought it, with only ONE scratch. We wanted to see how it would hold up to bricks, and literally rubbed and scraped it on them. The ring held up beautifully. My boyfriend still wears it daily, and as you can see, even after a year, this ring it still kicking ass.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16670649", "1": "0.32381976", "2": "0.14929", "3": "0.07460526", "4": "0.11218025", "5": "0.09827118", "6": "0.07512707"}}
