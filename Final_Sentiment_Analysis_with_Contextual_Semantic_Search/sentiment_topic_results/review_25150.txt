{"text": "WARNING: I did everything I was supposed to do to order the engraving that they offered, but it arrived today (it is a beautiful necklace, indeed!) but I turned it over and *GASP* my children's names were NOT on there!I almost cried.Don't go to the trouble of paying $5 and doing all the steps, cause they don't pay attention to their orders evidently.I am just so disappointed.UPDATE:Amazon refunded a partial discount due to the false advertising of these piece.  I am pleased.  Would have loved to have the engraving, but the necklace is beautiful and Amazon made it right.  I trust Amazon and would purchase this again!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13191544", "1": "0.13341227", "2": "0.1939974", "3": "0.106969364", "4": "0.14654082", "5": "0.15619268", "6": "0.13097204"}}
