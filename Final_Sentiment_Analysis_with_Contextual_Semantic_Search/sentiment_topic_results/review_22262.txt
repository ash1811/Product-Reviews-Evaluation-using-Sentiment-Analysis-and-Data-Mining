{"text": "I ordered two different kinds of toesocks from Injinji.  I got a mini-crew pair and these mico toesocks.  I wanted to try the different styles and weights.  What I didn't expect was the difference in size.  These were much smaller.  They are supposed to fit women's shoe sizes 6 to 8 1/2.  I am a 6 1/2 and I can barely make them fit.  Someone who is a size 8 could never wear them.I am happy with them; they do what I wanted them to do--prevent pinch blisters on my toes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.086425684", "1": "0.418436", "2": "0.04045077", "3": "0.28113303", "5": "0.08563958", "6": "0.08497238"}}
