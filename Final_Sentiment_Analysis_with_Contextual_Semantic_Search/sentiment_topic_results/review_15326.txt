{"text": "I ordered a 5x just incase they shrank when washed. What I got were a 5x top and a 4x bottom. The bottoms were too long and the top just fit snuggly. Good thing I ordered a size or two up. In other brands  I get a 3x. You can tell these are their lower end products. They are okay in a pinch but I would not order again", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10171461", "1": "0.21934383", "3": "0.23320642", "4": "0.18763208", "5": "0.24940509"}}
