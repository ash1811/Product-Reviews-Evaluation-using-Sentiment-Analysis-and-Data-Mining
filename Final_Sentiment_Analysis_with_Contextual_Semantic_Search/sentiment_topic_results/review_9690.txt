{"text": "I love this bra.  The 'Magic Lift' design delivers as promised, as well or better than any underwire bra I've purchased -- and lots more comfortable.  It definitely does lift to create a perky and pointy silhouette that looks especially sexy in a clinging sweater. A retro 1950-60's look. I stand a little straighter now and enjoy the discrete attention that I receive.  At my age, and after having nursed two babies for long periods, I definitely experience bosom sag if I'm braless, or in a lesser bra.  I've spent serious money on high quality brand underwires, had private fittings, etc.  Husband now finds it irresistable to sneak in tweaks when no one is looking.  Has even asked me to leave it on during intimacies once.The only cons are minor.  There is a bit of a gap between the center and my breastbone, common enough with many bras, although I've found a couple in past that don't do that.  It also is not a good choice for low cut apparel.  As to fit, I have previously been fitted as a C cup, but this model fills out better for me as a B cup.I think I'll order another right away.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13058998", "1": "0.26967353", "2": "0.11968012", "3": "0.19775265", "4": "0.111398585", "5": "0.077345334", "6": "0.09355977"}}
