{"text": "This watch has been made for at least 30 years now. I went for the chrome A158W, instead of the plastic F91W, which is the same watch, internally.I suspected the bracelet would be a hair-puller, and I was right. As a watch collector, I expected that, and I put a Swiss Army strap on it; much better. I really wanted the dressy chrome look on the watch head, and I figured I could dress it back up again in the future with a glossy lizard strap.The feature set, you can read about on Casio-USA's website, so I won't go into that much.The key things to note from ownership and use are as follows:+ Simple. Everything's easy to use and set if you take 2 minutes with the manual. If you're familiar with Casios, you won't even need the manual.+ Very light and thin. There's no other watch that packs this level of features and legibility into such a light package. When I'm wearing this watch, I forget that it's on, sometimes.- Hair-puller bracelet. OK for Asians, not so good for the rest of us.- No countdown timer. I miss this useful feature, but in many cases, the alarm can be used instead.+ Loud beeper. It is not sealed up so tight for waterproofness (this one's only rated as splashproof) that it makes the alarm notably quieter.- LED sidelight is barely adequate. There's a similar model with &#34;Electro-Luminescence&#34; that is no-doubt better in this regard. I knew that going in, but I felt the big blue &#34;ELECTRO-LUMINESCENCE&#34; banner on the watch face kind of ruined the 80s look of it. (yeah, I'm an nerd)In the long run, I use this as my back-up watch. I leave it in my desk drawer at work for those days when I forget to wear a watch leaving the house in the morning. This is the perfect watch for that duty, as it will run at least 7 years on a battery, if the alarm and light aren't used much.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04923758", "1": "0.09007985", "2": "0.3811111", "3": "0.1610238", "4": "0.17260131", "5": "0.09407569", "6": "0.051870715"}}
