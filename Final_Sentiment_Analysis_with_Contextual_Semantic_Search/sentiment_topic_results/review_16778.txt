{"text": "First things first, this watch is huuuuuuuuuuge, in my opinion, too huge (except you're over 6'9\" and 250lb). That's not the problem, the problem is that the watch looks cheap. The pull out crown it's tricky and take a while to adjust the hour. If this watch were a little bit smaller it would be ok. The chronograph function is ok and works well. The packaging is amazing. The price is great for what you get. If you want to be noticed, this is the right watch for you.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12226202", "1": "0.27583104", "2": "0.28433466", "3": "0.13719879", "4": "0.10340877", "5": "0.07369927"}}
