This shirt allows my skin to breathe which makes it in my opinion much better than the synthetic base layers.Silk is a very good insulating fabric very lightweight and great to wear under many layers.One thing I have noticed about the top and especially the pants that can be brought separately is that I feel it does not run true to size.I suggest buying one size smaller than the sizing chart implies.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24410427", "1": "0.13181008", "2": "0.07223762", "3": "0.20457979", "4": "0.14261095", "5": "0.1401757", "6": "0.064481616"}}
