{"text": "This costume was awesome!  I got compliments each time my son wore it this year.  It is the most authentic police uniform style costume on the market.  Complete with gold buttons, removable epaulets, and a shoulder cord holding a whistle (attached so safe for little ones).  The hat also was designed just like a real police uniform hat.I bought the size 4 costume for my 3 year old and since it was a little big, I got different pants to match the navy blue shirt. I stitched on patches from the PD that my husband and I work for- over the patches that came on the shirt, though they would have been fine too.  I also sewed a little gold badge over the badge patch that comes on the shirt. I tucked a small flashlight in the holster and hung handcuffs out of his back pocket.  He was so excited to dress like us- daddy especially, and the photos are priceless!  Only negative- The handcuffs that come with the set are flimsy metal and appear they could cut a child.  I just bought a different cheap pair in a set with the small badge at a toy store. You can't go wrong with this costume- very authentic!  My child will be able to use it for dress up for several more years.Update 2012- my skinny oldest son wore it for two Halloweens (age 3 and 4 but with different skinny navy cargo pants).  My second boy (heavier 3 yr old) wore it this year and will be able to wear it next year.  We gets tons of praise and comments from teachers, other parents, and treat-givers, and my kids feel so special and like real police officers.  It should fit (at least the shirt) from ages 3-5 for sure.  The pants are just plain polyester, so any navy pants will do.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1826764", "1": "0.14745398", "2": "0.059607036", "3": "0.21647264", "4": "0.20479338", "6": "0.1869402"}}
