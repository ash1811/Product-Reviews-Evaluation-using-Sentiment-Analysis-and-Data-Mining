{"text": "In over 50 years of carrying handbags of every shape and style, the Baggallini Wallet Bagg is far and away my favorite.  I've had two for years and have even thrown them in the washing machine a time or two with no ill effects.  They offer such great organization and easy access to all your needs when you're going through a busy check-out counter or need a quick touch-up.  I just wish they made one in leather for a little dressier look.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11272297", "1": "0.1689294", "2": "0.16826946", "3": "0.24607506", "4": "0.16621423", "6": "0.13458842"}}
