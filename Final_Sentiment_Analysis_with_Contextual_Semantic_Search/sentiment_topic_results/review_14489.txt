{"text": "Stores rarely have this waist size and shopping for jeans in the boys department will get you a Wrangler size 16, which should be 28 x 31, but does not fit the same as a men's jean. Suck it up, don't tuck in your shirt and you are going to look like a twig in jeans made for little boys.  A Wrangler size 18 is impossible to find in the stores, but that would compare to a 29 x 31. An alternative would be the husky sizes which should be a 30\" waist for a size 16H; too big and the pockets get bigger too.With these jeans, I have fit with a comfortable waist, heavy material that is washed out enough to be softer.  These are the same carpenter's jeans found in the discount stores.  These will look nice for a couple of years with heavy wear.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1105264", "1": "0.33095983", "2": "0.12940156", "3": "0.12883939", "4": "0.054773558", "5": "0.066128366", "6": "0.17937087"}}
