{"text": "This bra fits beautifully,  as all of my playtex bras do.I spent so long avoiding this brand, and i hate myself for it, All along i could have been happy, supported and comfortable. I guess as a younggirl/ teenager i thought of playtex as grannybras, but its not true.I wear a size 42D and thats what i ordered inthis bra, and it fits amazingly.Lots of support, no strap slippage, and it ispretty. But most importantly it is comfortable.I would recommend this bra, and any other styleby playtex.Also : If you go to playtex's website, there is achart on how to properly measure yourself forthe correct size bra. I did it, and was surprisedto find that, i was wearing the wrong size bra. Itold a few of my gal pals about it, they went onthe site and did the measurements, followed the chart,and they also, were wearing the  wrongsize.Hope this helps!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.02574543", "1": "0.1547731", "2": "0.10945776", "3": "0.25518143", "4": "0.27841374", "5": "0.03073487", "6": "0.14569369"}}
