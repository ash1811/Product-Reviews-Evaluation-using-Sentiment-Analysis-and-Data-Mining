{"text": "I got this for my husband as a gift. He loves sport and outdoor style watches. This one is easy to read and I think the analog face looks classier.  He hasn't managed to break it in about a year, which is a great track record for him. It looks like it cost more than it did. Does it look super expensive? No. But it doesn't look tacky and it seems appropriate for your average sized man (my husband is very tall but has slender wrists and hands).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.043785896", "1": "0.19268994", "2": "0.087786905", "3": "0.29483816", "4": "0.22519384", "5": "0.095016256", "6": "0.06068897"}}
