{"text": "I was hesitant to mail order shoe-wear but now I'm glad I did. I could not find anything nearby so I decided to shop online. Some shoes are actually less expensive online. These boots are a perfect fit with plenty of toe-room. 9.5 M is exactly right. And they look great. I haven't worn them for very long though. If there are any issues from wear and tear I'll update this review. Thanks Amazon! I think I'll be buying my shoes online from now on.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10369913", "1": "0.2180513", "2": "0.080719", "3": "0.067983136", "4": "0.16710803", "5": "0.28393197", "6": "0.078507386"}}
