{"text": "I have 4 of these t-shirts, 2 henleys and 1 lightweight t-shirt. Love them all. They look great, wear well and are as comfortable as any shirt you will own. The quality of the shirt is much higher than the 4-7 dollar t-shirts you will get at Wally World....these cost more but will last for years even with regular use and washing.--Beware of sizing, as many have already said, they run bigger....I wear an XL in EVERY other shirt I have but for these I wear a large. I am 6 ft tall, 225 lbs with broad shoulders and a 46 inch chest.Overall I LOVE these shirts!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.23779278", "1": "0.3493747", "2": "0.11559656", "3": "0.11765029", "4": "0.14076136", "6": "0.036349844"}}
