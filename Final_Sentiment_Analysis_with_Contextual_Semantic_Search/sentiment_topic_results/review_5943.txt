{"text": "Thank goodness I found this at Amazon! I moved to the Caribbean 7 years ago and brought 4 of these with me. With a very active life in this tropical climate, they were perfect. Just the right amount of support and quite comfortable. The first thing I did a few years later, on my first trip back to the States...was look for more! Now they are truly falling apart, but I say many years of hard use means they held up extremely well. I've tried many others but cannot get the fit as I get from these. I range from 38C to D and only once did a wire poke through.The antique beige works well, even under white linen shirts, and the tapestry design is smooth enough to work under quite thin fabrics. I'm not sure what people mean about \"show through\" as I teach...and am concerned about modesty, of course. Anyone who is full-figured and wants a great bra...this is it! (But save some for me.)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12466509", "1": "0.25920686", "2": "0.06980635", "3": "0.23450589", "4": "0.13919906", "5": "0.09055662", "6": "0.08206014"}}
