{"text": "I recently bought a McLaren Volo Dylan's Candy umbrella stroller for my grand daughter, Sophie (2-1/2) who travels with her mom quite a bit, and we'd like to protect the stroller as much as we can so it will last longer.I looked at various stroller travel bags and found that the JL Childress umbrella stroller travel bag is the best one.  The stroller fits inside the padded travel bag nicely with some room left so you can store other items i.e. toys, rain shield etc.  It's light, has a handle and fold neatly into square so you can store inside a bag pack until you have to pull out at the jet bridge for the stroller.  The best part is the price, under $30 for something so well made.  Any parents with nice expensive umbrella strollers who travel a lot with their todders should get one to protect your stroller from wear and tear, worth the purchase!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0695717", "1": "0.26208228", "2": "0.17820616", "3": "0.06953883", "4": "0.11269837", "5": "0.22961736", "6": "0.07828531"}}
