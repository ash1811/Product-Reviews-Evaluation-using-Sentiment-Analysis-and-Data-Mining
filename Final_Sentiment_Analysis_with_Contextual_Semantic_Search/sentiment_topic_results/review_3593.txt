{"text": "I wear a DD cup and many bras are uncomfortable.  I love the support this bra gives.  It is very comfortable to wear.  The straps stay in place, the band doesn't shift and ride up, the straps are comfortable on my shoulders.  I am a bit shorter and did have a bit of trouble with the wires digging into my upper arms.  I just worked a bit at adjusting the bra and making sure the band was further down on my body, but not too far so as to remove support.  This adjustment allowed the bra to fit comfortably, but I know that shorter torsoed women may have trouble with the underwires being a little too long for them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2449027", "2": "0.13400884", "3": "0.23621635", "4": "0.116959274", "5": "0.122576095", "6": "0.14282525"}}
