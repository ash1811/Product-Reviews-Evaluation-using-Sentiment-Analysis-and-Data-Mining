{"text": "This is my second Invicta, and I'm just as impressed with this one as I was with the first, an 8926 beveled bezel diver. The 8926 all stainless steel is an absolute workhorse. I've had it 6 years and it's still running strong. It is powered by a Miyota 21 jewel unidirectional wind automatic movement. It can be hand wound, but does not have the hack feature, and the rotor on the movement winds in only one direction, to the left. the rotor has a directional arrow on it. So it just spins in the other direction, quite rapidly if you move your wrist the right way. These Miyota movements are what is called indirect second hand movement, so over time they develop what is called second hand stutter or 'Miyota stutter', where the second hand will seem to get a little jerky in certain spots around the dial. It does not affect timekeeping. It went away after I had the watched cleaned and oiled. This is how I found out about this condition. I had it cleaned, oiled and timed for 40 bucks. Since I only paid 76.00USD + shipping, It was probably not worth it, but it's a great little watch, losing only a minute or two every other week. It now is on a Di-Modell Rallye waterproof leather strap, the steel band was scratched from normal wear. It has one of the smoothest screw down crowns I've felt. Rivals a Tag screw down, you can feel when it cushion against the inner crown gasket.Now, on to my new 8928OB. This has the TMI SII NH35A 24 jewel automatic movement. Amazon states this as being a 40mm diameter case, the same as the 8926. It is slightly bigger than the 8926, so i will have to measure to see which one is really 40 mm. It feels very good on the wrist, the case solid, but it looks like they laser engrave Invicta on the case now, because my 8926 has a solid, deep stamped logo. The band doesn't seem as solid as my 8926 ss band, but it does seem sturdy. The NH35A movement has the hack feature and so far is keeping good time, about ten seconds fast, very good for this movement, it will settle in. Bidirectional winding rotor. It's still a heavy watch. Very classy looking, and can easily be mistaken for a RSM. My only peeve, it doesn't have that nice, smooth screw down on the crown. It's a little rough feeling, but screws down tight. We'll see how this works out over time. Hopefully this one will prove to be as reliable as my 8926.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.0919543", "1": "0.037616745", "2": "0.04879179", "3": "0.282918", "4": "0.20188135", "5": "0.1360141", "6": "0.20082374"}}
