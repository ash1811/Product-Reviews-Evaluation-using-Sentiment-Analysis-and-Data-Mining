{"text": "I'm 5'7\", an athletic/curvy 150-5lbs and a 34DD up top, so I took the advice of other reviewers and sized up for extra room in the chest (got a 36, purple).  However, the back was so low cut and tight that it was incredibly uncomfortable to wear, right out of the package.  I don't think I could have sized up, either, since the chest area was just tight enough to hold the straps up properly.  I just think the low cut back is the problem - had it been just an inch higher in the back, it would have been totally comfortable.  As it was, though, I felt like I had back fat and might spill out of the back of it any second.  Yuck.On the plus side, returns were crazy easy and I was even eligible for a refund before shipping the item back (score one for the good guys).  I think if you're not quite as busty on top, this might fit a little more relaxed on you and be the perfect suit for lap swimming - it's nicely lined and I wanted to love it (especially because the purple is a great color).  However, it wasn't the one for me.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06882315", "1": "0.4454824", "2": "0.073494", "3": "0.28918657", "6": "0.11822338"}}
