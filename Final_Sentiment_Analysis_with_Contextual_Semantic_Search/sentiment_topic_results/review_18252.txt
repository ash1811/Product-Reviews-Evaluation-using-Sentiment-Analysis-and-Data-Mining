{"text": "This everyday watch looks great for the price and keeps great time. I like the bracelet snap closure, as the friction type always gets loose over time. The only negative is how hard it is to remove links from the bracelet. There are much easier ways to do this with other brands but this maker chose this clumsy method as it obviously costs less to make it this way. Took me an hour to remove 2 links and I am tool-handy. Very aggravating. I suggest that you have a jeweler do it for $10-15. I also suggest that all buyers get a jeweler's rouge cloth to keep the watch shiny and looking like new. I also clean all my watches with a cotton tip and rubbing alcohol every few months to remove dirt and skin oil. A bit of polishing after and they look new forever.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19589068", "1": "0.15654324", "2": "0.17652063", "3": "0.17618379", "4": "0.1399597", "5": "0.037164163", "6": "0.117737785"}}
