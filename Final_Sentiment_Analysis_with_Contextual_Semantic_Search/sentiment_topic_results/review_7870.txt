{"text": "Ordered these Van Skate shoes for my 10-yr-old grandson; they arrived just a couple of days ago. This is his third pair of Vans and I love that they have proved sturdy and always true to size.  The price was great (less than what I saw in retail stores), and they really look good.  He loves them because they are 'awesome!'", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07672438", "1": "0.42280594", "2": "0.08818663", "4": "0.16998927", "6": "0.23304692"}}
