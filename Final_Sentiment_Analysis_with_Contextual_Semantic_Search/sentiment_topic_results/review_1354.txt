{"text": "Originally ordered my usual shoe size 8 because there was *nothing* in the product description indicating to order up a 1/2 size.  I went to the Keen site and discovered it there. Perhaps TMI for some... my second toe on both feet is larger than my big toe. Order arrived and unfortunately it was too small.  Return was easy and painless.  I elected to exchange for an 8.5, same color.  After filling out the RMA request, Amazon emailed return shipping label and clearly explained how credit would be applied to my credit card.  Once amazon received the return and my exchange order had shipped, a full credit was issued.  BTW, the 8.5 fit perfectly.Great shoe!  Solid sole not to be confused with stiff.  Good arch support.  Toe box protection is key for us outdoor types.  Easily accomodates light wool socks.  Easy care.  Love color combination.  Shoes work when going to the office on casual day Friday - Pressed khaki capris and collared button down shirt.Liked the shoes so much, I ordered a pair of Newports (leather).", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16181915", "1": "0.24013901", "2": "0.1000826", "3": "0.19367748", "4": "0.1438997", "5": "0.06485369", "6": "0.09552838"}}
