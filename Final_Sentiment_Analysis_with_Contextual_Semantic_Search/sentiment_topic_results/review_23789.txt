{"text": "I love Vans skate shoes, I already owned some in different colors, so sizing wasn't an issue, just remember you'll probably fit into smaller size Vans than you would in a normal shoe.The red Vans I bought look super-cool, I love getting the chance to wear them out. If you're a teenager or young adult, then Vans are totally in style right now, and even if you don't skate they will give you a really cool youthful carefree look. So get yourself a pair of Vans!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.19269612", "1": "0.2663824", "2": "0.055948038", "3": "0.12263579", "5": "0.114032745", "6": "0.24536997"}}
