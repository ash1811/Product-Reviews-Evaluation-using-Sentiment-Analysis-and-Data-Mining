{"text": "First let me say I own 4 G-Shock watches. This one, the GA100SD-8A, DW6900 (White and Black). This one definitely has the smallest of all the watches faces & casing. So if you're looking for something LARGE and noticeable then this isn't the one.That being said, I absolutely love this watch. Aside from the military GA100SD-8A this has the best functionality in my mind -and definitely the most comfortable of all to wear. The band is wider than all other 3 watches and conforms to your wrist due to the design being much more modular and doesn't lay out straight in the least bit when you set it down. it actually is preforms into the shape of your round wrist so there's no &#34;bulginess&#34; you my get with typical new resin strapped watches. It has a great BACKLIT LED much like the other standard G-Shocks for the digital displays as well as glowing hands for the analog.Feature-wise the list is endless. I love being able to chose your time-zone (based on a code in the manual) and as I live in Ohio, it allows me to turn on or off the daylight savings time function. It then syncs the analog hand to the second to coincide with the digital display which I keep in 24hr format working in a hospital and need for medical chart documenting. It with the simple press of a button you can then see the GMT time it is based on and then go to its timer, countdown-timer, 1 of your 4 alarms, and so on. The main display also lets you easily swap between displaying the date or actual day (based on the mm, dd, yyyy entered during setup) and the setup is a breeze -5mins tops. I want to buy more at this price if this were to ever get lost, as I highly doubt it will ever get worn out or break based on it's construction. This stays on at work, in the pool, in the shower, while sleeping... most of the time because I forget it's even there. And a great alternative to the pop-culture &#34;military&#34; look of most other G-Shocks I own.It looks deceivingly simple, and simple looks sophisticated... worth every penny and would have paid more. Side note: There was some discrepancy on color from Casio's site and this. The color is solid black, metallic frame you see, and a charcoal gray face, no green like some have said.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08055115", "1": "0.25553742", "2": "0.19767733", "3": "0.18870682", "4": "0.03689436", "5": "0.14047912", "6": "0.1001538"}}
