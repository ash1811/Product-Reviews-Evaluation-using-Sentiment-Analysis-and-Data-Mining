{"text": "This shoe is extremely comfortable, looks good and is convenient.  Slips on and slips off.  No laces to tie or untie.  Really great for traveling and going thru those irritating TSA checkpoints at the airports.  The seller however I can not recommend.  When I orderd my Merrells, the seller had them listed as in stock, yet it took two emails...the second one threatening cancellation to finally get them shipped two weeks later.  BTW...this is my second pair.  The first pair were bought for me at a Merrell Store in Birmingham, Alabama and they are still going strong.  Just wanted another color.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09676657", "1": "0.3109713", "2": "0.10073252", "3": "0.29213873", "4": "0.032748755", "5": "0.03807897", "6": "0.1285632"}}
