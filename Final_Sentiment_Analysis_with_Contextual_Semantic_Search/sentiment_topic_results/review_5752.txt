{"text": "I purchased this shirt along with the competing Gildan t-shirt.Both are similar in nearly every detail.  After a few wash/wear cycles, I believe that I like the Gildan shirt slightly more.  The Gildan shirt seems to be slightly softer but only slightly.  I do wish that both shirts had a little bit more stretch to them, they are pretty stiff.Well worth the money !", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.16069585", "2": "0.088613465", "3": "0.25900546", "4": "0.042120196", "5": "0.25788787", "6": "0.1875833"}}
