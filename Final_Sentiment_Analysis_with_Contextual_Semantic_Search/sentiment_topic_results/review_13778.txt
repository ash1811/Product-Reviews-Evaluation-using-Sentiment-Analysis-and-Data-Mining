{"text": "I didn't realize how much support this simple sandal would provide to my feet but it was a godsend when I happened to take them with me (brand new) on a trip. Too much walking caused my feet to swell out of my shoes so began using the sandals. I really needed the foot support for my aching feet. Great price for a great fit and nice looking light weight sandal.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3286081", "2": "0.13181211", "3": "0.17250754", "4": "0.22065943", "5": "0.10543022", "6": "0.037282847"}}
