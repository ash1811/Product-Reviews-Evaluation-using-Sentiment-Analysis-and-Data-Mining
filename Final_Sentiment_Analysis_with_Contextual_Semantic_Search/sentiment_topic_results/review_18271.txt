{"text": "As a diabetic, I need to eat a little something every three hours and thought this watch with an alarm would be better than my iPhone alarm.  Wrong.....not only is the dial so small that you need a magnifying glass to see what it says, worse you cannot hear the alarm tone, even when we are in the house and it is quiet.  Sure wouldn't work in a store.I set the calendar but inadvertently transposed the day and date and after fiddling with it for over an hour, gave up and am sending it back.I bought another Polder clock/timer and I can see the time and hear the alarm and it counts up.  I'd pass on this Casio and look at the Polder timer.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.050876807", "1": "0.040099125", "2": "0.10108662", "3": "0.27180865", "4": "0.21963787", "5": "0.095750004", "6": "0.22074096"}}
