{"text": "I've worn these shoes for years.  Thy've been VERY kind to my feet.  The medium width is a good B size.  I bought my husband a pair of white ones last summer, which--miracles never cease--he's still wearing.  They're the only ones I've seen that are wide enough for him (He wears the XW.)  These shoes are good for walking and playing tennis.  I also wear an old pair to workout in the gym.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"2": "0.20961662", "3": "0.24976769", "4": "0.2185414", "5": "0.20854212", "6": "0.107153945"}}
