{"text": "I have purchased other Minnetonka moccasin's in the past.  I like them very much and they usually fit well.  This particular moccasin is OK in length...lengthwise it is just as to be expected however I ordered a Narrow width (as always) and it feels more like Medium.  I like the shoe very much and I'm going to try using a gel insert before I give up on them completely!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.57347256", "2": "0.16235498", "6": "0.24774562"}}
