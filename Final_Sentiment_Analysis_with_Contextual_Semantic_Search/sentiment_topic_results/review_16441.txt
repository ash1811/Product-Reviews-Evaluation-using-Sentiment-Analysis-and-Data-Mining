{"text": "I go through sunglasses like no tomorrow - I have a very on the go family and my sunglasses end up tossed into the glove box, my purse, wherever.  I usually buy a few pairs and keep them for a year or two.  I wanted a pair that looked cute but were affordable and you can't beat these sunglasses.  They're nice and large for lots of protection from the sun and give that fashionable Jackie O look that matches with every outfit.  My husband thought I looked adorable in them so that's always a bonus.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.072212", "1": "0.15329133", "2": "0.20901202", "3": "0.25069997", "4": "0.13116838", "5": "0.106186815", "6": "0.0774295"}}
