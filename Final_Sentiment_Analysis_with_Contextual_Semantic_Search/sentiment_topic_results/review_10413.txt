{"text": "The small size of these beautiful gold hoops makes them one of the most versatile earrings I own: they can be simple (for work), casual (with jeans and a sweater), or elegant (with a dress, if I want to keep the look low-key, or if I'm wearing a \"statement\" necklace requiring other jewelry to be minimal.)My one problem,resulting in the loss of one star, is that one of the clasps is so tight that it's difficult open and close the earring.  In hindsight, I should have returned them for another pair.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09027555", "1": "0.22925635", "2": "0.17526983", "3": "0.2327274", "4": "0.08020353", "5": "0.038428564", "6": "0.15383883"}}
