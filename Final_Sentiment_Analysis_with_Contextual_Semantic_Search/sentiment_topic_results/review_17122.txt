{"text": "Bought a pair of cheaper knock offs that gave my 21 month old daughter blisters in a very short time.  These shoes are fantastic!  They fit perfectly (bought the 6/7 for her, she is a 6.5 in other shoes).  I will definately be purchasing more of them.  The bright pink looks awesome--better than in the pics.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.3449368", "1": "0.1614145", "2": "0.16944657", "3": "0.12929833", "5": "0.14894721", "6": "0.041335672"}}
