{"text": "Simply put, these are the most comfortable underwear I've ever owned. I've had underwear that cost 6 times as much, including designer boxers, but the ComfortSoft waistband makes these more comfortable. Yes, they do tend to stretch out and turn more into boxers after time, but it does not bother me. If anything, they get even more comfortable. Plus, they cost about $2.50 a pair. If the get too loose, I'll just toss them out and buy new ones.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2752333", "2": "0.09936644", "3": "0.35095227", "4": "0.10262949", "5": "0.059792455", "6": "0.10876524"}}
