{"text": "These are really quite lovely, and comfy, but the run LARGE in size so i'd go down a size from your normal size. Unfortunately, i needed slippers, the others i have, also Amazon are small. I made the foolish mistake of wearing each pair because the were timely, but if i had to do it again, i'd probably sent em back for a size smaller. My cats are also drawn to these because they are fluffy, so what started at the foot of my bed at night, by morning they are tracked into kitchen or dining room. They are more than okay, they are actually keepers for me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13616401", "1": "0.15592645", "2": "0.05398602", "3": "0.31851476", "4": "0.22530586", "5": "0.068914585", "6": "0.041188303"}}
