{"text": "This is the second pair of Birkentock Milano's I've owned. They are made extremely well and conform to the shape of your foot. I got one a year ago and basically walked it into the ground, but was very pleased with the quality. Just picked up another pair from Amazon for about 35% off list price. I can't say enough good things about these. Highly recommended.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09245292", "1": "0.29179326", "2": "0.15122886", "3": "0.121477164", "4": "0.12709299", "5": "0.12075774", "6": "0.09519706"}}
