{"text": "Not really small I'd say, but not large like a backpack, it is just right for me (male, 5'11\" 170lbs, age 66). Good as a daypack. Waterproof, lots of padded pockets (big and little). Good flaps, magnetic closures (don't store magnitized strip credit cards near them), and zippers. It can hold a lot and quite a variety. Great quality. I will be using this mainly for travel and carry-on luggage. It is very versitile and lightweight and attractive. I do not understand why the price varies so much due to color. I highly recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps someone.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3526227", "2": "0.18889041", "3": "0.075028375", "4": "0.13806248", "5": "0.10521107", "6": "0.1379407"}}
