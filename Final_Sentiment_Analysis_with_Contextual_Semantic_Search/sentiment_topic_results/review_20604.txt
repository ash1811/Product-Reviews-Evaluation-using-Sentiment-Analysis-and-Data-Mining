{"text": "I bought two pairs of these in the grey and brown. The size was perfect. Remember that the toes on these are narrow and your feet have to break in the leather so at first it will be rather snug. But in time the snake skin will expand for a better fit. Very stylish boots. Can go with slacks, suit or jeans. If you have to polish, I would use a neutral wax. The skin on any snake skin boots usually sheds a little (edges on the scales gets loose or kinda stick up), but that's the charm with something of this quality. You won't find a better boot of this kind for this price!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.23241496", "2": "0.110373415", "3": "0.1043799", "4": "0.15381138", "5": "0.26437557", "6": "0.13213404"}}
