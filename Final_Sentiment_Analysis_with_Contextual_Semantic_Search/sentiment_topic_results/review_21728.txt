{"text": "I have used many spanx products in the past such as the higher power and power panty.  I needed tights to wear to a party so I ordered the spanx.  These tights are thick enough that they cover well but not super thick as to be overly warm.  They are comfortable and I can wear them all day.  They scrunch up a little in the ankles which I didn't notice the first time I wore them because I had on boots.  They are more durable than cheaper tights out there and come in a wide range of sizes.  These tights are great with boots and ok with flats which is why I gave them 4 stars.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08094952", "1": "0.24530469", "2": "0.09769243", "4": "0.107971385", "5": "0.3235802", "6": "0.14168954"}}
