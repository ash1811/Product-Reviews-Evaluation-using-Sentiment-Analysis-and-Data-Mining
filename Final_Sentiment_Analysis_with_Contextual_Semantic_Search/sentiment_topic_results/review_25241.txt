{"text": "I really really like them.  they fit in my ballet flats, flat boots, and trainers.  I can feel the support if I must walk for hours.  My first pair was the light blue full length insoles for my low/mid arch and i won't hike without them.  this is just as fantastic!I also got the version for heels but don't like them much.  nothing can make walking in a pair of high heels comfortable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11907388", "1": "0.26237446", "3": "0.27798763", "4": "0.13522813", "6": "0.19851527"}}
