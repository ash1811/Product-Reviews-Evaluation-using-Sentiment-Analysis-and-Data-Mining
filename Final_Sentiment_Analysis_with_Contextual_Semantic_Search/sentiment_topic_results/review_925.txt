{"text": "After trying Hanes underwear, I immediately returned to the one and only Jockey French Cut.  I have been wearing this brand and style of underwear for nearly 25 years, as my body has gone through all shapes and sizes -- and they are the best.  They are cut for a full size rear end, which I have always had and still do!  Non-binding, comfortable, fit well.  I love these underwear.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.051422417", "1": "0.3693165", "2": "0.09070561", "3": "0.3364599", "5": "0.04734302", "6": "0.100771755"}}
