{"text": "I ordered this polish to help give new life to my Allen Edmonds Benton shoe in the Chili color. This polish matched perfectly and made it look like it had come back from the factory. It is a cream polish so it will add some color back to a faded shoe and also make the leather feel more supple.The applicator has a sponge on the end of it allowing you to squeeze the tube and use it to apply the polish without having anything else. I would recommend using a soft horse hair brush to buff to a shine after letting the polish sit on the shoe until it is dry. It should take no more than 10 minutes in normal conditions for it to dry.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1302151", "1": "0.18443695", "2": "0.16413353", "3": "0.09221259", "4": "0.07630338", "5": "0.07235017", "6": "0.2803483"}}
