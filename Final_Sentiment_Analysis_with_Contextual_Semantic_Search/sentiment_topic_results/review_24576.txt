{"text": "I like to wear a leotard inside my racerback workout wear as I do not like to wear sleeveless. The material is so good that it doesn't lose the color or the shape even after several washes. I have Danskin leotard which loses both in couple of washes. The price of this piece is higher compared to Danskin but you get what you pay for and hence it feels so good when you wear. It made me look slim too and I felt like I was wearing a shapewear. I am a 5'4&#34; and 124 lbs and a small fit me very well. I am ordering it in few more colors.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.069135465", "1": "0.3238825", "2": "0.046160206", "3": "0.16696002", "4": "0.11356908", "5": "0.17960483", "6": "0.10068794"}}
