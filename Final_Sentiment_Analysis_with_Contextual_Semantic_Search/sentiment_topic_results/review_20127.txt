{"text": "I am currently using this backpack for college and I love it. It is plenty roomy and offers a lot of space to store stuff and even different straps to fit comfortably as well as expand if need be. I was concerned about the color when I first ordered it, I had wanted a darker color, however the price difference was something like an additional $30.00, so I stuck with the white/teal combo. I really like the colors and they do not seem to bright or easily stained (which is what I was worried about). I really like this bag and it has many uses rather for school, work, traveling or outdoor activities. I highly recommend it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20611224", "1": "0.35440964", "2": "0.19125685", "3": "0.06424095", "4": "0.0934004", "5": "0.06104595", "6": "0.029534018"}}
