{"text": "I have several other pairs of slippers for winter, and these are my absolute favorite. they're so warm and comfortable. My only two complaints though are that I'd like to see a more supportive footbed. Also, they do run a full size too small, so be sure to order one size up. I did so at the recommendation of the other reviewers, and they were right. The sole of the slipper is also non-slip.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07885086", "1": "0.19360167", "2": "0.12638028", "3": "0.21070513", "4": "0.25979564", "6": "0.12655497"}}
