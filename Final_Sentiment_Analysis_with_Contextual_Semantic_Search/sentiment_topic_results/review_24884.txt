{"text": "Since it is warming up I am going towards nightgowns and the ones I have I have had for so long I needed new ones so I ordered two from amazon, this being one. I love this very delicate looking and feeling long ivory gown. The lacey detail around the top is so beautiful and so very soft.  Most importantly it feels so soft, like nothing, and for me that is the real test of a nightgown. But if you have someone to sleep with they will love the way you look in it too.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05633622", "1": "0.2774334", "2": "0.081382014", "3": "0.11758509", "4": "0.2593886", "6": "0.20445007"}}
