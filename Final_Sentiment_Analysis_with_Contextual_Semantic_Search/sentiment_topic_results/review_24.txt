{"text": "Fits too large for me. I should have got a medium which would probably fit close to perfect. The quality of the shirt is good for the price paid. It can loose it's softness after only a few washes. I would suggest a lower temperature setting when you're washing the shirt. It has a pretty big tag on the inside of the shirt which can be annoying at times. I will use this as a night time shirt for when I go to bed. Overall it's okay, but don't expect too much from it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15086006", "1": "0.6387141", "4": "0.04437384", "5": "0.07565931", "6": "0.08386779"}}
