{"text": "I love, love, love this little purse and I am not a cross body purse kinda gal. I bought this because I work with children and need to keep my phone on me at all times during work and my hands free. Carrying my phone around did NOT work. I would put it down and forget where I put it. Now my phone is safe and sound and goes with me everywhere and I never forget it. I haven't had a cross body before as I do not really care for their visual appeal compared to shoulder bags. However, for convienance reasons I am completely sold!! I was a little taken back by the price of this mini bag (I guess I am cheap, I dont know) but I am glad I got it. I use it all day every day and it works exactly as it was intended. I also keep my lip balm in it and some gum.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.3039129", "2": "0.13549192", "3": "0.20008853", "4": "0.14949416", "6": "0.20614544"}}
