{"text": "My Domke F-2 arrived yesterday along with the extra padded internal compartment.I decided against the waxed leather because of the reviews where people said that the wax would rub off and instead went with Olive Drab.I moved my outfit into the bag and found that it could hold more than I expected, but of course a lot less than my much larger backpack.The Canon 5D Mark III fits with either the 50mm f/1.4 or the 20-35mm F/2.8L mounted.  The 70-200mm f/2.8L IS will just fit in the compartment with the lenshood reversed. However, the mounting end sticks \"up\" a little more than I would really like. The biggest thing I noticed was a lack of padding in the top flap, I can \"feel\" the endcap on the 70-200 through it. There is a zippered inside pocket on the flap, so I'll probably insert a piece of thinsulite or thin foam in it to give it just a little more padding on top as a \"comfort\"I fit the above lenses, the 2x teleconverter, 430EXii Flash, and accessories inside the main compartment. It's snug, but workable.  If I need more than that, I'd probably carry the full size backpack instead (even with the extra weight)I like the well made clips, backed up with a large velcro closure. While the velcro is not \"silent\" for street shooting, the combination will help to make sure that the bag stays closed.The strap is nice and wide, fully adjustable and goes all the way under the bag for extra strength.  There are two large end pockets big enough to carry accessories. Fully loaded, it is heavy, but manageable.Since I didn't get the waxed leather, I plan on spraying it down with some Kiwi Campdry or ScotchGuard to give it a little water repellancy on the outside.After the next few weeks of trips I'll update", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.24526422", "1": "0.17724647", "2": "0.1430865", "3": "0.1351532", "4": "0.09732326", "5": "0.08834779", "6": "0.11357853"}}
