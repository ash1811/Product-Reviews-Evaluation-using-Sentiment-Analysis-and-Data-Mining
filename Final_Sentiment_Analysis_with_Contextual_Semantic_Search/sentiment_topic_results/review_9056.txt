{"text": "I love the look of these boat shoes! I got the blue and white ones, and they go great with faded jeans- The only thing I don't like is that there's no support, but I guess that's how deck shoes are- Sebago makes wonderful shoes, I have two pairs of their loafers, and they are best very best I have ever owned. These boat shoes are very comfortable right out of the box.
