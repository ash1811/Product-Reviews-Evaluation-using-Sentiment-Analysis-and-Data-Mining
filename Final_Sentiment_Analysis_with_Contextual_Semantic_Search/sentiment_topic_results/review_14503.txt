{"text": "I ordered these on the grounds that I needed a taller size. I loved the color, but they came up only midway up my buttcrack. When I did the 'crouch down' test they revealed much, much more. The legs and fit indicated they were not original fitting as the leg stayed the same width all the way down the leg. All in all, what I ordered was completely different from what I thought I was ordering. If you're a tall guy like me, don't get them.Other than that, I'm giving them two stars rather than one for nice quality and color.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18260907", "1": "0.3200689", "2": "0.09883407", "3": "0.08621351", "4": "0.14417449", "5": "0.16522716"}}
