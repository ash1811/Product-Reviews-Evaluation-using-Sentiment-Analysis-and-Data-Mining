{"text": "I have had these for almost 2 years and I still love them!  This was my first pair of Reefs and I don't plan on going back to the Rainbows I previously wore.  They are way more comfortable and felt great the first time I put them on.  The color (bronze/brown) looks exactly the same as the picture.  They have withstood daily wear and still look great.  No foot stink like some people complain of with leather sandals.  They are true to size.  I don't know what else to say, I love em!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1480136", "1": "0.29321554", "2": "0.10177896", "3": "0.19431953", "4": "0.085266076", "5": "0.15508267", "6": "0.02232359"}}
