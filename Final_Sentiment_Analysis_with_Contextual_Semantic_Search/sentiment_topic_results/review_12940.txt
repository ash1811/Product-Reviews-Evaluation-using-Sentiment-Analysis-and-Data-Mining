{"text": "This is an excellent slip on sneaker.  It is very comfortable and does not slip off. I would buy one size larger as they are a little narrow and run small.  The tongue is a little short so you have to pull it up for it to be comfortable. The sneaker is light and very, very comfortable.  I was so excited when I slipped my feet into them. I cant wait to wear them on vacation and through out the summer!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.27529636", "1": "0.2285008", "2": "0.2207321", "3": "0.19903055", "5": "0.06799334"}}
