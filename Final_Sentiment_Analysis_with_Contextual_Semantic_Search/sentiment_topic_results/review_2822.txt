{"text": "The quality of KEDS has deteriorated sooo much recently. This pair was terrible. Extremely stiff, terrible material, and the support was non existent. I wore them for a week, and because of the quality, I lost feeling in my big toe for almost a month. The tightness of the shoe at the top damaged a nerve in my toe. Also, after that happened, I bought shoe stretcher in the hopes of wearing them comfortably, but not even the shoe stretcher helped. I cant return the shoes any more because I wore them constantly trying to break them in, but I will never buy KEDS again. And I threw out the pair that I did buy. I would look around for another shoe brand, KEDS are not the same as they used to be.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.28237638", "2": "0.16440362", "3": "0.26666623", "4": "0.09792264", "5": "0.11047478", "6": "0.075800784"}}
