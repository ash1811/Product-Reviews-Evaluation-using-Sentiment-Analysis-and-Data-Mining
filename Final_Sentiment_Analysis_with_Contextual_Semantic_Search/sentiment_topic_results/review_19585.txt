{"text": "after reading the reviews for this bra I took the plunge and tried it. It fits well and gives beautiful ample cleavage without being overkill. I gotta say though, this is one stiff bra. I dont think I can get it in a drawer without smashing its form. it seems to be very heavy neoprene, there will be no 'nips' showing thru. Also, trying on this bra... You know how we do ladies, put bra on backwards to close the hooks and turn to the front. It was a struggle to turn this bra around to the front. I will fight the good fight for this bra because it looks so great on.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08828231", "1": "0.20464052", "2": "0.1570258", "3": "0.27878448", "4": "0.19240768", "5": "0.028689846", "6": "0.050169352"}}
