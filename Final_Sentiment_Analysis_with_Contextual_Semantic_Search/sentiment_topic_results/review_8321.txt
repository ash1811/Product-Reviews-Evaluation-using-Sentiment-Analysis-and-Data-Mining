{"text": "I love this hat! Tilley makes wonderful hats, and HEMP is a fantastic material --- stronger and lighter than cotton and very durable. Tilley's unique chin-strap system works well, but a Tilly dealer in Key West shared a better solution: Take the front strap and tuck it up, but pull the rear strap down under your chin and tuck it behind your ears --- THEN tighten the strap with the 2 knots --- it holds MUCH better this way and is much more comfortable. I advise anyone buying one of these hats to be sure to try the hat on while wearing their sunglasses, as it can affect the fit slightly (depending on the shape of your head) --- The bows of the sunglasses may need to be under the headband behind your ears (or maybe not) --- so wear your sunglasses when you test for size. OH, AND BE SURE TO FOLLOW TILLEY'S SIZING RECOMMENDATIONS! Most people will be inclined to get a hat that is too tight.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10177205", "1": "0.18720514", "2": "0.21324627", "3": "0.26281825", "4": "0.03441469", "5": "0.12488459", "6": "0.075659044"}}
