{"text": "The watch is very attractive.  I do like the fact that it is so thin.  However, after receiving it I have found that I prefere a solid blue face as compared to this more modern style of the blue appearing differently depending on how the light happens to be hitting it.  This is personal taste, I just found that for me I don't particularly care for it.  It is a very beautiful watch and extremely light on the wrist, so even though I found I don't personally care for the style after receiving it I still gave it five stars.  I will be giving it to a friend for a holiday gift.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.31896266", "2": "0.1957465", "3": "0.13261427", "4": "0.089565046", "5": "0.13712014", "6": "0.12312256"}}
