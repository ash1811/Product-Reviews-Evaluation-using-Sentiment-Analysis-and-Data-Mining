{"text": "I love my Birkenstock Boston Clogs.  I have owned several pairs of these shoes since I was in high school and I keep coming back to purchase more.  These are the most comfortable all weather slip-ons that I have ever owned.  If you are on the fence, don't hesitate.  You will love them forever.  Here's a tip I wish someone would have told me years ago.  In general, women should purchase the narrow size while men should purchase the regular size.  I normally wear a size 8.5 (regular width) in women's flat shoes, and the 39N fits me perfectly.  Try this classic style.  The comfort and quality will not disappoint.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04416131", "1": "0.36048624", "2": "0.15869083", "3": "0.180779", "4": "0.14741918", "6": "0.10610412"}}
