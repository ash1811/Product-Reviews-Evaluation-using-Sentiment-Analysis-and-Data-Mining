{"text": "This pair of Uggs was a Christmas present to my wife.  She loves the boots and they are certainly up to the Ugg quality standards.  The price on these boots is almost three times what one can find with a knock-off brand that has the Ugg look.  I think it is probably worth it to go with the \"real\" Ugg boots since the high quality is obvious. These Uggs are well made and the suede leather looks great. The fit was accurate to the size and the Mrs. says they are really warm. Time will tell if the boots hold up with wear, but it sure looks like they would.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11780133", "1": "0.38328242", "2": "0.10478444", "3": "0.12471068", "4": "0.15171757", "6": "0.11519093"}}
