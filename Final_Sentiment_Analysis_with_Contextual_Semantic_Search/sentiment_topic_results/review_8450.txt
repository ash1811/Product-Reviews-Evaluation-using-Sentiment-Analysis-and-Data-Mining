{"text": "I have wide hips and fit most full, non thigh-hi nylons without difficulty. They pucker a bit at my middle on some, but I was almost unable to get this pair to my middle, which is a first for me. If you're a big wide in the hips (I wear a pant size around 11-12 depending on if they are from the juniors or womens departments) and I know I have curvy thighs too but I didn't expect to have difficulty fitting into these. I rarely have problems fitting into one-size items and only on thigh-highs like I said. Might want to up to the plus or shop elswhere if you're unsure if you'll fit, too.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06977149", "1": "0.40644968", "2": "0.080761164", "3": "0.2502116", "4": "0.07841805", "6": "0.111869484"}}
