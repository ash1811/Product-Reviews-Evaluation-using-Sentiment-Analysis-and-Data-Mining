{"text": "When I was a kid, these boots were all the rage--but my parents wouldn't buy me a pair.  Finally, for my 50th birthday, I treated myself!  They make me happy.  They also make my feet look TINY, and that's always nice.  I'm a size 7; these are a perfect fit.  They're going to require some breaking in, but generally are pretty comfy right out of the box.  I wish they were a little taller in the shaft, but then they wouldn't be the classic Frye Campus boot!  Love the saddle color.  I can't imagine how these boots will EVER wear out!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.143102", "1": "0.17478545", "2": "0.11080307", "3": "0.15013607", "4": "0.25154153", "5": "0.16697219"}}
