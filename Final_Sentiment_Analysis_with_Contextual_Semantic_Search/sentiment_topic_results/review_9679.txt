{"text": "Great design with large face numbers making it very easy to read the time. The indiglo feature is excellent as it brightly lights up the face of the watch as the button is pressed down, making it easy to read the time even at night. The watch accurately keeps the time as well, so there is no need to frequently adjust it. As others have mentioned though the seconds hand is a bit loud and that could get annoying for some people. I'm the kind of person who wears their watch 24/7 and it's something I notice all throughout the day if my hand is in the right position and the room is quiet enough, and while sleeping. It doesn't really bother me though, but I can understand how it would be a problem for others.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10337848", "1": "0.19430758", "2": "0.24436423", "3": "0.18204854", "4": "0.09903652", "5": "0.1061006", "6": "0.070764035"}}
