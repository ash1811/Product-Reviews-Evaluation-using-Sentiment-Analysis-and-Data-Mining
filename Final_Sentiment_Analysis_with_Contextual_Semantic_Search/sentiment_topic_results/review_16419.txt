{"text": "Like a lot of folks I ordered too big the first go around.  I have a 38\" waist and got the xl first...well the xl covers 39-44 or so.  The L covers 35-38 and is perfect.  It's not really urban camo, just the regular snow camo pattern from years back.  I'm glad to have found this pattern again,,,they match a lot of shirts and cover a lot of mess while working.  The look really durable and I'll probably get their vintage camo pattern next :)  Good stuff!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.040781397", "1": "0.17362422", "2": "0.08942837", "3": "0.14012343", "4": "0.19268367", "5": "0.24001454", "6": "0.12334437"}}
