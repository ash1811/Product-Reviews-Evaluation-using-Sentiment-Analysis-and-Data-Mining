{"text": "They've lasted over a year and they were perfect from Day One.  They fit well, they haven't lost their elasticity, and the colors stayed pretty true.  I love that they go up your ankle roughly two inches, way more than other Pilates socks I've bought since.  Other socks are too low.  Oh, and the actual sock fabric is nice and sturdy - not a cheap loosely-knit sock.Also, the grips on the bottom lasted quite longer than other brands, though they all lose their grip too soon.  After roughly 17 months, ready to get a new pair.  They are still usable except I'm slipping and sliding.  All-in-alll, I believe I got my money's worth.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.051441867", "1": "0.17185494", "2": "0.08079885", "3": "0.276258", "4": "0.09502333", "5": "0.21727778", "6": "0.10734521"}}
