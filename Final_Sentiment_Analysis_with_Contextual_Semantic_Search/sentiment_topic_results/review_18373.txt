{"text": "I am a watch fan and wanted an everyday good, durable watch.  I wanted something that was light weight, self-winding, and had glowing hand and hour markers.  I wanted a self-winding watch because I didn't want to worry about batteries.  Well, This watch had it all.  Granted, it's not self-winding; however, it does have Eco-drive technology.  Eco-drive is powered by solar energy, eliminating the need for batteries.  Most decent self-winding watches are over $500, so for a watch that doesn't need batteries, has titanium, and is just over 200 bucks...you can't beat it.  I love it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10710184", "1": "0.17722104", "2": "0.23066862", "3": "0.29697874", "4": "0.10495469", "6": "0.08037007"}}
