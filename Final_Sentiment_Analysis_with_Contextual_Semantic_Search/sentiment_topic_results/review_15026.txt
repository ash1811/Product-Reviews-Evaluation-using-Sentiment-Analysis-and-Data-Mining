{"text": "I bought these to go with my pirate costume. I wear a size 12 shoe and had a VERY hard time getting them over my shoes but I was careful and didn't rip anything. I've removed one star because in order to keep them looking good, you MUST safety pin or tape them to your pants, otherwise, like others have said, they will droop down and sit around your ankles. Other than that, they look great. Button detail is good, the laces look excellent. It's nice to be able to wear any ol' pair of comfortable dress shoes and they look like awesome pirate boots!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1401776", "1": "0.3314648", "2": "0.18239613", "3": "0.2340773", "4": "0.055379428", "5": "0.054072104"}}
