{"text": "I was looking for driving mocs that were easy to slip in and out of.  These shoes are extremely comfortable.  I got a half size up than normal, and they fit great, but my normal size would have been just fine too I think.  Not in style, but certainly not a Member's Only jacket either.  They make a pitter-patter on the floor like you're a little elf, but what the heck.  Functional, comfortable, and high quality.  I love Cole Haan!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.26601046", "1": "0.20260422", "2": "0.13917105", "3": "0.22728804", "4": "0.047221716", "6": "0.11412686"}}
