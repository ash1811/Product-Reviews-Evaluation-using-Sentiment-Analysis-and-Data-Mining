{"text": "I have several Luminox watches and they are all great. This is the original. It is very light (the description here says that the case is steel, but I don't think so: it is hard plastic). The watch is very nice and durable. I am totally happy with mine. They are really great watches, very bright at night (unlike most watches). I highly recommend this watch, especially at the price listed. The only minor thing is that the thing that you set the time with is not screw-down, which \"purists\" don't like. The watch is very accurate.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09116018", "1": "0.25892526", "2": "0.40687817", "4": "0.08884393", "6": "0.14782923"}}
