{"text": "I work in an office setting so I actually don't walk very much in these shoes but I wear them about 4 times a week.  They are very comfortable and don't set off security alarms when walking through (a huge plus for me) but within a few months I began to feel ashamed to wear them because they started to look scraggly.  Also the sole is coming loose from the shoe and I've even wondered about buying some glue.  For the money I'm disapointed in the wear.  IF more quality were put into these I'd buy them over and over.  I will say that I own several Merrell and love them all. It's hard for me to find shoes I can wear all day from the moment they come out of the box without breaking them in in some way but so far I'm able to do that with Merrill!  I do buy a 1/2 size larger than normal though because for me they are made small. Just wish they held up better.That being said I find I can't bring myself to buy Merrell anymore.  The soles do NOT last, they come loose, the leather is so thin white comes through.. it's just a shame!  These are really made much like a very cheap shoe would be and they do NOT last.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03709396", "1": "0.24894403", "2": "0.10438239", "3": "0.20870782", "4": "0.13311201", "5": "0.17507839", "6": "0.09268135"}}
