{"text": "I was so dissappointed to see how cheap this watch looks after it arrived. I have worn it only once and will probably give it away. If you do not adjust the band to fit the watch will spin around your wrist as the watch itself is top heavy. The watch stem looked tarnished when it arrived and the band is very dull.  I have seen $10 watches at Wal Mart that are better looking.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.117874295", "1": "0.081908815", "2": "0.37063307", "3": "0.08003762", "4": "0.12545037", "5": "0.10881279", "6": "0.11528304"}}
