{"text": "I bought these for my boyfriend who has been wearing two pairs of the same pants for nearly every other day of the week for at least 5 years.  They held up well, but are looking drab and worn out.  So I got these and was surprised to find they are just as good of a quality as the old pair.  I have become so used to companies going to lower quality materials in the past few years, but these were still very nice.  My only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the stitching seemed to be a bit off/uneven on the waistline - like they got past quality control and maybe should have been marked as irregular.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.44977316", "3": "0.2159335", "5": "0.14306064", "6": "0.18341412"}}
