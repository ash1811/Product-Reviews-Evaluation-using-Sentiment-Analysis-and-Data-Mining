{"text": "Unlike most sellers they take 10 business days just to ship unless you pay extra. I don't mind waiting a few days extra for delivery, but their failure to even register a tracking number makes it very difficult to know when to expect delivery of the product.I'm not disatisfied with the underwear, I don't expect great quality for the price.
