{"text": "I bought these in 3 different sizes trying to find the right one. The size chart is not helpful for these briefs because the size chart does not ask for hip measurements. It assumes that the bust and waist are proportioned to the hips and mine are not. My size in these ended up being XXL and I have never worn anything bigger than a size Large before. Even then, the leg holes are kind of restricting and I worried about losing circulation to my legs. Haha. I returned all of them and went with different shapewear.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07758617", "1": "0.0804421", "2": "0.23362346", "3": "0.2345861", "4": "0.15174228", "6": "0.21915513"}}
