{"text": "My sister gave me this watch as a Christmas gift last month and I was floored when I opened it! Yes I was the one who picked it out by adding it to my \"wish list\", but seeing it in front of me I couldn't believe my eyes! As stated by someone else already the watch is BIG, BEAUTIFUL and BOLD!!! I love and collect watches and this one just shot straight to the #1 spot. I wouldn't use it as a everyday watch, but i can't wait to have fun dressing it up(sexy dress) and down(jeans/sweater).", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1905914", "1": "0.10703908", "2": "0.28559858", "3": "0.041968014", "4": "0.19067593", "5": "0.18108155"}}
