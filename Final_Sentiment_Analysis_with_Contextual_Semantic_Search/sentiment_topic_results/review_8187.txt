{"text": "I used the vampire blood, crayons, paints, glitter so far and everything works as it should. It lasted all night (4 hours on both me and my 4 year old daughter).... only down side is the vampire blood I got was not as pictured it had a screw top and had a wide big hole so it was harder to make the vampire drips on the side of my mouths unlike if i would have gotten the one as pictured that had a pointed top it would have been easier but I still got it to work and next time Im using the blood capsules and cutting the tip and see if that works easier. worth the money.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24392799", "1": "0.101788744", "2": "0.11491981", "3": "0.20892555", "4": "0.06857919", "5": "0.15264125", "6": "0.109217465"}}
