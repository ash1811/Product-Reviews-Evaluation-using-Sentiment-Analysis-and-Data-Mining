{"text": "I tend to buy watches on sale and picked up this one for $49 and change about a month ago. It has been an excellent performer in this time period, averaging about 6 secs per day fast. The watch has a very readable face and the nylon band is quite comfortable ...it's so light, you almost forget you're wearing it. I have 4 other Seiko 5 series watches and of all of them, this one is the most accurate and cheapest one of the bunch. Get it on sale if you can!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.052488092", "1": "0.25614098", "2": "0.33717215", "3": "0.03138396", "4": "0.16670404", "6": "0.15313037"}}
