{"text": "Got these as a present, they were bought from Amazon. Look-wise, exactly as the picture shows. They come up to about mid-calf and look okay with skinny jeans tucked in or leggings.The bad- size runs big, get 1/2 size smaller. I normally wear an 8, but these are about 1/2 size to big. The inner boot is not lined, only the shaft is. On a cold day, you would need to wear some thick socks- maybe that's where the 1/2 size extra room would come into play. Foot bed is not very comfortable, might as well be walking on a wood sole. The top of the boot is floppy. even all the way laced, zipped, and buckled (actually velcro but will come back to that) the boot is floppy.  There is a small, very slender, \"buckle\" that is actually velcro. It does not do anything but be annoying since the area underneath bulges if you velcro too tight, and the side of the boot is floppy if too loose.Overall, the boot is just okay. Not my favorite and won't be wearing it a whole lot. Moot point since I bought them for cold, snowy winters, and the foot of the boot is not warm but actually quite thin.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.043055236", "1": "0.18679942", "2": "0.059061684", "3": "0.35744554", "4": "0.14289823", "5": "0.124019735", "6": "0.08672016"}}
