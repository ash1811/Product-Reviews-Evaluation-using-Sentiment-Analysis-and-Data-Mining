{"text": "I have an Invicta watch that I received and it was WAY too big when I got it. I didnt' want to take it down to my local store and have them charge me $15 to resize it so I ordered this tool and it worked perfectly.I do have a complaint though...The points you screw on to push the pin out, on mine they screwed on straight, but the dial you turned to push it into the hole on the link was NOT straight so as you spun it the point was spinning off center. It made lining up the hold with the point very difficult.Once I got the point into the hole I had no issues at all, just took a little extra focus, but I saved money so It was not that big of a deal.Do note, at least on the Invicta watch, on the back side of the links are arrows, it points in the direction the link pin pushes out, if you push the opposite direction of the arrows the pin will NOT come out and you'll probably break one of the tips on the pusher tool.That being said, it does come with multiple tips which is a good thing. Another bad thing, no directions come with this tool. You need to find them online.If you have a watch and need to resize it, this works, there are more expensive ones you can get but why would you?", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14620772", "1": "0.21905348", "2": "0.13983603", "3": "0.041077852", "4": "0.14198075", "5": "0.06247616", "6": "0.24936798"}}
