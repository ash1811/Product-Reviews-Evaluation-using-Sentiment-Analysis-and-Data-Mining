{"text": "I don't think I can speak highly enough about these boots.  They're my second pair of Frye's--had the same Campus Frye's years ago in a color that seems to be discontinued--the color Walnut.Those these in the 'Blazer Brown' are equally wonderful!!!The color, a deep, dark brown, is simply the most beautiful color EVER and the heel color is outstanding--a nice deep, dark brown too.What I like about these boots is that they seem to be made for my feet.  It's like there's this padding that cushions and holds your foot in place.  It's not just leather in there, but some kind of way that it's built, it just holds and hugs your foot.Looking at the info. card that comes with the boots, it's so great to see that Frye's are still made in the Great US of A!!!  And that it takes over 180 steps to make these boots.  I can't imagine another company going to these lenghths.Please, I hope everyone if they ever get a chance, please give these boots a chance and at least try them on for size.  I think you'll be glad you did!!!Cheers Frye!!!You guys ROCK!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1724677", "1": "0.33688372", "2": "0.087540045", "3": "0.070541285", "4": "0.11920149", "5": "0.14575218", "6": "0.067613594"}}
