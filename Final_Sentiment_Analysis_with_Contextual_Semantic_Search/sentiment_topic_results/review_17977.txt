{"text": "Good, inexpensive running watch.  I'm on my third.  Batteries last a couple of years and technically they're replaceable but I've never been able to get the watch to reseal after changing the batteries, so when you see fog inside the &#34;crystal&#34; you know it's too late.  Batteries last about 3 years so in essence the watch lasts three years.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.05767366", "1": "0.18467663", "2": "0.15494227", "3": "0.21802707", "4": "0.120833896", "5": "0.16283017", "6": "0.10101629"}}
