{"text": "I will have to return these as Pewter is not what is shown.  Pewter is supposed to be GREY!  the on line photo shows a nice, warm medium semi neutral color.  Instead what you get is something which leans more towards a dull gold mixed with a pale greenish tinge more like aged worn dull brass.  Not what I can use... also the main straps do not quite cover all the velcro pad so a little of it sticks out to catch dust and bits.  Ok fit but could have a tad more in the arch.  sigh.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11861774", "1": "0.2611512", "2": "0.13832083", "3": "0.12857436", "4": "0.15264301", "5": "0.040647518", "6": "0.16004534"}}
