{"text": "We bought a pair for an older child who wore out lesser, cheaper brands in a few months. With one brand we had trouble with the rubber sole separating from the rest of the sandal. Sometimes you could fix it with Shoe Goo, sometimes not. I recognized Columbia as a good brand and bought a pair on the large side, since he is still growing. So far we're doing fine. One can tell by inspection it is a much better sandal than sandals selling for half the price. So, though it is more expensive than some other brands at department stores, I think this is a good value in the long run. Comfortable and attractive, too.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08538348", "1": "0.19892725", "2": "0.30969587", "3": "0.23664673", "5": "0.085280985", "6": "0.081779964"}}
