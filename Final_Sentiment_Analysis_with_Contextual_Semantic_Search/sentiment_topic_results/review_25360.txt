{"text": "Purchased this product twice now from the same company.these hats are great and are adjustable.I go through alot of hats and these hats last.The ones I bought prior were in June 2007 and now its April 2012 and the ones i have are still wearable and one is just now starting to fray on the bream. Long lasting, great product.When needed I will buy again , well in a few more years as these will last awhile .I wanted two more just to have as I use alot of hats and I get alot of material on them, paint, dirt, tar, chemicals etc etc and after so many washes they eventually wear out so far only one is worn enough i may have to throw it away in a few months maybe.Great product and great price.Highly recommend this product from this seller !!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.24062274", "2": "0.24700138", "3": "0.23342873", "4": "0.08316667", "5": "0.114042476", "6": "0.079393156"}}
