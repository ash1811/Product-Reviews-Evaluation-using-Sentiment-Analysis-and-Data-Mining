{"text": "This case is surprisingly huge!  I bought this one because my Flak Jackets are pretty large, and they don't fit in normal glasses cases.  This case is great for protecting the glasses, but it's so big that I can't really carry it in a pocket, jacket, or laptop bag. I can only fit the case in my largest backpack, so that's the only time I use it, and only for long trips. For short trips, I just have to keep the glasses in my pocket because this case is too huge to carry.I wish there were a better hard case that was designed for the size of the Flak Jacket, and not so much bigger that it can't fit in a pocket.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1753402", "1": "0.2599875", "2": "0.23954856", "3": "0.24811654", "4": "0.0718872"}}
