{"text": "Fabric is scratchy but after a couple of washes, it relaxed and lost its scratch.  Nice 100% cotton, not thin enough to see through but a thinner cotton fabric than the Anvil t-shirt.  Color is as shown (at least on my monitor) and has weathered many washings without fading or shrinking.  Not fancy or fitted but a good, basic, comfortable t-shirt.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08536281", "1": "0.28017297", "3": "0.13602622", "4": "0.20062554", "5": "0.119815364", "6": "0.17401741"}}
