{"text": "This is a pretty good shoe for those special occasions, but proper sizing may take a couple of atttempts.  In reading prior reviews, it was hard to say because some said it was too big; others said it was too small.  Well, I have to vote for the too big side.  If your kid is new to wearing a size 9, you might want to order an 8.5.  If he is nearing the end of his size 9 days, order a size 9.  Get it?  Shoe has nice rubber soles and is easy to get on with the elastic in the lip.  I reordered once.  Despite the sizing issue, I would order this product again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15666002", "1": "0.26218528", "2": "0.054985467", "3": "0.09433332", "4": "0.10308332", "5": "0.16737027", "6": "0.16138233"}}
