{"text": "When our church started taking collections for school supplies and backpacks, I knew I would order nothing but a Jansport.  It's a good size, carries a decent amount of supplies (I stuffed it full of supplies, including 3 binders!), and the quality is great.  In my opinion, you can't go wrong ordering a Jansport. I'm hoping the child who receives this bookbag is pleased, and that it lasts them a good few years. :)As far as shipping and cost, this bookbag is a steal and was shipped promptly.  Very happy with my purchase. :)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.090141065", "1": "0.25367036", "2": "0.13634601", "3": "0.2171498", "4": "0.1266129", "5": "0.17336717"}}
