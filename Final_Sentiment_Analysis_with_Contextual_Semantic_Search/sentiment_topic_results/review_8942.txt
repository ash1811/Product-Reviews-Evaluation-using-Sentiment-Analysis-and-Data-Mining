{"text": "I bought these in size 8.5M.The worst thing about these sneakers is that the white leather upper is not as white as the laces or rubber midsole. A lot of white leather uppers are a little off-white, but these are worse than that. They have a slight grayish tinge to them that makes them slightly more off-colored than the K-Swiss white leather sneakers I ordered at the same time. The off-whitish-grayish leather color is really obvious so I'm definitely returning them.What also bothers me but might not necessarily bother you about these shoes is that the eyelets are farther apart than other sneakers, so that makes my foot appear wider and larger than they are, which I don't like.Also, a minor complaint is that the foot bed feels like I'm walking on a wedge. Other sneakers have the ball of my foot sitting a little lower.Another thing I was worried about with Sketchers is that they are notoriously HEAVY. I have an older pair of blue Sketchers and they weigh 13 oz. each shoe, which is hella heavy. These weigh only 11.1 oz. each in the 8.5, so they've improved on that a bit, although leather uppers are going to be heavier than synthetic, and I have synthetic upper New Balance running shoes in 8.5 that weigh a mere 7.6 oz. each for comparison, which I love.I would stay away from the white version of these Sketchers if you care about the color of your uppers.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.05226665", "1": "0.082113385", "2": "0.19789925", "3": "0.1652819", "4": "0.13713913", "5": "0.2988604", "6": "0.06643933"}}
