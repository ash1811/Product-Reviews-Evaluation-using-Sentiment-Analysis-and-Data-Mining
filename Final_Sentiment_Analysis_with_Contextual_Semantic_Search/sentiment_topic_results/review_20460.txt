{"text": "These slippers by Totes start out feeling a bit too tight, but they do stretch a bit--still, you may want to order one size up just to be sure your feet will be comfortable in these! The feel of the outside \"micro terry\" fabric is great but the quality of the sole is only fair; but then again I bought these to wear when visiting friends for the weekend or to use if I wind up in some hospital as I did a few weeks ago when I had both pneumonia and bronchitis! These slippers will be infinitely better than walking on a hospital floor in my socks.Overall, these are not the best slippers I've ever purchased; if you really want good quality I recommend you keep searching. I use these only occasionally so I think they're good enough for what I want.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12316862", "1": "0.22559156", "2": "0.064056054", "3": "0.117466606", "4": "0.04160488", "5": "0.18331446", "6": "0.24479784"}}
