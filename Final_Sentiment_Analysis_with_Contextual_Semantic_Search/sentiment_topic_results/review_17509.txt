TO SET THE TIME, ETC:  push top left button until the seconds flash...  push bottom left button to choose the function/mode...  push bottom right button to cycle through the numbers (or days)  TO ADJUST THE BAND:  dvd3 saved the day for me... dvd3 says:  With the the clasp unhooked and the watch facing upwards, take a small conventional screwdriver (I USED A PAPERCLIP) and insert it into the slot on the female half of the clasp and gently pry the clip upwards by pressing down on the handle of the screwdriver. It should now be loose. Now slide the clasp up or down the strap until it is the size you want it. Snap the clasp back into place (you might have to move it slightly to get it into exactly the right position) by pressing down on the clip firmly. Test it and if it is still wrong, repeat until it's the size you want it.You just replied with a later post", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15720825", "1": "0.18674149", "2": "0.21233493", "3": "0.08259384", "4": "0.061950903", "5": "0.07584743", "6": "0.2233231"}}
