{"text": "This is an extremely nice, comfortable and useful money belt.  I travel a lot, both in the United States and out.  To be quite frank, I am more uneasy in an American city than I am in other countries as far as being robbed, but when traveling to other destinations, you have so much more to loose; e.g.  your passport, visas, etc.  You can get in a real mess without these things so why take a chance.This belt fits perfectly.  I should say it fit perfectly once I did a bit of cutting on the strap.  I have a very thin waist and the thing almost could have circled me twice.  This was really no problem though and a quick flick of a knife did the job.The silk material is quite comfortable and the belt is quite safe when wet.  I have been caught out in many a rain storm with mine on and I have never had a problem with leakage.  I also tend to sweat like a pig in certain climates, there again, no problem.Now keep in mind that this thing should not be used like a fanny pack as it was not built for that.  Money, a few travelers checks and papers and that Is it.  You cannot stuff a water bottle, medications, camping gear and a portable toilet in the thing.I was very impressed with the quality and the price of this belt and do recommend it highly.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.047835283", "1": "0.38715285", "2": "0.35896072", "4": "0.09971261", "5": "0.07412731", "6": "0.029607326"}}
