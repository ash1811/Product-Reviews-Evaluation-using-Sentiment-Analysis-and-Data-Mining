{"text": "I LOVE this sleeping bra!  I really don't know how I ever nursed my first kid for a year without this nursing bra. It is a must have for a nursing mom!  I have only washed this in the washing machine and also dried it in the dryer and it has frayed a little bit in the back but I just cut off the strings each time and it's fine.  It's a wonderful sleeping bra!  Definitely worth the $15.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17427836", "2": "0.065483734", "3": "0.43822104", "4": "0.049241748", "5": "0.16014425", "6": "0.10874975"}}
