{"text": "I have an enormous collection of shawls and this one went right to the top when I opened the package and it has stayed there once I've worn it!  Long alpaca hair lie silkily and flatly along it's considerable length.  It's like being wrapped in a cloud and it is warm.  It's stunning.  Seriously beautiful.  Deep dark blue color is a super deep peacock blue of the darkest deep ocean kind on black background and would go with multiple colors.  So beautiful my daughter (a lawyer) took it and has semi-permanently borrowed it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.26379985", "1": "0.32032043", "2": "0.0793738", "3": "0.10089784", "4": "0.030666875", "5": "0.046890024", "6": "0.15805118"}}
