{"text": "One pair was fine; the other had one normal leghole and one wide leghole that made the pair unwearable (there was no support for your member, and your sack was banging against the skin of your thigh!) YUCK.I got a set last year and the legholes were symmetrical and the underwear, laying on your bed, was square-ish. These pairs are triangular with the circular legholes, like most other underwear.I don't want other underwear, I want my comfy old Munsingwears!I would not buy these again. (I'd return them if that wasnt gross.)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.30983922", "1": "0.28537497", "2": "0.11143115", "4": "0.082365476", "5": "0.08373963", "6": "0.12437528"}}
