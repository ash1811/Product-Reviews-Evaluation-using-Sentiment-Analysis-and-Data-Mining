{"text": "I bought this costume in size 2T for a 2-year-old grandson. The pants and shirt are heavy polyester that feels like twill. The costume fit well. The cap was crushed in delivery and doesn't really hold its shape. The holster belt is thin plastic and flimsy. The uniform is priced well enough to buy the uniform and ignore the accessories. The embroidery of patches is well done.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1558626", "1": "0.2753583", "2": "0.12979427", "3": "0.10228727", "4": "0.10146027", "6": "0.23162878"}}
