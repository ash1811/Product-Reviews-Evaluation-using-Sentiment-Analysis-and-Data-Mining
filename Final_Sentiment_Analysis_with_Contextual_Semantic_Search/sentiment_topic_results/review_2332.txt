{"text": "At age 56 my feet have started to let me know that they are not big fans of my Italian dress shoes.  Now that I am on my feet most of the day I need a comfortable yet business looking pair of shoes.  These fit the bill but are not perfect.They look like what they are, a relatively inexpensive \"Dockers\" product.  They don't have a shine on them, more like a dull, matte-like finish that can get scuffed easily.  Still, they look okay and are much more comfortable that my high-priced dress shoes.  I bought the black pair and will get one in brown as well.  If I get a year out of them I will be very pleased.EDIT: 9/05/2013Well... I didn't get a year out of them, more like 9 months before they started to look really worn.  I am tough on shoes in general and these seem to get torn up easier than the expensive brands.  However, since they are comfortable and cheap I just bought another pair.  I still like them but it would be nice if they held up better.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.057226766", "1": "0.31079024", "2": "0.19320379", "3": "0.11022283", "4": "0.07686211", "5": "0.16372558", "6": "0.08796865"}}
