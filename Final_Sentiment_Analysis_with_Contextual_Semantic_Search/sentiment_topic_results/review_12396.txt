{"text": "I like these flip-flops a lot.I like the plain look of them and the soles are very, very comfortable.However the strap is TOO TIGHT around my foot and it cuts in a little.  after wearing them for a bit it will leave a mark.I normally wear 11s or 12s.  I originally bought 11s but returned them because they were too snug.I ordered the 12s and they were not any better.I kept them because I like them and I do not wear flip-flops often enough that it will be a problem.I am also hoping they will break in a bit.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07151087", "1": "0.25966454", "2": "0.092950016", "3": "0.31229934", "4": "0.14242585", "6": "0.11781666"}}
