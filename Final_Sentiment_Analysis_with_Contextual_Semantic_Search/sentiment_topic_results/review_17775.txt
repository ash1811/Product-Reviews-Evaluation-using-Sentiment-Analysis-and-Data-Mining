{"text": "I've been wearing these G-Shocks since they came out and I love them. They're durable, reliable and affordable. This one is my favorite model and I can attest to it's a fore-mentioned qualities. I would take one of these over an expensive Swiss watch any day. There's just about nothing bad to say about it except that it is sort of plain and bulky so you probably don't want to wear it out on a date if you're trying to impress. Fantastic watch and good price on Amazon!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09456654", "1": "0.34855846", "2": "0.14604346", "3": "0.074002594", "4": "0.1652143", "5": "0.04726547", "6": "0.12434921"}}
