{"text": "I ordered the Citizen diving watch and received it within 2 working days. The watch looked exactly like the photo and came packaged in a nice leather bound zippered case. The watch is a little heavier than a normal watch but that is due to the construction needed for diving. I am not a scuba diver but I look cool as hell with the watch on! It keeps great time and since it's an eco drive watch, it never needs batteries just sunlight. I am very happy for my purchase!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.28852645", "1": "0.11570212", "2": "0.26658744", "3": "0.07971741", "5": "0.11665175", "6": "0.1299941"}}
