{"text": "I purchased this watch as a companion piece for the 1st. generation Black Monster that I've owned and loved for years. I couldn't be happier, especially considering the inclusion of the metal bracelet; do the arithmetic and subtract $60 from the total cost of the watch (that's the upgrade price for an original equipment metal bracelet) and you'll get an idea of how affordable it really is when purchased together! Hand wind and hacking features are absent from 1st. generation Monsters. Both are good to have, but I've found them to be less than necessary for most daily applications. The accuracy of timekeeping (which is, after all, the notion behind wearing a watch) is on a par with automatics costing far more. You can't go wrong with this one unless you prefer a more subdued color for the dial. If that's the case, check out the lst. generation Black Monster - same fine quality.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16316746", "1": "0.1292295", "2": "0.15037048", "3": "0.18656212", "4": "0.07832232", "5": "0.12831268", "6": "0.16403545"}}
