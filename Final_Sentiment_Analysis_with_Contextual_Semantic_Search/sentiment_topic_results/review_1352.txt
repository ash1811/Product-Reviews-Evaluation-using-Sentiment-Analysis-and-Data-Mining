{"text": "I would have rated these 5 stars for the show itself and the comfort factor, but was a tad disappointed to find that these run on the small side.  I tend to wear a size 9 in shoes, but buy a 9.5 in sneakers to allow for socks. Since I was planning on wearing these without socks I purchased a 9 and although they are nice and wide in the toe and foot bed, they JUST fit (my heel may hang off a tad) on the other end. I didn't want to bother returning them and will definitely buy again, but just order 1/2 size larger next time.Excellent quality.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.28881183", "2": "0.118830234", "3": "0.14160366", "4": "0.02702073", "5": "0.18570939", "6": "0.23550111"}}
