{"text": "I love the way the fabric feels because it's ultra smooth. The fit is just as expected, except I didn't expect the leg length to be longer (9&#34;) than the previous long mesh shorts they used to manufacture (8.5&#34;); I'd prefer an 8.5&#34; leg length because I have short legs and shorts just look better when they hit the mid-knee cap, but that minor detail doesn't effect how I feel about this product because I use mesh shorts for lounging at home during spring and summer. The color is very nice---it's as shown on the photo.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.3559089", "1": "0.24719869", "2": "0.10342454", "4": "0.11143586", "5": "0.13267672", "6": "0.046543982"}}
