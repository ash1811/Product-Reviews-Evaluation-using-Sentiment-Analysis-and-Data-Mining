{"text": "On the good side, this is a very, very handsome watch -- I get lots of compliments (even from Rolex owners). The gold plating is nicely done. To my surprise the gold-plated band really does feel different than stainless -- it is softer on the skin and feels warmer.The Invicta 8937 has proven to be very waterproof. I use it for swimming, sailing, jet-skiing. So the screw-down crown does its job.OK, here's my complaints. The watch is a terrible time-keeper. When it runs for 24 hours straight, it will lose about 1.5 to 2.0 minutes per day. But what's worse, it will, once or twice a week, simply stop running (even while on my wrist). Usually it stops at night, but I've had it stop in the middle of the day. To prevent this I now manually wind the watch every morning and when I go to bed. That will usually (but not always) keep it running. As for the poor time-keeping, I know it could be regulated, but I don't feel like spending $50 to fix an $80.00 watch.My strong recommendation -- get the Invicta model 9312 with Swiss Quartz movement instead. It looks identical to the model 8937 (though the 9312 is slightly thinner and lighter in weight). I also own a model 9312 and it is AMAZINGLY accurate. I've set and checked my Invicta 9312 with the web atomic time clock. The 9312 has not lost or gained one second in two weeks. Amazing. The 9312 is without a doubt the most accurate time piece I own.The only reason I can see for getting the model 8937 is if you absolutely need the screw-down crown. Unfortunately Invicta no longer offers a screw-down crown with the model 9312, which, in all other respects, is a better watch.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15509537", "1": "0.19263533", "2": "0.18707097", "3": "0.12088338", "4": "0.07719037", "5": "0.16110624", "6": "0.106018275"}}
