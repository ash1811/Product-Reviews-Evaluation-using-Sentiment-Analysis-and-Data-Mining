{"text": "The Casio DW-5600 is approved by NASA for use at the space station and in manned space vehicles! (Google it!)Beats the Omega Speedmaster BY FAR in accuracy and pricing!It is simply one of the best watches in the whole universe! I LOVE IT!If you don't care for overpriced luxury bling watches, which are expensive to buy, expensive to service, getting magnetized easily and won't keep time and are mostly not shock-proof, then the Casio DW-5600E is THE watch for you! Not bulky, accurate (+ 7 sec/month!), has all the important functions, is shock-proof and water resistant 20bar. A lithium battery ensures functionality for many years to come. This watch tells others that you are a practical guy who gets the best product for less money and doesn't waste his hard earned money for an overpriced watch.GO, GET IT!!! :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.30555767", "1": "0.19956717", "2": "0.14730205", "3": "0.08170347", "4": "0.14880964", "5": "0.02641621", "6": "0.090643816"}}
