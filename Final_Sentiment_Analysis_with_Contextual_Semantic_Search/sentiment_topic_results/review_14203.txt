{"text": "I am not a Flip Flop person, since I do not like the loose fit, usually thin soles and I do not like the Flip flop noise. However, I enjoyed being able to slip on and off the soft flips that I had and loved the soft cushion, though too thin.  These Tevas are thicker, soft and cushioned with a bit of arch support.  A nice fit and look so nice!  I have a stone floor and wanted slippers that really cushion.  These do the trick!  They are completely black, though, not a color mix.  Totally comfy and dressy to boot!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.031727556", "1": "0.3989077", "2": "0.186546", "3": "0.10874587", "4": "0.16965024", "5": "0.04708399", "6": "0.05733867"}}
