{"text": "I have narrow boney feet and a heel spur, so pretty much all dress shoes that don't have cushion will hurt my feet after a short time.  I buy these by the dozen and literally have them in all my dress shoes.  They are perfect for high heels as they provide cushy support and keep your feel from sliding forward and take up very little room.  I use them in sandals as they don't show either in open toe shoes.The material is very high quality, I've had them in some of my favorite shoes, been in them for close to 10 years and still works.  The material is also not sticky like some of the gel insoles, so they don't feel sticky to your bare feet.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.029923024", "1": "0.3244251", "2": "0.14791751", "3": "0.1476931", "4": "0.16096039", "5": "0.032105587", "6": "0.15697524"}}
