{"text": "Yes, this item is only $9. To be honest, its not even worth that. I recieved it today, and the material is SO think i'm positive my tweezers will poke a hole right through while traveling. There was already a hole IN The zipper. I don't think this would be durable at all. Do yourself a favor, spend another $10 and get either the Rick Steves toiletry kit or the Travelon, those are both tried and trusted brands, and are both under $20.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13139139", "1": "0.22916503", "2": "0.16584559", "3": "0.054225676", "4": "0.17614485", "5": "0.13390183", "6": "0.10932564"}}
