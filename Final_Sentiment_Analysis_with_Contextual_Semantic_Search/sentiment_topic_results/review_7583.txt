{"text": "I've worn Henley's all my life and I'm constantly searching for new colors. I love the fact these have the pocket, especially ideal for my smart phone. These are very good shirts, but they do run just a tad large. I like my Henleys to fit more like a body shirt. And when I order a medium, they usually will. These don't. Other than that, I would have given this 5 stars. I've bought these for myself and my brother. I weigh 190, stand 6' tall and the medium is loose on me, except in the arms. Hope that helps.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10788488", "1": "0.34170473", "2": "0.045621116", "3": "0.19841044", "4": "0.08615647", "6": "0.21751457"}}
