{"text": "Just what I was looking for to fill out my wedding dress.  I bought it based on the other reviews that stated it was adjustable.  I do not see that the hoops are adjustable in any way.  However, this does not effect me because it is at the right diameter for my needs.  The shipping was very fast and the fit is great.  I paid around $26 which I think is an ok price...but I think it's a little high for the simplicity and quality of the product I received.  It was still substantially cheaper than all the ones I looked at from the Bridal Stores so I can only complain slightly.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.039135944", "1": "0.24018854", "2": "0.15739894", "3": "0.09637192", "4": "0.14066547", "5": "0.22086559", "6": "0.10537365"}}
