{"text": "I was just looking for a business casual pair of shoes for work.  I have flat feet with a custom insole.  I like that I as able to take out the padding and insert my own insole and place the padding on top.The shoes look good,  they are a bit heavy on my feet.  Can't say I appreciate that much now but I'm sure I will when it gets cold out.All in all it was worth the purchase, they are pretty comfortable", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04539053", "1": "0.4663211", "2": "0.12634523", "3": "0.035992112", "4": "0.101142526", "5": "0.15289772", "6": "0.071910806"}}
