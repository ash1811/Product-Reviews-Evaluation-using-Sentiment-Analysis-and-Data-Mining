{"text": "This backpack is the best I've ever had. The bag itself is light as a feather and has plenty of room but ISN'T BULKY! Before this I had a military backpack, and that thing would knock someone over if I turned around too fast.Please note that I also store my basic emergency gear in this day bag  (empty water bladder, several MRE's/Ration bars, First-Aid Kit, gloves etc etc) and I can easily carry it around every day along with my books and my laptop.The padded ventilation in the back is the Tempur-Pedic of back-covers, and the shoulder straps are the most comfortable I've ever experienced- highly recommended for camping, biking or any other outdoor activity.You would think that for the price, the quality would suffer- but this thing is tough! I don't think it would survive a wild dog attack, but it's definitely going to get me through college.
