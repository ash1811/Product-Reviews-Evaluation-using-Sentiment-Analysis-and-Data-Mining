{"text": "I couldn't decide between these and the taller Frye Harness 15R so ended up buying both!I am always an 8.5M and the same in these - although a bit difficult to get on initially you need to persevere as once you get your foot in they fit perfectly and are immediately VERY comfortable. Over a few weeks of wearing they have softened up and now are much easier to get on and off and even more comfortable.The Tan leather is beautiful and makes the boots look almost vintage, with a nice, soft, slightly worn-in look.These are my new 'everyday' boots which I wear around the property, training horses, doing chores etc., but they're also fantastic dressed up with skinny jeans, shorts or dresses! So versatile and I know they'll last forever.Definitely worth the money and one of my new Frye favourites, and I have LOTS of Frye boots! :)If I had to pick a single pair of boots to live and work in, these would be the ones!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13316041", "1": "0.19882366", "2": "0.05991793", "3": "0.09701178", "4": "0.20340423", "5": "0.11289475", "6": "0.1947872"}}
