{"text": "I purchased this ZANheadgear Balaclava for one purpose and one purpose alone.  It is meant to hide my neck and face while I'm wearing a TIE Fighter outfit complete with a helmet and chest armor.  I plan on joining up with the 501st, a Star Wars charity organization, and this product was recommended to me by a member.  It's thin, lightweight, and allows my eyes to remain uncovered.As of right now I've only worn it a few times, but despite its being thin, it is very warm.  If you plan to use it for hunting, as a cover under your helmet while riding a motorcycle (or on a boat), or in any type of outdoor activity, it should be just fine.  It will fit under most helmets, but you might want to test it first.Highly recommended.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13732082", "1": "0.12400706", "2": "0.22412553", "3": "0.17221066", "4": "0.1847044", "5": "0.10325656", "6": "0.054375008"}}
