{"text": "I LOVE these socks!  My preschool-aged son had a pair last winter for sledding and outdoor fun, but we lost 1 sock.  This year, I returned to purchase 2 more pairs to prepare for this year's winter adventures!  These socks are super-warm and lightweight.  They are not the bulky, heavy wool socks of our childhoods!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.100817956", "1": "0.29103002", "2": "0.07609515", "3": "0.21973784", "4": "0.025008343", "5": "0.20841086", "6": "0.07889981"}}
