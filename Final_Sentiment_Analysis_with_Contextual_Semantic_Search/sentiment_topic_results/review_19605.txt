{"text": "This is the most uncomfortable bra I've ever tried to wear.  The straps are too short so it kept hiking up in the back.  I was constantly aware I was wearing it, it was so uncomfortable.  I needed an odd size 44B, have a nerve injury in my left shoulder that acts up if the straps are too tight, and don't want an underwire.  I bought this because of all the great reviews, but I felt like I was wearing some sort of medieval harness rather than a bra.  The best bra in my mind is one I can forget I have on, and this wasn't it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17662765", "1": "0.28635752", "2": "0.15746588", "3": "0.16310035", "4": "0.05026944", "5": "0.046942454", "6": "0.11923673"}}
