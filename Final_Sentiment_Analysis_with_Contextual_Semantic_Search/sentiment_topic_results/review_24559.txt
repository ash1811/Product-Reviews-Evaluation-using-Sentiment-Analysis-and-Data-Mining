{"text": "The overall design of this bra is good - but the fit is not.  It fits too tightly and is very uncomfortable. ( I wondered if it would loosen up, eventually, but don't know if I could wear it long enough for that to happen!)  I wear these types of bras when I work out with a trainer - usually comfortable and I don't have to worry about straps slipping, etc.  But, this bra is just too tight and uncomfortable. I have already worn it - so - I guess it will go in the give away  box!  I usually really like Wacoal bras, so I was disappointed.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.034987785", "1": "0.36931407", "2": "0.05908218", "3": "0.27524784", "4": "0.13757484", "6": "0.12086351"}}
