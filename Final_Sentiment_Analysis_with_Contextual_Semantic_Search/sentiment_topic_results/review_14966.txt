{"text": "I have two kinds of purses--smallish and LUGGAGE.  The smaller purses go everywhere, but the larger bags often stay in the car or under the desk, while the bare necessities go into the grocery store or to lunch in a wristlet.  Wristlets, however, are often too small.  This bag is the perfect compromise.  Plenty of room for whatever you think of as the bare necessities, but still light & small enough to go in a carry-on, backpack, briefcase or hobo bag with plenty of room for other stuff.Also, while this bag has card slots and two zipper pouches inside to use as a wallet, I prefer putting my actual wallet inside.  It is a single-fold wallet.  When open, it fits perfectly in this little purse.  I love this thing.  I will be doing a wristlet inventory soon.  Most of them will be going to the consignment shop.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16201973", "1": "0.18632099", "2": "0.1932309", "3": "0.16264705", "4": "0.14799772", "5": "0.06376261", "6": "0.084021024"}}
