{"text": "I just purchased these for a trip to Vail.  They were extremely warm and comfortable.  Right out of the box and without ever wearing them I was amazed at how comfortable they are.  Like a memory foam they surrounded my foot in a soft insulating material.  Walking in the sow in single digit temps, I was warm dry and never felt like the boot needed to be &#34;broken in&#34;.  I would recommend buying a 1/2 size larger than you normally wear to allow for winter socks.  These boots look great, and peroform excellently and I highly recommend them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08214372", "1": "0.44921392", "2": "0.10043952", "3": "0.06002689", "4": "0.11087522", "5": "0.19473709"}}
