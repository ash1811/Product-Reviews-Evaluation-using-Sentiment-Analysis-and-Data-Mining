{"text": "I used these Teenee bags for a long time, had three of them.  In the end, they were just too small for me, but they are good for a given purpose.  If you want to wear your purse under a layer of clothing so that no one can see it, these tiny bags are good.  I used to wear them under my coat.  You'd better have one of the old school small phones though, or find another place to keep your phone.  I have an old \"stupid\" phone (LG Octane), so it actually fit.One of the issues I had was with the very thin straps.  They would sometimes cut into my neck, and when I took the purse off (wore it across body), the bag would spin around and around and make twisted spaghetti out of the straps.  Slightly wider straps would be nice.Also, and I'm not quite sure how to describe this, but often, the zipper pulls would lay a certain crooked way and make it hard to open the zippers, especially on the front flap.  The little rings that connect the pull to the zipper are too wide, or the hook they hook into is too small.  Told ya it was hard to describe!  I kept my credit cards in there, so it was important to be able to get in there quickly.The bag is VERY flat.  This is not one you can stuff much.  Still, I fit pretty much everything I needed into mine.  The key words are \"pretty much.\"  After a couple years of just plain doing without some things I really needed, I decided to go for something slightly bigger and bought the eBags Terrace Mini, which I absolutely love.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.046988957", "1": "0.2821009", "2": "0.18893415", "3": "0.15985669", "4": "0.07852551", "5": "0.12748729", "6": "0.11610654"}}
