I bought a small and was surprised to find it fits both the 3.5 and the 5.5 year olds - one loose and one tight!Seems to be good quality - especially for a kids halloween costume.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1970592", "1": "0.19792183", "2": "0.17971474", "4": "0.24377109", "5": "0.090267934", "6": "0.08775891"}}
