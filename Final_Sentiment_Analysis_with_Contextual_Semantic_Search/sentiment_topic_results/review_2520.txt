{"text": "I love my gold glitter Sperry Top-Spider shoes.  They are very comfortable and I was able to wear them comfortably the very first time with no break-in, but there are a couple things that another purchaser may want to know...I wear a U.S. women's size 10 shoe (extremely consistently)...I ordered a 10 in these shoes and they are a bit big...I could've gone with a 9.5, so i would recommend ordering a half size smaller than usual.  Also...the \"glitter\" is not actually glitter.  I was worried that it would be glitter because we all know how glitter can flake off and get all over everything, but it is actually tiny gold sequins which is very good.  The only thing I do not like about the shoes are the soles...they are blindingly white - makes me feel like George on that episode of Seinfeld where he wears those basketball jumping shoes and starts talking in 3rd person like Jimmy.  Anyway, I think the soles would be much better in a tan color or even black.  I still love the shoes and I love their sparkle, but I'm looking forward to the white soles dulling a bit.
