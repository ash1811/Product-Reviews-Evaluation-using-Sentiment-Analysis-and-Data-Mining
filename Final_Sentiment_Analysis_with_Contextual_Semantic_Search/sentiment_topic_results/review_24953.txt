{"text": "Over Christmas break I ordered 6 different types of insoles for my plantar f that is KILLLLING me.  I wear a Mens New Balance 9 D and that is the perfect fit for me, even though I have Womens size 10 feet.  These insoles fit that size PERFECTLY.  AND they help with the pain which if you have PF you know what I am talking about.  Nothing I have found, including the $600 orthos the Dr. made for me (hard plastic - soooo painful to all the other joints as it works to re-align you) have worked this well. The other companies did not work for me.
