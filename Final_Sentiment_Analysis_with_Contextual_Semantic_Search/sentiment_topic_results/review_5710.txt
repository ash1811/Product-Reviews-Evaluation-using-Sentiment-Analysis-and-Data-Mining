{"text": "The Good:1. Material is of pretty good thickness. Doesn't feel cheap.2. Entire hand can fit in pockets. Not too shallow.3. Elastic at the ankle fits tight enough to to allow the pant leg bottom to fall over the top of my shoe.The Bad:1. The useless elastic in the waistband is useless2. And this the worst part. The string to tie is just a loop that sticks out and there is no &#34;drawstring restraining clip&#34;. If there were two separate strings I'd know what to do. Tie them together. There is no way to get the waist tight that I know of.I wouldn't purchase these again.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14522947", "1": "0.3784962", "2": "0.12508789", "3": "0.13406548", "4": "0.16318052", "5": "0.051337376"}}
