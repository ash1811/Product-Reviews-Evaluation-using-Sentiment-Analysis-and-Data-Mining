{"text": "I bought my first pair of keen shoes 8 years ago when I lived in Connecticut. I still have that pair of shoes, still going strong even with frequent wear! Sure, the treads are getting worn down after so many years but these shoes are some of the finest craftsmanship out there. Now, with this pair we have 7 pairs in the family all still in service.I find that the fit is true to size for me. Wife has had the same experience. I have wider and flatter feet than she has, and we both find the fit comfortable. From my perspective, these are a god send with their wide and roomy toe box. I also happen to like the all around toe protection. Sure, it's not a steel toe, but I'm not a construction worker and most of my concerns involve dogs and kids stepping on feet. For these mundane toe related hazards, Keen shoes work like a champ.From a style standpoint I bought these to wear with grey/blue toned clothing where brown wasn't really a good choice. These did the trick!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0564424", "1": "0.40828213", "2": "0.12450911", "3": "0.0776651", "4": "0.1132459", "5": "0.027661357", "6": "0.19219398"}}
