{"text": "I own 6 shoes from Ecco. From the beginning these shoes did not look as sturdy as the rest of my Ecco shoes. I was right. These shoes lasted me only 4 years (I rotate my 6 shoes) before the rubber sole from the bottom of the shoe began to fall apart. But prior to that, these shoes served me really well.As with other Ecco shoes, these are made of high quality (except the bottom sole) materials. The black leather had a good shine to it after a vigorous polishing. The quality of the leather, althogh not sturdy, are noticeably of high grade. You can wear them in both casual and formal settings (they look great both in my jeans and my suit).Perhaps more than any other Ecco shoe I have worn, these shoes are very light and comfortable. Just don't expect them to last you a very long time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.33418038", "2": "0.24200884", "3": "0.10231783", "4": "0.030569138", "5": "0.20995961", "6": "0.078692704"}}
