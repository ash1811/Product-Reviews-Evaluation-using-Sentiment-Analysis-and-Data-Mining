{"text": "Not a huge fan.  They're just okay.  The straps rub against the top of my normal width foot, so not hugely comfortable.  Fit as expected and of course easy to clean.  I'm keeping them, but mostly throw these on to garden and wear another shoe if I am heading out anywhere else.  I have a similar sandal from Teva that was a lot more comfy than these.  My favorite thing about this pair is the black and maroon colour.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.074870236", "1": "0.3348369", "2": "0.14785326", "3": "0.25054938", "4": "0.08531899", "5": "0.10316004"}}
