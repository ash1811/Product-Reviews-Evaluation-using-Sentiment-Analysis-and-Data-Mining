{"text": "These pants were several inches too long, but probably I ordered the wrong size; they required cutting and hemming.Fabric is smooth, comfortable and strong.  Seams are well stitched and finished.  Waistband is the right size.  My husband is very pleased with these pants.  Would order them again (shorter).  Double check the length before you order.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12909214", "1": "0.298203", "2": "0.15725969", "3": "0.20437892", "4": "0.048122745", "5": "0.15846418"}}
