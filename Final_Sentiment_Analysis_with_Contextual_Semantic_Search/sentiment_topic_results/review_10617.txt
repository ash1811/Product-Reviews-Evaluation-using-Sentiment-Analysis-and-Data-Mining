{"text": "Doesn't look like it will be waterproof, but good enough if you get caught in the rain. I'd never use it as a regular jacket for exercise- it would sweat - but I just wanted something that folds to next to nothing to stash in my bike or hiking bag- and this fits the bill. The packable pocket in front will be a extra protection for my phone. Runs big. You can move in it. The Royal blue is nice. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the price- it's the kind of thing you can buy for under $20 at the beach. I didn't ding for it, but wasn't 100% comfortable with it being made in UAE.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14825441", "1": "0.33843097", "2": "0.20190199", "3": "0.09709698", "4": "0.04939959", "5": "0.16239354"}}
