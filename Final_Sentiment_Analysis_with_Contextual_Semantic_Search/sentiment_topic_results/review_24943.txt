{"text": "I have had six pairs of these in various shoes over the years, hiking boots, tennis shoes, and work shoes. I have never had a bad pair. Excellent heel cushioning effect. Break in quickly. They feel a little tight on my arch at first due to the fact that I have a fairly flat arch, but within a day of wearing I no longer notice anything. These work great to give a old pair of shoes new life. I still flinch at paying the high cost but always glad I spent the money after walking for a day.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03642174", "1": "0.23261899", "2": "0.22136527", "3": "0.23730256", "4": "0.09509073", "5": "0.11200568", "6": "0.06519502"}}
