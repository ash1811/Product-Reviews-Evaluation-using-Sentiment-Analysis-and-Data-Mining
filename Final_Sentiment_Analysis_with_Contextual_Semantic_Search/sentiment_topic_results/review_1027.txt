{"text": "My husband is happy with his Clark's.  He has been wanting a pair for the longest.  He wore them faithfully in the 80's and what can I say, he's a real &#34;80's man&#34; lol.  Anyway, they are very well made and look beautiful on.  The sizing was a bit tricky.  He normally wears  size 10, but we had to go with an 11 so I guess they run a bit small.  These shoes are timeless classics IMO.  I think this is a must for any guy young or old.  Definitely recommend.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.20426978", "2": "0.103012405", "3": "0.20978248", "4": "0.2020598", "5": "0.15664092", "6": "0.121104926"}}
