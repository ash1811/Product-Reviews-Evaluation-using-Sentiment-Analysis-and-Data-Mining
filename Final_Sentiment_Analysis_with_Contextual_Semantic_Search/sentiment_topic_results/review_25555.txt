{"text": "I didn't expect half the quality this drover had.  It is heavy duty and extremely comfortable!  It does have some weight to it, but any oilskin outerwear will... so as long as you expect it there are no worries.  I would recommend letting it air out or hosing it down before hanging it in a closet, as it has the fresh oilskin smell to it still.  I am a big guy, and it seems that in the larger sizes they might run a little small... but I can make do with it.  Overall, I think this is an amazing deal and one of the best quality Drover/Dusters available.  I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.21686779", "2": "0.034810204", "3": "0.2825954", "4": "0.22869447", "5": "0.13562915", "6": "0.09869861"}}
