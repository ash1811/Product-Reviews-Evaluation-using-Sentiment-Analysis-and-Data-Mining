{"text": "I wore these socks ONCE and they developed a hole in the toe. I bought a few pairs, it happened with every pair. I DO cut my toenails. I DO wear good shoes (Nike, Reebok), and I also bought two other brands of socks at the same time as these. ALL the other socks are still great after many wearing and washings. I am not exagerating when I tell you that ALL the pairs of these socks are in the garbage. They look sturdy, feel great! One would NEVER imagine that each and every pair fell apart in ONE or two days in use.I have no idea how others gave these socks a good rating.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.20018405", "2": "0.1513715", "3": "0.06084344", "4": "0.18719222", "5": "0.3071729", "6": "0.09076525"}}
