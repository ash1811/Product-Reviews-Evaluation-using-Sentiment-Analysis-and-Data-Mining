{"text": "This is one of the best watches that I have ever bought. Here are some of the reasons why I could give 100 stars to this watch:1) Very durable and stylish looking2) Got tons of complements from both girls and guys. Girls say they loved it.3) I have a hairy arm, so I was very glad that it does not pull on my hair.4) The blue plate inside the watch looks very shiny and new for a long time.5) The glass does not scratch at all. I had this watch for over a year and it still seems to not have a single scratch on it6)Very comfortable and light as a feather. I am a guy who hates big, clunky watches that seem to weight don on my wrist. Not going to happen with this watch.7) The time hands, as well as intervals glow in dark.8) It is very accurate. I never had any problems with it being late.9) The metal mesh band is very subtle and good looking. After a year, the color (black) fades a bit, but not to the point where it is noticeable by people around you. If you look at it closely, you will see the difference.10) It is affordable and I promise you that if you are giving it as a gift, the person will LOVE it and love you for getting it :)I could go on forever, but I think that was enough reason that will prove to you that this is a watch worth getting.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.106956236", "1": "0.29958597", "2": "0.21624531", "3": "0.069708884", "4": "0.12867549", "5": "0.05696137", "6": "0.12186672"}}
