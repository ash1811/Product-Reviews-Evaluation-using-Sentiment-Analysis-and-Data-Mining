{"text": "I love Capezio products, and while I haven't worn this yet, I know it is going to be wonderful. I purchased a short sleeve one for summer and went ahead and got this one for cooler weather. I mainly got this for warmth, but it is great because it provides seamless support under jeans, pants, skirts, and dresses. Warning: don't buy these if you are needing extra duty support because that's not really what they are designed for. They do help in the support area, however, these are more for coverage than anything else. They are so comfortable. Highly recommend!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.053271033", "1": "0.2355049", "2": "0.1437219", "3": "0.13260403", "4": "0.18285802", "5": "0.08991762", "6": "0.16212246"}}
