{"text": "I love these shoes. I'm on my third pair. I heard that Merrell discontinued this shoe and I don't understand why. They also had a boot version of the spire that was great and it is definitely discontinued. Argh! If anyone from Merrell is reading - please keep making the Spire. I love the arch support. I wear these with my orthotics and they work great together.My one and only complaint about the shoes that the tread starts to separate from the shoe  and wear out before the rest of the shoe does. Other than that I absolutely adore the shoes I wear them at least 4 days a week. I wear them to work with slacks. I wear them with jeans.  I can walk miles in the shoes and feel really comfortable.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.2042602", "2": "0.18583909", "3": "0.25116298", "4": "0.13029756", "5": "0.1695389", "6": "0.05643155"}}
