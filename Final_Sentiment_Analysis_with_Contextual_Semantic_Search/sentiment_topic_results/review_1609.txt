{"text": "I ordered the correct size, and it fits well.  The only thing I really don't like is that the boning really doesn't hold you in.  It pulls you in, but you still have an obvious belly, so anything I wear over it you can see the line of hook and eye down the front.  I have to say, I like the Rago one I got right before this one arrived.  It works much better to pull me in where needed and make my curves stand out.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.103592485", "1": "0.098696366", "2": "0.35931593", "3": "0.21756719", "5": "0.16639547", "6": "0.051002786"}}
