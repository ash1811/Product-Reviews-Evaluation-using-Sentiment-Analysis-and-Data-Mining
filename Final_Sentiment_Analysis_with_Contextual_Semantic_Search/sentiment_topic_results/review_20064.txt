{"text": "The backpack is fine and seems like any other backpack. However, there are odd straps by the main  compartment which are very annoying! I always keep mine loose and pretend they are not there. Also, the pockets open all the way. This can be annoying if you are in a rush and can't find a zipper.If you have a laptop, this is not a good backpack. If you're a college student, this is not the best backpack. There is no laptop compartment and it's not very spacious. I can only fit about 3 one inch binders and a book before my backpack starts bulging. Anything above that and it'll bulge. I never pack it too much because I don't want to break the zippers.If you're looking for a cheap backpack and you're in high school or elementary school, then this backpack is fine. It could always be better, but it works okay for me and could do the same for you.It's too bad the bag can't eat my binders and materials like a fat boy!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10296074", "1": "0.26837346", "2": "0.42340642", "3": "0.04972", "4": "0.09516668", "6": "0.057654075"}}
