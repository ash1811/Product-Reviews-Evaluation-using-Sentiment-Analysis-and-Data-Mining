{"text": "I've been looking at different G-Shock models for an \"outdoor\" golf watch.  Most of the G-Shocks I've looked at were too large for my slender wrist.  The G2900F is the ideal size.  It's beefy but not too thick.  The watch is very light, which is very important too me.  Features are perfect for my needs.  I've read too many reviews on the solar watches not charging properly.  Why worry about charging when you can have this watch with a 10 year battery?Other key features are multiple alarms, world city times, automatic back light, and countdown timer.  Very cool watch!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06104287", "2": "0.15288292", "3": "0.20480464", "4": "0.25427687", "5": "0.12785947", "6": "0.19652557"}}
