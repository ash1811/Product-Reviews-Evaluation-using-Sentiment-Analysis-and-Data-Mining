{"text": "I GOT THESE FOR MY SON IN LAW. THESE BOAT SHOES ARE ACTUALLY FOR A GUY WHO GOES TO THE BEACH, THE BOAT, AND THE BEACH ALL THE TIME. ACTUALLY, ODD AS IT MAY SOUND, MY DAUGHTER AND MY SON IN LAW HAVE FEET APPROXIMATELY THE SAME SIZE, SO I LOOKED FOR A PAIR THAT COULD BE OK FOR A GUY OR A GAL. BOTH REPORT THAT THE SHOE FITS PERFECTLY AND AMBLES IN THE SAND OK. (SOME SHOES SLIP AND SLIDE IN THE SAND, BUT THESE DO NOT.) BOTH ARE WELL PLEASED AS THESE WILL DRESS UP OR DOWN.....AND BESIDES, MOM PAID FOR THEM.IT IS MY PLEASURE TO DO SO WHEN I CAN GET GREAT STUFF INEXPENSIVELY FROM AMAZON! I HIGHLYN RECOMMEND THESE.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2769882", "1": "0.22729038", "2": "0.1148837", "4": "0.1752624", "5": "0.13095996", "6": "0.07204675"}}
