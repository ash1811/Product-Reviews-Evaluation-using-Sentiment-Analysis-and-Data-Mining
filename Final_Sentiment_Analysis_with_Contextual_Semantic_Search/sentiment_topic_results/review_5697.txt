{"text": "I had high hopes for these sweats as I have several sweatshirts by Jerzees that I really like. These are a poor imitation. I've worn them bicycling twice and washed once and already a side seam and pocket stitching have unravelled!! I hardly consider that wear-and-tear, that is just way too soon for any garment to start falling apart. On closer inspection I see that all the stitching is cheaply done, you'd expect more quality for .09 cents per/hr from a Honduran sweatshop.Hey Jerzee: bring the work back to the good ol' USA!! The extra $1.50 in labor costs to the garment is worth it to have the quality back", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.047546823", "1": "0.22093345", "2": "0.06434961", "3": "0.15562508", "4": "0.11860831", "5": "0.11519461", "6": "0.27774212"}}
