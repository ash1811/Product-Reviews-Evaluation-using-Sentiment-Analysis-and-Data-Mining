{"text": "Perfect size - not too big and not too small. Will fit on most any belt and contains ample space for your carry items. Good materials well stitched together. Another review stated they got one with plastic hardware - mine was metal. Reminds me of the old school military pouches that will stand up to heavy use (at least that's what I'm hoping for). No regrets on this purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16968608", "1": "0.20245527", "2": "0.062087387", "4": "0.19717494", "5": "0.06918985", "6": "0.29599217"}}
