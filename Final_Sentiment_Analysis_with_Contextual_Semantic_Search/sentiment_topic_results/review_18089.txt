{"text": "REVIEWED BY A FAMILY MEMBER:I needed an easy to read analog watch with a second hand.  Since I don't like to wear watches, I needed one that's comfortably lightweight.This Casio watch fits the bill nicely ... and it's cute!SEE MY PHOTOS IN CUSTOMER IMAGESThis Casio watch is certainly not unobtrusive.  It's a petite casual/sporty women's watch with just enough feminine style.PROS:Small lightweight watch (case diameter 24mm)Easy to read numeral display with sweep (second) handCasio rubber strap contours to my hand comfortably after a couple of daysThe Casio watch case is rated 'Water Resistant' - So, it's waterproof enough to wear while washing your hands or walking in the rainThe watch is powered by quartz movement so, it's very accurate ... I only reset my watch for daylight saving!Although it's certainly not G Shock tough, this watch is well built and makes a great utilitarian work watch.  If you like the feel of a small lightweight analog watch on your hands that's simple to use ... then this Casio watch is the one!(REVIEWED BY A FAMILY MEMBER)Hope the review and photos were helpful ...
