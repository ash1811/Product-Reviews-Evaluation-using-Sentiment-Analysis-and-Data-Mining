{"text": "I am graduate student who needs decent clothes for not much money. I used to be a Russell Athletic shirt wearer but their quality took a nose dive and Dickies seems to be the only clothes vendor I can find who sells decently made clothing for a good price. All other t-shirt manufacturers are making shirts too small or from thin crappy fabric. Dickies is the only one I know who still makes a shirt heavy enough to last and with seams that will not tear in a stiff  breeze. If you want quality, this is where you will find it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.100831926", "1": "0.30883887", "2": "0.17208584", "3": "0.23522756", "4": "0.053058457", "6": "0.1272441"}}
