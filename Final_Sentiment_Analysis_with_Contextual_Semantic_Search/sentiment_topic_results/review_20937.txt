{"text": "I wore the original version of this shoe for Army PT for years. Wore great, comfortable and the soles never wore out.  This version is lighter weight, cheaper build and is a sneaker vs a running shoe.  Very comfortable to walk in and good traction from the sole.  If you are looking for a good shoe for light walking or everyday wear you can't go wrong with the price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.40388077", "2": "0.1406334", "3": "0.07985278", "4": "0.07392587", "5": "0.29454425"}}
