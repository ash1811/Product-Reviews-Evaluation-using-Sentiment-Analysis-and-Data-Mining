{"text": "I have gotten several of these now and they are supportive, comfortable and lasted me a long time (my bras tend to wear out quickly due to the weight of my larger bust), even wore them after I stopped nursing.  The fabric holds well, but is also stretchy enough to handle size fluctuations that happen postpartum/while nursing.  The wider straps keep them from digging in to my shoulders.  They are also cheaper than most of the nursing bras for my size that I've looked at.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06636086", "1": "0.1952542", "2": "0.07074367", "3": "0.2212355", "4": "0.16410697", "5": "0.12928045", "6": "0.15301836"}}
