{"text": "I purchased this to wear while I'm over in Europe, however since I've been wearing it since I received it and really like it as an everyday watch.  I like the large display and the white background.  I have a very very small wrist, and I can report that it fits fine with 3 more notches to spare out of 11.  I recommend this watch for day to day wearing as the face doesn't look too cheap or anything, and looks a lot better than the product image.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.066743605", "1": "0.26653656", "2": "0.2696851", "3": "0.04403726", "4": "0.0858869", "5": "0.26377866"}}
