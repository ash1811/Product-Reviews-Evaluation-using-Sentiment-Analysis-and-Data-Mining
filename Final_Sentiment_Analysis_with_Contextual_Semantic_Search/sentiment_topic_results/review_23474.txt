Mineral crystal with cyclop feature. Water resistance to 200 meters or 660 feet. The bezel (coin edge type) reminds me of the more expensive Rolex Submariner.

This is the watch that made aficionados world wide think about the real cost of Rolex watches. Are you paying for status symbol or quality?
