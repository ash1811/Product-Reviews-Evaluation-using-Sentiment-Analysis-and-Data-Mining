{"text": "Bloch is a name brand in dance shoes.  I listened to other reviews and only sized up 1 1/2 sizes from my street shoes, and 1 size up from my sneaker size.  They fit but were snug and my toes were way up at the tip.  I tried wearing them around the house and tried a Zumba routine.  They were okay but I am having problems with the balls of my feet, so since these are not cushioned I was not in heaven.  These are good shoes but just not for me.  I ordered them another 1/2 size larger and they were a little loose.  However, they, too did not feel good on the foot after awhile, so I am returning both pairs.I would not discourage anyone from buying these shoes.  Just remember to order 1 - 2 sizes up.  Can be annoying.  I wish the dance shoe companies would make their shoe sizes the same as sneaker sizes.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12209323", "1": "0.21231054", "2": "0.13214295", "3": "0.33175197", "4": "0.06261143", "5": "0.04098394", "6": "0.098105945"}}
