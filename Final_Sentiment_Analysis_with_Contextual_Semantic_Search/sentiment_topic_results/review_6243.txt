{"text": "I got this for my 3 year old Star Wars obsessed son. He loves it and it's super cute.  The outfit is a felt like material with the brown vest attached under the off white robe. The ears are floppy and do not stand up like in the picture but I don't feel that takes away from the costume. He's 38 inches tall and it is the perfect length.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18273424", "1": "0.24978314", "2": "0.17726594", "4": "0.051343646", "5": "0.12174768", "6": "0.2131386"}}
