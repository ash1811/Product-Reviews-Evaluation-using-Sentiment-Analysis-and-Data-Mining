{"text": "Thanks to the other reviewers, I ordered this bra. It is perfect for the D cups. Finding a comfortable bra that works well is not easy if you're full breasted. No underwired needed...really.  You don't need an underwire with this bra. It gives excellent shaping. There's no digging into the skin under your breasts...no marks left because the underside band is a soft and slightly padded....no scratchy elastic gripping at your skin.  Ths shoulder straps stay in place and are comfortable...no marks left in your skin. The support is awesome. The back does have 4 or 5 hooks for the D cups, but it also has a strong meshlike, side to back panel. It allows for movement and stretch as you move. Non binding. It does not \"cut\" into your underarm area. The cups have very minimal stretch and very good separation and shaping. The cups do have a seam, but the seam is flat, and sewn flat. The front of the bra doesn't gape away from your chest. This is not a harness. It is relatively lightweight and very comfortable....very supportive.  I like it. The bra offers support, shaping and comfort.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.043150995", "1": "0.2723344", "2": "0.09310165", "3": "0.12817514", "4": "0.10909991", "5": "0.1809403", "6": "0.17319764"}}
