{"text": "Lee Jeans makes a great pair of loose fitting jeans for gentlemen who want a slightly more relaxed look to their jeans; and these jeans are also a good choice for people like me who are slightly overweight. They just plain give you extra room; and that's great!The denim is nice and thick; and these jeans are extremely durable. The excellent stitching helps make this possible. In fact, these jeans last for years at a time without any fraying--even at the bottoms of the legs. Although they are permanent press, I would wash these jeans with similar colors to avoid any color dye bleeding onto white garments in the wash or dryer cycle.I also like the relaxed, very slightly oversized look on the sides of the straight legs.Overall, these fine jeans by Lee Jeans easily rival jeans made by other manufacturers.

If you want a pair of jeans with some extra room in the seat and thigh areas, this may be just what you're looking for.
