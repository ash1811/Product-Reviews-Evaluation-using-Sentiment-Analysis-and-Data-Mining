{"text": "I bought two pair. Like shoes the lack of pants in my size at local stores e.g. Target (there's TWO less than a mile apart and neither have 34/32!? Maybe someone will discover inventory control and predict consumer buying...) so I am looking at amazon to buy pants.They are heavy which while they'll probably hold up pretty well over time are also a bit warm. I have a hard time dealing with the front pockets. I keep my keys and change, cigarette lighter in my front pockets and it always seems a tight fit getting my hand in them to fish out what I need. I don't have this problem with Levis or Wranglers.On the (new) pair I am wearing today there are loose string loops on the outer leg seams in more than one place. Whether this is an issue of quality control or merely quality I don't know. The other pair does not have the same loose string problem.They are fairly comfortable but really that is often a factor of your body itself. Not any more comfortable than Levis to me though.The legs are longer than typical jeans of the same size. My 34/32s are more like a 34/33.If you never tried on a pair I might suggest trying them at a store first before buying online. I wish I could but see my opening thesis...", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10906864", "1": "0.33263227", "2": "0.088883646", "3": "0.10623481", "4": "0.079870515", "5": "0.103437394", "6": "0.17987275"}}
