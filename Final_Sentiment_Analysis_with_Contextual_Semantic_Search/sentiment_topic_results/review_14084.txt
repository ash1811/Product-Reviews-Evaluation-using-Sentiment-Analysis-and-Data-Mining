{"text": "I was paying $10 to get my battery changed in my Fossil watch every year or two.. I bought a battery for $2 bucks and with this tool...basically paid for itself. Mine did not come with any instructions but was easy to figure out..and like others said..just push in the correct bit all the way and it will not fall out. The other bits are odd looking and curious what kind of watch takes them but I only needed the one set for all my watches.. Very pleased. Not giving 5 stars because there are no instructions and the case is lame..but still a good buy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07996008", "1": "0.42904362", "2": "0.23579425", "4": "0.090753496", "5": "0.11027111", "6": "0.051520493"}}
