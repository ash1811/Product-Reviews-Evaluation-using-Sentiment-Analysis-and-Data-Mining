{"text": "I love these bags.  They are inexpensive and they hold quite a bit.  We travel quite a bit and I keep them packed so I am ready to go at a moments notice.  I bought several of these in different colors so that I can separate my items easily and keep similar items together.  They have so many uses for traveling as well as in the home.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.26598388", "1": "0.19361107", "3": "0.2619078", "4": "0.14752936", "6": "0.12201773"}}
