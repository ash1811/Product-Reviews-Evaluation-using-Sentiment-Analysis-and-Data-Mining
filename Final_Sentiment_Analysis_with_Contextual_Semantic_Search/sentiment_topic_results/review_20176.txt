{"text": "...compartments are designed! Read on for details...This is a very thoughtfully-designed bag! Handles in all the right places and durability to boot! My beau and I took it on a 6-week tour of Italy & Spain (mostly walking, buses, trains, 4 plane rides, a few cabs, and a Mercedes) - pulling, toting, lifting... all were very easy with this bag. The COOLEST feature (that I have not seen on another bag in this \"class\") is that the inside cavity is divided into **two large SEPARATE sections**, accessible by various zippers, and also, convertible into one massive section. This feature was great for us, because we only took this one bag with us (to save fees & increase convenience). Because of this feature, I could have one part of the section and my beau could have the other part of the section, both totally separate. The sections \"split\" at the \"hinge\" of the bag, so when we rolled up to a new hotel (and there were MANY!), we just popped open the bag at the hinge and he could get to his things and I could get to my things, without tossing around the entire contents of the bag (or messing up the other's organizational system)! This feature makes this bag SO MUCH MORE CONVENIENT that others without this feature, whether you are two people sharing a bag, or one person who wants a compartment for clean and a compartment for dirty or a compartment for casual and a compartment for dressy, etc. It's like having a rolling dresser with you - like how many of the old steamer trunks (for long voyages) were designed.We liked this feature so much, that we bought the matching smaller carry-on version for a recent trip to New Orleans. With the help of some space-bag style compression bags, I was able to pack a dozen adult-sized outfits, a bath-towel, my bed pillow, lots of shower items, numerous electronic gadgetry & chargers, and even two pairs of flip-flops! And, that was in the smaller version of this bag!Other great features you never knew you needed:**padded back-pack straps** (these are great when you're trekking through muddy or dirty ground, or up a lot of stairs or need to carry/hold on to something else in your hands, etc.) - if you're strong enough to carry the packed pack on your back, just remove the straps from their pouch, slip them on your shoulders, lift/stand with your leg muscles, and you're good to go. As with most rolling backpacks, there's a nice flap that covers the \"exposed\" part of the pack so your back/butt stays clean when carrying it on your back.Also, there's a **very big and roomy pocket on the top** that can hold something about the size of a child's bike helmet. This pocket is great for shoes, chargers, snacks, travel umbrella, flashlight, wet clothes, travel guides, etc.My beau says the **duffel-style straps** on this bag, the ones that go across the girth (belly) of the bag, are a great option for carrying the bag up a short flight of stairs or loading onto an airport shuttle luggage rack, etc. Much easier than trying to do this with a bag that only has a top or maybe a side handle. Another great feature of these straps is that they are held together by a padded velcro-closure handle, which can be used to **secure the bag to something stationary** to give it a little more security then without this. It's no stainless steel cable, but I bet a thief (or mistaken/confused passenger) would be less likely to casually pick up and walk away with a bag that was tethered, than one that is not.Even completely full, I found the bag to be **well-balanced and easy to wheel** through most terrain (even those old European cobblestone and gravel alleys!) The **zippers are easy to close** and the fabric (so far) has proven to be **very durable** (we've taken it on numerous long trips in the 4 years we've owned it).We own the Graphite/Titanium/Spring (grey with lime green accents) colored bag. So, another bonus is that it **doesn't look like all those black wheeled suitcases out there**, so it's less likely someone will accidentally walk off with the bag, or that you will mistake someone else's for your own. Remember, a tightly-tied bandanna or brightly-colored ribbon will minimize the possibility of this, as well!Happy Travels...I rely on reviews here at Amazon to help me make informed buying choices.
