{"text": "I was looking for a good looking, comfortable, analog watch that simply told me the time. No extra features needed.  This watch fits my criteria perfectly! It reminds me of those classic white-faced clocks with black numbers we see in places like schools and hospitals. Very utilitarian. They simply tell the time and are very easy to read.  It's like I'm wearing a micro version of that classic clock on my wrist.What (specifically) do I like it about this watch?Size.It's lightweight, thin, and unobtrusive. You forget it's on your wrist.Simple.No clutter on the face. It tells you the time. That's it.Easy-to-read face with great contrast.It has big black numbers that stand out, a light ivory background, and black hands.Very comfortable band.I like this material. It's soft and flexible. When you bend your wrist, it bends with you. No jabbing or stiffness.Good looking, minimalist design. The watch is not trying to make a statement.And oh, I almost forgot the price. It was ten bucks!Cons:The band should be longer. It's not a problem for me, but as a warning for guys with large wrists, it might not be long enough. I would consider my wrists medium to large, and I'm down to the third hole from the end.Some users have complained that the face is too small. This complaint is more of a personal preference rather than a criticism (or con) of the watch.  Casio does give the face dimensions.  I knew what I was getting into, and I have come to prefer this size. I have a very large stainless steel Fossil watch that I grew tired of wearing because it's obtrusive, heavy, and the band is metal which can be uncomfortable.This is a watch that gets the job done, looks good doing it, and gets out of the way!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.24864374", "2": "0.17625502", "3": "0.23583099", "4": "0.09158316", "5": "0.04418375", "6": "0.20145671"}}
