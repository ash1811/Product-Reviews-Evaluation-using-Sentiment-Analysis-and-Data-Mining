{"text": "I wear flip flops as much of the year as I can, and even when I can't wear them outside, I wear them in the house. I am very happy to have discovered Reef sandals. They are the most comfortable sandals and a reasonable price.The Ginger flip flop has a nice thick sole that provides some arch support and the top is a pretty design on cloth. For flip flops, these are stylish and comfortable and the size is true to my shoe size. (If there is any question, go to the next higher size.)My only concern is the part that goes over the foot. Although it is very cute, the top is somewhat thinner than I am accustomed to so I am not sure that it will hold up as well as some of the others. However, because it is thin, it is very comfortable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06858174", "1": "0.34034255", "2": "0.15717286", "3": "0.2490401", "4": "0.109801605", "6": "0.072588734"}}
