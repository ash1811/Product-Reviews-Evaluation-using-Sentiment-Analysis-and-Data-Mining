{"text": "I wear size-7.5 in a regular shoe and got size-8 Sloggers. My feet are not super wide, but not narrow either. The Sloggers are a perfect fit.  I have been wearing Sloggers for a couple of weeks now. They are very comfortable, and I have been wearing them not only in the garden or washing the car, but when I have to do quick errands in the rain.  Yesterday, it was pouring and I actually wore them to work, so I was in Sloggers for about 12 hours! I had no problems at all. I was as comfortable in the evening as I was in the morning.  My feet were NOT hot and sweaty despite not taking them off for such a long time.Sloggers are a bit heavier than I expected. They are made of rubberized material top and bottom. No openings anywhere, so they are very good for walking in wet grass. Surprisingly, my feet do not get too hot despite having no ventilation in the shoe. The sole of the shoe is nicely textured.  I am attaching a photo which shows the top and the bottom of the shoe.  Next to the shoe I positioned a ruler so you can see how high the back of the shoe rises.  The back is not totally open, it has a slight rise which help to keep your foot firmly in the shoe.  The bottom of the show has some padding, so it provides nice support for the foot and is responsible for very comfortable feeling.  And of course they are very easy to put on and take off, which is very handy when your hands are covered with dirt from the garden.The second photo I am attaching to this review shows my foot wearing the shoe, hopefully this gives a better idea of the look and fit than just the shoe by itself.  In a close-up you can see a bit of room in the back - the difference between size-7.5 foot and size-8 shoe.The men a work made fun of the shoes, they thought they were ugly (what do they know?), but I think they are cute plus very comfortable and functional.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08328725", "1": "0.27866355", "2": "0.10503028", "3": "0.2544734", "4": "0.15184246", "5": "0.08643402", "6": "0.040269088"}}
