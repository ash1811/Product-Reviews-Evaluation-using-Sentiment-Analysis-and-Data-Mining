{"text": "The shawl is soft and beautiful as advertised. It is substantial and not flimsy at all. The dark blue is not a navy, but runs to the green a bit, like a very dark, deep teal. I was hoping for a navy color, but it is gorgeous, nonetheless.One item that was unexpected (and this could be because I've never bought anything like this before), but the texture of the shawl is brushed. The yarn from the woven fabric is brushed over the rest of the fabric. This gives it a striking shimmery quality, BUT it also means that there is no way to use the lint roller to remove all of the white cat hair floating around my house. The lint roller would pull all of the gently brushed alpaca hair out. I would have bought a lighter color if I had known (I may anyway because the shawl is so pretty, and my house is so cold in winter).I have not washed it yet. It is marked as dry clean only, but I hand-wash woolens (including cashmere) in cool water and gentle soap.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06542861", "1": "0.113735445", "2": "0.1384023", "3": "0.12126476", "4": "0.25961885", "5": "0.15703811", "6": "0.14451194"}}
