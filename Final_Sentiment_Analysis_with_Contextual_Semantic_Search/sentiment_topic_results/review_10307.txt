They are nicely padded in the middle but not so thick that they annoyed him and they don't look puffy under clothes. When we switched my son over to the only other type of underwear you can find for toddlers, crappy superhero ones, the scratchy elastic rubbed red marks around the top of his thighs so I just bought more of these.
