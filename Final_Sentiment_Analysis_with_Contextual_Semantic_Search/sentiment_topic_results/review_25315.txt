{"text": "I love this shoe.  I work outdoors, am on my feet, hiking trails a lot for my work.  This shoes fits nicely, is a rugged shoe, gives great support, and it breathes really well so my feet don't feel like they are basting in sweat.  Great shoe.  My only gripe is that unless you tie a double knot the round shoestrings come untied quite a bit.  There are times I am hiking or pushing a mower when I have to stop anywhere from one to three times to retie my shoes.  Tying double knots of course takes care of this, but other sneakers and walking shoes I've had definitely didn't demand I double tie them.  BUT, this shoe is a great shoe, and so double tie them I will.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09380227", "1": "0.09543731", "2": "0.300938", "3": "0.24135034", "4": "0.14169723", "5": "0.10405905", "6": "0.02271579"}}
