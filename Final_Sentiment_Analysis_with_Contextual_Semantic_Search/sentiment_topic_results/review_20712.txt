{"text": "I'm so sad I can't wear these.  My right foot likes the 41, tho it's a tiny bit short and has my heel sitting on the heel a bit.  But that would have been OK, because it holds the foot beautifully otherwise.  Lovely sole etc.The left foot seems to have gotten wider since my pregnancy, and it just complains about these uppers.  They are too snug over the big toe joint. Removing the insoles doesn't work - it removes all the support including the (mild) arch support, and just makes them much too deep over all.  So there it is! I also tried the 42s, but they're a tad long and too loose over all in both feet.It's also true that the non-adjustable strap is a bad idea.  It's baggy.So near and yet so far! My quest for comfortable-and-cute shoes goes on...I'm returning both sizes.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03086005", "1": "0.15697937", "2": "0.05970316", "3": "0.28393328", "4": "0.26213935", "5": "0.05499179", "6": "0.15139304"}}
