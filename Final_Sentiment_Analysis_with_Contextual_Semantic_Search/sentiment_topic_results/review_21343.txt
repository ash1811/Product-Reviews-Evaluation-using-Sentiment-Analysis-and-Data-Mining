{"text": "I wish I had returned it but now it's gathering dust. There are only 3 spots where it can be adjusted so just hope that your particular size works with one of them. They are too far apart. So if you pick one and it's too tight, the next one is going to be too loose. It wasn't comfortable at all.  At least Velcro is more adjustable to various sizes! Would not recommend!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.1971127", "2": "0.56725", "5": "0.05735675", "6": "0.16483566"}}
