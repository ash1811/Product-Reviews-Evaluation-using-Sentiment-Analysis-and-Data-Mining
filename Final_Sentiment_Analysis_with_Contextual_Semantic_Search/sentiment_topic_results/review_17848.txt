{"text": "I bought this watch as a gift for my brother who specifically wanted a better looking digital watch to wear to work.  Out of the countless watches I looked at, this Casio was the best one (and it's round twin) under $100.  It has most of the desired features in a digital:  alarm, stopwatch, timer.  It also has a temperature meter but I wonder about it's accuracy.  In any case, the digital readout is very difficult to see in the light of day.  At night, a push of the illumination button makes it easy to see.  The band looks OK but is cheap rolled steel with no attempt made to polish/brush the sides to conceal that fact.  All in all, a decent watch that stands out in looks compared to other budget digital watches.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07853284", "2": "0.17199616", "3": "0.18932143", "4": "0.19857231", "5": "0.0755457", "6": "0.28371447"}}
