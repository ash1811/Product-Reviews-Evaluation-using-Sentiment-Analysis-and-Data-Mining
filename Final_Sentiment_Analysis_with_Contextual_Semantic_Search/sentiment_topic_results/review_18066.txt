{"text": "The product arrived rapidly and was what we ordered.  However, the watch band has never stayed clasped.  We've taken it to two watch shops and said \"we don't work on Casios.\"  We said it was just the band and they turned up their nose.  Obviously, we won't be shopping at those shops again. Too much hassle and expense to return this item considering the cost, so we're looking to replace the band already--which will cost more than the watch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16349606", "2": "0.20649172", "3": "0.17790292", "4": "0.16525407", "5": "0.16882698", "6": "0.11460595"}}
