{"text": "I bought this to replace a very similar watch I wore for years, but after that one broke I stopped wearing watches altogether since I could just look at my cell phone for the time. It turns out I almost never carry my cellphone, so  I often don't know the time. This changes that problem.I think I have an average size wrist, but it is a little tight. It took a while to getting used to wearing a watch after not wearing one for several years. I've gotten right back in the groove though. I know what time and day and date it is with just a glance. The design is clean and good looking so that it can be an everyday wear watch, with all the outfits you have.One struggle is in setting the day and date. There are three positions for the little knob, and when you're pulling it out, it is so easy to bypass the middle position you need to set the day and date. I figured it out, but I initially had to hand it to my wife to figure it out, so bad was my frustration.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.095918246", "1": "0.30087015", "2": "0.19930208", "3": "0.13723028", "4": "0.14998473", "5": "0.11426515"}}
