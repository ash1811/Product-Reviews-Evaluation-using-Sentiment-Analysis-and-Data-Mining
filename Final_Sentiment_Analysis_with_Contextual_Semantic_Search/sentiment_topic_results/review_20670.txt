{"text": "I ordered the 44\" black belt with black buckle. Product arrived very quickly. It is a sturdy belt, 1.5\" wide, made of heavy duty cotton. I prefer cotton to nylon because they seem to be just as durable in all but the most extreme conditions and hold onto the belt buckle more securely because they are less likely to slip than nylon. Anyway, my two cents.The buckle is heavy duty enough. Not quite bullet proof but sturdy enough to last a long time. Definitely worth the money.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19058956", "1": "0.2143105", "2": "0.15175591", "3": "0.18384618", "4": "0.078502625", "5": "0.09783279", "6": "0.08316246"}}
