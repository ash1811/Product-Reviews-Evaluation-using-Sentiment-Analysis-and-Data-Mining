{"text": "Overall, I really like this travel bag.  The pockets are a generous size and each can fit multiple items.  My only issue is that one of the zippers broke very early on (within the first 2 weeks).  If the zipper had not broken, I would have been happy to give this product 5 stars.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11027108", "1": "0.25007033", "3": "0.06518476", "4": "0.13920246", "5": "0.18593249", "6": "0.24437769"}}
