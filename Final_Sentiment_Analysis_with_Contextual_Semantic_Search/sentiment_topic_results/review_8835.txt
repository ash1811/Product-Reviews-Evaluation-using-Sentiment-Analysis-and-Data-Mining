{"text": "Bought a pair of 33x30. I think they fit like 28x30. Like 3&#34; short of snapping.I bought these because I am tired of paying a lot for Levies and never knowing where I am getting a good price or a horrible price. Also, what model, etc.FYI - My wife did not like these. Thought they looked very very boring. Old man pants.Liked:- Quality made or so in my opinion in the 10 min I looked at them and tried them on.Disliked:- About 5 sizes too small. Not sure why. I checked the inside label to be sure.- They are a bit old man looking. More so than I could tell from the online pic.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12400053", "1": "0.3224705", "2": "0.111038916", "3": "0.083590776", "4": "0.17754121", "5": "0.10707342", "6": "0.07428462"}}
