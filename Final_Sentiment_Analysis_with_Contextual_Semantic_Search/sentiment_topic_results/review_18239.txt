{"text": "Pros:1) It only cost me $24.2) It's comfortable.  This watch will fit a wide range of wrists!  13 holes in the band for your fitting pleasure!3) It's not a G-shock... But it possesses many functions ordinarily carried by one.  I.e. Alarm, Timer, Stopwatch.  And it seems fairly strong... Not likely to fall apart for at least a few years.4) COOL feature- Time continues to display during Timer & Stopwatch modes.5) Green &#34;Electro Luminescent Backlight&#34; sufficiently lights watch for 1.5 seconds.  (I timed it for ya!)Cons:1) While using the Timer or the Stopwatch, one must &#34;reset&#34; using the upper-left hand &#34;Adjust&#34; button which is recessed (and on most watches reserved strictly for adjustments of settings).  For instance, the watch wearer needs to press &#34;Adjust&#34; to &#34;zero out&#34; the stopwatch.  I dunno... It'll be especially awkward especially if you're a track/swim coach, or someone who often uses those features.Well, I like it!!  But, I have 25 other watches too, most of which I also like.  This carries all the traditional functions of a Casio watch.  Thank you for reading this... hopefully it helped.  Ask any questions... I'm pretty good about replying within a day or two.Happy Holidays !!!  :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06521446", "1": "0.12580931", "2": "0.19405136", "3": "0.0950231", "4": "0.31536722", "5": "0.11596149", "6": "0.08857301"}}
