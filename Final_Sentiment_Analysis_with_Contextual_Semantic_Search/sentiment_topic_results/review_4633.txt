{"text": "My dad likes to wear more formal shoes, but also has some problems with his feet. Since Sperrys are so comfortable and have so much support, I figured getting him a pair of Sperrys &#34;masked&#34; as a traditional loafer would be a great gift solution. My dad loved them. They are very nice quality. He is normally between an 11 and 11.5W(EE) in shoes, and the 11 fit him perfectly. All around very happy with this product and Amazon!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03300727", "1": "0.5148875", "2": "0.10388516", "3": "0.10880898", "4": "0.19815566", "5": "0.037766624"}}
