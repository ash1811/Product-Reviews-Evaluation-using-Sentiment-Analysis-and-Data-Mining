{"text": "These liners do exactly what I want them to do.  First, they are thin enough to fit under my snow gloves without bunching up.  Second, I can take off the snow gloves to give treats to my dogs during our walks and my hands don't freeze.  Thanks to the reviewer who gave size measurements - the small fit great based on those measurements.  I've only had these for a couple of days so don't know how they will hold up but for now I like them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.19393165", "1": "0.2627565", "2": "0.1485121", "3": "0.15928186", "5": "0.22850081"}}
