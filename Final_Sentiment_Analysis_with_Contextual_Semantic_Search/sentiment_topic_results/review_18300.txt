{"text": "I remember when I bought my first Casio watch back in college which was around 1973.  Cost was around $50, no kidding for a plastic watch with a funny digital screen.  Fast forward 30 years and I am finding myself buying almost an identical watch with some minor mechanical and cosmetic improvements for $13.  It just doesn't get any better.  Hope they continue making these watches.  They are affordable, keep incredibly accurate time and weight almost nothing.  I now find myself returning to a simpler time in my life with this incredible watch. For now, my Invicta, Timex, G Shock and other oversize timpieces can be placed in storage and worn on a special occassions. Big is not necessarily beautiful and practical.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.18218917", "2": "0.22283892", "3": "0.1178152", "4": "0.10034959", "5": "0.19071896", "6": "0.1840069"}}
