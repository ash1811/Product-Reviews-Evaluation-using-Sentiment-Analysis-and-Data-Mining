{"text": "I switched from briefs to boxers over a year ago and these are my favorite hot weather underwear.  The cotton boxers are simply too warm under a pair of pants, even shorts, when it's hot out.  Briefs are a bit less comfortable and also warmer than the wickers.  So, for regular day to day use, these wickers are pretty good.I don't wear them running, but do wear them hiking/camping.  The only negative is in camp when someone notices that you're wearing something that looks like silk undies.  I tell 'em that at least mine are dry, theirs are still wet with sweat, and that their junk is going to rot.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.105071604", "1": "0.30003586", "2": "0.12676497", "4": "0.2296828", "5": "0.03925356", "6": "0.19679345"}}
