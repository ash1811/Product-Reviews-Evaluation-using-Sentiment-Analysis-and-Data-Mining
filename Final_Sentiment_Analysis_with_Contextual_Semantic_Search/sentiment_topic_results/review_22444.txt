{"text": "Although these are decent enough and a much more economical decision than buying individual pairs of panties, one thing was immediately obvious to me upon opening the package: none of these were uniform. I know that even for machines, some slight variation is to be expected - but come on, more than two inches difference in the waist between two pairs in the same package, both marked \"size 5/S\"? That's a little more than a \"slight variation\" - for me it's the difference between (comfortably) wearable or not, and so what I really paid for was only 5 pairs.On the other hand, other reviews for similar Hanes products contain some even more dire findings, like pairs that were cut with an entirely different rise or that had one leg hugely different than the other...so I guess this wasn't entirely unexpected.The point stands, though: buy these keeping in mind that you may get less than advertised.Addendum: after ordering a second pack, I'd also like to note that you won't always get \"3 white, 3 black\". Instead, I got an \"assorted\" pack with 2 black, one pink, one cream, one brown, one tan. I don't particularly mind, since it was the same price and none of the colors are objectionable...it's the same basic product. Still, if you are ordering these specifically for black and white, you may be disappointed. (Or maybe they just ran out of stock...)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.24971364", "2": "0.09600873", "3": "0.44525102", "4": "0.0359369", "5": "0.13525863", "6": "0.035513524"}}
