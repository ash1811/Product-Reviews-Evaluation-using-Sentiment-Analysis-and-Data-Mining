{"text": "Soft, lovely color exactly as pictured and sized correctly.  I purchased a S and it fit perfectly  HOWEVER, note that I am 5'7&#34;, 115 lbs.  I wear a women's size 2 in slacks and am an A cup.  If you are large busted it may not fit as you want.  As in many lingerie pieces, the panties are tiny...but again, note I am a size 2.  Because the straps cross in the back it will take you a minute to figure out how to get into it.  So again, if you are a larger woman, getting it over your head and placed correctly could be a little harder.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14339834", "1": "0.3766029", "2": "0.12495284", "3": "0.09105295", "4": "0.16694422", "6": "0.09439416"}}
