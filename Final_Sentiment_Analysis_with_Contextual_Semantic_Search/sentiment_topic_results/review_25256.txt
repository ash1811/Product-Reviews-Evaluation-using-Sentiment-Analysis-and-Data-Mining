{"text": "I bought two pairs from Amazon around my expected size and got a great fit with the smaller pair.Amazon makes it so easy to return the pair that did not fit. I went to orders page to get an RMA. I printed out the RMA form and the free return shipping label. They come in a plastic bag with a spare adhesive strip, so I put the big pair back into the bag and used the spare adhesive strip to seal the bag. That took 15 minutes.I dropped them off at Staples at lunch time for UPS pickup and when I got home Amazon had credited my card without even waiting to get them back. It cant get any simpler. Saved 2 hours by not having to drive to REI, which didnt even have one of the wide sizes I wanted to try in stock.-------------------------------------I bought the boot for desert hiking, so I did not get the more expensive &#34;gore-tax&#34; version. If the boots and my feet some how get wet in a spring or wash, they will dry out pretty quickly in the desert. In fact I avoid gore-tex products because a cheaper alternative called eVent (made by GE) has been tested by the US Army Labs at Natick, Mass and found to offer superior breathability. For a citation, &#34;google army natick goretex test&#34;They are definetly not for back packing--just day hiking--because the soles are not stiff.If you are going to be scrambling on limestone out in the desert, a sole made of Stealth Rubber(TM) is better, but since its just a vacation trip, I decided on these.The wide size fits true for me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.141653", "1": "0.16926706", "2": "0.073783584", "3": "0.18138938", "4": "0.19645037", "5": "0.07817104", "6": "0.1592856"}}
