{"text": "I haven't ordered nice shoes online before and wasn't very confident that it would work out with sizing and such, but when I got these and tried them on they fit incredibly and they look amazing.  I will be wearing these to work now.  I can now trash my old Bass shoes from 2002 that I tried to wear that looked horrible.  If you get the regular fit it is somewhat snug around the outside of your foot, but fits quite nicely.  If you want a little wiggle room get the wider fit.  Great, fancy shoes that look fantastic with dress clothes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.033542175", "1": "0.5254516", "2": "0.20960872", "4": "0.06466261", "5": "0.055671804", "6": "0.10835808"}}
