{"text": "I found this watch for my husband probably 10 yrs. ago.  He is really hard on his watches being a mechanic.  He likes all the feature, backlight, timer, stop watch, alarm.  The band is the best, it has a strap that goes under the watch that helps to keep the pressure off the pins. It's Velcro so easy to remove when needing to quickly.  I only have to purchase new when he either scratches up the face to much or loses it like he did this time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12671755", "1": "0.14731598", "2": "0.26662964", "3": "0.07674106", "4": "0.24893926", "6": "0.1302466"}}
