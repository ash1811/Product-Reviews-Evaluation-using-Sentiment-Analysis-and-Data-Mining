{"text": "All I wanted was a pair of hoop earring, yellow or white gold. I've worn this style as every day earrings for years and managed to lose one. These looked perfect and in spite of the outrageous increase of the price of gold, I decided to order them. The size was exactly as described and would have indeed been perfect except for the following: the part that goes into the piercing is not the usual wire. Instead it is a thin flat piece of gold that is significantly wider in diameter than a wire and was terribly uncomfortable. If you are a person with stretched out piercings, this may not bother you, but it was a deal breaker for me. The second problem is that earrings like this must have a good closure. ONE of them had a very tight closure- almost too tight but I could have lived with that. The other was so loose that it would have definitely come unhooked and I would have lost it. Needless to say, I was terribly disappointed. If you are a person who is used to wearing larger diameter earrings, I would say this could be a good deal if you get a pair with decent closures. They're beautiful and shiny and an excellent size. But if you're like I am and thick earrings hurt you, look for ones with wire style clasp backs.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.099509984", "1": "0.3287004", "2": "0.10609637", "3": "0.22557274", "5": "0.088796265", "6": "0.14895946"}}
