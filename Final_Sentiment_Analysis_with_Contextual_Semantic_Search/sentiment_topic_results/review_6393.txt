{"text": "I was given these sox when I bought a pair of running shoes at a marathon expo.  I like them so much that I wanted another pair and ordered these.  Although the brand and picture show the same sock, they are not exactly the same, or as good as my original pair.  The cushioning isn't as plush and the fabric doesn't wick moisture away from my toes as well.  If I didn't already have the pair I love, I might be less critical of them, but I won't be ordering more here.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09170401", "1": "0.17525598", "2": "0.1708562", "3": "0.25453466", "4": "0.09539643", "5": "0.14100729", "6": "0.071245395"}}
