{"text": "I love these, I was hesitating about size not because I thought they would be small but because I thought they would actually be too big as second earrings. I recently got a second hole pierced and I was wondering what to get in order to complement my swirly earrings and these guys do the trick. They aren't small so I don't know what people are talking about, but they aren't huge either. I never take them off; I go to the beach with them, shower and sleep with them and they don't bother me at all. Wouldn't hesitate to buy them again!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.038944464", "1": "0.23453729", "2": "0.16503097", "3": "0.22499903", "4": "0.13843924", "5": "0.076679915", "6": "0.12136913"}}
