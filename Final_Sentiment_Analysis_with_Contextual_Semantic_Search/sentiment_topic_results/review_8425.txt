{"text": "I bought these to wear as part of my Halloween costume. I dressed up as a character named Wendy from the \"Where is Waldo\" books to match my boyfriend who dressed up as Waldo and my Pomeranian who was dressed as the dog. I received them in less than a week. They are very comfortable and they looked great on. I haven't worn them for any other occasion just yet but I hope that I\"m able to incorporate them in another future Halloween costume.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2592362", "1": "0.30541", "3": "0.14880234", "4": "0.1451991", "5": "0.063350506", "6": "0.07423825"}}
