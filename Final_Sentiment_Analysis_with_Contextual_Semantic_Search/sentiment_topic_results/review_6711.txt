{"text": "I like this watch. Being a short woman with small hands and wrists, I was happy to find this product. I wish the strap or band was leather, but the price was inexpensive. I would pay more if the strap was made of leather, as the strap does not fit as well and turns to the side of my wrist. I readjust several times in a day. But again happy with price and quality of the watch itself.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12567076", "1": "0.2597946", "2": "0.34113374", "5": "0.18763605", "6": "0.07802055"}}
