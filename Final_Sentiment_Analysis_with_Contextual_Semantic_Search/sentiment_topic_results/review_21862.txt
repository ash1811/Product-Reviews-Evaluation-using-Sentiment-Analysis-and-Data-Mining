{"text": "The Under Armour duffle is a good gym bag. Lots of pockets. A brilliant shoe holder. One end of the bag opens up to a bag inside the duffle that can hold a pair of shoes and leave enough room for some clothes inside separated from your shoes. The interior is made of very light weight vinyl, not the same rough material of the exterior.This would not work well as a carry on bag for travelling. It is truly a gym bag.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11473649", "1": "0.13930272", "2": "0.36346447", "3": "0.13192773", "4": "0.07353367", "5": "0.12205769", "6": "0.0549772"}}
