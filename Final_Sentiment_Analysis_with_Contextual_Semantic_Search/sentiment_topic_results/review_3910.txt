{"text": "A year or two ago, I bought a different pair of Isotoner slippers.  I still have them and they work great but I bought them in pink and I wanted black.  That style hasn't been available for awhile now so I decided to get these since they are similar in design.  This pair looks slightly different, feels slightly different, and runs a size smaller than the last pair I bought.  I had to return my first pair of these which I ordered in a 7-8 because they were too small.  I exchanged them for the next size up, 8-9, and they fit much better.  Not crazy about them though.  I really prefer my original pair.I also want to give props to Jason C at Amazon for helping me out. I was having issues with the site during the exchange process and he made everything right for me.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.036939785", "1": "0.2494525", "2": "0.03448575", "3": "0.25215438", "4": "0.13574462", "5": "0.10430907", "6": "0.18691391"}}
