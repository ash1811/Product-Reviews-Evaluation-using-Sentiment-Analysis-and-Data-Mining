{"text": "I looked for a month to find a new carry-on sized, lightweight travel bag that has a 'back-slip' to slip onto the handle of a roll-aboard.  This bag fills the bill... except for one thing.  The zipper on the bag is not lockable.  In fact, it's zipper pulls/tabs are rather flimsy, so linking the two pulls with a small cable lock won't work very well to deter the casual thief.  [What I'm looking for it not Fort Knox... it's a fabric bag.  I'd just like a little bit of deterrence to keep people's hands off the contents of the bag.For me. the main competitor to this bag as a shoulder carry on is the heavier Eagle Creek Adventure duffel (a new model)... the EC bag is also considerably more expensive.  EC kind of screwed up the design (and wasted valueable end-pocket and pouch potential) with expansion zips on the bag's ends.  In other words, EC took a perfectly good bag and diminished its utility with its new 'expansion' capability.)  EC's heavier and clunkier expansion design and price were deal breakers compared to the lighter, nicely designed, and less expensive Akona duffel.  But the EC bag has lockable zippers.  Akona, please take note:  Put a lockable zipper on this bag and square off with Eagle Creek for the world's best shoulder, carry-on bag.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09181068", "1": "0.056158144", "2": "0.11362315", "3": "0.2591715", "4": "0.09978791", "5": "0.3243273", "6": "0.05512133"}}
