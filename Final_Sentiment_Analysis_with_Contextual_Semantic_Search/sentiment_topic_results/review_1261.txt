{"text": "OK, I don't play soccer.  Maybe that is why the big tongue?  In time does it lay down over the front or stay up to keep out dirt?  Must be padding for instep when you kick the ball? It did not work for me.Ordered my size (13) but I could slide my foot so far forward there was room for fingers behind my heel.  Tried heavier socks.  Made shoe too narrow and there was still 1.5 inches in front of my big toe even on the larger foot.  One of my feet is larger which is why I order 13.  Other is maybe 12 or 12.5, same medium (D) width.........at least it's not my ears, LOL.IF shoes were shorter, a proper 13, fit was excellent with light socks.  Construction was above average.  However even if I re-ordered 12s?? that tongue looks and feels dumb.  So today I am sending them back.Incidentally I also received a pair of Samoas in 13 and they fit perfect even though they are also adidas.  So the oversize is just in the Samba?  Overall the shoe is well made.  Ordered second pair of Samoas.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0823165", "1": "0.23526871", "2": "0.1799886", "3": "0.13440105", "4": "0.17039756", "5": "0.1367712", "6": "0.060856365"}}
