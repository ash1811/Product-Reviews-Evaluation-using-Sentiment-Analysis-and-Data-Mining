{"text": "I'm disappointed with the watch because I didn't know the strap was longer than usual. I have ordered this watch before and it fit fine. I don't know what to do about it because I don't know how to shorten the strap. I am 79 and I hate to be bothered with trying to find out where to have it shortened. Any help you could give me would be appreciated!
