{"text": "After watching many episodes of &#34;Double Divas&#34;, I was so excited when they started an online store with a fitting portion.  I found out I was actually wearing 2 cup sizes too small and 3 band sizes too big!  I ordered this bra because it reminded me of a Playtex bra I used to wear (obviously in the wrong size).  I was very pleased with the purchase.  It was comfortable to wear all day and I absolutely love the subtle color.  I had no problems with this bra and will definitely purchase it in the future as I have a need.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07912486", "1": "0.21359944", "2": "0.0770655", "3": "0.3135289", "4": "0.2143854", "5": "0.06748679", "6": "0.034809124"}}
