He has had this brand before and really liked them, also because they are waterproof and warm in colder weather. We walk outdoors in the wintertime a lot and he wanted a warm waterproof boot for winter wear. He also plans to wear them to work because he can wear casual wear at work and these are more comfortable than dress shoes.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.042096436", "1": "0.3870441", "2": "0.13168208", "3": "0.15351833", "4": "0.2443538", "6": "0.037802383"}}
