{"text": "I live in NZ and the winters here are pretty cold.  It is difficult to find leg warmers here.  If I happen to be lucky to find some - it would only come in black and the knit is quite thin.  When I asked why there were none, I heard from one New Zealander that leg warmers were knitted on demand because they are viewed as a retro type of garment.  I said bah!  They were like gloves for legs... functionally important in keeping legs warm!  I ordered some from Amazon and was quite chuffed at the different colours I could choose from. I can now wear these warmers with short skirts or long skirts or even pants...whichever I choose.  I now have colours that match...and I am bloody warm!  Thank you!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03712031", "1": "0.20131966", "2": "0.12036218", "3": "0.26146987", "4": "0.16357113", "5": "0.03447216", "6": "0.18168469"}}
