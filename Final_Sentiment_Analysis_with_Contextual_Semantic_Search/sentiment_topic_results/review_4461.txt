{"text": "What can I say that won't make me sound like I work for the Lee Denim Jean Company.They look great, the fit well, they are affordable and they are durable.Outside of a pair of cotton, baggy sweatpants...These Lee jeans are the MOST comfortable pants I own.I will definitely buy more...in a few years, when these wear out.Seriously... Highly recommend Lee Jeans.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14067802", "1": "0.31565562", "3": "0.21250795", "4": "0.044517912", "6": "0.27844527"}}
