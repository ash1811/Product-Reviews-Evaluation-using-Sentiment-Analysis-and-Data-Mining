{"text": "Well I don't have Ugg boots, although I wish I did.  I got these hoping to put them in my hiking boots to make them warmer.  But the inserts are a lot thicker than I thought they would be.But I do have an older pair of bootie style leather slippers with the sheepskin lining that is all worn away--I've since gotten a newer pair but they still feel too snug without the sheepskin squished down somewhat yet.  I put these in my older slippers and wow, what a difference.  I feel like I'm wearing new slippers without the excess sheepskin pressing on my toes from the side.This is a great option for extending the life of these types of slippers.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.2017802", "1": "0.14231291", "2": "0.14217408", "3": "0.09601318", "4": "0.08411909", "5": "0.1593099", "6": "0.17429063"}}
