{"text": "I loved these.  Still have them, very durable.  Warm.  These were better than the bomber jacket as those got a little funny in the material.  These are a great color, I was hesitant to buy them really due to the color, but they match everything.  They run a size larger. I am an 8, purchased a 7, so when I go back for another pair, it will be another 7.  It was a cold winter, and I found these easy transition slippers to shoes to go out and in. I felt these were a good deal and a great choice all the way around!  I like the non contrast also.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06102909", "1": "0.34091142", "2": "0.10098157", "3": "0.27784383", "4": "0.02959719", "5": "0.07174444", "6": "0.11789244"}}
