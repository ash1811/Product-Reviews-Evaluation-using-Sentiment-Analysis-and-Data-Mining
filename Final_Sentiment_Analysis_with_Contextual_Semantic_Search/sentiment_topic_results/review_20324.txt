{"text": "My husband loves these; they take a lot longer to rip out the knee (he is a licensed Contractor) than the ones without the double knees.I get these for him all the time and this time I was able to get them for way less ($10.00 less each) than if I went to a local store (who never have his size anyhow and have to order them in for him). And they had his size on Amazon and for a great price.  Which is good, because it takes him about 6 months to get through the knees. And he usually wears them 6 months past that because they are so expensive.Anyhow, recommended for Construction Workers who do not like to wear knee guards.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12343684", "1": "0.26261038", "2": "0.115344256", "3": "0.08568707", "4": "0.19110641", "5": "0.043820582", "6": "0.17799446"}}
