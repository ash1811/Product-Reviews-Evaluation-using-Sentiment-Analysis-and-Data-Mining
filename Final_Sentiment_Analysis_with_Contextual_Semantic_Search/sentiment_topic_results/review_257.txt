{"text": "I got this in silver because I like the color and wanted to try the two straps backpack-style.  Just thought I'd throw out that the silver color does NOT have the zippered compartment that some other colors seem to have, which is okay, because it's not in the description.  I also bought the 101 Snorkel bag which DOES have a zippered compartment, so that other one will hold the hotel and car keys, etc.  (we have three sets of snorkel gear to carry between the two bags). Both bags are the same size, but the Speedo has a finer mesh and is the only one with two straps.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.029268263", "1": "0.36779684", "2": "0.3116559", "3": "0.17000544", "4": "0.11565462"}}
