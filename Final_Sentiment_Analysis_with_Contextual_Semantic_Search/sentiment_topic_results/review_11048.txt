{"text": "Have worn Acorn slippers for years; they last and last!  Comfy, sturdy, warm and easy to wash.  We've noticed the fit has gotten a little smaller, now that they are made in China.  Two things we would like--better sizing, sized in narrow and wide, as well as, individual sizes, not multi-sized AND even though they are cushioned, more would be better, with a little arch support.  We like the tex moc and polar moc styles the best.  Don't ever want to be without them!  We love them!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.19965708", "3": "0.38751027", "4": "0.15552521", "5": "0.15853144", "6": "0.0934679"}}
