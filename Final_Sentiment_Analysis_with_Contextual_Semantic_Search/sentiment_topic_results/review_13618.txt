{"text": "These are pretty great boat shoes. I'm on my second pair of Makos so far. The traction is great (if you actually ever go out on a boat, that can be helpful... I, for one, have been wearing Sperry's for a decade and rarely set foot on a boat...hmmm). They have a classic look to them and not having to tie shoelaces is always a selling point. Just remember to get a size down since you probably won't be wearing socks with your Sperry's.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.123972856", "1": "0.4012447", "2": "0.17168228", "3": "0.14429852", "4": "0.053120546", "5": "0.10227477"}}
