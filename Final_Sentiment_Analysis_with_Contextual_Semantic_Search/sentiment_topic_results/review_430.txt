{"text": "WOW!  I am so impressed.  I needed something for polishing a very tarnished small silver locket, and thought that buying a jar of liquid/gel polish would be overkill.  These wipes turned out to be perfect.  My locket was clean and shiny in less than a minute.  I didn't have to deal with any mess or corrosive material.  The best thing was that I didn't need to remove the photos from the fiddly little locket.I read the reviews before buying this product, so I was aware that the I would receive a smaller product than advertised.  Mine was a small flat case with the 25 wipes of dimensions 2 7/8 in by 3 5/8 in (7.6 cm by 9.2 cm).  Incorrect advertising is of course disappointing, but the size is perfect for my locket so I'm still giving it 5 stars.EDIT:I have modified my review to 3 stars because I'm not seeing the anti-tarnish effects claimed in the descriptions.  My silver locket (with 925 stamp) lost its luster within about 4 days and became visibly tarnished after 2 weeks.  I would have expected the \"anti-tarnish shield\" to be a bit better than that.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.3394984", "1": "0.09514204", "2": "0.12296179", "3": "0.09238678", "5": "0.11285964", "6": "0.23487824"}}
