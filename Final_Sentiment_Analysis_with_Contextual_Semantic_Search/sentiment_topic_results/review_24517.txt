{"text": "Finding shoes for a husband with very wide, very flat feet is hard work! There isn't a big selection out there ....and even if you can find something wide enough, there are so many parts of a shoe that can pinch or rub or otherwise irritate, that there's no guarantee it will fit right. Having said all that, my husband was very happy with these Hush Puppies slip-ons. They are wide enough! They are lightweight! And they can even pass for dress shoes...well...compared to other shoes he wears..... He's happy and I'm absolutely delighted.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10606814", "1": "0.27558514", "2": "0.17292123", "3": "0.070714146", "4": "0.21535377", "5": "0.10714162", "6": "0.052215956"}}
