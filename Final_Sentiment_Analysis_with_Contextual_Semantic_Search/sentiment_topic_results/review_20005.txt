{"text": "Its as it says very large and a bit bulky but I bought mine for travel so it works out perfect each wide compartment can carry a lot even include my laptop for a weekend trip. Its a well made bag, very pretty love the floral pattern and the black. My only issue I have is the strap it can get twisted and the bulky padding for the shoulder is a bit big should of been smaller but otherwise pretty bag, sturdy and so far its serving its purpose so far so good :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.23037575", "2": "0.23750608", "3": "0.22127073", "4": "0.09081917", "5": "0.13987762", "6": "0.07703429"}}
