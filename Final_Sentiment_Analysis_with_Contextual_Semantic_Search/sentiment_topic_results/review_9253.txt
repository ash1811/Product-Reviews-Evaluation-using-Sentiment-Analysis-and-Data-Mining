{"text": "I'm married to a man with ice cube feet in the winter.  He's usually in a pair of ultra-thick heavy wool socks once colder weather comes.No need for the wooly Sasquatch socks anymore, though.  These sheepskin slippers are just the ticket for icy feet.  The slip-on style is easy to slide feet into and the soft shearling fleece interior offers incredible warmth.  The outer surface of the slippers is a thick suede which is so far very durable against scuffs.The cushioned memory foam insole is an added bonus for my husband.  A daily long distance runner, he often suffers from tired and sore feet...so the cushioning offers some extra pampering.  There's much to like about these slippers.  But the best thing about them is how comfortable they are.The soles of the slippers offer traction against slipping and are durable and sturdy enough for the occasional traipse outside with our dogs.As other reviewers suggested, I ordered them a half size larger...and they fit perfectly.I do have one small gripe about the pair I received.  I ordered them in the darker Root Beer color; and on the forefoot of one of the slippers, some of the adhesive used to adhere the sole was smeared over the surface of a small inch-square area of the suede.  I used a fingernail and was able to scrape most of it off.  Probably should have sent them back for a \"perfect\" pair; but that appeared to be the only issue with them.  And cold weather is already here...no time to wait.  Can't let those feet get any icier.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.25599593", "1": "0.1406528", "2": "0.09629052", "3": "0.1634646", "4": "0.11625929", "5": "0.103493504", "6": "0.12384337"}}
