{"text": "I do really like this shoe for walking and working out. It would be my first choice for actual running as there isn't a ton of &#34;bounce&#34;, but that's just my preference for my running shoes.THey are very comfortable and fit great! I have bunions so I like to have slightly wider sneakers. I wear a size 9 but was told I should get a 10 in running shoes. Since I saw a 9.5 Wide, I figured I'd try that, and I love the fit. I don't think I need a whole 10 with the size of my foot, but bec. of the bunions I normally do get a 10. So the 9.5 with a wider width is great!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.025404416", "1": "0.33504122", "2": "0.07650368", "3": "0.1600782", "4": "0.111644216", "5": "0.19215313", "6": "0.09917513"}}
