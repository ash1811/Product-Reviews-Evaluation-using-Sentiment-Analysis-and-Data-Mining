{"text": "I'm only 17 weeks but wanted to try this out because I am already having sciatica. I ordered the medium based on other reviews saying the sizing was extremely small. I'm 5'8\" pre pregnancy 145 lbs...now 155...the smallest setting is very uncomfortably tight and huge on the mid setting...it is pretty worthless to me for now (maybe when I'm a little bigger...) I ended up getting the Babies R Us support belt...it's got a lot more fabric but is extremely comfortable and fits properly.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.102267615", "1": "0.21711656", "2": "0.12722279", "3": "0.3708004", "4": "0.091260396", "6": "0.08846131"}}
