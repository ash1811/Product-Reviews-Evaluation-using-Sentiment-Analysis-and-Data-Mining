{"text": "My husband loves this watch.  Being a farmer a watch with a second hand is important for calibrating fertilizer during water runs.  This watch has an easy to see second hand and the light is nice during the evenings.  The band is elastic but sturdy and comfortable.  Love this watch!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.20544969", "1": "0.23746087", "2": "0.2883761", "4": "0.25278938"}}
