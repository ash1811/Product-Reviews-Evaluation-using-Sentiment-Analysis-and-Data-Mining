{"text": "The Amazon page says to buy a size below your normal size. My running shoe size is 12.  I have black Rothco ripple sole jungle boots in 11 and they fit perfect.I just paid $20 to send back these tan boots in size 11.  They may have resized(re-lasted) these because a size 11, for me, is a size 11.So, do they have a mixture of old over sized and new correctly sized boots.  Good luck.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0549894", "1": "0.1463694", "2": "0.14585379", "3": "0.24052861", "4": "0.23226738", "5": "0.07284756", "6": "0.1071439"}}
