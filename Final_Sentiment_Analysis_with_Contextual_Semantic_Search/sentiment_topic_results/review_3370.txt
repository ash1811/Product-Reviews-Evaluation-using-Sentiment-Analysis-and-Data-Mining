{"text": "I must like these shoes, this is my fourth pair, and they're all still in use. I discovered Merrell's hiking shoes maybe 10-12 years ago, and always found them to be well made, durable and comfortable. The jungle mocs continue the tradition, and add the convenience of being a slip-on. This makes them my go-to shoes for a run out to the mailbox, for any activity that involves walking, yard work (the oldest pair), etc. They are also good looking enough for business casual wear at the office, going well with khakis or jeans on casual Friday.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1430924", "1": "0.19654863", "2": "0.12679335", "3": "0.19744033", "4": "0.12532863", "5": "0.18616308", "6": "0.024633566"}}
