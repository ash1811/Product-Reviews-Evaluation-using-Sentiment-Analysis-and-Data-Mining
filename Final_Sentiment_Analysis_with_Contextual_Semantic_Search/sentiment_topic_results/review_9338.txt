{"text": "I was looking for a fun toy for the kids to play with in an interactive way.  This is perfect!  It has many toys inside, so you don't have to buy much else, and the chest is very durable.  Some other pirate chests I looked at were flimsy or crazy expensive.  This has been dropped and sat on, but still looks great and the latch works.  My kids are in love with this toy!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.056874536", "1": "0.47762293", "2": "0.030791994", "3": "0.0955807", "4": "0.13093194", "5": "0.12912023", "6": "0.07907772"}}
