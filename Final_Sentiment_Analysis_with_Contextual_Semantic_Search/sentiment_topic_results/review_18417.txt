{"text": "During the day, I rarely have problems with leg or foot cramps, but in the middle of the night, I wake up sometimes with horrendous cramps that make me jump straight out of bed in order to stretch my calves and make the pain subside.  This, of course is the end of my sleep for this night.  I've tried taking every nutrient known to mankind, and nothing helped.So, I decided to try these soft leg warmers.  I already knew I would like the fabric because I have socks and scarves made of it. It feels so luxurious.  The thing I wasn't sure of was whether I could actually sleep in them because my skin is so sensitive, and I thought after a while they might itch, but I've had them for about 3 weeks, and I've slept peacefully throughout (most) nights. My sleep has improved about 90%. They're long enough that when nights are cold, I can slip them right down to cover my feet as well, so I'm warm all the way from my knees to my toes.I think maybe they should come in sizes.  I considered getting some for my mom who also deals with night cramps, but I don't think they would fit her legs because they're quite a bit larger than mine. I'm 5'2\" and weight 129 lbs, and these fit perfectly.  In another review, someone said hers immediately got a hole in them. They come with a tag attached with a plastic strip run through the fabric.  Clip that strip carefully; if you jerk it out of the fabric, you're almost assured to get a hole in the area where it was pulled through. She may not have done this; I'm just sayin'.Anyway, I got a couple of pairs, one to wear and one to wash, and I think this is the beginning of a long and beautiful relationship.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.26774153", "2": "0.15452008", "3": "0.274197", "5": "0.18269484", "6": "0.11620475"}}
