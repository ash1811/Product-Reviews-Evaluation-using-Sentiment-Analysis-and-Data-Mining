{"text": "This bag is of superior construction. The material is about 600 denier (ie thick) and the zippers are big & well designed. The material is shiny & looks very smart.There are two negatives- the carry handles are a bit too long, meaning the bag is close to the ground then you walk- the webbing on the end! I didn't realise there was external black webbing (to hold a football or maybe shoes) at one end, I might cut it off.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.051299874", "1": "0.24399824", "2": "0.26865017", "3": "0.13657562", "4": "0.20696586", "5": "0.08922266"}}
