{"text": "This backpack is perfect for my high school-er who is dragging books binders & technology back and forth for 9months! There is however a few things that are dumb with this.. 1st the pocket in the back that is to hold the computer in, its really not going to do anything but get squished to the bottom of the bag by books because it is like a cheap purse separator. Next the zippers are a hot mess all over the place, hard to work some, a few you have to unbuckle the side buckles to open all the way, which are the ones that will be used most. The cell phone pocket is made for a phone from 10yrs ago, phones are more slimline now and this one is ready for the boxy flip phone which my parents still own but no one who would be using this bag! There is a weird clip on the outside front above the ripple type ribbon deal, not sure what it would be for, if you hang you key there it will be gone in 5 mins! My son likes it, and if it can bring everything he needs day in and out from point a to point b without breaking then I am happy! Maybe the company could do some product testing with real mothers who would point out what may look good on paper just isnt needed!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12886953", "1": "0.1330526", "2": "0.31390384", "3": "0.060998645", "4": "0.030296983", "5": "0.18138494", "6": "0.15149345"}}
