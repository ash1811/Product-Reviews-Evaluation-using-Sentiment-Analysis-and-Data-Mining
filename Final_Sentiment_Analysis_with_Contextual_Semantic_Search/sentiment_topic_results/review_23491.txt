{"text": "I have only had the watch for a week now but I have received a number of compliments on it. This Invicta looks almost exactly like a Rolex which costs thousands. Easy to set. Seems like it keeps time accurately. Took it to a jeweler and paid 10 bucks to have a couple of the links removed and it fits perfectly. Can't say I like the clasping system but other brands have used that same system as well so it not an Invicta thing. For the price, you can't beat this watch.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.18410441", "1": "0.22479883", "2": "0.2221214", "3": "0.102805786", "4": "0.11752382", "5": "0.104141794", "6": "0.04450394"}}
