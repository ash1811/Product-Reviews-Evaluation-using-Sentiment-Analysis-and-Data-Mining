{"text": "I have a pair of SmartWool hiking socks that are over ten years old and they are still one of the best pairs of socks in the drawer.  I'm going on a trip to Europe and Colorado and will be doing a LOT of walking so I bought five more pairs.  When you think of how well these socks are made and how long they can last the price is worth it.  You can't go wrong with these socks.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16716085", "1": "0.3574022", "2": "0.1040481", "5": "0.35976595"}}
