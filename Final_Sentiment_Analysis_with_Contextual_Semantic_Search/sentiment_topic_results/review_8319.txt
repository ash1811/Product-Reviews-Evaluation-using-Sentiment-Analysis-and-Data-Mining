{"text": "I bought this after many years struggling with bra. I hate bra with wire, after washed them a few time the wire started to come out and poke your skin. I removed the wire and my boobs look like going everywhere without support.I change my bra with sport bra...good support and comfortable, the problem was my nipple.People could see my nipple when I wore t-shirt. So, I used tissue to cover.Tired of this, I searched in Amazon \"nipple cover\". I found this and I love them !!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.24547063", "2": "0.12195361", "3": "0.1462716", "4": "0.17560399", "5": "0.09786204", "6": "0.20991337"}}
