{"text": "I have purchased Champion brand socks in bricks-and-mortar stores, and they have been rather thin or skimpy, and they are always too tight because of the all too common tendency to save money (for the manufacturer, not necessarily the consumer) by having one size supposedly fit all (or nearly so).  Most store-bought socks seem to be &#34;for sizes 6 - 12&#34;, which means way too tight like a tourniquet if you have a large foot size and probably too loose if you have a small foot, duh.  These (Champion from Amazon) have a series of sizes, and while each size covers a range of foot sizes, they are much more realistic, smaller ranges, so they fit better.  In addition, these are thicker, taller, and generally higher quality than the ones I've seen in the stores from Champion.  I wonder if Champion's Marketing folks realize that every pair they sell in stores makes consumers think of Champion as cheap and ill-fitting?  Hmmm.  But these are very good, and less expensive than the also good but overpriced socks from some other, specialty sock brands.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08976204", "1": "0.24961334", "2": "0.027176628", "3": "0.13216633", "4": "0.20821145", "5": "0.13132106", "6": "0.16174915"}}
