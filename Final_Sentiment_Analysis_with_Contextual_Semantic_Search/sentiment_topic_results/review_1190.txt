{"text": "The very first thing noticed was that this hat basically has no shape. The material is fairly light cotton. When you wear it, your head gives it some shape. It held up to its first wash without much change. I am guessing that is good.  It will work very well for its intended purpose, which is shade for doing the lawn. I removed the draw string before putting it in the wash, and I suggest you do the same. For the price, it is not that bad, but when placed on a table, the hat looks like a circular piece of cloth with a bit of a lump in the center. Aside from the light material, the hat looks to be well made, just a little heavier material would have given this hat a higher rating than its three star &#34;it's okay&#34; rating. The hat shipped in a plastic bag, inside a flat padded shipping envelope. I wasn't sure what had come before opening it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12584202", "1": "0.35854217", "2": "0.121541776", "3": "0.16719311", "4": "0.15834306", "6": "0.06592908"}}
