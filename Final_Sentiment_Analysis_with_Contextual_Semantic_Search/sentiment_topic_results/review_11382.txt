{"text": "These slipers as they are called are really a soft type of shoe, you can easily wear them out and look just great. And Im very fussy about looking good. They are a fantstic quality I bought the terry lined ones so I guess its better to wear them out than the fleece. They are great value, so comfortable and good looking going to buy more in other colors.Excellent with Jeans/Tee.. Very good product, one of the best items so far I have found in footwear on Amazon. GREAT!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04071484", "1": "0.39676523", "2": "0.08337076", "3": "0.040912326", "4": "0.2422779", "5": "0.14129902", "6": "0.05465994"}}
