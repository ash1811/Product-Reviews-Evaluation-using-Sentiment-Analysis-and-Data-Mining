{"text": "I wear a lot of dangle and hoop earrings. I bought this, opened it, threw the box away and started putting my earrings in it. only to find out that 75% of my earrings didnt go in this. I actually broke, bent, and damanged most of my earrings trying to get this holder to work. So now im stuck with a product that will sit in my closet and never use, because it only works for stud earrings.
