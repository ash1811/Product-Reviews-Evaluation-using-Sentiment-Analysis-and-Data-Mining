{"text": "I loved this belt when I traveled to Europe!  It was very comfortable and spacious, and I often would have to check that it was still around my waist since I could hardly feel it.  It gave me a great peace of mind knowing that my passport, rail pass, cash, and credit/debit cards were out of harms way from pickpockets.  I lent this to my brother when he traveled to Europe and he loved it as well.  I plan to use it whenever I travel again.  I wouldn't even think of bringing my wallet and putting it in my pocket in Europe...I've seen too many unfortunate things happen that way.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04055636", "1": "0.2148157", "2": "0.28143328", "3": "0.038185872", "4": "0.15283933", "5": "0.16883688", "6": "0.10333259"}}
