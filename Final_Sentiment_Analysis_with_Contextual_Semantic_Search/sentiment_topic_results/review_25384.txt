{"text": "I needed something that would carry my iPad, headphones and all necessities at my seat for travel.  This bag is great.  I can get everything into it and then just pack a small purse in my carry on to use when I arrive.  It's durable - has just the right amount of pockets and compartments.  The plus is that it matches my luggage.  I love it!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.055219736", "1": "0.34755534", "2": "0.18176822", "3": "0.18189211", "4": "0.123469085", "6": "0.105324075"}}
