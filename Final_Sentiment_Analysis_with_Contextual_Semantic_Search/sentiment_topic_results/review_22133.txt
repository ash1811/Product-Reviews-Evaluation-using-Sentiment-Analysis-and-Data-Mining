{"text": "These silk glove liners are a god-send to those who desire extra warmth in the winter months, or for people whose fingers and hands tend to get cold easily.  The liners are very thin, being silk, and will easily fit under your usual gloves (provided your existing gloves are not too tight).There is much to like about thermasilk liners:1.  They wick sweat and moisture from the hands to outer layers keeping hands dry.2.  They provide an extra layer of warmth beneath your regular gloves.3.  They are a decent pair of gloves to wear alone if the temperature is above 45 - 50 degrees.4.  They work great for skiing, sledding, skating, and other outdoor activities where extra warmth is needed without bulk.A few downsides:1.  Added cost (but offset in my opinion due to the increase in warmth.2.  Silk products in general tend to snag fairly easily, so they do not last a long time - at least this has been my experience.3.  Somewhat \"slippery\" due to silk surface. Definitely not \"driving gloves\".There are similar glove liners made out of polypropylene, which are perhaps just as good as silk, (and perhaps longer-lasting) but there is something elegant about silk!
