{"text": "Most torsolettes do not hold me up properly, this one did wonderfully.  I am a 34F and it gave me great lift and shape.  Nice bonus of smoothing out your waist as well.  It is a bit tight fitting and digs in a little at the top of the back however because it holds me so well I don't mind.  I will just need to tone up me back more.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.097871035", "1": "0.2750366", "2": "0.17090422", "3": "0.26508898", "4": "0.0836047", "6": "0.102871746"}}
