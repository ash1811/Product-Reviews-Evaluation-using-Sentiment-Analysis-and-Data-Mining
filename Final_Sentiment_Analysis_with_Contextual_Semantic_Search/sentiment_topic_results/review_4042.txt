{"text": "I wanted slippers with a bit of a heel and cushioning so I could work standing up, which I understand is healthier. These slippers give me that. They make it easier for me to stand and move around for many hours while I work.However, it is true that you end up standing on the part that's supposed to fit behind your heel, flattening it; and these slippers started to fray almost from the start. I wish the back and sides were higher up, and the material was less prone to fraying, but I still like these slippers very much for my purposes and would buy them again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11475623", "1": "0.17743768", "2": "0.10138592", "3": "0.10937419", "4": "0.08453319", "5": "0.10273009", "6": "0.30978274"}}
