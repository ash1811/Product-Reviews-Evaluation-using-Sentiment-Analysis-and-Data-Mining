{"text": "I'm 7 months pregnant and did not like the way the nursing bras with clips / drop-down cups felt - these are definitely more comfortable for me.  On the downside, this bra is basically a t-shirt material (note: you can see your nipples through the material) and not very supportive.  The trim is similar to Hanes / cheaper underwear elastic so it gets stuck / a bit uncomfortable at times.  If you want a thicker and more supportive bra, the Lamaze Cotton Spandex Sleep Bra for Nursing and Maternity is a better choice as its material is more heavy duty (although beware that the front tends to ride up / be a little short).  This wasn't a bad purchase, but it's definitely not my top choice of the three bras I purchased.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11701457", "1": "0.29170936", "2": "0.08687929", "3": "0.23149325", "4": "0.096443534", "6": "0.17415136"}}
