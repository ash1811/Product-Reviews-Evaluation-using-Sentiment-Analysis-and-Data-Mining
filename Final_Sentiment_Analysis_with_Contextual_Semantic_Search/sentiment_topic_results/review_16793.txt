{"text": "My son-in-law was very pleased to receive this watch as a gift.  However none of the adults present could rotate the outer rim as the directions instructed to get it to pop up and then proceed with the setting process.  The band is quite large and has to have at least 4 links removed so hopefully a jeweler can assist with the initial set up of the watch.  I was a little disappointed that it was so complicated to set but since the band was so large it couldn't be worn immediately.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04832978", "1": "0.1681931", "2": "0.18298408", "3": "0.14688797", "4": "0.15948011", "5": "0.10702512", "6": "0.18709983"}}
