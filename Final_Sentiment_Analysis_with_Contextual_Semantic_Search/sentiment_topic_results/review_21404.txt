{"text": "These are a staple in my husband's closet. Though I see several folks reporting inconsistent quality and sizing, the last 2 pair we purchased here (Oct 2012) are just as durable and accurately sized as the first pair we purchased years ago. Out of 8 pair he's owned, only one turned out to be a tad wonky. The reality is that any mass produced, foreign made garment in this price range risks some consistency issues, but there are no other jeans that fit his build better than the Classic Fit IZOD.He has both the darker vintage and the lighter blue and they're more than adequately soft without being too thin. They're machine washed in warm water on the most vigorous cycle and dried on the hottest setting but they hold up pretty nicely and haven't significantly shrunk. On a few pairs, he's experienced a belt loop breaking, but for a man who is rough on his clothes, we're impressed.The look of these is pretty, well, \"dad jeans\" as we call them. They won't win style points as the cut isn't on trend and they've not been given any additional vidual treatments like pre-fading. We overlook that as hubby has a hard-to-fit body so the generous stride makes these ideal for the long-waisted.Due to the low price, comfort, and, in our experience, consistent fit, we hope they keep churning these out.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.0674812", "1": "0.2329424", "2": "0.10999733", "3": "0.04454831", "4": "0.25348136", "5": "0.13125221", "6": "0.16029716"}}
