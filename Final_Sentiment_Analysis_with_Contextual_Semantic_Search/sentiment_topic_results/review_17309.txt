{"text": "This watch has a great look and it is obviously a quality product.  The band fits well and the overall watch has a very classy, yes casual, feel.  One concern that I have noted, since it is an automatic watch, if not worn everyday, it does stop.  I was hoping I would be able to take it off for a day or two and not have to worry about resetting the time.  Other than this minor issue, which is easily remedied by either wearing it more often or resetting the time, I have no regrets about this purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.30869627", "2": "0.1264913", "3": "0.052580882", "4": "0.14487027", "5": "0.2617683", "6": "0.10240274"}}
