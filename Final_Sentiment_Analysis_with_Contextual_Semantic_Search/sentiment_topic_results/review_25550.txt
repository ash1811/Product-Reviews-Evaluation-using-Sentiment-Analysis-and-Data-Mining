{"text": "CW-X tights fit well and are constructed well.  These are one step down from the Stabilyx Tights.  Sent them back after trying only because the Stabilyx pair has compression around the waist and back for better support.  I'm 5-4 and 128 pounds.  Length was perfect.  Good buy if you don't need extra compression help on your lower back.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.048829008", "1": "0.31470284", "3": "0.1028696", "4": "0.09782131", "5": "0.2334641", "6": "0.19831891"}}
