{"text": "I am a HUGE fan of Sanuk products.  My collection seems to keep growing and growing; however, after purchasing these shoes, I may never want another pair of shoes again (this coming from a shoe addict).  They are HEAVEN!  They fit perfectly, no rubbing, no breaking in.  The soles of the shoe are PHENOMENAL!  So soft and cushioned.  Great traction, the foot doesn't slide, the toe part does not dig into any part of the foot and they are aesthetically pleasing! I live in Arizona, where flip flops can be worn basically ALL year long, so they are a great show, very durable, and I imagine will last a very long time.  I was so excited about these, I bought a pair for my friend.  They are the gift that keeps on giving!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08337923", "1": "0.26723588", "2": "0.26636115", "3": "0.1324487", "5": "0.1617319", "6": "0.0865643"}}
