{"text": "My wife LOVED it!  This pendant was great for my wife and I was even thinking about getting one for my daughter for her birthday.  But the clasp broke within 3 weeks and is not usable.  I will be getting a little better chain with clasp that will hold a lot better than it did.  But don't let this 'clasp' issue prevent you from buying one.  The locket itself is really nice.  Good product for the price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17364825", "1": "0.24330127", "2": "0.1834754", "3": "0.078372076", "4": "0.14663975", "5": "0.17098108"}}
