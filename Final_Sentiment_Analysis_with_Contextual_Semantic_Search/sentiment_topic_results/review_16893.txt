{"text": "I love how these look on my ear. However I apparently have smaller than average ears or maybe oddly shaped ears, as I've had trouble finding a spot where the cuffs will stay in place without having to adjust them to grip so tightly they make my ears sore. In anyone has any tips on how to wear these comfortably, please let me know, because I really do like them!I've bought from Silver Insanity before and as always they are an A+ seller with good prices, quick shipping, and quality merchandise. I don't blame them for my trouble with the earrings - it's just my weird ears! I will buy from them again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1422842", "1": "0.15892342", "2": "0.090173535", "3": "0.14870927", "4": "0.15833639", "5": "0.15635666", "6": "0.14521654"}}
