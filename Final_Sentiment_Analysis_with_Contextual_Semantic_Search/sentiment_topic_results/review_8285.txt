{"text": "I thought that these would be the same as the 569's I had bought a couple months ago at a local retail store. They were my first Levi's that I've ever bought. I thought that the ones I had purchased recently were the ones made with the thinner material and different cuts mentioned in the reviews on here; however, this is not the case. These 569's are of really poor quality, and not worth the money at all. I definitely will not be buying 569's ever again. Wrangler's are much better than this...if only they fit the way the old 569's used to...", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.29074442", "2": "0.17156422", "3": "0.15526234", "4": "0.09812149", "5": "0.049862504", "6": "0.23173933"}}
