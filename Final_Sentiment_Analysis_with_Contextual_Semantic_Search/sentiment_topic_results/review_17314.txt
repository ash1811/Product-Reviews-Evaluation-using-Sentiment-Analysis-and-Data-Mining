{"text": "Not much to say that a zillion other earlier reviewers haven't already fully covered. This watch is so popular for some great reasons.So count me in as one more plus vote. This is a great little automatic watch. I can't believe Seiko can make and sell it at this price.The exact same model is offered in blue, beige, olive drab and black. Watch bands are easily interchangeable.The styling is loosely based on the WW2 US Army's &#34;A-1&#34; watch issued to soldiers and pilots alike.Seiko quality at an amazing price. This would be a good 'first real watch' choice for a young person.Hope this is helpful. Enjoy!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10909034", "1": "0.23039669", "2": "0.120665275", "3": "0.12101441", "4": "0.1684304", "5": "0.11935057", "6": "0.13105235"}}
