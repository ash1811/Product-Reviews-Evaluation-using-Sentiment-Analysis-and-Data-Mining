{"text": "I am thrilled with the quality of these earrings and so glad that with 14k gold, they are still quite affordable.The stones are excellently matched in color and just the perfect shade of brown that goes with anything.  They stand out on the lobe and I was worried they'd be really small, but they are not.  In spite of the decent size of the stones, these are really lightweight and you can't tell you're wearing them, at all.I think these would make an excellent gift and I'm considering buying an additional pair, just for that purpose!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1606057", "1": "0.29278895", "2": "0.13581066", "3": "0.24196415", "4": "0.10015726", "5": "0.037027646", "6": "0.031645615"}}
