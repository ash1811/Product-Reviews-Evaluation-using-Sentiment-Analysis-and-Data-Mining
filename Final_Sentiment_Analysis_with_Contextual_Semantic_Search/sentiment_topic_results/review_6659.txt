{"text": "I don't usually title things in all caps, but these deserve it! I had no idea that socks make such a huge difference in how my feet feel. I pretty much stopped walking for exercise a few years ago because my feet are so messed up from standing on concrete up to 16 hours a day at work. Finally frustrated from lack of exercise and weight gain, I decided to attempt to walk again. Decided to buy new walking shoes and socks, and the Thorlos got great ratings all around. The Thin Cushion Mini Crew was the first pair I bought, and I put them on... and... walked 2 miles right off the bat with no problem! I was amazed! No pain, no burning, no itching, no swelling! The padding and support in these is just wonderful. I was so impressed that not only did I buy more, I also bought Thorlo running, fitness, and heavy and med. hiking socks, and they are ALL fantastic. Now I wear them everyday and my feet feel so much better! They are so worth the price!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17239262", "1": "0.2067274", "2": "0.07868759", "3": "0.24206609", "5": "0.18504234", "6": "0.11294127"}}
