{"text": "Bought for my son for his work boots and gloves.  It dried his boots overnight.  There is no fan, so no noise, and he just put it in his bedroom using the floor mounts.  We had another boot drier with a fan that we used in the garage but this design is much better.  You would think this would do nothing because you can touch the prongs when it is on and it barely feels warm.  When I put my hand up inside when the boot was mounted on one of them though it was much warmer, but still not overly hot.  Pretty neat how it works.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15601788", "1": "0.22207083", "2": "0.12339464", "3": "0.060286406", "4": "0.23906478", "5": "0.041150194", "6": "0.15801524"}}
