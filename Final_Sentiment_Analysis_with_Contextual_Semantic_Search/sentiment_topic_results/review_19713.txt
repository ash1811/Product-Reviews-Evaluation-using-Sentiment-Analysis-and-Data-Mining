{"text": "I have had several Timex's over the years and they've all held up.  Timex watches usually outlast the bands they come with!  We bought this for our daughter who was learning to tell time in First grade.  All in all it's a good watch and she likes the look of it.  The only complaint we have is that the numbers for the seconds are really small, making it hard to read them. In a perfect world, those numbers would be a bit larger.  All in all, a great watch for a young one learning to tell time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19297212", "1": "0.25777438", "2": "0.22904445", "3": "0.057651836", "4": "0.18092518", "5": "0.038764667", "6": "0.042867333"}}
