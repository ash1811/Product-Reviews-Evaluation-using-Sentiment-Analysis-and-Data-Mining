{"text": "This sandal for me is always  wonderful and I have it in this exact style in two other colours. Love this red and will enjoy wearing it. This sandal gives great support, no wear in time (even though this is a thong). As this has a strap across the top of the foot it is quite far along the foot and feels comfortable and secure. As for the Birko Flor I prefer it to the leather as sometimes that is a bit hard, Birko Flor is instantly comfortable. Basically the perfect summer shoe", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10582896", "1": "0.30236116", "2": "0.16993152", "3": "0.26964563", "5": "0.14625157"}}
