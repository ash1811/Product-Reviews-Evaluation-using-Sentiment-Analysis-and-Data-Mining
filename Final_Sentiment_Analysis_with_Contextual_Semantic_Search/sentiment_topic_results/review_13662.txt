{"text": "When I received they had a bit of a scuffed finish in a couple of places but I was able to rub most of it out. I wore them without socks and they were very comfortable. This says a lot coming from a primarily running shoe wearer. I accidentally spilled a drop of soup on them the first time I wore them and they immediately stained but I was able to get most of it out just cleaning with water. I have since ordered saddle soap to clean them with but haven't tried it yet. I have the linen oat color. I love them now but I think I will love them even more in the spring and summer. I haven't worn loafers since high school but I'm enjoying these so far!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08163512", "1": "0.22380881", "2": "0.17115624", "3": "0.14240184", "5": "0.30017233", "6": "0.07795813"}}
