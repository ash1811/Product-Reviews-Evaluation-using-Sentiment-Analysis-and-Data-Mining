{"text": "After reading other reviews saying these sandals run a little big, I ordered them in the narrow instead of the regular.  They fit perfectly.  The leather is thick and smooth, and the color is a beautiful, saturated aqua blue.  The color looks more like denim in the picture, but it's actually a bit more turquoise, which is what I really like, so i was very happy when I got them.  After wearing them for about a half hour, they were already starting to break in.  I've been wearing Birkenstocks for many years, and these are exactly what I expected for fit and comfort.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.5224233", "2": "0.026963584", "3": "0.19044831", "4": "0.08450887", "5": "0.16996635"}}
