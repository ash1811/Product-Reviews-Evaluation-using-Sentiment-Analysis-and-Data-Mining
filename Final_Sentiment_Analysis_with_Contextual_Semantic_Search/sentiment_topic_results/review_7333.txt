{"text": "I was hoping for a softer less structured, casual type of cargo pants with enough pockets that I could wear in the gym in the winter while working out. That way I could keep gloves, phone, keys, wallet on my person without having to use the gym locker room. I am a size that it seems nobody likes to make cargo pants for. (40W x 34L) and these are about all I could find.This fabric seems like it is indestructible and even after a dozen washings my wife still hates me wearing them around her as the fabric is still really stiff and they make this really loud &#34;swooshing&#34; sound when you walk. The quality is excellent... TOO excellent... They will probably last forever... especially with me because I will probably rarely wear them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.059304856", "1": "0.3087383", "2": "0.18354686", "3": "0.12627885", "5": "0.20680523", "6": "0.11321089"}}
