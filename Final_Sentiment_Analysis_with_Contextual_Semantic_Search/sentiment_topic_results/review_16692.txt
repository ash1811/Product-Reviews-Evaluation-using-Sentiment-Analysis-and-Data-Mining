{"text": "I got a pair of Neport sandals this spring and have been using them for 2-3 months now. I couldn't make up my mind if I should buy these or the \"Newport H2\" model. The difference seems to be that the H2 is using some \"water friendlier\" material than leather for the outer layer and the H2 have 100% rubber sole while the Newport have some leather upper layer on the sole that makes it more comfortable.I chose the Newport because I thought I was going to use them occasionally for 'street use' but if I could make the choice again I would probably select the H2 because apparently I see to use them only for hiking. The leather layer does not even come in contact with your feel anyway so I'm not really sure what's the point.These sandals are great! Here's what I like about them:\\* super comfortable. You can wear them all day and never feel the need to take them off.* Hold your feet very well. I haven't tried super difficult trails but I have tried dry trails, creeks, boulders, you name it. They just won't quit.* Sole has very good grip. They do not slip and slide even when wet.* toe protection is great* nice reflective stripes on front and back* it takes a second to wear them or take them offThey are not perfect though:* they take a longer to dry when they get soaking wet then I would have expected* they are a bit on the heavy side. I was surprised when I first lifted them out of the box. But you get used to this* the price you pay for the good hold and grip is I guess some less air. When it's really hot outside, your feet will get a bit warm. These are no flip flops...Note that I had to pick up size 9. I normally wear 8 or 8.5 max.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13327196", "1": "0.32853988", "2": "0.21946228", "3": "0.15784529", "4": "0.0627896", "5": "0.066306464", "6": "0.03178455"}}
