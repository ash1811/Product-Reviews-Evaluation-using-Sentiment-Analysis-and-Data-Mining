{"text": "If buying this strictly for an inexpensive costume option, then this dress is worth it.  The sizing runs a bit small (as other reviewers mentioned) so order up a size (or two) if you want to be comfortable.  Also, please note the fringe is a bit fragile so you can expect to lose a string or two in the course of the evening.  Otherwise it was just right for a flapper costume on a budget.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.21833298", "1": "0.15333901", "2": "0.14752422", "3": "0.14708802", "4": "0.082863346", "5": "0.24716152"}}
