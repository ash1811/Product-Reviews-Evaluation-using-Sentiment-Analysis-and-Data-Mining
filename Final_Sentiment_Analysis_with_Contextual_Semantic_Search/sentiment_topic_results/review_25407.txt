{"text": "I now use this pack as my daily pack for going to work and for business trips.  It is relatively compact, but fits my MacBook Air (13\") and iPad perfectly well.  There is a place for papers, business cards, pens, etc.  The mesh area up front snaps securely closed and is perfect for snacks, my camera, or plus my kindle.  I really like the way the pack rides.  Very high and tight, but adjustable.  Weight feels evenly distributed.  The pack never feels like it's sagging.  I have a Siwissgear pack as well, but much prefer this Northface pack.  Great buy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19189285", "1": "0.39979938", "2": "0.15451838", "4": "0.026943112", "5": "0.050036725", "6": "0.17446232"}}
