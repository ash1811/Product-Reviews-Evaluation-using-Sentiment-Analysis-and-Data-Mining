{"text": "These are so very cute, but they were huge. I think my daughter's normal size 6 in UGG boots did not translate with slippers. Other than the sizing though, these are terrific shoes, comfortable and great with jeans. I had to return them because of the sizing and she said not to reorder in the smaller size as she'd rather have tall boots. I have nothing negative to say about this product and shipping was fast, well packaged and on time.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1159469", "1": "0.13617131", "2": "0.0846795", "3": "0.19381115", "4": "0.16688263", "5": "0.15294309", "6": "0.14956544"}}
