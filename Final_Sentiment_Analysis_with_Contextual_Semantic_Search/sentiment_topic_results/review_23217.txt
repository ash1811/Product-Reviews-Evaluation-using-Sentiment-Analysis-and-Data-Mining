{"text": "I usually wear a 36I, but ordered this in a 36H. It was still too big. I am giving it 4 stars because it is a very nice bra, and those are hard to find in my size! I appreciate the padded shoulder straps for sure! And it was comfortable and a nice material. I will probably order another one, but in a 36F, and see if that fits better.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16619208", "1": "0.46465477", "2": "0.11136918", "3": "0.08225151", "4": "0.103005536", "6": "0.06805233"}}
