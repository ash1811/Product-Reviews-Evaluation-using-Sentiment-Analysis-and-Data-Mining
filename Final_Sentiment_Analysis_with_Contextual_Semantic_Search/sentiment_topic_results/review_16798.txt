{"text": "When it has came down to Invicta, they definitely have been the quality leader in making great watches over the years, not just in demand, but class and innovation. They have made some really great automatic watches for the past several years, but the demand of their great timepieces has definitely exploded over the past years. But for anyone that wants a over-sized timepiece without worry about the price, this is definitely one I recommend. This Pro Diver Grand Diver Automatic is a great timepiece that is simple and easy to take care of. What I honestly love abut this piece isn't just the style, but the blue face and excellent illumination of the watch. What I do though wish was that this piece would be a bit easier to open and close with the safety lock. It can be uncomfortable, and the unidirectional bezel can stick a bit. But nevertheless, thi is a good watch to get for anyone that wants a bulky automatic, without the waste of price.Price: BSetup & Comfort: B-Overall: B 1/2-", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.16050224", "2": "0.193269", "3": "0.16377293", "4": "0.16184817", "5": "0.18698518", "6": "0.13131028"}}
