{"text": "I did a lot of research on watches before narrowing my choices down.  This Tissot prc200 was high on my list, and after researching retail pricing vs. internet, looking at the discussions of the possible fakes for sale on eBay and elsewhere, and based on my many positive experiences with Amazon, I decided to purchase the watch here.  I am so glad I did! My very first watch, purchased for me in 1968 in Switzerland by my parents, was a Tissot, so the brand has nostalgic connotations for me. The prc200 is a very beautiful and very well made watch at this price. Though \"beauty is in the eye of the beholder\", I feel that most would find this an attractive sports watch. Though, as others have commented, the deployment clasp takes some getting used to and breaking in, it is there for a reason and works great (though I can't promise it would fit all wrists). The band IS brown (as advertised), not black. It IS real leather (with a croc pattern). I have examined the watch quite carefully, and though I am not a horologist, it certainly appears to be an authentic Tissot.  Some reviewers have complained that no warranty card came with the watch; that is true; however, the watch is warrantied through Amazon (as is much they sell); if you look for it on the site you can see the 2-year watch warranty (same as Tissot's).  I suspect that one reason Amazon can sell this watch for $200 below retail is that they assume the risk of the warranty and any subsequent repair. Given Tissot's reputation for quality, I expect few will need to use the warranty in the 2 year time. I set the watch to the \"USN Atomic Clock\" and it has kept perfect time. What would I change? The packaging is OVERKILL, as far as I am concerned (and I bet it adds $$$ to the price).", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.21229835", "1": "0.1873899", "2": "0.104822405", "3": "0.12875873", "4": "0.22285995", "5": "0.08449648", "6": "0.05937421"}}
