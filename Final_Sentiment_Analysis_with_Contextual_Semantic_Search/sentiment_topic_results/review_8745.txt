{"text": "After showing my son many of the different G-Shock models, he chose this and the 5600 model.  He as 12 yrs old when we bought it, and he had thin wrists so we were looking for G-Shocks that were not overly large - like many of them are.Both this and the 5600 turned out to be winners - we now own both.  This one fits smaller wrists well, and the watch face is on the smaller end of the spectrum of the G line.  It has also grown on me, I love the large numbers for the time, the simplicity of the uncluttered face.  If you look at other G-Shocks, this one stands alone in style and is unlike the others... my son loves it, and after six months works like a charm.  We'll see if the battery truly is 10 years... I am skeptical but have been proven wrong before!He wears this and the 5600 to school every day, and alternates them evenly.  Both watches still look brand new.  G-Shocks are tough - they can take a fair amount of abuse (not misuse) and are a great choice for a kid.  My other son also has two G-Shocks - he is much tougher on his gear, and they too are holding up well.A note on the price I paid - this normally fluctuates in price here on Amazon like many items do.  We watched it go from $65ish to $75ish - we just left it in the Cart.  Then one day it dropped into the $30's and we bought it... we were skeptical it would be new / acceptable, but everything was OK and the watch has worked like a champ.  Like many things on Amazon, patience will reward!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04089069", "1": "0.15192331", "2": "0.17102791", "3": "0.07907113", "4": "0.22409081", "5": "0.17519939", "6": "0.15779673"}}
