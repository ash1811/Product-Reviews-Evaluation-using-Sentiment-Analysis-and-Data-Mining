{"text": "This is my third pair of Merrell shoes. and they just keep getting better.  A long lasting, high quality ventilated shoe for walking and light path hiking, requires no break-in. They afford good traction in loose dirt and rock with a bit of support.  It you hike off path, I would suggest the ankle boot by Merrell.  I have a pair and they are identical to these, but offer greater foot support. These are much cooler for the Summer though. A great shoe.Highly recommended.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11804692", "1": "0.13924912", "2": "0.2141803", "3": "0.28639728", "4": "0.12684937", "5": "0.08256348", "6": "0.0327135"}}
