{"text": "These are SO cute and I absolutely adore the stirrup style, which I find is hard to come by on legwarmers of this length.I wanted these because I love leg warmers that pull up to the top of the thigh. However, the stitching at the top made them so unbelievably tight that I was only able to get them to my lower thigh, about 2-3 inches above my knee) and I couldn't even attempt to pull them up as high as the picture. They just cut into my legs so hard. My thighs are a little thicker but they're not like tree stumps or anything! I've never had thigh high socks or legwarmers nearly as tight on me. These were also a little bit itchy, but nothing unbearable by any means IMO.I wanted so badly to love these but I'm just very, very disappointed with them :'C.There are other less expensive legwarmers that can fit on almost anyone's thighs that I've purchased on Amazon. I guess I'll just have to stick to those and hope I find stirrups on a pair that fits one day!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.0796752", "1": "0.23681729", "2": "0.25052965", "3": "0.20762207", "4": "0.034279197", "6": "0.18851088"}}
