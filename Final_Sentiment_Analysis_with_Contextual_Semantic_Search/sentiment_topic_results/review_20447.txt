{"text": "Purchased this sleek looking watch for my wife.  She is hard on watches and I didnt want a $1500 Omega that would be scratched and destroyed a year later.  This watch exudes classic femininity and looks stylish in work, play or sporting environments.  Very reasonable cost with the only downside that it is water resistant but not water proof.  It can probably withstand a shower but obviously not diving in the ocean.  My wife received it and enjoys it, so happy all around.  Would buy another one a few years down the road, when the current one gives out.  Nice buy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16160002", "1": "0.33449537", "2": "0.22880693", "3": "0.097535856", "4": "0.07390293", "6": "0.10118902"}}
