{"text": "Once I got over the ugliness of these sandals (I had a pair of Keen Bike shoes so I knew how good they were) and let myself wear them, I was very happy I did.I have been entrusting my back and knees to MBT's for the past 4 years or so (MBT Women's Kisumu Sandal, I realized that over time these were causing more pain to the sacral pain and sacral dysfunction I have.  I have had several pair of MBT shoes and at $200+ a pair, it has been difficult to give up on them and realize that they cause more pain for me these days in my lower back.  I needed a change of pace.I have to say that some of the arch and insole features that other people mention (like the ridge that hits behind the toes) have been no problem for me and have actually helped.  In order to avoid the potential \"smell\" that some people have complained of, I bought2 Toms Stink-Free Deodorizer Spray - 8 oz.to use beforehand to try to avoid any bacterial build-up that might contribute to any unwanted odors.After researching and researching some more, I discovered that people with back or foot problems like me (Morton's Neuroma) and lumbar/sacral and knee problems just need solid shoes with a good arch and a wide enough toebox.  Odd as they look at first, I found myself quickly amenable to them when I realized that they were actually supporting my knees and back and I could climb multiple steps of stairs and make my way around without a lot of pain ... that was pretty fantastic to me.  Just one thing about me, I have MS, so the walking I do is usually a little stiffer and more prone to pain.  If I can discover and adjunct shoe like Keen to make it a bit easier, I am a happy camper.5 Stars for Keen.Also, since I've read they can get a little ripe and smelly, I decided to pick up a bottle of Tom's2 Toms Stink-Free Deodorizer Spray - 8 oz..I worn them for about a week, comfy right out the box.
