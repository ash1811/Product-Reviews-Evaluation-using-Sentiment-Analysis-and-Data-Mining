{"text": "I bought my first foldable earring screen for my daughter. I have just received two more of the Acrylic Earring screens. I love them. I put my stud earrings on the very top and bottom rows. I hang my earrings with French hook ending  in the small grooves not the holes. All my earrings fit perfectly on the screen and I can see which one I want at a glance. I tried to organize my earrings by color and it helps me find the perfect earring. I would recommend this erring organizer to anyone.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13450904", "1": "0.2936263", "2": "0.13617525", "3": "0.070917405", "5": "0.22372402", "6": "0.13810828"}}
