{"text": "Wanted a small backpack to carry as an alternative to a purse on an up coming cruise.  The straps are not padded, but the skinny straps make it more compact and not bulky.  This was exactly what I wanted.For a size reference I posted the Half Pint in black next to my kindergartner's gray Spring Break backpack.JanSport Classics Series Spring Break Backpack (Forge Grey)I was not able to post the pics on this product page for some reason so I posted them on a Spring Break product page.I noticed on the Jansport website that the dimensions are listed as 12.3\" x 10\" x 6.5\".  The first two measurements are about what I get with a tape measure (with the 10\" being at the bottom not the skinnier top), but the depth of 6.5\" is not correct.  I get about 3.5\" to 4\" for only the main compartment, depending on how you measure and how much is in it to make it puffier or not, and I get about 5\" if you include the main and the front pocket together.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11032559", "1": "0.043821536", "2": "0.19351031", "3": "0.18629348", "4": "0.11841018", "5": "0.23807865", "6": "0.10956023"}}
