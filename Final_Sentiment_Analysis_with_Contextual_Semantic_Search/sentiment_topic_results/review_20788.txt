{"text": "This is expensive for a hoodie.  And you will not regret one penny of the cost.  I wear this every single day under all kinds of conditions including hunting trips.  It is lined so it is incredibly warm. The material is of gorgeous quality.  The stitching is solid and tough.  The fit is perfect.  The zippers are brass or something, and big, so they won't ever give out on you.  Many washes later it has neither stretched nor shrunk and still fits like the day I got it, except now ten times as comfortable without looking aged.All the best outerwear and hunting gear I own or use is Carhartt.  You could spend $20 on a black hoodie and it will last you less than a year and look awful after two washes.  Or you could spend $60 on this one and have it last a decade, I will bet.  Which is the better deal? Think carefully!  Thanks for existing, Carhartt.  When so many other clothing manufactures keep making things shoddier and shoddier (hello Levi's what is wrong with you?), the Carhartt quality just never changes.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.4367688", "2": "0.20873648", "3": "0.056043256", "4": "0.2074585", "5": "0.086514615"}}
