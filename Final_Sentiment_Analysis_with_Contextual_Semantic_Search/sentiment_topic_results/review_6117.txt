{"text": "Other reviews have already mentioned the facts and I must agree, although these are soft, yes, nice and soft, they are not the softest and they do not last!..  Big problem and waste of money on these and they do not hold up after even just a couple washes; the neck stretches out immediately after just a wash or two and the sleeves are 3/4 length, which is not mentioned in the product description anywhere!  and the cut on the hip is too high and they do end up riding up on our little one!We got a set of  these and although they  seem to run true to size,  I would definitely size up, but then again I would never recommend anyone buy these unless you are looking for a 3/4 sleeve onesie with a higher cut hip area and a neck area stretched out after a couple washes..Save your money and just get the gerber brand, although the gerber ones are thinner, at least they have long sleeves and dont ride up the leg and the neck doesnt stretch out..Bottom line, a total waste of money and we really wish we would of never bought them!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.21117786", "2": "0.06401335", "3": "0.39722407", "5": "0.25229904", "6": "0.06997342"}}
