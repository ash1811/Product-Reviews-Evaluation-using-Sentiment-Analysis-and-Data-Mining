{"text": "6 years ago I was having pain in my feet and knees, so I went to the foot Doctor. Turns out I had fallen arches that was causing the problem. They said I could either do these insoles and replace every 6 months or so, or spend hundreds on a special made pair, yet still need to replace. After taping, doing stretches and using these insoles as instructed, my arches went back into shape, I went from a size 12 men's shoe to a correct size 10.5 shoe.I buy multiple pairs of these at a time, one for work, one for everyday shoe and a spare pair. I then replace as I need and rotate them around. Pains gone, arches are still good and they are a great price. I'd highly recommend.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15641436", "1": "0.074979566", "2": "0.2776311", "3": "0.25855774", "4": "0.08464228", "5": "0.050808392", "6": "0.09696651"}}
