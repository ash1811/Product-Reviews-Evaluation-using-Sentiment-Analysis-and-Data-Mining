{"text": "These shoes are soooo comfortable. The sock is padded like sneakers, good support and cushioning, etc. But come on, the uppers are a mix of synthetic and the lowest possible grade of leather, which is basically just synthetic with a layer of ground up leather dust glued together underneath. They look it too. Maybe you could get away with it in black, but the brown, which was more reddish, just looked to cheap to be seen in. Dear Stags used to be cheap, but acceptable, the kind of shoes you would wear if you had to look decent but be on your feet. But these are just beyond the pale, and considering they very close in price to much better shoes while being closer in quality to Payless, I'm not sure why anyone would buy these.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14551519", "1": "0.2013955", "2": "0.25069723", "3": "0.019548215", "4": "0.16285999", "5": "0.16671172", "6": "0.05327215"}}
