{"text": "Ordered this backpack because Jansport use to make good quality gear.  Unfortunately this pack was not made to handle the rigors of middle school and the zipper ripped out within a week.  I understand the need to make profits but if you are going to call a backpack a \"BIG Student Daypack\" at least make it capable of handling the heavy books and binders teh schoold require kids to cart to and from school.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10495122", "1": "0.23316924", "2": "0.1838158", "3": "0.24197587", "4": "0.11366619", "5": "0.0672207", "6": "0.055200987"}}
