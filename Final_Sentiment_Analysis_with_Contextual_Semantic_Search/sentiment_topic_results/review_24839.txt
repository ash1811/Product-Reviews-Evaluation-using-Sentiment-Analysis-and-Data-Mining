{"text": "As a young working professional I find it difficult to accept the contemporary \"youthful\" style of most leisure items, particularly shoes. I am not a \"skater\" or a \"boy\" for that matter, nor do I want something flashy. Sanuk has hit upon a very nice contemporary design that is not overly plain or poorly constructed while maintaining a youthful functionality and appearance.The price seems kind of high until you break them in for a week, they really are one of the most convenient and comfortable pairs of shoes I have ever owned. Tangentially they are now my go-to alternative to my old Birkenstocks, which have been retired to the trash. I'm not sure how well the antimicrobial foam treatment will stand up over time, but they lasted really well for one summer and I can't see them breaking down any time soon, unlike the cork bed of Birks which tends to develop an inhospitable funk.Also as others have said these run a little small, I usually run 11 and had to swap them out for 12. These were sold from \"Surf & Dirt\" and their customer service is worth mentioning as very high quality.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18692164", "1": "0.19522457", "2": "0.20812085", "3": "0.063238725", "4": "0.12973747", "5": "0.025488693", "6": "0.19126809"}}
