{"text": "As others have noted, if you are average to above-average size (mainly facially) I would recommend getting the 55mm as opposed to the 52mm. These fit great; I am 6'1 with somewhat large facial features and the Wayfarer's sit nicely on my nose and are proportionate. I am always hesitant to buy glasses I haven't tried on, but went out on a limb here since they were on Lightning deal. I love the color of the frame (mine are darker that the image shown, and almost look black in some lighting, which looks great IMO) and the glass-tint provides great protection with a clear/crisp image. Came with a nice brow-leather semi-hard case and cleaning cloth. Glasses fit perfectly in the case and don't take up a lot of room, which is great for my ever-cluttered center console in my SUV. I have always wanted a par of these &#34;classic&#34; RayBans and now I have them! With the lightning deal @ around $70 you can't beat the value. This is my 3rd pair of RayBans and I am a very satisfied customer again", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.113099396", "1": "0.26373923", "2": "0.047407016", "3": "0.3276663", "4": "0.14853883", "5": "0.056668807", "6": "0.042880412"}}
