{"text": "Very comfortable boxers.  I used to be a dedicated tighty-whitey wearer but these have converted me.  I am happily wedgie free.From a sizing perspective, they might run a little large.  That is, I wear 'large' sized Hanes undershirts but for these boxers, medium is perfect.  I fluctuate between a 34 and 36 inch waist in pants/shorts/etc so take that for what it's worth.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10299682", "1": "0.29091477", "2": "0.14470316", "3": "0.16156371", "5": "0.054060183", "6": "0.24167123"}}
