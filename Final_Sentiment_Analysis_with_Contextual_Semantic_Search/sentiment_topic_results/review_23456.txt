{"text": "Very few can afford, or would even want to spend the money needed to buy, a Rolex. But if you want the classic Rolex Submariner look without the price, then this watch is for you!Take a look at the Rolex Submariner online, then look at this watch. You couldn't get a more similar watch (unless it was a fake Rolex). Except for the Invicta logos (right below 12:00, scrawled on the side, and on the second hand), Invicta has very closely matched, or paid homage, to the classic. You will likely be asked &#34;Is that a Rolex?&#34; when wearing it.I know there are plenty out there who dislike Invicta for being Invicta, and the watch snobs who shun anything that's not a $10,000+ watch, and the enthusiasts who rightly claim that you can get better quality out of a Seiko or Orient dive watch. But if you are after the pure look of a Rolex Submariner, then Invicta has hit the mark with the 8926OB (original coin bezel). This is THE Invicta that they are really known for. A quick search online will show you its popularity.A warning, though, to those used to large watches (43mm and above) and/or with large wrists... This may appear to be a small watch to you. The 8926 and the Rolex Sub are 40mm across without the crown, which can be a little small for some. And it actually wears slightly smaller, since it's only about 38mm across the crystal face, which makes it appear a little smaller. I have slim wrists (6.75 inches around) so this is really the perfect sized watch for me. But if you prefer larger watches, then you might want to consider the Invicta 0420: it looks the same but is much larger; about 45mm.Overall, I love this watch and it gets the most time of all my watches on my wrist. Highly recommended!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15274207", "1": "0.22641908", "2": "0.19466706", "3": "0.121295996", "4": "0.13224451", "5": "0.1012431", "6": "0.07138819"}}
