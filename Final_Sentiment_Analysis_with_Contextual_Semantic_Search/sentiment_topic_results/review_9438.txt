{"text": "These Ugg ascot slippers are wonderful in so many ways. I love wearing them around the house, when taking out the trash or grabbing the mail, or even for a short trip to the grocery store.Wearing them feels better than being barefoot.The only real con about the Ascot, and my reason for not giving a 5 star review, is that the fur on the insoles wears out sooner than I would like. It seems like the insoles are good for about 1 season of use, at which point I'll have to get them out (they're glued in a couple places) and put in replacement Ugg sheepskin insoles.The shoes will probably last for years - maybe a decade even - but the insoles will lose their fur with moderate to heavy use.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11084034", "1": "0.12069158", "2": "0.1652007", "3": "0.18473484", "4": "0.103292614", "5": "0.19580328", "6": "0.119436674"}}
