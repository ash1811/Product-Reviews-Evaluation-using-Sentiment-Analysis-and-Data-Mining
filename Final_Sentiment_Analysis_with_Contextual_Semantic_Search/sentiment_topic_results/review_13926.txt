{"text": "I feel like, &#34;what can one say when one word can pretty much sum it up? How about &#34;Perfect&#34;.I get comments on this all the time -- it's very classy, wears well, keeps time great, and is, well, just awesome.  It looks and feels like it costs 10x what I paid.The only thing about this watch is that it's challenging to adjust or set an alarm.  I don't use any of those features, to be fair, so perhaps I'd get more used to it if I used it for that.  Cell phones and other gadgets have replaced those needs for me, but when I wanted to use it, I certainly had to get out the manual and read it carefully.  Not worth it.  But for me, it's worth it just to have it as a classy, solidly build timepiece that draws just enough attention to it that it stays classy.  I never get tired of looking at its pearl-white-like bezel coloring, the deep, rich blacks in the face (and the band).  And the clasp is well built.Love this watch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17073031", "1": "0.27102184", "2": "0.10267587", "3": "0.12366284", "4": "0.12509218", "5": "0.056042824", "6": "0.15077418"}}
