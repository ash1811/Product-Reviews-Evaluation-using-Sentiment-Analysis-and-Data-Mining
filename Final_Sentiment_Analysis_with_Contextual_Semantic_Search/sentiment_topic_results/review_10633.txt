{"text": "These earrings, though pretty, are very easily smudged. For something intended to be worn against the skin, this is a BIG NO, NO. When you first put the earrings on (after washing) they are sparkly and pretty. However, about an hour later, after bobbing against one's skin (particularly those of us with oily skin, I suspect) they look like a completely different pair of earrings. The oily smudges on them change the look from sparkly crystal, to cheap plastic. For a decoration (not worn on the body), the material is great, however as an earing, I wouldn't recommend them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21449102", "1": "0.25682616", "2": "0.14700924", "3": "0.02869325", "4": "0.11216615", "5": "0.071150325", "6": "0.16966382"}}
