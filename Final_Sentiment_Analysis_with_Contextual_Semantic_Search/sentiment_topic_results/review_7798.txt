{"text": "Cheap tool, negligently assembled and unfinished. Screw designed to keep the push pin in place barely had a slot cut in it. The floating, spring-loaded platform designed to help you line up the link with the pin doesn't glide up and down properly and has too strong of a spring attached to it, making it hard to get perfect alignment. Broke one pin in the first 5 minutes but thankfully the tool comes with 3 more spares. There's a reason for that. My copy also didn't provide parallel pin alignment, they all look about 3 degrees tilted up. I'm suspecting that's why the first one broke, since it's being forced to flex as it pushes. For the price, can't expect much. If you manage to adjust 3 watches before running out of pins, you've saved yourself about $40", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08201599", "1": "0.28532627", "2": "0.08555759", "3": "0.1470043", "4": "0.18982224", "5": "0.035713017", "6": "0.17456064"}}
