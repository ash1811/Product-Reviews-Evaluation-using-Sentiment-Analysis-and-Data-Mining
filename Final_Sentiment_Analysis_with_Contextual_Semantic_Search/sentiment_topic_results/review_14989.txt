{"text": "I bought these sunglasses for my 13-year-old grandson.  He liked the style, and the fit is okay.  The quality of the plastic is about the same as a pair of little children's sunglasses.  My biggest complaint, however, is that the lenses keep falling out.  They fell out just taking them out of the plastic wrapper.  I put them back in and then tried to wipe them clean.  Out they popped again.  If I had bought them for myself I would have sent them back already.  I'm still deciding whether or not to ask my grandson for them back so I can return them.  I'm sure they'll be a real hassle to wear with one lens or the other always popping out.  I can't recommend them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08701733", "1": "0.41078052", "2": "0.18209812", "3": "0.045482457", "4": "0.22482154", "6": "0.04727671"}}
