{"text": "First, these are nicely made, comfortable, good material and many people will like them, if they like \"shorts\" that come down over your knees. I gave these a so/so rating but that's because the photos are deceiving. I just don't don't like long shorts and was deceived by the photos into thinking these were regular shorts..I want my shorts to be shorts, to me that means they come halfway down my thighs, not to my knees. The photos supplied in this listing are not helpful. The legs on these \"shorts\" are much longer then they appear in the photos. They should give at lease one photo with a model wearing these \"shorts\" so you can see how long they actually are. Shame on me for not reading more of the reviews as I now see that several other buyers mentioned the same thing. It's not worth the money to return them so I am keeping them as sleepwear but I won't be wearing these anywhere else. If you like really long shorts, you will probably like these. As far as the waist, I am a 38-40 waist, I ordered the 1X and they fit me perfectly, so I'm not sure why some people are having issues with the waist size unless they are just purchasing the wrong size.*** Update -- Looks like someone has updated the photos on this listing now. I just wanted to mention this so that someone reading my review wouldn't be scratching their heads wondering what I was talking about. The new photos are much better and more realistic.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.33913425", "1": "0.24023648", "2": "0.15449113", "4": "0.05785856", "6": "0.20325045"}}
