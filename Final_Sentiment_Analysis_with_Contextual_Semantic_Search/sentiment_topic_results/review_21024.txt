{"text": "Well I was skeptical, as I have problems finding footwear. I have diabetes & other problems, balance, etc. so I really can't wear most shoes anymore. My actual size is 6 wide, but they're hard to find. I usually have to get a 61/2, but they aren't correct for my feet. (too long & narrow) So, I wanted to try the 6, even though it wasn't wide. (I have Amazon Prime, so if they didn't fit I could return them free of charge.) They were on sale for $47; I never would have paid full price. When I got them & tried them on I was very very happy to find that they did fit me almost perfectly! They are really great for me. They feel like they were made for my feet! Seem to 'cradle' my feet exactly & provide 'full' coverage. (NOTE the picture.)Thay are not tight at all, & not loose. I like the way they sort of tip up in the front...very helpful so I don't trip. My feet are sensitive, as someone else had mentioned & you will feel those little 'pimples' on the inside. Doesn't bother me though. Wide enough so you can wear a reg. pair/thin sport sock with them. Also, you can put an insole (oder-eater, etc.) inside, as they will make your feet sweat, if you are prone, & your feet will slip around. But... because they are (well-made) plastic, in the hot weather you can just hose your feet down to cool off! They will be great for the summer, but I will wear them year-round with socks. I liked them so much, I just ordered another pair in red, & were $37.  I wanted sage & coral but they don't have them in a 6. My foot is 81/2 inches long & about 31/2 wide. I feel someone with a 7 could fit a 6. BUT I will say they are wide, and someone with a NARROW foot would not fit/like these in any size. Another 'con' I have for these sandals: I, personally, need more height & will purchase 'heel cups' for added comfort & safety. They do look good on me, but this is my style! YES, I would recommend these sandals for anybody, especially with the summer coming up! PS Have worn them every day for a week now :)UPDATE: My red sandals fit exactly the same; that is perfectly! So, I then ordered a third pair in black. Sameperfect fit...These were the only 3 colors of size 6 on sale. I am waiting to see if coral, sage & midnight come on sale soon. I have various/serious medical problems related to my feet. I am so happy I can switch between these colors, and I don't have to spend half a day to adjust my feet/brain to different fits. Sometimes I wear with a colorful sock. Cute with jeans. I have been wearing these, exclusively, all day long. Yes, if I am on my feet too long, the soles get a little sore, but my feet NEVER HURT ANYWHERE, ANYMORE! I will update again in a couple more months of wearing.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.093529895", "1": "0.44129935", "2": "0.1816944", "3": "0.13092825", "4": "0.13343298", "6": "0.016680533"}}
