{"text": "I bought this for my husband in November 2011. (I got the 5mm for myself also.) I can't believe how great it still looks!!! Husband is very hard on things and only wears a cross necklace and his wedding band. I have bought him many of both only to have them smashed, broken, bent or just plain beat up in no time flat. Everything from 14k gold that I paid hundreds of dollars for to stainless steel. Nothing held up! He is a welder by trade and also is wrenching on the Harley, working with wood, hunting, building or shooting bows, etc., so he is very rough on his rings. And because he is a special metals welder, he knows all the different kinds of metals and how they hold up so when we started looking for a tungsten ring, I was a bit put off by how expensive they are....Until I looked here!!! This is by far the best ring I have ever bought for him!!! And at $20, it is a steal! I wasn't crazy about how the brushed ones looked, so I got the polished one figuring who cares if he trashes in in a few months. Well I have to say there is not a mark, scratch or chip in this ring yet!!!! Our last few bands have been comfort fit also, so I was glad to see that these were made that way too. True to size and the weight of this ring is off the charts! You know you have a durable ring!! I LOVE THIS RING!! ((A word of caution.....Do not force a tungsten ring on if it is too small! There is no way to cut them off! You have to use a pair of vise-grips to crack/smash them off.))", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10379841", "1": "0.18756221", "2": "0.09205972", "3": "0.24793051", "4": "0.23363547", "5": "0.05255488", "6": "0.082458764"}}
