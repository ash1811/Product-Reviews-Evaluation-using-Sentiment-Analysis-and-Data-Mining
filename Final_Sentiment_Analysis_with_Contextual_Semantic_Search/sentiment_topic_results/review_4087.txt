{"text": "My 12-year-old wants to be a gladiator this year and this costume fit the bill price wise.  I think it runs a bit small, though.  My son is not big for his age and he is underweight.  I bought the large, which is a 10/12 and it is short on him.  The tunic hits him above the knees.  The \"leather\" doublet is on the front only.  It ties in the back.  The cape is attached to it and covers the tie.  The \"leather\" doublet is as long as the tunic - you can barely see the tunic below it.  The headband and other accessories are cool.  My son is happy, so that is good.  He bought a toy sword and shield to go with it.  For the price, it looks great!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13018112", "1": "0.4112748", "2": "0.092828885", "3": "0.048940916", "4": "0.2675968", "5": "0.04652792"}}
