{"text": "These shirts fit close to the skin but are EXCEPTIONALLY comfortable with almost a silky feel. But, luckily there is no silky sheen. I typically wear a small t-shirt, but I ordered mediums, which fit perfectly. Order a size larger than you usually wear unless you're looking for a compression fit. They are very long, so they stay tucked in all day. I love that they don't create that bulky Big Fig look around my waist under my dress shirts. I should also note that they are slightly sheer but look fine with a dress shirt and open collar.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.076943785", "1": "0.3711257", "2": "0.102348976", "3": "0.100811124", "4": "0.10469936", "5": "0.16247757", "6": "0.0815935"}}
