{"text": "A T-shirt may be \"only a T-shirt\" to some, but when you want a roomy shirt with generous proportions and substantial materials -- the all-cotton shirt is a bit heftier than run-of-the-mill T's -- this Carhartt shirt does the job. The armholes allow easy motion, and the body of the tall-sized shirt is longer than the norm of tall sizes from other manufacturers. Both features ensure all-day comfort for the active wearer. This holds for work and play duties alike. The only quibble: There's a small, cheesy (cheap-looking) manufacturer label on the front of the breast pocket. There are a lot of other ways and places to put a brand's name on a garment.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13191822", "1": "0.24029925", "2": "0.08587058", "3": "0.17302926", "4": "0.15481524", "6": "0.21175356"}}
