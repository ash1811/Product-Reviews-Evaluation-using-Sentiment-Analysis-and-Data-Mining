{"text": "This Waist Cincher doesn't slip or ride up. However, it does have a tendency to twist a bit after a lot of movement. It snaps in the front making it easy to get on and off. The front snaps can show through a thin shirt or blouse, therefore I recommend wearing a camisole with certain tops.I was initially attracted to this particular waist cincher because it has boning in the back, sides and front for shaping and support. The boning is pretty good considering the price. My posture has improved since wearing as well. I find it to be quite comfortable even after wearing all day. Comfort and support are important to me since I tend to spend a lot of time sitting in front of a computer. If you're looking for a comfortable and pretty waist cincher with good shaping qualities and support that you can wear all day long, then I think you will be pleased with this cincher.This is my third pair of this style. I have had my first 2 pairs for over a year now and they have both started to show signs of wear and tear. The boning in one has started to come loose while the Lycra fabric in the side front panels of the other has given way a bit. I wear these almost daily so overall I feel they have held up well. I only wish it came in prettier colors rather than the standard white, black and beige.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.35920173", "1": "0.13233303", "2": "0.1893663", "4": "0.1278298", "5": "0.0978358", "6": "0.09118732"}}
