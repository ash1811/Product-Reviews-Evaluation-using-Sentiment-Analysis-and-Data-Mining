{"text": "I stand on my feet for 7 hours at a time in a professional job. This is my shoe w/ a walking insole inside I work it out just fine and no one notices I have on sneaks! I am on my fourth pair and looking for several replacements. Works great w/ slacks or khaki pants. (make sure if you are getting them as an alternative to a ladies dress shoe get the all blk w/ the all blk gumsole and all blk laces) Most dress shoes for ladies are very very uncomfortable even though they are fashionable and this one does both very well. The fact that I can machine wash makes them even more likeable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17075977", "1": "0.20470408", "2": "0.21481839", "3": "0.21814285", "4": "0.090886936", "5": "0.068503276", "6": "0.032184716"}}
