{"text": "Been looking for an inexpensive watch to use at work.  The Casio MQ24-7B2 works just right for that purpose.  I wanted something inexpensive and that I wouldn't mind if it got scratched or broken.  The watch is very light and yes, it keeps time.  So far happy with the Casio watch and hopefully it will last for a good while.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.31094", "2": "0.17750795", "3": "0.16785716", "4": "0.15195478", "5": "0.080474004", "6": "0.10664371"}}
