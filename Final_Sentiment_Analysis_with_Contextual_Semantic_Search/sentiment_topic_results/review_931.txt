{"text": "This shoe is basically the same shoe that Florsheim sells as the &#34;Riva&#34;  The only difference that I can see is one has &#34;Florsheim&#34; printed inside and the other has &#34;Bostonian.  The difference in price is astonishing.  The Riva is $110.00.  I have been wearing &#34;Rivas&#34; for 15 years so I know the shoe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15998252", "1": "0.12268455", "2": "0.41837975", "3": "0.14884076", "4": "0.13862564"}}
