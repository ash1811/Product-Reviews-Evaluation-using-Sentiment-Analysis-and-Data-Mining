{"text": "My \"second\" High Sierra Backpack.. and IT's great! Even better in person.. Great compartments (lot's of room..), fabric great, even the 'color' (pomodoro/charcoal) is \"smart\".. and not \"RED\". This look of the backpack is great.What I like most is the backpack, like so many others, is not complicated with \"cords\" or \"snaps\", but a very clean modern \"functional\" backpack.. that didn't cost an arm or a leg. Way to go High Sierra!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.27191636", "1": "0.14262654", "2": "0.2971962", "5": "0.17798895", "6": "0.103428885"}}
