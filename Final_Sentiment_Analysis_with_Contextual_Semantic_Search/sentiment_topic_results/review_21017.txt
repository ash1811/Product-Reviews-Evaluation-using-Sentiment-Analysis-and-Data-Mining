{"text": "I've always loved to wear hoisery because they make my legs look nice (Victoria's Secret's model I'm not).  Amongst pantyhose, stockings and thigh-highs, I love stockings the best because they require the cutest lingerie items--garter belts!!!  But, let's face it, no one can really find those matching bra and panty to go with that garter belt and make that 7AM commute.  And though maybe there is no one there to see, pantyhoses cover up those pretty [...] panties from Victoria's Secret.  These thigh-highs go with just any bras and panties; they don't cover up pretty panties; and they don't twist up like pantyhoses...I also wear Hue (not as durable in my experiences) and Victoria's Secret thigh highs (a little too pricy).  But for its durability and price, Hanes Lacetop thigh highs are the best.The only thing that I hope Hanes can do better is that they introduce this product in snow white.  Though I mostly wear nude (litte color or barely there), I have always loved wearing pure white with white bras and panties.  But this is definitely the ones to wear everyday.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12190501", "1": "0.081683226", "2": "0.08952656", "3": "0.13122253", "4": "0.19848056", "5": "0.18169865", "6": "0.1954835"}}
