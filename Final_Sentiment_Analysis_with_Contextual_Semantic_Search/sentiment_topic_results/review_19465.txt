{"text": "I bought the black patent wallet.  It is exactly what I wanted and cheaper than our local boutique.  It is a well organized clutch/wallet.  I have enough rooms for all my cards, checkbook, my cell, car keys, sunglasses and the best part is my cash is easy to get to and I don't have to fold it!  It is well made and I love it.  My teen girls are fighting over which one of them get it when I am done with it.  =)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19041109", "2": "0.4479583", "4": "0.13129686", "5": "0.17259257", "6": "0.050369065"}}
