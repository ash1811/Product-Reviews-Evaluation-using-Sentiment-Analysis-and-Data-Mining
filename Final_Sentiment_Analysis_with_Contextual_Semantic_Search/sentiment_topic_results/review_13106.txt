{"text": "I really like canvas bags like this one. When you buy this, keep in mind that it is really small. You will have a difficult time using it for work or as a every day carry bag. That being said, it was priced well and is well made. I wish they made the same thing only bigger - I love the buckle on it and wishes the other Rothco bags had them instead of Velcro.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.22856157", "1": "0.2571637", "2": "0.30072036", "4": "0.1138987", "6": "0.09189468"}}
