{"text": "I apply a shine with this polish on my several pairs of Allen Edmonds shoes several times a year.  Do this and your shoes will retain that \"new\" look for years to come.  This polish applies directly to the shoe with the sponge applicator on the tip.  Then use a smooth rag such as an old T-Shirt to buff the shoes.  A shoebrush works also, but alas, I never seem to have one around.  Since Allen Edmonds shoes are the best, why use anything but this excellent Allen Edmonds polish?
