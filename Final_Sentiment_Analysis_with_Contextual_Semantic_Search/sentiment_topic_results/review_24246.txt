{"text": "I wish I'd read the reviews for this - I usually do, but LEGO prides themselves on quality products and my son fell in love with it reading about it in a LEGO book. It seemed like the perfect watch.It came and it is super cute, though it felt a lot cheaper than LEGO generally does. The kids were ecstatic, and had a lot of fun putting it together in their own way. My older son especially was excited to have a watch and has been staring at it telling me the time all day. However, he complained that it kept falling off. Unfortunately, though I know he's been being careful, it fell off outside and he can no longer find it.If you want something fun and cute for a few hours, or to add a few extra unique pieces to your collection, get this. However, don't count on it as a functional watch at all.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12989445", "1": "0.19689918", "2": "0.23378558", "3": "0.18836024", "4": "0.057148207", "5": "0.1915178"}}
