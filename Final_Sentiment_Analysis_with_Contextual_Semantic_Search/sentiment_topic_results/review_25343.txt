{"text": "I ordered this duster for rainy days.  I am 5'4, 170 lbs... with mostly a belly.... A medium fits with room to spare....  I will have to hem the sleeves but ..... it is for men.  I travel the trails and ride about 6 hours a day on weekends, I camp out and need to walk to clubhouse for dinner and this will keep me dry for sure when it rains...  then I can still dance when the DJ starts  :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.37454155", "2": "0.14328484", "4": "0.16725715", "5": "0.055255085", "6": "0.25188336"}}
