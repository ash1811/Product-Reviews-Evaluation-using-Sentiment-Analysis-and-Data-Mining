{"text": "I have Oregonian feet.  Long & VERY skinny.  These fit great.  I am wheel chair bound & use my one good foot to propel myself with on my hard wood floors. I needed socks that I could wear to bed & use in the wheelchair.  These are perfect.  Doctors tell you to wear toed socks or shoes as when we age, our toes get squished together & need to be spread back to normal position.  So these fill all my elderly needs.  Hard to bend over & put them on, but so is any sock or shoe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13567352", "1": "0.18168682", "2": "0.13359089", "3": "0.06399124", "4": "0.23832159", "5": "0.19537525", "6": "0.051360656"}}
