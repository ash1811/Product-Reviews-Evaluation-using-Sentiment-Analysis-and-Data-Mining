{"text": "I like everything about this had except the Carhartt label which is sewn on the outside where everyone will see it. It is a plain and unattractive label. I just spent five minutes carefully cutting the threads that secured the label to the hat and removing the label. Now the hat is great. It's well-made. Even though I have a large head, it stretches enough that I can wear it comfortably. It looks good. The hat is long enough that you will need to either turn up the edge of it so it is doubled, or you will have the medieval/Gumby look if you wear it like a beanie. Actually, I like that look too. The hat is very warm. I expect to get many years of good use out of it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07768284", "1": "0.23111942", "2": "0.18008637", "3": "0.04972692", "4": "0.21214479", "5": "0.14036392", "6": "0.10887574"}}
