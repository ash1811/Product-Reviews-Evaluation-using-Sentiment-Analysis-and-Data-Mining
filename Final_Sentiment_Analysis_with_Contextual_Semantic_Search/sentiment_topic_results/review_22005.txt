{"text": "I really wanted to like this.  I spent a week researching coveralls online, reading reviews, looking at sizes, etc.  I ordered a small, regular, because I couldn't find a short in the right size.  But this is HUGE.  My six foot neighbor could fit in this without a problem.  I am 5'5&#34;, size 8, and the arms are 6 inches too long, the legs are 10 inches too long.  The arms and legs are three times as wide as my body.  I will have to send it back.  And, as far as insulation goes, there is none.  It says it is quilted and insulated, but it's not.  There is a thin layer of nylon fabric lining the cotton duck, but there is no padding between the two.  Nothing.  It is made in Bangladesh.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.113791995", "1": "0.27017668", "3": "0.25994995", "4": "0.09198551", "5": "0.11602455", "6": "0.14585848"}}
