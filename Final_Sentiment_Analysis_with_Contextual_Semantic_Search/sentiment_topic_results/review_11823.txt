{"text": "My son just moved to a size 5.5.  His shoes are all huge.  So I bought the size 5, thinking they'd be huge, and wet & slide off & I didn't want him to trip.  I should have gone with the 6-7, which sounds so big for a boy who is tripping on his 5.5's.....  I doubt he'll get to wear these,but I already tore the tags off, thinking I was sending  them to daycare right away. :(  Size Up.  Otherwise, very nice quality. doesn't look like the cheesey ones I've seen in stores.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.087927364", "1": "0.25087613", "2": "0.21785533", "3": "0.3005287", "4": "0.028549371", "5": "0.06440274", "6": "0.049860373"}}
