{"text": "I have only owned these sandals for about a week, but I love them. I wasn't sure what size to order given the company's recommendation to order a size larger because it supposedly runs small. I am normally a size 8, and I ordered a size 8. They fit perfectly. They are incredibly comfortable and supportive. I usually get very sweaty feet, but I did not notice much sweating while wearing these around. I haven't been able to wear them hiking yet, so this review is just in terms of wearing them around my work, house, and yard.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11778124", "1": "0.30470398", "2": "0.08145605", "3": "0.38472128", "4": "0.048775785", "5": "0.059640694"}}
