{"text": "I am quite pleased with this product to clean my silver jewelry.  My jewelry store advised that I should only use a cloth to polish my silver bracelets and necklaces, as silver jewelry can be made with many different types of silver.  I am happy with the two step cloth system;  one to clean and the second to polish.  The price is reasonable, and there isn't an odd smell or mess when using the cloth.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18718664", "1": "0.5212848", "2": "0.061144277", "5": "0.11566687", "6": "0.10733839"}}
