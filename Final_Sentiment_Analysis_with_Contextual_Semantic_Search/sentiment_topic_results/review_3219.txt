{"text": "Call me old-fashioned, but I am not interested in acid-washed, pre-softened, skin-tight or fancy-pocket blue jeans.  Give me American-made, traditional cut, no frills, thick denim blue jeans.  I prefer to wear them in myself.  These are perfect for that.  They are relaxed fit, so there is a little extra room for you, and they are cut to be WORN, not to be \"fashionable\".  You want comfort and fashion, buy a pair of chinos or dress pants.  I will keep my jeans.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.093513414", "1": "0.1957362", "3": "0.38798177", "4": "0.13250469", "5": "0.14082356", "6": "0.0461159"}}
