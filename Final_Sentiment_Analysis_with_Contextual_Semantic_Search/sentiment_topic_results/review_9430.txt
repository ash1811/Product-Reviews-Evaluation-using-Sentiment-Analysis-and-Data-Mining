{"text": "I purchased these slippers as a gift for my husband. He wears a 10 1/2 so I ordered size 11. He has a narrow foot, I was concerned they may be too big but they actually fit perfectly. I had seen lots of reviews on issues w sizing but going up 1/2 size even w a narrow foot worked out fine. Nice, thick solid slipper, well-made. My only complaint is the sole leaves minor scuff marks on my hardwood flooring.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11365615", "1": "0.21691176", "2": "0.12821476", "4": "0.15302159", "5": "0.25564966", "6": "0.12949204"}}
