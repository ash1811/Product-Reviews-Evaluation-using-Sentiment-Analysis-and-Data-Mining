{"text": "For someone that works on their feet 12 hours a day, these shoes are amazing when I'm off the clock.  I bought a similar pair (closed) to wear at work at are by far the best investment I've made for my feet in a very long time.  The comfort I have with them cannot compare to anything, not even the custom made orthodics!  Will definitely be buying another pair soon.  :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07910599", "1": "0.17935932", "2": "0.16398446", "3": "0.3059779", "4": "0.16984548", "6": "0.097949244"}}
