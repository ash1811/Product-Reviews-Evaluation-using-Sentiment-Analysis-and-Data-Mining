{"text": "Here's the problem I had with these.  When sitting with them on they feel like slippers....sooo comfortable.  But the problem is in the heel when I stand and walk.  These are wides, but the shoe fits differently from every other wide I have ever bought.  The shoe doesn't curve as much as it should and on the inside of the heel it actually pushes into the bottom inner side of my heel.  With a full length insert and a heel insert, it solves the problem.  But without, they are painful to walk in.  I literally feel like my heel is bruising when I walk.  My feet don't look like they are shaped strangely and I've never had this problem with other shoes.  However, I would buy these again with the extras I'd need to make them feel right b/c of the otherwise perfect comfort and build quality.  They still look and feel nice after daily wear for 8 months and I'm normally tough on shoes.  If you buy the wides and you try them on and the heel doesn't feel perfect, don't think you can deal with it....  Either send them back or buy inserts.  Also, the black on these shoes is really dark dark black and looks really nice.  ...Even nicer than in the pictures.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13392732", "1": "0.20446737", "2": "0.099833466", "3": "0.113650315", "5": "0.24491158", "6": "0.2006958"}}
