{"text": "I was looking for a bag that would hold and lightly pad my iPad along with all my &#34;daily&#34; things. It's perfect! The inner compartments keep papers and my calendar in place so I can grab with no fumbling through lots of items. The outer compartments hold things I need frequently- iPhone, zipper case with ID-cash-credit cards, and keys. Really appreciate the magnetic closures on the small outside pockets and the large pocket behind the outside zipper pocket (allows for the occasional paper item to stay in place without flying away). Just met a woman with the exact bag in same taupe on her shoulder; she said it's her second one- first bag lasted years until zippers broke. Look forward to years using mine!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09743425", "1": "0.3748188", "2": "0.12550998", "3": "0.1289265", "4": "0.058411565", "5": "0.110020034", "6": "0.10487887"}}
