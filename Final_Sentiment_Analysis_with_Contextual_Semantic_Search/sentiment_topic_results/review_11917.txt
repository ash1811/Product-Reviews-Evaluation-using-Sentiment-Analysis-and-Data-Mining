{"text": "In Sum: Great function and quality though they are sized large so order at least a size lower.These Denim these jeans are made of are of excellent quality and the interior lining is both warm, and shows no signs of wear despite repeated washing. These jeans may be costly but barring outright abuse will last for years. These are quite simply the most comfortable pants I own for cold weather and outdoor activity. Something to keep in mind is that Carhartt clothing is sized large to allow for under layers. With these pants I ordered a size smaller then usual and after they stretch from wear a little I still need a belt to keep them up, which I might be bothered by if the jeans weren't so comfortable in doors and out. One exceptional trait of these jeans is that they have are an at waist cut and have ample room in the crotch, presumably to fit additional layers. As a result of the relaxed cut he look of the jeans can best be described as baggy and utilitarian, but if you care more about fashion then you do about keeping yourself warm you likely wouldn't be looking at a pair of lined jeans in the first place. Be warned, however,  that your significant other or fashion conscious friends may disagree.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15928905", "1": "0.32803315", "2": "0.062164403", "3": "0.2564256", "4": "0.10478947", "6": "0.087089375"}}
