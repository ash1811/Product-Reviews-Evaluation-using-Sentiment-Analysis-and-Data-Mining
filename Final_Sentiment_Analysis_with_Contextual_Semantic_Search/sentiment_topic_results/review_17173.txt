{"text": "Got these boots, and WOW! They appeared to be well made.  Note: Boots are not made in the USA as I thought, but rather, made in the Dominican Republic. Boots are very comfortable, but I got a Wide fit, and maybe could have gone with a regular width.  I normally wear EE or W width shoes, so note to users, these boots tend to fit on the wider side.  Maybe wearing thicker socks will fill in the shoe better.  However, the opening of the boot is rather narrow, and putting them on is a bit of a struggle, as the ankle part of the boot is made rather narrow.  I've had Timberline's before and these are not as nice as the originals (back in the early 90's).  4 out of 5 as that's the only knock against these boots.  Otherwise, sole is top notch quality, and the uppers are top quality new buck .", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.43343946", "2": "0.09965939", "3": "0.059027757", "4": "0.21299742", "5": "0.11294435", "6": "0.07965913"}}
