{"text": "I have been using Superfeet insoles for several years and really like the support they give.  I have fallen arches and must wear insoles in all my shoes.  This is the first time trying the orange color and they seen good as well. I think they are a little thicker then the other colors and work well for my workout/walking shoes.  Highly recommend these for anyone with foot problems.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.014333472", "1": "0.30357438", "2": "0.22167015", "3": "0.18707375", "4": "0.10045509", "5": "0.13287167", "6": "0.040021483"}}
