{"text": "I bought a pair of the pink camo fatigues about three years ago and love them, so I decide to get another pair. I bought the olive drab and love them as well. They do run a bit large. I bought a medium, but I think I could have bought the small. The pink camo pair fit me a little big and so do these. That's ok...I love this pair as well. Would recommend these paints. Well made. Mid weight. Comfortable!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.4352336", "3": "0.2907171", "4": "0.09192311", "5": "0.07552437", "6": "0.10075821"}}
