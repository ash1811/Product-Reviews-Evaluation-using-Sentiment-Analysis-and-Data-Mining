{"text": "I've been thinking of getting a good pair of waterproof boots for some time. Saw these Timberland White Ledge boots and decided to give them a try. I've owned Timberland Boots for quit a few years. My last pair kind of \"bought the farm\" and I needed a new pair. These look like just what I've been looking for.

I'm sure they'll be fine.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.054229088", "1": "0.22318369", "2": "0.16820058", "3": "0.28393334", "4": "0.15705656", "5": "0.052098848", "6": "0.06129791"}}
