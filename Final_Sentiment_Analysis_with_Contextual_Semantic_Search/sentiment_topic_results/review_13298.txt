{"text": "I have extremely wide feet, and after years of messing around with other lesser quality brands, i decided to order these once i learned they were available.  They are a godsend!  Finally, a slide/sneaker that fits right, offers great support for the type of shoe it is, and comes in extra wide widths.  They are also extremely comfortable. They come with a removable insole which is nice, because once removed it gives you the ability to wear socks if needed.  I found the sizing and width to be spot on. I will be ordering another pair just to have for a backup.  Highly recommended!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.062627345", "1": "0.41236874", "2": "0.12364608", "3": "0.17754054", "4": "0.116746485", "5": "0.10437056"}}
