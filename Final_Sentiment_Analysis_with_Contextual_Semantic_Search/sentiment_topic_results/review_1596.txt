{"text": "I am 5'3\" and about 160 lbs. I was measured at a lingerie store and told I should wear an XL in the flexees waistnipper #6868. I wore it for a couple of hours and while yes it did slim me down a bit it became loose after a couple of hours. It lost it's snug fit within about two hours. I will be trying one that has the extra rows of hooks where I can tighten/loosen it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06416586", "1": "0.24783498", "2": "0.2580276", "4": "0.090952754", "5": "0.1412636", "6": "0.19377187"}}
