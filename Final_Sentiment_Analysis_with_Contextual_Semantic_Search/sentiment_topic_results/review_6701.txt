{"text": "After completly opening the package and extracting the watch (difficult to say the least), I saw the tag on the watch that said \"Synthetic Leather\".  The Amazon product description says \"Leather Strap Watch\", but it is NOT a leather strap!  The whole reason I bought this watch instead of others is that it was advertised as leather.  Turns out, I should have gotten a different watch.The watch is very nice-looking, numbers easy to read, functions, and while the pink strap is pretty (and NOT leather), it is just a bit dustier than pictured.If you like the way it looks and you don't care about the leather part, it's a nice watch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.037010558", "1": "0.13638346", "2": "0.40875342", "3": "0.053695776", "4": "0.08596125", "5": "0.11288314", "6": "0.16531241"}}
