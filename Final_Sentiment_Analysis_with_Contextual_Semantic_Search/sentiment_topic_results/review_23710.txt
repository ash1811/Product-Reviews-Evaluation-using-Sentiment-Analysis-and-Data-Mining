{"text": "These socks are super thin, and improperly sized! I wear a size 12 (2E) shoe. These socks do not even go halfway up my calves and I am not a tall person (5'10\") with thick hobbit legs. They are not too tight for my legs, its just that my feet are large enough there is not enough length in the leg of the sock for it to extend as far as it is supposed to. If you want an over the calf sock and have a large foot and thick legs, DO NOT buy these!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.1526181", "2": "0.14603084", "3": "0.3067908", "4": "0.14494874", "5": "0.2430957"}}
