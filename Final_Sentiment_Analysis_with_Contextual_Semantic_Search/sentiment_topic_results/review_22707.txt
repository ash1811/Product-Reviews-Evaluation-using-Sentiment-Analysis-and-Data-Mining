{"text": "These are what I look for in a panty, they are comfortable, fit right and have the coverage I like.The Hi-Cut has a better feel to it than the bikini or the brief and I'd say it's an in-betweener of the two.I like most of the colors, my biggest complaint would be that we don't get to choose the colors.They tend to last a good while before the elastic wears out, I wish they lasted a little longer.It's a good value for the price, I would buy again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10577102", "1": "0.34637725", "2": "0.10598239", "3": "0.09956803", "4": "0.12758288", "5": "0.12972942", "6": "0.08498901"}}
