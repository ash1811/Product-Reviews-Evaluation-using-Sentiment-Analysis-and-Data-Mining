{"text": "After reading all the great reviews on Amazon I was so excited to get these shoes.  I have Amazon Prime and paid the extra $3.99 to have these shoes shipped quickly.I received the shoes and found them very painful.  They look like men's flip flops, very clunky looking.  I decided to work through the pain and ugliness and give the shoes at least a two day trial.  I failed.  When I woke up the next morning I put these shoes on and they were even more painful than the day before.I have a daughter that wears the same shoe size as I do, so I decided that I'd give the shoes to her.  She tried the shoes on and couldn't stand wearing them for even a minute.  She said the shoes were trying to roll her feet out which is exactly how the sandals made my feet feel x10.My daughter and I both wear Oasics running shoes everyday, and we both have fairly flat feet.  I had high hopes for Montrail Women's Molokini Sandals, but these shoes are too painful to wear.  I live in a very rural area and have purchased from Amazon bi-weekly for over 10 years.  I've only returned one item to amazon in that time span, but I will be returning these shoes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.146489", "1": "0.29069716", "2": "0.25264764", "3": "0.030572368", "4": "0.062328864", "5": "0.18209507", "6": "0.035169955"}}
