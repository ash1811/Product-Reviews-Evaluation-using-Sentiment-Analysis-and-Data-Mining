{"text": "Well made and VERY comfortable dark brown dress shoe.  A subtle quality that many people won't consciously notice, but will make an impression anyway.  Skip the Bush or Dockers with their no-nonsense rubber soles and heavy padding made necessary by a poor fit and choice of materials.  The Allen Edmonds' all leather construction fits like a well made glove and won't make your feet look like boats.They say that human evolution causes us to favor mates with symmetrical features and proportionate body parts.  Don't shoot yourself in the foot by buying the bulky over padded dress shoes!  Spend the money to get something that will make you look good...  The Allen Edmonds are the shoe.Also do yourself a favor and research proper shoe care, then buy a care kit... these shoes deserve it!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06350321", "1": "0.30210653", "2": "0.18819414", "3": "0.15051562", "4": "0.13053614", "5": "0.07532828", "6": "0.089816034"}}
