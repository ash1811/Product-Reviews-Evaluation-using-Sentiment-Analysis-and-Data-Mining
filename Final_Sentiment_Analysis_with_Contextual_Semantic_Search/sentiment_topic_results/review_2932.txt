{"text": "First of all, this shirt is fantastic. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because, like a few of the other reviewers have mentioned, the shirts manufactured in Mexico or scratchy and a bit uncomfortable(you don't notice once you start working out), especially compared to the shirts manufactured in Jordan, those ones are really soft and comfortable. It's too bad you can't tell on Amazon which one you're going to get. It is actually worth it to pick up the shirt at a brick and mortar store just so you can make sure you get a Jordan manufactured shirt. THE JORDAN MANUFACTURED SHIRT IS A 5 STAR PRODUCT.If you are used to wearing cotton tees, this shirt will change your life, especially if you sweat a lot (no more changing your shirt multiple times!). You will never go back to cotton, these shirts are that great. They don't hold all of your sweat, restrict, or feel uncomfortable like cotton. They stretch a bit with you and have a very comfortable loose cut.I also own an Adidas shirt which is good, and a few Nike Pro Combat shirts which are my favorite for the gym. I like the Nike shirts slightly better because the sleeves are cut better, the collar is much nicer, it stretches a bit more, and the tail is a bit longer. The advantage of the UA shirt is that it is the most similar to a regular cotton shirt if that matters to you(better for casual wear I guess).I wear this shirt to the gym (lifting, Krav Maga, treadmill), Mountain Biking, and playing tennis.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1878085", "1": "0.15748319", "2": "0.14267267", "3": "0.15964395", "4": "0.098670155", "5": "0.08131685", "6": "0.17240474"}}
