{"text": "My son is obsessed with clocks and telling time lately. He saw this watch when I was browsing online and said he would really like to have it. I did not give him the extra little parts that came with it, just the basic watch. It was easy to size to his wrist by snapping out a few of the pieces.  Stays on well and is surviving him banging it around at school and everywhere else we go.  Arrived quickly from seller :)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.21065325", "1": "0.104780525", "2": "0.20592341", "3": "0.110311545", "5": "0.20883882", "6": "0.1559872"}}
