{"text": "I'm a little embarrassed to admit it, but I like buying expensive underwear. To clarify, \"expensive,\" to me, is anything that's not $10 Fruit of the Loom 3-packs from Target.I wanted to see what the fuss is about so over the years I've purchased underwear from Hugo Boss, American Eagle, Emporio Armani and others. The majority of my purchases have been comfortable enough or sharp looking, but none have been as comfortable as these Calvin Klein Micro Modal Trunks. They feel amazing against your skin and truly, ahem, support you instead of just jamming all your bits together. I will slowly but surely replace the remaining Hanes and Fruit of the Loom briefs with these. They feel like a dream and they're worth every penny.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.19948085", "1": "0.20075102", "2": "0.17302208", "3": "0.15326878", "4": "0.13677439", "5": "0.053389642", "6": "0.08331324"}}
