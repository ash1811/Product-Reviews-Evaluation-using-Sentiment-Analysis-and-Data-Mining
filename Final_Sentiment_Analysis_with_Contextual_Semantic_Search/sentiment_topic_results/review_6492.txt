{"text": "These are great socks. I wear them all year round, without shoes around the house, on long walks, and while exercising. I particularly like the light hiking crew socks. I occasionally buy more, even though the first ones I bought, year ago, are still in excellent condition after having been washed and dried many times. They are cushioned enough to protect my feet when I'm on them for a long time and they protect them from extreme temperatures as well.I was discussing survival techniques with an Army officer who recommended Thorlo socks for warmth. I bought some for that purpose, for power outages, cold Winter weather, etc., and never have wanted any other kind since. They last for years and I wear them every day, Winter and Summer, usually without shoes since I work from home, sometimes with shoes on 3-mile walks. These are everything I want in a sock. I highly recommend them.As far as size goes, they are more flexible than most, so you probably won't go wrong. Try a pair. I've never wanted any other socks after trying these.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05987077", "1": "0.27716997", "2": "0.092806734", "3": "0.19025992", "4": "0.14872426", "5": "0.11687989", "6": "0.114288494"}}
