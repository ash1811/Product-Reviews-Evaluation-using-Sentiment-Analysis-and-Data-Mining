{"text": "I love acorn slippers that don't have a center seam across the top.  Since I have a wide foot, they always fit.  I would have ordered an additional pair, however; these are not flat on the bottom.  Somehow my foot often seems to roll sideways when I walk.  I think there is something to make the sole soft and it lifts my foot.  Otherwise, they are great to keep my feet warm when I am sitting.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.38423067", "2": "0.10061388", "3": "0.23330283", "4": "0.12163831", "5": "0.097113535", "6": "0.05952119"}}
