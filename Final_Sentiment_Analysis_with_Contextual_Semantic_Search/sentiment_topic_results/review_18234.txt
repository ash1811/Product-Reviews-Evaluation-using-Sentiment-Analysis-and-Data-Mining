{"text": "This is a bargain for the price. 20M water resistance and a nice set of basic functions - nothing fancy here. Granted, it is not a G-Shock - but the watch feels pretty sturdy for the price. The resign band is not the best - but at this price point - I can't complain.The real appeal of this watch is to the nerd in all of us from years ago. The rock-boost style push buttons on the bottom of the watch, the odd shaped display - it brings you back to a simpler digital watch time. No moon phases or tide graphs here. No compass or barometers - just simple time telling in a digital way.A little trivia item - this was the exact model watch Tom Cruise wore in the first Mission Impossible movie. Don't know why they didn't spring for a true G-Shock - but if it was good enough for Ethan Hunt - well than at this price, it is good enough for me as well!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11257306", "1": "0.30667302", "2": "0.12656784", "4": "0.086341314", "5": "0.17671293", "6": "0.18888998"}}
