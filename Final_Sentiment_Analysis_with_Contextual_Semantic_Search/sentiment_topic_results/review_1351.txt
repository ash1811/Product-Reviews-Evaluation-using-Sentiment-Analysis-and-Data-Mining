{"text": "I'm floored by the quality of these shoes. I've tried other sports sandals. Not because I'm athletic but because I like the idea of a multi purpose shoe. Other brands fit so off and tend to have an arch so high that my foot cramps within minutes. I could wear these shoes all day! Super comfortable. Best thing is i feel stable while walking. Doesn't feel like I'm walking on big rubber soles....if you've worn competitor brands you know what I'm talking about. Love these shoes! Love the color! Love the versatility.  I hope they last a long time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04817355", "1": "0.34421632", "2": "0.124454774", "3": "0.2013206", "4": "0.16516243", "6": "0.11427725"}}
