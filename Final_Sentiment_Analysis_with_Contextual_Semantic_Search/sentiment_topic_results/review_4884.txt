{"text": "The watch is very nice for only $25, feels rugged and strong, the details on the dial are quite nice as well.  Excellent wristwatch, I give it 5 stars. It's def. better than a similar Pulsar which I also bought for $50(no knock against Pulsar now they produce good watches)  But this particular Timex model is much better, they outdid Pulsar in my opinion.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07743538", "1": "0.19789824", "2": "0.23211122", "3": "0.069790475", "4": "0.07014484", "5": "0.16304535", "6": "0.18957457"}}
