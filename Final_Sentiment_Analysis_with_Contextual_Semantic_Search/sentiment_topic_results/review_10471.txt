{"text": "I ordered these moccasins for my daughter after searching all over the stores and internet. I sent them to the states, as she was moving there shortly. She went last week and got her moccasins. She says they are so-o-o-o-0 comfortable. Everyone seems to be wearing them now. They are the IN shoe to wear. They have a crepe or rubber sole, so can be worn outside, for many years to come. I am going to get myself a pair as well. I had a pair for over 12 years, that I recently had to throw out,as thy were worn every day and wore out. They are a great investment, even though a bit expensive, as thy are so comfortable, and thy last forever. I would recommend all grown people to buy a pair of moccasins, a good, quality pair like these. They have a lifetime warranty. This seller was great and the moccasins were shipped immediately. They arrived quickly as well. ***** FIVE STARS. A lot of celebs are wearing moccasins as well now. They are in fashion, comfortable and durable. A winner, all around!!!!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19083026", "1": "0.28911573", "2": "0.049913745", "3": "0.22333172", "5": "0.09112081", "6": "0.15316212"}}
