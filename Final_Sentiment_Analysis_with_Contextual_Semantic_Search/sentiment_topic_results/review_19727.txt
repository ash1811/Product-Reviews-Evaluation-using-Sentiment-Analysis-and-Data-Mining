{"text": "Ordinarily, I wouldn't bother to write an Amazon review for sweatpants.  Ordinarily, the occasion simply wouldn't warrant such a measure.  But, I am living large because of these sweatpants.  Coming home to a cold house never felt better, because I know these sweatpants are going to be there, waiting for me.  I get home with cold legs, put these on, and BOOM--my reality is altered.Another reviewer noted that these sweatpants have white pockets.  Yes, they do, but I can forgive that; my keys and wallet prefer the soft white ambiance.  These are powerful sweatpants.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.26288405", "1": "0.2199843", "4": "0.15255778", "5": "0.21450189", "6": "0.14485261"}}
