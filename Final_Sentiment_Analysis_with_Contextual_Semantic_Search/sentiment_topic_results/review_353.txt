{"text": "I bought this for my older brother, He had a red Polo shirt he loved but it was a 2X and much too small on him, And had quite a few holes due to it's age.So when I saw this for 13.00 bucks. I was curious. I know hanes makes good shirts so I decided to take the plunge.As far as I can tell he likes it and it fits much better on him, My brother isn't overweight or anything, But he's a big guy.He's about 6'10 and shirts tend to run small on him.This seems to fit him great.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.6287077", "2": "0.2677757", "5": "0.0316193", "6": "0.06330146"}}
