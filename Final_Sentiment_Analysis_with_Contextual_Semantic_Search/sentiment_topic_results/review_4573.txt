{"text": "I bought two pair of these jeans about 5 years ago at a large retail store and absolutely loved the fit and quality. Both pairs recently gave out and I was unable to find them in the retail outlets. I tried other jeans but the quality and fit just weren't there. So I searched Amazon with the details from the old jeans labels and to my surprise they came up. I ordered one pair &#34;to test the water&#34;. They soon arrived and to my surprise the quality and fit were the same, great!!! I'll be ordering several more pairs from Amazon very soon.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.038804654", "1": "0.45142528", "2": "0.04735545", "3": "0.16820943", "4": "0.09969077", "5": "0.12363278", "6": "0.07088165"}}
