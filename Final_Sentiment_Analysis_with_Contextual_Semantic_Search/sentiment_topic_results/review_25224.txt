{"text": "I have always liked Converse All Stars and when I saw the charcoal color I had to have them. The size is good for me.  I had a blue pair (low tops) last year and they were snug on my right foot because of a previous injury.  Those were a size 8 so I got these in size 9 and now no more pain :) .  They run narrow in my opinion so if your foot is a bit wide I'd size up.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07319248", "1": "0.37065917", "2": "0.079523794", "3": "0.31730127", "4": "0.064205065", "6": "0.09134646"}}
