{"text": "The only reason I gave this a 3 is because the grommet was not put on properly and it has slowly shredded the shoe lace.  The shoes are my favorite shoes to wear adn when I am careful, the shoestring can be manipulated to not damage teh shoestring.  I got an extra pair of laces just in case.  The shoe deserves a 5, but the quuality control needs to look at the grommet, as this was the top right grommet on the left shoe.  This is the first pair of Keens that I have ever had any issue with and would buy these again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11177677", "1": "0.18025248", "2": "0.22570084", "3": "0.114566185", "4": "0.03121332", "5": "0.14667906", "6": "0.18981133"}}
