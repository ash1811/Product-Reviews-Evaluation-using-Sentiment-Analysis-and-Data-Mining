{"text": "I received my first pair of SmartWool socks for Christmas last year. My husband had been wearing the thick kind with boots for years as well as the running socks. When I got my Margarita socks for women, I thought they looked funky and wasn't sure I would wear them. BUT by this year, I asked for more for my birthday so I would have a clean pair at all times. SmartWool costs more but is the most comfortable, serviceable sock I have ever had. They are warm but you don't sweat in them. They are soft, but the fibers are sturdy. The colors are vibrant and they do not fade. They don't slide down into your shoe. I like that they come in two different lengths so if you want a boot sock you have it; if you don't want it that high, you have an option. They feel good and are just plain cute too! I would recommend them to anyone.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16003336", "1": "0.32524058", "2": "0.16369505", "4": "0.08345304", "5": "0.22407158", "6": "0.04089475"}}
