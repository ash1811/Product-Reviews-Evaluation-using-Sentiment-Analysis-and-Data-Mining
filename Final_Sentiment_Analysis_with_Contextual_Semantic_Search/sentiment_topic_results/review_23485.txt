{"text": "There are many variations of Invicta diver's watches. I had read in some reviews about one watch being much smaller than others. By mistake I ordered this one, which is only 38 mm across. When I received it I was surprised at how small the face looked. The circular bezel takes up a lot he space so the face was quite small. I returned it and ordered the larger titanium version. I just received the replacement and am very happy with its size. Invicta watches are great value for money. Just beware of the size before ordering.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16360997", "1": "0.19098365", "2": "0.22800446", "3": "0.2614422", "5": "0.095464796", "6": "0.05755511"}}
