{"text": "I purchased these Reef flip flops to replace my favorite pair of Evolv flip flops (Evolv no longer makes the style I have loved for years).  Overall, these fit well and are very comfortable.  The bottle opener in the bottom of the shoe is a novelty but I don't actually use it (who wants to walk all over and then put your drink on the bottom of your shoe?!)  I suppose if I were stranded on a beach with a six pack and no way to open it, I might reconsider the usefulness of this feature though.I would recommend these shoes, however I don't recommend using the bottle opener unless you just wear these around your house!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.047580883", "1": "0.26613215", "2": "0.25222367", "3": "0.062166397", "4": "0.05513053", "5": "0.2785414", "6": "0.03822502"}}
