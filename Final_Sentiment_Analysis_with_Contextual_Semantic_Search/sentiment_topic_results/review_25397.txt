{"text": "This  bag is a nice bag for those who are looking for bigger things. Despite the dimensions given of the product, when it did arrive I found it to be too big and it did not fit my purpose. I ended up selling it (just after opening it up) to a friend who wanted a tote bag for her kids stuff when travelling around the place.
