{"text": "After getting some blisters on a ruck, I began my search for the perfect pair of boot socks for military use.I've owned Rocky S2V's, Fox River's, Thorlo combat, Wigwam combat, and Smartwool.The Thorlo socks by far offered the most cushion. In fact, they're so thick, they increase my shoe size another half size, both for the running and boot pairs that I own, which can make space tighter. I liked the Thorlos until I found the Smartwools. The smartwools are just slightly thinner, don't bunch up as much and perform a lot better in decreasing sweat. I now only wear smartwool PHD medium cushioned socks, and I'll wear a coolmax liner on longer rucks.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09277704", "1": "0.1401751", "2": "0.14300317", "3": "0.17550491", "4": "0.1519633", "5": "0.1482818", "6": "0.14829469"}}
