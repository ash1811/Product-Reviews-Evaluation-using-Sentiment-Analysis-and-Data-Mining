{"text": "This is the only sports bra I've ever found which works in my size (usually a 40G, but a 42F in this bra).  People should note that this bra is hard and scratchy when first opened but it softens up nicely when washed (and yes, dry it in the drier the first time to really soften it up).  This is the only non-underwire I've worn which keeps my breasts uplifted all day long, but it can chafe under the breasts when worn all day if you are very active and sweaty.  The shape is a bit on the pointy side but I think it still gives a youthful silhouette under clothes.  I've worn it under clothes to work as well as to hike and work out in. Like all glamorise bras, the cups are generously sized, so if you are between cup sizes, go down (at least in the F-G cup size range).  The band is really small in this bra (to get the \"sports bra\" ultra-tight fit, I guess), so I recommend sizing up one band size and down one cup size to get a good fit.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06624994", "1": "0.10020535", "2": "0.08228996", "3": "0.35864735", "4": "0.070205264", "5": "0.15993777", "6": "0.16246437"}}
