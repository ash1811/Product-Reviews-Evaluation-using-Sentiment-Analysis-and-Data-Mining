{"text": "These shoes are beautiful and comfortable. I usually wear a 9 1/2 so that's what I ordered and they fit perfectly. Keep in mind....if you buy the red ones they transfer color like crazy!  They make your socks red and then if you put on a different pair of shoes the color will come off those socks and stain the insides of the other shoes.  They even come with a warning inside the box that says the color will transfer easily. I wouldn't buy the red again but they are gorgeous.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.041335452", "1": "0.46106997", "2": "0.13506514", "4": "0.0704098", "5": "0.15244941", "6": "0.13654192"}}
