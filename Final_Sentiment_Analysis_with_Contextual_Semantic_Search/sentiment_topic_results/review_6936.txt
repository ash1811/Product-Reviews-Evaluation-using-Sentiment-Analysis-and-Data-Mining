{"text": "I have been buying Carhartt work wear for my husband for over 20 years. I have always been happy with their quality. These  tees are cut so thin that they were tight on my 6'2&#34; hubby who weighs 160 pounds. I bought the Medium because that is the size he always wears in Carhartt. Unfortunately, I was expecting the same quality as other products that I have purchased from them. I washed them before he wore them so I ended up throwing them out! I will be looking for another work clothes manufacturer. The muscle tees are also cut too thin.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.095542535", "1": "0.49527374", "2": "0.07907721", "3": "0.08225932", "4": "0.11191646", "5": "0.13287896"}}
