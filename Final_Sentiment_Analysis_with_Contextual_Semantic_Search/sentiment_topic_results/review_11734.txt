{"text": "I have been buying and using these shoes for years and years, and the quality has always been great. I use them for gardening, and then swimming right after (I do both every single day) and they hold up to both. They are great traction and protection in the garden, and they are great for swimming laps and pushing off from flip turns.I usually wear a 6.5 in women's shoes and a 6 in these shoes fits fine.My issue is this: for the last several months, I have been going through these shoes like crazy. With daily use, I'm having to buy a new pair every month- either the sole gets holes in it, or the top of the shoes rips/stretches so it doesn't fit anymore. Nothing has changed about the conditions or usage (same pool, same garden surface, same amount of wear) but apparently the quality of these shoes has gone REALLY downhill. They just aren't as durable. But they are comfy and they protect my feet, so I keep buying them- I haven't found a shoe that fits as great.The other issue, and this has always been a problem- the innersole of the shoe slips. It's firmly in place when the show arrives, but after a few wears it pulls up from the bottom of the shoe and \"floats around\" as you walk/swim/etc. It's a pain in the neck. But, again, because of the fit of these shoes, I put up with it.However, I'm definitely on the search for a better shoe- if I can find one with similar fit, nice thick grippy sole, and as lightweight, I would switch in a heartbeat.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10298785", "1": "0.20706062", "2": "0.19064942", "3": "0.17185394", "4": "0.08075194", "5": "0.2443866"}}
