{"text": "These shoes are the best shoes I have bought in a long time! Fit is great, they are so incredibly comfortable, and lightweight with good traction! I needed some walking shoes that could hold up to the winter ice and snow, and these are perfect for my needs! I read the reviews from others who purchased these shoes who have health problems that affect their legs, which I relate to, and am glad I followed their recommendation of these shoes! I would give them more than five stars if I could.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.32680506", "2": "0.2805511", "3": "0.12037339", "5": "0.22733864", "6": "0.038423322"}}
