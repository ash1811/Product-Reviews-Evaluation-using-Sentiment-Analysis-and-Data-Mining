{"text": "I hate purchasing my hosiery in the store as I rarely can find a brand that fits me well in a plus size. This is a high-quality hosiery that fits very well and is very comfortable. The design is such that the probability of splitting the seam is minimized (some of you know what I mean), and it doesn't appear to be easily prone to runs. The color is also true to description. Will definitely purchase this again;  in fact, this just may become my exclusive hosiery of choice.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07028809", "1": "0.34030277", "3": "0.32972214", "4": "0.1850452", "6": "0.067809954"}}
