{"text": "I was wary when I bought this.  Bras rarely fit well and look good.  This one does both and is comfortable, right from the start.  It has a smooth finish, unlike the other bra I also bought, so it looks good under silk and fabrics that would otherwise reveal texture.  I just ordered it in tan too.  One thing I don't like;  the T back means the shoulder straps extend closer to the neck than other bras and are visible with some of my tops.  That's a small concern compared to how easy it is to put on, how well it feels, how well it holds everything in place, and how good it looks.  Also, way less expensive than bras at Nordstroms!  I should add one thing:  I use Dimrs from Amazon to hide protruding nipples.  I have to use them with this bra, but I have to use them with every bra I wear.  So I don't count this again this bra.  If you don't want nipples showing, I still highly recommend this bra.  Try out the other product with it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08499258", "1": "0.30749905", "2": "0.12825584", "3": "0.21808796", "4": "0.114991404", "6": "0.14393122"}}
