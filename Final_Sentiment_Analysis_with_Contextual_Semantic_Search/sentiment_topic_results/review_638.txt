{"text": "The quality of Wrangler Jeans has always been tops, and nothing has changed. They are ruggerd in capital letters.  Also being Wranglers, they have 100% 'street cred'. I also like Levis, but at 40% less, it is hard not to go with these Wranglers. They are certainly not inferior in any way - perhaps superior in some!  I like the additional belt loops in the front.Fit is a difficult one.  It depends on your body type.  I can say these fit me well, but that is meaningless unless we share the same body shape.  So I will just say this: These jeans fit great if you are big-built and 'somewhat well padded', i.e. carrying a few pounds over.  They will be baggy for you if you are a Slim Jim looking for skin tight jeans.  But they will be tight if you are more than a little overweight.  You know if you are fat, whatever you like to tell other people!  If so, go for the Comfort Fit.  I have tried both.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.095238626", "1": "0.20502578", "2": "0.17647722", "3": "0.06442596", "4": "0.17339385", "5": "0.074573494", "6": "0.2108651"}}
