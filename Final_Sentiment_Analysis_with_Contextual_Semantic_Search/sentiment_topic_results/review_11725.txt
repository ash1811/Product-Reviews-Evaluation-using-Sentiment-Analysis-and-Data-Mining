{"text": "These are such a great size, are nice and shiny, and have a good weight to them.  I'm super happy with this purchase.  However, the backs are completely useless.  They just slide on and off, up and down the post--there is no catch whatsoever.  So I'm disappointed that I'm going to have to spend the time, money and effort to pick up replacement backs, but I expected this based on some of the other reviews.  So don't hesitate to buy these since they are great quality and a good value, but do plan to replace the backs before you wear them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.42236516", "2": "0.20793805", "3": "0.1427919", "5": "0.20062496", "6": "0.02015831"}}
