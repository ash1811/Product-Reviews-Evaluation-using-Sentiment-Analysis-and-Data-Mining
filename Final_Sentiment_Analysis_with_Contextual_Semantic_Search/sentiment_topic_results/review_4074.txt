{"text": "Snug fit may not be what you are looking for in most things on your feet, with the possible exception of ski boots. But with these, fit is critical. What good is a loose fit that lets water in? Kind of defeats the purpose.  The elasticity is strong enough it will put pressure on your foot over time (I forgot to take them off one day, and by noon or so it made my feet a bit sore). But they aren't made for long-term wear. And being snug means they are doing their job.  I read other reviews to help me with sizing. The front (toe area) is squared off a bit, so they may cause issues with shoes that have more pointed toes. Other than that, you shouldn't have a problem. I found them true to size.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.26467887", "2": "0.16144796", "3": "0.20826404", "4": "0.12631945", "5": "0.09446003", "6": "0.14238608"}}
