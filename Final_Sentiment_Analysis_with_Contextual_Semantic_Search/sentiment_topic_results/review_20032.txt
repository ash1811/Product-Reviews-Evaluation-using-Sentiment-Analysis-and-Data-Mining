{"text": "This pack is probably not for everyone, but I love mine.  I take the train to work and don't usually travel light.  It holds my laptop, a couple of phones and chargers, several folders, newspaper, magazines, lunch bag, umbrella, general office supplies, etc. etc.  Very sturdy as well.  It has a decent mesh pocket for beverages that holds them quite securely.  There a number of compartments so that you can keep all of this stuff organized reasonably well.  And it is very sturdy.  I can't imagine that many of the packs I've seen that cost twice as much or more are any better.  I bought another for my nephew who needs a laptop bag as he heads off to college and he loves his as well.  You may not like it however if you don't cart around a lot of stuff or if the availability of too many zippered compartments make you forget where you've stored things.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13077264", "1": "0.39983538", "2": "0.064559095", "3": "0.13743277", "4": "0.14507459", "5": "0.050512955", "6": "0.07181256"}}
