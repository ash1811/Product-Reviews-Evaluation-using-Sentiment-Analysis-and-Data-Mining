{"text": "Pros: beautiful and funky for a cheap boot. Live them! Complaints all the time.I have a 13\" calf and rarely can find a boot that doesn't look like I'm swimming in them.Cons: first pair I got had a warped heel support and had to be returned. However my next pair showed up fast.I have high arches so the instep was really tight, nothing a couple of wearing a didn't cure. I have arch supports in them now and they are fine.These fit like narrow sized shoe. If you lean towards the upper size of a medium fit, these are going to be supper tight. I would also recommend a half size increase. Te toe box isn't small, but it is a but narrow. That extra half size gives you better wiggle room.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.33140412", "2": "0.08344084", "3": "0.2510427", "4": "0.13663489", "5": "0.050767783", "6": "0.14460501"}}
