{"text": "This item is a cheap knock off of a US military Jeep Hat.  The real hat is made in the US to a military specification by a military contractor.  Don't bother with this garbage and buy the real thing.  They only come in black or drab green, made of 100% wool.  They're warm as hell.  If they are good enough for our military, they're good enough for you.  My local army / navy store sells them for $6.99 and that's for the real thing.  These seem like a first class POS judging from the other reviews.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17527999", "1": "0.22180319", "2": "0.19035937", "3": "0.16876347", "4": "0.11215477", "6": "0.12898535"}}
