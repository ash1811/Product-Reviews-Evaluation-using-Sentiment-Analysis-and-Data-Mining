{"text": "I am not quit 5 foot five.  These pants are too short for me if I pull them to the waste.  Surprising they are so short.  Also found one defect in the sewing near the product.  I put them on and wore them because I needed them so can't consider returning them.  The rest of the pants are true to fit, like the three strip shorts, just not long enough.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13088155", "1": "0.16901049", "2": "0.11122075", "3": "0.14915861", "4": "0.08843269", "5": "0.14653113", "6": "0.20476475"}}
