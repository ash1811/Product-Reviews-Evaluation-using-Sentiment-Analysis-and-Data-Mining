{"text": "I ordered this bra to wear under T-shirts and tank tops this summer. I was looking for something that was supportive, smoothing and wouldn't 'show through' on cool evenings (if you know what I mean). I'm 5'6 and 140 lbs. I ordered my usual size 34D. Let me start by saying that it is truly a beautiful bra. I LOVED that it had three hooks and eyes in the back...something you don't usually find on a 34D. It was very supportive...but perhaps a bit too supportive. I felt like it was minimizing my girls. I also felt that they didn't look rounded, but rather the cups forced them into a sort of cone shape. We aren't talking Madonna Bra here, but it was reminiscent of something you'd see in a Mad Men era look. Not really my thing. I also thought the back band was a bit scratchy and that the underwire came up a bit high on the sides. I don't carry much underarm flab but that could be an issue if someone looking to purchase did. I had it on for about 20 min. and couldn't wait to take it off. Way too smooshed into the cups and way to scratchy on my back. Sadly, this beautiful bra is going back.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.035976615", "1": "0.2679631", "2": "0.14832516", "3": "0.20730402", "4": "0.16701095", "5": "0.09400754", "6": "0.0794126"}}
