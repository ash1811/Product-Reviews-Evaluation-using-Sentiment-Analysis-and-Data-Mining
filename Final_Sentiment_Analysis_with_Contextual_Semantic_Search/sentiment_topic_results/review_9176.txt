{"text": "My teen son bought these for me at Christmas because of the affordable price. I returned them mainly due to them seeming to be at least 2 sizes smaller than labeled, but there were also a couple other issues. First, the bottom was extremely slippery (pun intended). Maybe this would improve with wear (like outside on concrete), but I nearly killed myself a couple of times on our tile floor. Second, the tag for the slippers sits squarely in the middle of where your foot sits inside the shoe. I could feel it clearly, even with socks on. I would have needed to cut this tag out if I had not returned them due to the size problem.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.105706744", "1": "0.19243127", "2": "0.11985463", "3": "0.26401702", "4": "0.09887541", "5": "0.19151022", "6": "0.027604708"}}
