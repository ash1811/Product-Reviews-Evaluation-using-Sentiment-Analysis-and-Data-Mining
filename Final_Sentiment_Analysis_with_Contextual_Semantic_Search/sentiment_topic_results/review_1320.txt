{"text": "If you have gigantic toes then these are for you.I love Keens for the most part, I hoped I'd love the shoes.  I ordered them online-- and I think I probably just got the wrong type of Keens.  I returned them.  They felt like hard plastic inside, and I had a good idea I'd hate 'em wet.  They'd be slippery inside with no good way to get a grip-- of course they'll dry quickly, but they felt so so slippery and like very hard cheap plastic inside.  I didn't like it at all.  The toe area fit pretty much like how the picture looks-- it was huge and I felt like I was wearing clown shoes.  Maybe you get use to it.  I dunno ;)  Not for me-- the toe area felt bizarre, the inside felt weird-- just all around felt off.  Loved my Tevas and got use to those, so I think it might just be the shoe and my personal preference (?)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.076136306", "1": "0.2505821", "2": "0.22992857", "3": "0.14703456", "4": "0.14885458", "5": "0.05926601", "6": "0.08819782"}}
