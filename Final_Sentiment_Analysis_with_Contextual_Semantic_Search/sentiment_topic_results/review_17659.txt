{"text": "Among all the bulky and expensive watches out there, I was so happy to find the retro casios from my childhood. This watch is waterproof, slim, precise and has light and the basic functions. I have the brown one too, and switch by the mood. As others have written, the case is chromed plastic, not steel. however, the chrome coating is thick and the watch is quite durable. Further, it is so light it is a pleasure to wear.I couldn't imagine wearing another watch ever again. Highly recommended.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16007598", "1": "0.22786707", "2": "0.2517496", "3": "0.050303753", "4": "0.12856594", "5": "0.07229172", "6": "0.10914595"}}
