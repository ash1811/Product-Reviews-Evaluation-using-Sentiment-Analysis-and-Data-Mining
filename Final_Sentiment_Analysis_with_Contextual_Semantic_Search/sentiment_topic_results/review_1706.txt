{"text": "I thought I would be a wireless* strapless bra, but I found out that there some kind of hard things on the bottom of the cups. Not that it was uncomfortable....but I didn't expect there to be hard things under the cups. Gives great support but the tops of the bra seems to just to be kinda open and it kinda sems to hang around there. Wish it would be top of the bra would be closer/tighter to the top of my chest....Gives good support, but if it doesnt stick to my chest and only be tight around the bottom, it isnt the one for me....Oh well I have yet to find that one great strapless bra....", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13186434", "1": "0.20291378", "2": "0.10389574", "3": "0.3860991", "5": "0.17011519"}}
