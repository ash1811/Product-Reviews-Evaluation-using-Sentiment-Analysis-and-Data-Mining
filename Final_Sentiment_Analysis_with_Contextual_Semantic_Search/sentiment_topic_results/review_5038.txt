{"text": "I purchased these sandals because of my past experience with Birkenstocks, in particular Arizonas.  Birkenstocks are well worth the money spent, and Amazon offers them at a discounted price.  Unfortunately, the first pair I received was damaged.  However, I contacted Amazon, and actions to resolve this issue were initiated immediately.  I received the new pair within a few days, and then I shipped the first pair back using the supplied shipping labels.  I also received a confirmation email when Amazon received the return, and therefore I am pleased with the outcome.  I do feel the product should have been inspected, for with the damage that was there, it was evident that these had previously been returned.  Overall, though, I would recommend purchasing through Amazon, and the shoes are a great purchase, as expected!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.3015234", "1": "0.08581208", "2": "0.055800878", "3": "0.124489106", "4": "0.16217734", "5": "0.20935646", "6": "0.06084074"}}
