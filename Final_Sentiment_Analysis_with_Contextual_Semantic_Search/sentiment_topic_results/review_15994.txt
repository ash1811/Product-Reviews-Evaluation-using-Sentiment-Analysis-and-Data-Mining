{"text": "My sister turned me on to reef's years ago, but it's since been years since I've bought a pair. I ran across these on Amazon and didn't think twice about buying them! I am pleased with my purchase and it arrived in a timely manner. They are pretty true to size, but maybe just a hair big. I wear a size 7. While these fit pretty well, I wouldn't be upset if they were a half size smaller. Again, the most comfortable flip-flop you can buy... get them!! ;)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.064624", "1": "0.38754424", "3": "0.25315934", "4": "0.084460646", "5": "0.12165011", "6": "0.08544578"}}
