{"text": "I've worn Reebok Women's Freestyle Hi Tops for years, when I needed new ones recently, I went to several local stores at the mall only to find they didn't haven any and &#34;hadn't seen them in a while&#34;. So, went to trusty Amazon.com and found them with ease. These are the only shoes I can wear that don't hurt my feet and that have good ankle support. The fit is great, they don't wear out. Good quality workmanship.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10767133", "1": "0.19074333", "2": "0.077928275", "3": "0.2075425", "4": "0.20535694", "5": "0.069144905", "6": "0.14161274"}}
