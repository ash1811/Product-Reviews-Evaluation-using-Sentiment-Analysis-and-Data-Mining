{"text": "This wallet is exactly what I wanted.  I didn't want one that zipped around, or had zip pockets for cash.  This has a snap close where you put your paper/coin money, and seems very secure.  It has lots of slots for credit cards, and pockets inside for other items. There's also a place for your removable checkbook.  I chose the red one, which is a nice color, and the leather is really very nice.  Mundi is a good name, and I'm glad they're still around!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.053111754", "1": "0.3075918", "2": "0.2710018", "3": "0.10208248", "4": "0.22143528", "6": "0.041649155"}}
