{"text": "I had recently purchased a brown pair of the Ecco SeaWalker while in California.  I liked them so much I decided to get a black pair, found them on Amazon.com and ordered them.  They are very comfortable and can be worn from casual to dress up casual.  I have worn Ecco's for years so know the quality is excellent.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.046376698", "1": "0.45266408", "2": "0.049932677", "3": "0.19409183", "5": "0.04694426", "6": "0.20505273"}}
