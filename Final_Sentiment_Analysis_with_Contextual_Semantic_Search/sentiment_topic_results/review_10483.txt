{"text": "This is my fifth Ugg dakota slipper. (I have a black, a tan, a silver and a grey and I wanted a red pair. ) I  could not find a red one in a size 6 at my favorite retailer.  These slippers are so comforable, I wear them everywhere even at work. I love that my feet are  soft and cozy when I wear them  Lucky for me, Amazon had the right size and the specific red that I wanted and they were delivered on time as promised.Thank you Amazon.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10935275", "1": "0.26680535", "3": "0.1568595", "4": "0.23261777", "5": "0.059188172", "6": "0.17192231"}}
