{"text": "I bought one of these shirts in a size larger than I normally wear thinking it would be loose and cool for working in the summer heat.  It's a really good quality shirt but it's pretty huge on me.  I don't mind since it will be a beater shirt and the huge size probably will help with cooing airflow in the heat and humidity.  I'm ordering another in my regular size because I like it so much and I like a loose fit anyway.If you order it, be aware of the sizing.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.05450038", "1": "0.37257722", "2": "0.08547851", "3": "0.3474273", "4": "0.06932094", "6": "0.06776872"}}
