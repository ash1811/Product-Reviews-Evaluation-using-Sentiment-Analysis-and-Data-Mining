{"text": "I have a high arch and even I got plantar fasciitis for a few days when I switched from a regular insole to these.  But that's just your body readapting and it's why God gave you the ability to stretch your calf muscle!  So heed the warning that lot of people have given, but don't let it be the reason that you don't buy these.  If you have a medium to high arch, these are the insoles that Superfeet intended for you!These insoles are, hands down, an absolute life saver.  I suffer from Compartment Pressure Syndrome so badly that it hurts to walk from the train to my office sometimes!  I'd been wearing Superfeet in my running shoes and decided to buy a pair for my dress shoes and they fit just fine (switching them back and forth between shoes just got tiresome).I highly recommend Superfeet!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09340391", "1": "0.17150632", "2": "0.19061904", "3": "0.14042915", "4": "0.194711", "5": "0.11178311", "6": "0.09754746"}}
