{"text": "This watch looks really slick and I liked it a lot. However, there are problems. The surface scratches very very easily. I once had a minor incident whereby another persons jade just lightly touched my watch, so trivial I didn't think anything would scratch. When I had a look, I had a scratch on the watch.Another problem is with the resin strap. It cracked after a year usage and it broke within less than 2yr usage. Now I can't wear it. Not worth buying the strap (can't use non propriety ones).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16468354", "1": "0.19314002", "2": "0.27831542", "3": "0.09987765", "4": "0.118977666", "6": "0.14219345"}}
