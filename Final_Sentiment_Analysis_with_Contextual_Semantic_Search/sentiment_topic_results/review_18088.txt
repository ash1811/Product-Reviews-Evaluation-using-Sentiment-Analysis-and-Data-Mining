{"text": "I bought this watch because I had a fancy watch already but wanted something casual to wear around the house or out running errands. I wind up needing to wash my hands frequently throughout the day so it also needed to be water proof. This little black watch delivers. It's simple yet stylish and looks like it costs more than it did.I've had it a while now and have worn it pretty extensively. Around the house, during exercise, in the shower, while washing my hands -- and it still keeps perfect time.Often watch bands are much too large for my delicate wrists even on the last hole, but not true with this watch! It is a perfect fit. It can also be made to fit a fairly large sized female wrist by using the first hole, though if you have lumberjack man-wrists or something this watch probably isn't for you.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.041022852", "1": "0.20845106", "2": "0.18785651", "3": "0.15565094", "4": "0.09682423", "5": "0.15846474", "6": "0.15172964"}}
