{"text": "This is a really fine watch with many features. I'm surprised that the other reviewers didn't realize you have to REMOVE the watch from your wrist to get an accurate temperature reading. I bought this for my son. He sets it outside on the deck for a few minutes to get the temp. He's worn it swimming, showering, and other sports activities with no issues. Keeps really good time. Has a nice feel to it -- quality weight, not cheap or flimsy. I had one link removed by a jeweler. Also, he loves the digital and analog read-outs. They have stayed perfectly in synch.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.17758083", "2": "0.16817999", "3": "0.21344322", "4": "0.09090248", "5": "0.2098792", "6": "0.1373627"}}
