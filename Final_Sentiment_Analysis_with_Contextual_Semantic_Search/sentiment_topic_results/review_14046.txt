{"text": "I bought a used one of these really cheap at a pawnshop. The rubber strap was broken in half and the shop owner just wanted to get rid of it I guess. The watch itself was near perfect with no scratches on the crystal and the case only had very minor scuffing..Contrary to and earlier review here, you can change the band very easily yourself..It is just held in place with machine screws on the back of the case..I believe I purchased the band here on Amazon..It wasn't cheap but now I have one of these big ,beautiful watches that looks new !!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06787849", "1": "0.28780007", "2": "0.22637354", "3": "0.07049822", "4": "0.29655665", "6": "0.047969803"}}
