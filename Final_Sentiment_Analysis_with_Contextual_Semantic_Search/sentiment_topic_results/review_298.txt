{"text": "I got two of these shirts with a company logo about 6 years ago and wore it only in the house - knockabout.  It's still in great condition.  I bought 5 of the white and 5 of the black and couldn't be happier.  They wash well, last a long time and are soft - so you can wear them all day - and to sleep in.  Absolutely fantastic product.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.050698176", "1": "0.09798263", "2": "0.11563241", "3": "0.15858655", "5": "0.4765796", "6": "0.09631098"}}
