{"text": "Great quality jean. I bought a couple colors, but will only do one review. The jean is bigger in the legs and behind than 501 and 505. If you are getting older or more muscular from workouts this jean is a winner. Quality excellent and price what you would find at department store sale.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06357036", "1": "0.41640472", "2": "0.1519299", "3": "0.067952104", "4": "0.1472853", "5": "0.14792511"}}
