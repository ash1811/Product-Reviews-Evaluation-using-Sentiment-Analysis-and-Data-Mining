{"text": "I have tried a number of these pants over the past few weeks.  I have been looking for a durable pair of pants to use for work around the house.  But I wanted a pair of pants I could keep on when stepping out for lunch or picking up the kids.  These pants fit well, have great pockets .... just perfect.  I even played a quick game of hockey with my son & fell in the street.  The pants held up great with no rips or tears.  I'm going back to buy more soon.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.052979037", "1": "0.567835", "2": "0.06283074", "3": "0.11641513", "4": "0.06769279", "5": "0.0991427", "6": "0.03310463"}}
