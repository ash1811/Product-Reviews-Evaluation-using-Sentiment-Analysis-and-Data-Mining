{"text": "I bought this bag to carry my Microsoft Surface RT.  The Surface (with touch cover) fits perfectly, with room for a medium-sized book and some paperwork.  The outer pockets are small, but large enough to hold a power adapters, a set of ear-buds and a small mouse or other small peripheral.  The outer pockets seal with Velcro flaps and are pretty secure.  The large pocket has a buckle that's not as secure as I would like, but not bad.  It has never opened unexpectedly on me, but seems like it might and I check it regularly.Note that this bag has NO PADDING of any kind to protect electronics, so weigh that factor when considering it.  I took a pad out of another computer bag and put it in the bottom of this bag, just in case I get careless with setting it down on a hard surface.  I'm satisfied with that, but again, factor this in carefully if you plan on carrying electronics of any kind.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08151638", "1": "0.34799847", "2": "0.077402145", "3": "0.1649878", "4": "0.090046085", "5": "0.14779168", "6": "0.090257384"}}
