{"text": "I saw these boots at Sears and was surprised how expensive they were.  Found them on Amazon for almost $80 less!  I usually wear a 9.5, but the reviews stated that these run a half size big.  So I ordered them in 9.  They were slightly small (my toe was just at the end of the toe box).  But I immediately rubbed them with mink oil and wore them about.  The mink oil softened the leather and they stretched just right.  They are very comfortable and seem well-made.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07373996", "1": "0.2861646", "2": "0.086193405", "3": "0.11440749", "4": "0.13945203", "5": "0.16225867", "6": "0.13778387"}}
