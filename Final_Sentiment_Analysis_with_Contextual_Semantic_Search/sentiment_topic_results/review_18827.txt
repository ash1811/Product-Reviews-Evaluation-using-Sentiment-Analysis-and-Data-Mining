{"text": "This is the second Wenger watch that I have owned and I cannot say enough good things about the quality and craftsmanship that goes in to their watches. I had previously owned theWenger Swiss Military Men's 72917 Classic Field Black Dial Brown Leather Military Watchbut I lost it on a trip. Needless to say, I wanted another Wenger to replace it only this time I opted for the dial white face, instead of black. Purely a personal preference. And I am definitely not disappointed. Upon receiving the watch, I inspected it for any small little things that may be imperfections in production and I found none.The leather strap is durable, feels good on my wrist, and is quite comfortable. Even though it is a larger watch, I hardly notice that I am wearing it. And, aside from that, I rather like the design Wenger put into the strap.The crystal is perfect. Viewing the dial is very easy. There is no distortion which I have encountered with some other brands, ie sometimes the viewing angle does not allow for a crystal-clear view. Not on the Wenger. From any angle it is crystal clear. The black outline on the minute and hour hands (along with the red second hand) are very visible.The crown, like my earlier one, is a bit stiff but not overly so. I would much rather have it that way than too loose. With some other brands I have discovered that the crown, due to being somewhat loose, had popped out and my timepiece was no longer keeping time. Or it came loose, the time changed, and the crown went back, but the time was way off. A tighter fitting crown protects that from occurring.Speaking of keeping time, the 72900 is keeping perfectly in synch with my smart phone. It does not seem to miss a minute.This is a sturdy, well-built and accurate timepiece. Definitely highly recommended!(Update Sept 18, 2013: Going on two years now and it is still keeping totally accurate time. I have accidently grazed the crystal on some fairly rough surfaces but there is no permanent damage, it is still clear. The band still looks new, though there is that indentation where the latch and buckle meet the band - but that happens to any leather strap. I remain perfectly happy with this timepiece.)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.0829516", "1": "0.17416748", "2": "0.23990119", "3": "0.21398209", "4": "0.075531736", "5": "0.061767455", "6": "0.15169843"}}
