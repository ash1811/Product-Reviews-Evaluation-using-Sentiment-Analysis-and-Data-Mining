{"text": "These socks didn't even get me through a winter. I paid $20 for socks that after once a week wear over 3 months developed holes in both heels. I don't pay $20 for a pair of socks that end up pilling and falling apart after just a few uses. SmartWool USED to be a great brand, but not anymore.
