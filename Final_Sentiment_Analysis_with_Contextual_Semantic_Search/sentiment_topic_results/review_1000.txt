{"text": "This is my third pair of the Clark's desert boots. I own the beeswax and oakwood but this time I purchased the sand suede. Amazon has it for $74 with free 2 day shipping and no tax which is much cheaper than anywhere else. The shoes themselves are excellent quality and extremely comfortable. I wear a 9 in Nike's but for this I wear a 7.5. At first they may feel a little narrow, but they break in very quickly. I don't recommend tying these shoes too tight. Buy a size that you can wear and have them not slip off while keeping the shoelaces kind of loose and that's how you are supposed to have these on. Like with all suede shoes, put some protection on it before use.Out of all the colors, I think I like sand suede the best. It seems to look great with almost everything. I find that I have to go up a half size in the beeswax or other leather ones, because they have less give and therefore fit a bit tighter especially cause my feet are semi wide.Buy these shoes if you are on the fence, these are the pair you will never regret even if you spend full retail price of $110.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09501899", "1": "0.31929705", "2": "0.1624216", "3": "0.23745616", "4": "0.10077392", "6": "0.08247226"}}
