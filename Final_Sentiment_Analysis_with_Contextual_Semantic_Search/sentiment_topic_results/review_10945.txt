{"text": "Perfect for every outfit or dress that's bare in any way which would look awkward with a regular bra (strapless, spaghetti strap, one-shoulder, low back). These stick on securely & are smoothly contoured not to be lumpy or show through clingy fabrics. They allow discreet freedom in the summer, although expect that increased sweating will occur in the cups with extended wear. I love that they are washable, making them long lasting & durable. When the sticky silicone finally gets too gunky & loses its effective stickiness, I use a kitchen scrub sponge to *gently* scrub off the residue with gentle soap & drip-dry - full stickiness is renewed. The weightless foam material makes it very comfortable to wear & as long as it stays in place I forget that I'm wearing a bra.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.087208584", "1": "0.17305243", "2": "0.12920631", "3": "0.2335734", "4": "0.06328691", "5": "0.15740876", "6": "0.1562636"}}
