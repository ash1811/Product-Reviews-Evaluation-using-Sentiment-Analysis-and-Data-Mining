{"text": "This bra is pretty.  Good color to hide under white shirts, etc..  It definitely holds up my D's well - - but maybe too much?  When I put it on I feel as though I am wearing a suit of armor.  It is definitely the biggest bra I have ever had.  My husband isn't that crazy about it.  No sex appeal.Under a shirt my girls are way up high and pointing at you.  Makes me feel too &#34;in your face&#34; with my girls.The cups do wrinkle across the top as others said.  The wrinkling is slight and right across the center.  A smaller cup would be too small.A great thing - this bra does NOT cause underarm fat bulges!!  Love that!I just need to find the right style for me.So, I am having to return it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07660221", "1": "0.1963374", "2": "0.21872863", "3": "0.3502941", "4": "0.057154562", "5": "0.09867926"}}
