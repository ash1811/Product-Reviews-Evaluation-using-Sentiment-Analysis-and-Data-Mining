{"text": "This bra do lift your breast up and tuck your breast in tight. The strap is big enough so it will not dig in your shoulder blade. You have full back and side coverage, which is a plus. The one I don't like about the bra the underneathe part of the bra don't lay flat and roll up under the breast. I do have to keep pulling it down every so often. This bra will surely make you stand up striaght. So all in all, please give  it a try you might just love it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12915696", "1": "0.29844424", "2": "0.09387719", "3": "0.41859978", "6": "0.05340244"}}
