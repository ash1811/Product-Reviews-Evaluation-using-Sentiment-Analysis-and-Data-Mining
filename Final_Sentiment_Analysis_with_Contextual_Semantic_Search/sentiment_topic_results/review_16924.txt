{"text": "I would think that the Carhartt Double front Logger jeans would be extremely durable, given the name brand.  However much to our surprise, these jeans are constantly tearing, whether in the back pocket, front pocket, knee cap etc.  The only good thing is that my husband, who is a licensed plumber, usually gets about 6 months out of each one before they start to tare.  I even used those durable denim patches on them to cover up the holes and they don't last on this denim. Overall, the price is decent...maybe my husband should be more careful?!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.099396735", "1": "0.34324527", "2": "0.14066564", "3": "0.09708203", "4": "0.14882682", "5": "0.12108951", "6": "0.049693972"}}
