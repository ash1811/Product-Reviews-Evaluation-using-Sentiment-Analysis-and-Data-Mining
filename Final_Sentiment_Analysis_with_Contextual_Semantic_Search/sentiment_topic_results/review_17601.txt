{"text": "Quite happy with this watch, not G-shock bulky, slim and rugged looking. Numbers light up, no tiny led which is the deal sealer for me. Haven't gone for a swim with it yet, we will see. Light and comfortable on the wrist. Time and date clearly visible in all light conditions. Seriously, for 20 bucks its a bargain here in Australia. If you have smaller wrist and don't like the massive other casio watches, this one's for you.Ticks all the boxes for me.Update: A year on and still works great, my wife uses it for work eveyday.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18965441", "1": "0.08173852", "2": "0.18833059", "3": "0.11533805", "4": "0.2189573", "5": "0.17297083", "6": "0.033010334"}}
