{"text": "I like this belt. The Jolly Roger theme is very cool. Having been in the military I can say this belt is not as good as issue belts, but then I am not likely to wear this into combat any time soon. This is a good belt to wear casually, which is just what I wanted. It is also inexpensive, great for around the house.I am happy with this neat belt.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11574807", "1": "0.16707174", "2": "0.20864329", "4": "0.13374911", "5": "0.20436785", "6": "0.16580519"}}
