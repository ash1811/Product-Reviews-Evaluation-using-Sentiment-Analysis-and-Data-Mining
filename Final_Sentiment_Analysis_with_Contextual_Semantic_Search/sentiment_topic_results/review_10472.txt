{"text": "They always say uggs run large. so i got a size smaller. not only should i have not gotten a size smaller, but i probably should have went have a size up. this shoe runs uncharacteristically small for Uggs. To make things worse the seller refuses to return if you get them too small. you have to return on your cost and re-order. very unfortunate.Other than that, really fashionable shoe, and very good quality make. i'm sure if they had fit i would have loved them. I'm going to return these and buy the right fitting pair from the ugg website.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18026885", "1": "0.18811364", "2": "0.10041149", "3": "0.36364707", "4": "0.059152626", "6": "0.10580482"}}
