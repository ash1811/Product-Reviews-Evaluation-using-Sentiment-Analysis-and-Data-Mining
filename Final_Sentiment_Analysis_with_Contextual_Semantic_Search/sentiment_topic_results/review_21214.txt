{"text": "Keen shoes are EXTREMELY comfortable out of the box, no doubt, and their style and overall construction is well-suited to a variety of activities: casual wear, work wear, and light hiking. Your taste may vary, but I don't think they look too terribly goofy, either.However, like almost every other make and model of shoe, they are \"throwaway\" items, not meant to be resoled or otherwise repaired. I'm on my second pair and neither has made it past the one-year mark before they started to look ratty, despite my assiduous application of Dr. Marten's Wonder Balsam. My current pair is now on its last legs, the soles fraying badly and held together with Shoe Goo, soon to be relegated to my growing collection of \"yard work\" only footwear, all of which look bad but will endure years of continued use in their diminished capacity.This pattern of consumption is terribly wasteful and not at all in the best interests of either the environment or the American workforce (Keens are of course made in China.)A remedy is at hand: for only fifty or so dollars more (and up,) one can have some very well-made American shoes from one of several manufacturers that can be resoled and will last several times longer than the imports. It's a win for the American economy and, in the long run, for your wallet as well.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1340432", "1": "0.1392011", "2": "0.19321926", "3": "0.11642509", "4": "0.17644422", "5": "0.054116834", "6": "0.18655023"}}
