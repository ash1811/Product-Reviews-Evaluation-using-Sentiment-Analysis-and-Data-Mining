{"text": "I absolutely love this gown.  I bought it just before I gave birth so that I would have something of my own that was comfortable enough to wear in the hospital.  This fit the bill.  It's so silky and comfy and it has a little stretch to it which I needed for breast feeding.  I may just go back and buy several more in various colors!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.4528842", "2": "0.17483851", "3": "0.15765171", "5": "0.11853724", "6": "0.08619722"}}
