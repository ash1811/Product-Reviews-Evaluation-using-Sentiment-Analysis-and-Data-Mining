{"text": "I have never owned a pair of hose like these. I really like the shine and shimmer. Not a big fan of very sheer hose because I have spider vines but never thought about them.  They come pre-shaped (I guess that's what you call it) and I noticed while sitting that they were just a tad loose at the ankle.  But I think that's is typical of this type of nylon, plus I really did mind that at all!Yep... I'll be buying these again.  It's hard to locate nice hose in my size (plus) in the stores.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20973673", "1": "0.12971878", "2": "0.05720421", "3": "0.23495673", "4": "0.103820555", "5": "0.21356155", "6": "0.051001452"}}
