{"text": "Just received in the mail today and currently wearing this 2x shirt.  Fits great and very comfortable.  For the price, I will be putting other camo patterns from this vendor in my wish list.  If it wasn't Christmas I would order another tonight.  Actually ordered this one just to get me to the free shipping amount.  Will order another next time I need a few dollars to get there.  Shirt will be cool enough to protect my arms from sun or bugs or a good layer in cooler temps.  Just right for those late fall cool day.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.059281427", "1": "0.34698734", "2": "0.04856793", "3": "0.0299659", "4": "0.10832683", "5": "0.27270973", "6": "0.13416082"}}
