{"text": "I have a couple of Scrushes at my house. The one with the base is at the entrance that has stone steps, and the one without the base at the entrance that has wood steps. The Scrusher with a base allows you to put one foot on the base to hold it down, while you are cleaning the other shoe. The Scrusher without the base has to screwed down to the deck to stay in place while you are using it. You cannot use this Schrusher (without the base) without attaching it to something because as you clean your boot it will move around with with boot.The Scrusher has brushes on the bottom and the sides so it scrapes the boot from the sides as well as from the bottom. It works well on scraping off garden dirt during the summer as well as snow during the winter. The stiff brushes do a good job cleaning without damaging/scratching the shoe.I owned my Scrushes for 3 years, they stay outside all year round. The only down side is that metal parts began rusting on both of them, so I had to move the free standing Scrusher off the nice stone steps to avoid rusty stains. However the replacement steel base is sold separately so it can be replaced (to find the base search for Scrusher Boot Cleaner Base (Steel Base Only!))I am attaching several photos of my Scrusher, so you can evaluate its condition and the amount of rust yourself.Ali Julia review", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.24202098", "1": "0.16083755", "2": "0.06435192", "3": "0.096350946", "4": "0.07254485", "5": "0.27811837", "6": "0.085775405"}}
