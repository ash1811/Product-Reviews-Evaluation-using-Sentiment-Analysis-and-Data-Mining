{"text": "I ordered these as an anniversary present for my husband, after I heard him comment that his others were wearing out; he had really gotten his money's worth out of those.  I had to remind him of the usual two-week breaking in, and that was o.k.  They did seem just a tad longer than the others, but otherwise fit great.  Amazon's price was also better than any site also, so that encouraged me to go ahead and get them before a possible price increase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10226633", "1": "0.2615303", "2": "0.13566172", "4": "0.23340948", "5": "0.15740597", "6": "0.10612573"}}
