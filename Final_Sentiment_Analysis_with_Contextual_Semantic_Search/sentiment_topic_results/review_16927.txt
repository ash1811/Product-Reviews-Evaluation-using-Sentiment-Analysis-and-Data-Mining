{"text": "I have purchase Carhartt bibs in the past.  They are a good, quality product, and were what I expected....right until I tried them on.  I am 189# and wear a 36&#34; waist pant which are not snug by any means.  I could even get these on. I don't mean they were snug. They didn't remotely fit.  I ordered a pair in 40&#34; waist thinking I would drown or at least be comfortable.  They are roomier, although if I button the top side buttons I better plan on not breathing or bending over.  Sizing is a bit misleading!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08321583", "1": "0.3767915", "2": "0.07013981", "3": "0.084296264", "5": "0.09693286", "6": "0.2857021"}}
