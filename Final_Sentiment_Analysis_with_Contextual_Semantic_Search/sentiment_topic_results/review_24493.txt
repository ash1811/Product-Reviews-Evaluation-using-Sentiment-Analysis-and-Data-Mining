{"text": "I'm a person who tries many shoes and related insoles because I've had many leg, ankle and foot injuries due to an accident.  Therefore, I'm always in search of the most comfortable shoe and insole combination.  Like other reviewers, I don't purchase many shoes with the insoles glued to the shoe.  Am always bringing insoles to stores when I test shoes.  The Superfeet Orange are at the top of my list for casual shoes and boots.Like many, I used to wear the green and have converted to these.  I have high arches, wear a 10.5 shoe and an \"e\" in the Superfeet Orange insoles.  They seem a little too thick for dress shoes, but are good for larger casual shoes (Ecco, in particular), sneakers and boots.  They are best when wearing thick boot socks with boots.  My pain diminishes wearing the Superfeet Orange and that's really all I'm interested in using these for.  I'm happy and will purchase again.  I'm also picky and love these.If you don't have high arches, try the Superfeet Platinum instead of the orante.  The Platinum also work better with dress shoes due to the fact they are thinner.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.033929326", "1": "0.059808705", "2": "0.3312011", "3": "0.15997076", "4": "0.21798567", "5": "0.14812319", "6": "0.04898126"}}
