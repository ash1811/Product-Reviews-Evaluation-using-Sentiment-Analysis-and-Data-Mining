{"text": "I just bought these, have worn and washed once.  So far so good.  they are a little light weight, but I got them to wear under long tops, sweaters and skirts, so that is fine.  they fit very nice.  I have a problem with things being too short from waist to crotch, these fit.  They are also long enough in the leg.  I am happy with them and hope they hold up for a long time!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08944", "1": "0.446902", "2": "0.075585306", "3": "0.17838112", "4": "0.15693013", "6": "0.048662193"}}
