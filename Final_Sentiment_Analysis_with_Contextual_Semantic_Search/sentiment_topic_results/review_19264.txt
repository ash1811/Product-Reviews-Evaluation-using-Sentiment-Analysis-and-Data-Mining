{"text": "After looking for a perfect size wallet at stores, I found this at $16.99 at Amazon.  To tell you the truth I didn't believed, because of the pictures, that this wallet could have enough space.  When finally arrived (quickly with Amazon Prime),  this was a surprise!  Finally all my cards will be in a same place and my coins, my receipts.....I mean  Everything!.  Is not the best quality as leather, but for the price and condition, is for far the best wallet that I have.This wallet also comes with a calculator, as describe in pictures.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12740318", "1": "0.19572121", "2": "0.17510717", "3": "0.16169381", "4": "0.17780966", "5": "0.087529644", "6": "0.074735336"}}
