{"text": "I got these for my boyfriend who usually wears the saggiest of sweats because they have been worn for years and stretched out from repeated wear and washing.  He claims they felt good and were a nice medium weight,  but to me they seemed a bit tight in the upper legs.  The size isn't really the issue, as the waist and hips fit just fine.  Hopefully they will stretch out like the old ones to give a more streamline look. But heck, these are sweats.  He just uses them to work out and stretch, so really not a big issue at this price.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.34466958", "2": "0.12807041", "3": "0.13268183", "4": "0.17028074", "5": "0.17121254", "6": "0.050101828"}}
