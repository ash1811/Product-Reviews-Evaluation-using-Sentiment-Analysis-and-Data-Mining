{"text": "I had a pair of Land's End Plain Toe Oxfords for years and they have been workhorses.  In my casual work environments over the past few years, I wore them almost every day.  The sole on one shoe finally wore out and they don't carry those shoes anymore, so I had to find an Oxford that could replace them.  So far, the Dockers Shelter shoes are doing the job.This is a substantial shoe.  The upper is high-quality and sturdy and the sole is fairly thick - but not too thick as to look chunky.  They are very comfortable and have gel cushioning in the heel for extra comfort.  I highly recommend these shoes as daily wear workhorses.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0292222", "1": "0.17832239", "2": "0.25233138", "3": "0.12283821", "4": "0.124130785", "5": "0.26293066", "6": "0.030224381"}}
