{"text": "I love these shoes.  They were super comfortable from the first wear, and I didn't have any \"breaking in\" period.  No blisters or red marks on my feet.  I love wearing them and feel like they even work on casual Friday.  I ordered a 1/2 size up but I'm not sure it was necessary.  The only downside is I ordered them (late) for a vacation trip and they arrived the day after I left home.  But that was really my fault.I am really enjoying them as an everyday sneaker.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.33768", "1": "0.15934028", "2": "0.14720742", "3": "0.10725038", "4": "0.05066011", "5": "0.11407383", "6": "0.08378799"}}
