{"text": "I'm writing this review to help others with sizing.  I'm a size 8 in women's pants (sometimes 6 if it runs large), 34D bust, and I have a long torso.  The size 12 swimsuit fit just about perfectly.  The conservative cut provides nice coverage (I specifically wanted that). This does cut into the backs of your thighs, and I know that would not be comfortable or flattering on some women who have larger thighs in relation to their butt. I would have liked more bust support as this provides almost none.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.46305314", "2": "0.0502084", "3": "0.23124667", "4": "0.1392482", "6": "0.11083454"}}
