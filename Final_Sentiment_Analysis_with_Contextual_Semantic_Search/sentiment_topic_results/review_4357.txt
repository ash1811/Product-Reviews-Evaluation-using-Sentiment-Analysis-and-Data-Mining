{"text": "I bought these for my son, his size can be hard to find.  They fit perfectly and look nice.  This was a lot easier than running around to a bunch of stores, which is what I had been doing.  He wears a 30&#34; waist and 32&#34; lenghth and all I could find was a few pairs of pleated front pants.  The price was good.
