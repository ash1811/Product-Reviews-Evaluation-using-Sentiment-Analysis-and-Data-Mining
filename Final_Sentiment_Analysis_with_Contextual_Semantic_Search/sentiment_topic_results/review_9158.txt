{"text": "Have used Rockport's for years.  They use to be top of the line for comfort, yet look dressy enough to wear in the office.  Comfort, quality, and value......but something changed.  I bought a brown and black pair of this model.  They are wearing faster than the older models and are NOT as comfortable.  When you notice that you are wearing shoes that is usually a clue that something is not right.  The old Rockports you could put on and walk in all day and never think about your shoes or your feet.  Not so with this stiffer version.  Sadly looks like when these wear out will have to try to find a more comfortable shoe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07673122", "1": "0.44602773", "2": "0.10002848", "3": "0.06359653", "4": "0.19626224", "6": "0.11479246"}}
