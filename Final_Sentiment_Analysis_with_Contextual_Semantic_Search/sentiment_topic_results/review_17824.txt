{"text": "I had this watch for a year, and let me tell you it is the toughest watch I have ever owned.  I put it through camping trips, car repair, oil and paint spills, dropped from a 2 story building.  Got sandwiched between closing doors, hit by car doors and scrapped through a street floor.  And guess what!!  This bad boy is still cooking!!  What a remarkable watch!  So strong and well made.  You buy a G Shock and you have a watch for life.  The only complaint I have about this watch is that it is too bulky, too big for my small wrists.  If you have small wrists, I recommend the Classic 5600 or 6900 series G Shocks.  Which is what I have now and they fit much better on smaller wrists.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05237287", "1": "0.21713427", "2": "0.23476526", "4": "0.28756762", "5": "0.12118477", "6": "0.08465603"}}
