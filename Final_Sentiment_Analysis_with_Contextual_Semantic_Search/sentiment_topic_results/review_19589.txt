{"text": "The band is too tight, and I wore it for weeks in hopes it would stretch out.The outside edge of the underwires are curved too much toward the center of the chest.  This pulls the breast away from the stays, and it does make them look perky but makes one feel so bound it's difficult to breathe.  I had to bend the underwires just to be able to wear the bra.The adjustable straps do not have enough length to adjust for me, so I suffer dig-in, and this is the worst of all.  Every day my shoulders and the tops of my breasts where the straps meet the cups were red from pulling and irritation.The bra simply fits too small.And that lace cami part?  It shows as little bumps through every garment except a Fair Isle sweater.I would have returned it, but it was too late by the time I was finished with trying to make it work.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.099308014", "1": "0.26468468", "2": "0.20087387", "3": "0.300484", "4": "0.05944785", "6": "0.07281066"}}
