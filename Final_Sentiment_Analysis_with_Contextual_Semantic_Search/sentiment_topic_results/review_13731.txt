{"text": "These are amazingly comfortable. I wore them all day while shopping, right out of the box and no soreness or blisters anywhere. I felt like they were made specifically for my feet! I would give these 5 stars but their sizing is off. However, because of all the great people who gave reviews warned about it and said to order a size larger than you wear and I did, they fit perfectly. I have high arches so it is extremely difficult to find any shoe that gives support, I can happily say these do. They are like walking on pillows. The material between the toes is soft there's no rubbing at all. The top of the straps are just to the bottom of your toes, which makes them look like they would be difficult to keep on. It's quite the opposite, I didn't have to tighten my toes, and walked just like I was wearing enclosed shoes. Great for the calves. These are by far the best flip flops I have ever worn and the only ones I will buy in the future! Just remember if you buy, order one size up (if you wear a half size then you will be okay by just going with the next nearest whole size, e.g. 8 1/2 would order a 9).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.107294835", "1": "0.28799272", "2": "0.17837806", "3": "0.15078771", "5": "0.14435889", "6": "0.12871403"}}
