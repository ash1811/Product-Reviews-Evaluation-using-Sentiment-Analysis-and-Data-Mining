{"text": "I saw other women around town wearing these, and bought a pair in black for my girlfriend as a gift. O.M.G. do they look good on her!!! Comfortable, stylish, versatile, durable and sexy - I'm not sure what more you could ask from an item of clothing. She loves them because they're great at the gym, around the house, and in a pinch, with the right shoes and top, can be dressed up nicely enough to wear out and around without feeling like a slob. Very soft, high-quality, nice weight fabric, and very well made.She's 5'-4\" and 110lbs, and the size \"small\" fits her like they were custom made for her, length and everything. We'll be getting more in other colors...Update 3/1/10: We're up to 3 pairs in 3 different colors, and they're all awesome. They look, fit, feel, and perform great.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1574576", "1": "0.3734144", "2": "0.075191624", "3": "0.07261766", "4": "0.08659563", "5": "0.0863304", "6": "0.14839263"}}
