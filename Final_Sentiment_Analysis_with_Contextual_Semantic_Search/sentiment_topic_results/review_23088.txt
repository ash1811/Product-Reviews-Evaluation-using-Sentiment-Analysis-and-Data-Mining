{"text": "I can say that this hat is nicer than the picture and the sizing is perfect so the sizing on the website was a bullseye. This hat is light and protective and the adjustable parts are great. I garden and walk my dogs and needed a hat. Shipping was on time and the box was huge, I hope that this hat is crushable as advertised so that I can throw it in my backpak. I'll need more wear time to evaluate the longevity of this hat. The colors are nice and neutral. I am not a hat person usually but this hat actually looks good on me. Good product, better than the hats in some of the stores, the price was a little steep. Glad I purchased this hat all in all. I do recommend this seller.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04595066", "1": "0.31058595", "2": "0.04559492", "3": "0.2721268", "4": "0.16788243", "5": "0.09142146", "6": "0.0664378"}}
