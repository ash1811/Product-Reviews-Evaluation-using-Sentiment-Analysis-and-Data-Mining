{"text": "While I love the plush cozy socks and I can see that they are high quality, I was floored when I opened the box and saw ONE pair of socks.  Yup, one.  Maybe I am cheapy, but it seems outrageous to charge over 10.00 for one pair of socks.  They looked really nice though, so I put them on and they were heavenly to wear.  So I excitedly tried to put on my running shoes... wait a minute, they don't fit now! LOL  They call them \"Lite\" but my goodness, they took up so much room that I couldn't put on my shoes.  They are NOT lite, I would most definitely call them PLUSH!  I use them around the house now when my feet are cold; and they would be great in winter boots, but I can't recommend them for anything else!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07005328", "1": "0.28357515", "2": "0.13739407", "3": "0.18914776", "4": "0.09349803", "5": "0.1867173", "6": "0.039614435"}}
