{"text": "I ordered these shoes with free super-saver shipping. There must be a nearby service center because the package arrived in 2 days. I am so delighted to receive these early! I shopped around for Zumba shoes and dance sneakers for a week before choosing this item - a stylish dance sneaker at a good price.  I really wanted red shoes, but found none in my size for a reasonable price that I liked. These came laced with black laces, and included a second pair of red shoe laces which \"add the flavour\" with the other red accents on the heel and tongue.  I ordered 1 size up from my street size based on other reviews and my medium width foot. The shoes looked small in the box, but are a perfect fit.  I will update my review after I Zumba in them for a week.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22905293", "2": "0.18512906", "3": "0.18185897", "4": "0.13094607", "5": "0.09543971", "6": "0.17542875"}}
