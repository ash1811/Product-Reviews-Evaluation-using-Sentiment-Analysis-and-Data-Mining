{"text": "I used to wear thick wool socks when I went backpacking as a Boy Scout. I also wore thick wool socks when I used to work outdoors in Northern Wisconsin during their winters. I never in my life thought I would be comfortable wearing wool socks during any season other than winter or cold weather.These socks really are worth all the 5 star reviews they get. I tried them on a trip to Paris France recently and I compared them to my standard cotton socks and also to synthetic sports socks.They are well cushioned and relatively thick. In Paris, we were on our feet all day long and we were either standing on the metro or walking around town the entire time. I never had any issues with blisters, overheating, or that scratchy feeling you sometimes get from wool. My feet still felt good in the evening when I came home and took my shoes and socks off. I didn't have any issues with foot odor at all, and the socks dried quickly after being washed. The smart wool socks exceeded the synthetic sports socks and my regular cotton socks in every category. I was didn't have any hesitation to wear the socks a second day without washing them. I can't say that for any of the other socks I took on the trip. I can honestly say that these make great travel socks, you can take a couple pairs and wash them in the sinks when they get dirty and they dry overnight. 2 - 3 pairs of these socks would have replaced 7-10 pairs of cotton socks for me.Pros:SoftSupportiveDurableCoolComfortableDries quicklyWicks away sweatCons:More expensive than cotton socksLimited color optionsBulkier than comparable cotton socks", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07837541", "1": "0.24259195", "2": "0.05765703", "3": "0.20461793", "4": "0.09033017", "5": "0.23860554", "6": "0.087822005"}}
