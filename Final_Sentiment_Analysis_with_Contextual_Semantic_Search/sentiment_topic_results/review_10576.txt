{"text": "I have been wearing hiking boots, technical climbing boots, logger boots, and in recent years the ultra lightweight hiking boots like the Chocurua, and none have been as comfortable from the moment I put them on. Something that is very unusual about the last that is used by Timberland is that it provides a comfortable amount of space at the front for your toes and sock end but the heal section is narrower and provides exceptional lateral support for your foot.On step 10-15 degree dirt slopes these boots with their ankle and heel support and grippy sole make for excellent traction and it is easy to maintain your footing. Steep trail sections that were a bit of a challenge with my old boots are a breeze to go up and down with these boots.I do not know if these boots would hold up to heavy back packing but that is not their intended use. If you want a boot that gives you excellent traction and foot support on loose soil or mud and like to stay on your feet, these shoes are the ones to get. They are lightweight hikers and for day hikes they provide very good arch support right out of the box. With the last three pairs of boots I have had to add Pinnacle Powerstep supports and throw away the insoles that came with them from the manufacturer. Not so with these Timberland boots which to me represents a $25 savings.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20546679", "1": "0.18527557", "2": "0.13504241", "3": "0.1533239", "4": "0.1364237", "5": "0.101207554", "6": "0.08326009"}}
