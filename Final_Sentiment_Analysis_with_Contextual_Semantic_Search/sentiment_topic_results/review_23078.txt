{"text": "Super light-weight great for those who get hat headaches, well-made, sunblock hat. Costs somewhat more than the copycats, but well worth it for all the careful details included in this hat. The only thing missing is a lightweight clip to keep it from blowing away, but easier enough for me to add. (planning to wear chin strap in back with clip on collar.) Recommend this over similar low-cost sun hats with rear veils. I ordered both, what a huge difference! Keeping this, returning the other. This Sunday Afternoons Adventure Hat is made in Viet Nam (read - quality). High recommend.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13440692", "1": "0.23199615", "2": "0.17730483", "3": "0.25065783", "4": "0.03855021", "5": "0.038479757", "6": "0.12860432"}}
