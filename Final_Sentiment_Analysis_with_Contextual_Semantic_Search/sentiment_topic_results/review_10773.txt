{"text": "We have had cold in the single digit's early this year! I bought a pair for My Son who works out in these elements!  I have purchased These type Overalls before? Yet They were nothing like these! We had already Tried Long Johns. He was even wearing 3 pairs of shocks ! Nothing helped! Than I tried these! One of the \"BIG\" Issues was They could only be \"BLACK\"! This was the only Company I saw that offered these in Black?However,I am not saying They aren't EXPENSIVE! HOWEVER,FINDING A 42X34 IS NOT AVAILABLE IN ANY OF THE OTHER COMPANIES ,WITH THESE OUTSIDE OF HIS WORK UNIFORM,THEY NEED TO BE THIS LARGE !! AFTER SHOPPING AT SEVERAL STORES WE COULD't find anything  CHEAPER.Not another Store  BUT NOT LONG ENOUGH !PLUS THEY ACTUALLY COST MORE Yet were not the made ANYWHERE as WELL as These were !They wash Up well,dry almost complety Than hang on a hanger & They look Like brand NEW ! They keep the wind from going right through! They are Like wearing a Quilted like a heavy but thin material? KEEPS COLD OUT & HEAT IN! Will Purchase another pair!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17704874", "1": "0.33434197", "2": "0.08857084", "4": "0.07905438", "5": "0.27114612", "6": "0.047360744"}}
