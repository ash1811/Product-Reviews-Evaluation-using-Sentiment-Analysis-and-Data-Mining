{"text": "I use this watch for TRX training and it works perfectly. The ability to quickly get to the Timer and Chrono function combined with large and easy to push buttons make this a great watch for exercising.I also think that the face size is perfect; not too large like some men's watches.My only gripe is that I wish I could make the alarm/timer sound louder so I could hear it even if I'm playing music through ear buds. I have to listen to my music at a very low level to hear the alarm go off telling me that my 30 second intervals are up.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10351697", "1": "0.22610922", "2": "0.16581261", "3": "0.09541454", "4": "0.08705331", "5": "0.19616154", "6": "0.12593184"}}
