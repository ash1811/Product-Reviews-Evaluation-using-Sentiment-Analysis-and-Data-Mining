{"text": "Bought this watch a about two weeks ago. I was worried that the face of the watch would be too huge around my tiny wrists but the watch fit nicely. I've always had issues with wearing bracelets because my wrists were so tiny but this watch had enough holes on the strap to fit. There were even two smaller holes for people with smaller wrists. The black light is wonder. Glad to have a pretty but functional watch. I do notice however that the strap is a bit thin and will eventually tear..but that can be easily replaced. Glad to have purchased this watch.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.029909996", "1": "0.22958194", "2": "0.36956424", "3": "0.21662417", "4": "0.048001125", "5": "0.083428666", "6": "0.022889866"}}
