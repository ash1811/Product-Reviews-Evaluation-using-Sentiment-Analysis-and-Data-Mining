{"text": "I bought these jeans because I just got tired of the high price of Levis.  These things are so good, that I just donated my used Levis.  These fit nice. look good and seem substantial.  Since my first two pairs, I bought two more, and will soon order another two pairs.  Got to have plenty on hand.  I recommend them if you're a blue jean wearer, and want a better fit, that doesn't seem to shrink as much as some of the competition.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07090516", "1": "0.48266923", "2": "0.029365527", "3": "0.08485226", "5": "0.10878058", "6": "0.220231"}}
