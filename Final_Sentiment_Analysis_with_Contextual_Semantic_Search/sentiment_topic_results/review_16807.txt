{"text": "This is the best 80 dollar watch I ever had.  I have had several that were over 200 dollars and I think this one is better than those also.  It's a handsome watch.  I have small wrists and it looks just right on my arm.  I had to go to a local jeweler and have 2 links removed from the bracelet.  It was right after Christmas and she either felt charitable or sorry for me so she did it for free.  It took her less than a minute.  It is keeping very good time.  As for people that complain about the magnifying bubble over the date, I like it because I hate squinting to see the date.  The blue dial and outside minute bezel are beautiful.  I own a whole drawer full of watches and this is my favorite.  Until I buy another Invicta of course.  It comes in a nice (huge) yellow leatherette box with a soft cloth to polish it up with.  It would make a very attractive gift.  I prefer that is a battery watch as I have no experience with an automatic and don't wear one often enough to keep it wound.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.092581324", "1": "0.12231179", "2": "0.21649523", "3": "0.070870474", "4": "0.27898622", "5": "0.060799014", "6": "0.157956"}}
