{"text": "I've been wearing Sebago and Sperry boat shoes for years.  I live in them, and until now thought they were the most comfortable shoes of all.  I was wrong.  These Minnetonka Moosehead moccasins are BY FAR the most comfortable shoes/slippers on the planet!  My son recommended them, and boy am I glad he did.  I have Neuropathy and can't stand wearing socks or tight shoes.  While these seem a little snug right now... size 9.5, my normal size... I'm told they will stretch and mold themselves to my feet over time.  When I'm wearing these I often feel like I'm not even wearing anything on my feet.  I love them!!!  Try a pair... you won't be disappointed!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04391662", "1": "0.303818", "2": "0.16798416", "3": "0.17632556", "4": "0.12670788", "5": "0.087842345", "6": "0.093405455"}}
