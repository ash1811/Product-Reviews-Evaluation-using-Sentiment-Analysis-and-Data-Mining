{"text": "I wasn't exactly sure what a &#34;crew sock&#34; is, but it turns out to be halfway between a dress sock and a sweat sock.  I am always running out of black socks, needed something to pad around the house in, and these seemed ideal as they have extra thick bottoms.  They are well-made with a woven sculpted pattern, but I found the material just a little too thick and rough to be totally comfortable, and the one-size-fits-all is a little too tight for my size 11 feet.  These are merely serviceable, and I will probably try something else the next time I purhcase socks.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.072892316", "1": "0.13716738", "2": "0.09876374", "3": "0.116276845", "4": "0.1341133", "5": "0.3125282", "6": "0.12825821"}}
