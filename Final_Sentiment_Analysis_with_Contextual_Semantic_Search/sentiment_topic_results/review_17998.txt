{"text": "The watch looks great and keeps excellent time. The band is comfortable and sturdy and the lighted dial is perfectly designed to view time in the dark. The watch has a lot of features for such an inexpensive item but it's really hard to remember how to use them. The setting and operation sequences seem pretty counter-intuitive to me. Even though it's not called a \"daily alarm\" the alarm seems to go off every day at the same time without re-setting. But I really need to keep the instructions handy if I want to be able to stop it instead of just hitting \"snooze\". The alarm is not very loud. I won't hear it if I'm in a noisy place. Someone else pointed out that the crystal scratches easily and they were SO right! Even though I work in an office and am very careful, mine somehow picked up a wide nasty scratch in just days. I used to have a bottle of \"plastic polish\" that might buff the scratches out. Most of the special features are not useful to me so this was a good deal but not a great one.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24251014", "1": "0.21386869", "2": "0.12985781", "3": "0.06992785", "4": "0.22957392", "5": "0.03369055", "6": "0.08057106"}}
