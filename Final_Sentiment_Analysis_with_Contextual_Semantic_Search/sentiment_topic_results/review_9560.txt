{"text": "I actually purchased this watch at a fine jewelery store...at a much heftier price! So when I decided to check Amazon's watch department, I was not as pleased with my purchase as I had been. But it's a waste of energy to cry over spilled milk, my mother always told me, so I'll limit the whining.I thought I'd review it, anyway, because I really like this watch for all the reasons stated in Amazon's product description (stainless steel, two-tone, white dial, black hands, etc.)...and more! I think the thin band and style of this watch is modern, simple and elegant, but what I like best is that it's easy to read, I can wear it in the pool and since it's both silver and gold, it complements most of my jewelry. Another plus is that Timex is a trusted brand that's been around since I was a kid, and that was long ago... lolTimex Women's T2H491 Easy Reader Two-Tone Expansion Band Watchis not an expensive watch, by any means, but it suits me and my lifestyle.I highly recommend this watch and Amazon's new watch department. Five stars, any old time.
