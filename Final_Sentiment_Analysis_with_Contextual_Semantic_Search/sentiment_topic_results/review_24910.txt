{"text": "To be brief, I looked at a lot of insoles on here, and read their reviews.  I have a high arch and these fit my feet very well.  They are a harder plastic on the bottom, which sounds counter-intuitive, but apparently it gives a solid base for your feet or something to that effect.  Either way they feel great and you don't notice they're there really, which for someone working, walking on concrete, is what you're looking for.  I am now looking at the \"wide\" version for a pair of boots I have.  I sized these up to their insoles and they are a little too narrow, but, each of the four insoles I tried out were at least slightly too narrow for said boot.  These aren't the cheapest insole but they are supportive and great for a high arch.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.113008805", "1": "0.24749766", "2": "0.055875894", "3": "0.094435334", "4": "0.30325547", "5": "0.12401461", "6": "0.06191223"}}
