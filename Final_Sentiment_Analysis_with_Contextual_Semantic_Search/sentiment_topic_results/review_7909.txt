{"text": "This pant is just a basic. It is exactly as described and is very comfy. However, I did not listen to other reviews and should have. This pant runs way large!! I got the medium for my husband who wears a 32 waist pant and it is way too big and a little too long. I would recommend this to someone, just get a size smaller than is your regular size!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.29935437", "2": "0.12214561", "3": "0.37382197", "4": "0.049825918", "6": "0.14614496"}}
