{"text": "The madela sleep nursing bra ended up being too short on me.  That may sound strange but to make it cover *everything* in the front, the back had to ride up quite a ways. I have never had this problem with other bras and I did not put it in the dryer  before use.  Otherwise it was the right size, so I am not returning, but definitely not my favorite bra.  You can try bravado designs -their bras have adjustable straps and are also good quality.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20314129", "1": "0.099329494", "2": "0.13184963", "3": "0.43600795", "4": "0.06687957", "6": "0.059380583"}}
