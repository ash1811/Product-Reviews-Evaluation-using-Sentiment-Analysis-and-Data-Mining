{"text": "When I was scrolling through the selection of watches, I came across this watch, and I liked it right off for its looks. Even though it's a hybrid digital-analog model, it retains a classic, retro kind of look. I think it looks good. And certainly the price is right. But when it came I was dismayed. It is very plastic. It weighs less than a thumbtack! I wouldn't say it feels chintzy. But it doesn't have the weight that really good watches have. But rather than write it off, I read its thick little manual booklet, familiarized myself with all of its functions, and started wearing it. It is actually a quite versatile and functional timepiece. And it's the first watch I've ever come across that does not have a tiny knob to set the hands with. I didn't spot that anomaly until I received it. You push a combination of buttons to set the hour and minute hands. And, surprisingly, the setting and menu system is straightforward and intuitive. It has turned out to be an inexpensive tool I can really put to practical use. Countdown timer. Stopwatch. World clock. Alarm clock. 12- or 24-hour display. Illuminated dial. No great loss if it's lost or stolen. And it does look good, I think, if you can get past the fact that it's about 95 percent plastic. Once I got used to its featherweight nature, I didn't regret buying it. I wear it on rough assignments. It's holding up well. In all honesty, I think this watch actually may be the best cheap, plastic watch I've ever owned! Really! And so I recommend it. It's certainly nicer, more useful, and easy to figure out than most of the other cheap watches out there. Your mileage may vary, but this watch by Casio is doing right by me.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14972413", "1": "0.30460075", "2": "0.17032845", "3": "0.10508267", "4": "0.11646654", "5": "0.034826674", "6": "0.118970804"}}
