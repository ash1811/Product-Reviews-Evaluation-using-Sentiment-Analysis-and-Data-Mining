{"text": "I bought this shoe more than 2 years ago, and I ware it at work everyday.  At work, I stand on my feet most of the time,and I work 6 days a week. As it said, this shoe is a great shoe ,still look great after 2 years of wearing, yet it is very comfortable. I am waiting for it to break( I don't know when?), and I will buy it again. It worth every penny!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14055416", "1": "0.29926923", "2": "0.14219202", "3": "0.17078339", "4": "0.11867984", "5": "0.090626754", "6": "0.037894614"}}
