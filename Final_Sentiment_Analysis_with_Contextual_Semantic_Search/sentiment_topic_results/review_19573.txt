{"text": "Well it fits, which is a difficult thing for my size (40H).  A lot of bras I've purchased are sized incorrectly and are usually way to small so it is a treat to find one that actually covers me and doesn't squish me together or squash out my armpits.  It also has great lift and is smooth (no pointy or bumpy business).  The only reason I don't LOVE it YET, is comfort.  It is a little bit painful right now, the straps dig and the alastic around my ribs is very uncomfortable.  I am hoping these areas will relax or I will adjust because other than that, it is everything I have been searching for.  :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14650044", "1": "0.23150074", "2": "0.15619981", "3": "0.11746406", "4": "0.1890237", "5": "0.055643033", "6": "0.103668205"}}
