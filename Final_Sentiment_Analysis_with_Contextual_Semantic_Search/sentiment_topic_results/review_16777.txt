{"text": "I took a gamble when buying this watch, didn't really know if it will suit me, but my gut feeling told me to go for it. I like having stylish watches, and this one sure does have a lot of style. It is huge, but not heavy, the knobs on the side may pinch a bit sometimes to some sensitive people, doesn't bother me.The time is really easy to read, needless to explain why. The leather strap is of very good quality and looks great. The color is creamish off whitish going to yellowish side. The material of the metal can be better but at 99.99 price by Amazon, I will settle for it.It is bit confusing to how to adjust the watch, the manual does not help. After 5 minutes of trying, I found out that the main knob on the side is actually like a screw cap and you can rotate it to remove the screw cap, and then you can use the button underneath it. I don't think it is practically too useful as a chronometer or all the sports / activity stuff, but just going for the looks, it does have it going for it.I would not pay full price for it, 99.99 is the perfect price for it, anything more would be more. Comes in a nice yellow box by Invicita, comes with a platinum warranty application which extends the default one year warranty to 5 year, supposedly for amazon.com customer, this upgrade is free, I will find out soon, have submitted my application to Invicta.If you like watches, this one is for you. And for all you ladies out there, if you want to make your man happy, give him this as a gift alongwith a nice cigar. He will surely appreciate it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12848605", "1": "0.16385134", "2": "0.20985569", "3": "0.18270706", "4": "0.12646377", "6": "0.18632647"}}
