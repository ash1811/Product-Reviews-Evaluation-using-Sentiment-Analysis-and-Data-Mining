{"text": "I purchased these for my 19 year old daughter. Just to clarify, because I was quite confused by some of the photos I looked at... In some photos, this pair of glasses look quite pink and even though they are not advertised as such, appear to be gradient. I really didn't understand what part of the pair is \"silver\". What I received is: gold frame, light brown lens and very slighly mirrored. They do not appear pink at all and I still can't figure out what is \"silver\" in any type of light. They are NOT gradient.The lens is quite light and even with the mirroring,looking at my daughter wearing them, I can clearly see her eyes through the lens.The glasses have some weight but have a very fine frame. The arms are needle thin, yet the frame feels sturdy. I will keep them anyway, but I wish they had pink tint/mirror and were gradient with perhaps a darker colour of brown.UPDATE- My daughter has had two pairs of these glasses in the exact same colour: 58 mm and 55mm. Now that she has the right fit, I can say that the 58 mm is too big big. the lens is large on her small face and they are too loose on her head. Altho the 55mm are only 3mm smaller, there is a huge difference. The lens ts noticeably smaller and the arm fit is much better. I would recommend the 58 mm for an average sized man and the 55 for an average woman.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.34136248", "1": "0.15204582", "2": "0.045558117", "3": "0.30422568", "4": "0.075416535", "5": "0.037473906", "6": "0.043917418"}}
