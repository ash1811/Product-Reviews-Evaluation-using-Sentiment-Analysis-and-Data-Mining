{"text": "I had two watches I liked but they had the Velcro wrist band which kept loosening and eventually falling off the wrist.  This TIMEX stays put as it has a worthy buckle arrangement.  And I no longer have to waste time to set the correct date or other obstructions.  The watch at the price I paid, keeps time on time, which is the basic reason to have a watch.
