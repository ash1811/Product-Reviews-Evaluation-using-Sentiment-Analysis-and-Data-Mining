{"text": "I thought these were the cutest things ever so I got these for my three year old son to go with his little easter outfit. They fit him a little big, but that is fine by me because now he has shoes that will last for a little longer. He thought they were weird when he first put them on because of the heel part. He's not used to shoes that have a little heel, but once he got outside and started playing with his family and friends, he forgot all about the heel &#34;problem.&#34; By the way, they still looked new after the first (adventurous) wear. I say this because some dress shoes I buy this explorer end up looking terrible by the end of the first wear.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08536016", "1": "0.19803524", "2": "0.11852926", "3": "0.2975296", "5": "0.14309713", "6": "0.1548439"}}
