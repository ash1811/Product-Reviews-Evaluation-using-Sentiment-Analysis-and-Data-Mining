{"text": "I ordered this bag to replace a smaller, very tattered Jansport bag I got my boyfriend 5 years ago. He is a musician and often goes back and forth from the studio, work and home. This bag fits everything he needs; pedals, cables, laptop, pro headphones, a winter jacket, lunch and more... The zippers hold up very well even though it always seems like bursting. He especially likes the S style straps. Great price from Amazon as well (was $32 when I ordered and elsewhere can be $50+). Would definitely recommend.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.032671202", "1": "0.27153286", "2": "0.20337889", "3": "0.1483379", "4": "0.109287575", "5": "0.0987419", "6": "0.13604969"}}
