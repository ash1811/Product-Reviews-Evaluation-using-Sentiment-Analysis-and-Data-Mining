{"text": "We have other Jansport bags so I know the quality and was happy to get this one on sale. Apparently my daughter likes the ugly patterns nobody else does. But she is also observant and noticed that the pattern is not entirely the same as the picture. There are no circles on hers. It's much more an abstract tie dye, so if your kid is like mine, prepare them for the pattern to not be consistent. Oh, and since more and more schools are requiring small kids to carry full size backpacks, it would be nice if the manufacturers would make the straps so that you could snug it a little smaller for little people. My kid will look like a turtle, but that's what they say she needs.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.02969412", "1": "0.05630845", "2": "0.26685795", "3": "0.3121466", "4": "0.14470811", "5": "0.16252726", "6": "0.027757522"}}
