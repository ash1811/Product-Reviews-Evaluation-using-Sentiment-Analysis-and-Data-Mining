{"text": "So I ordered these in hopes of getting some good around the house sweat pants, theyre sized closer to 2 sizes smaller then on the label when compared to unbranded or hanes products of the same size.So being an amazon prime customer I was easily able to return them, but they charged half the price of a pair of the pants as a \"restock\" fee, I dont know if they do this for every order returned or just me, because I had to remove the pants from the plastic bag to try them on.Needless to say I will not attempt to get a larger size of these pants from them since if they dont fit right I will be eating most of the cost in return fees.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.100887604", "1": "0.29541165", "2": "0.09911914", "3": "0.21662894", "4": "0.13472863", "5": "0.078468606", "6": "0.07475543"}}
