{"text": "I got these for my wedding because I am in a wheelchair and due to my feet being a bit deformed (they do not sit flat on the ground) I can not wear regular shoes so thought this would be pretty for my feet with my wedding dress. I was apprehensive about the reviews and so did as some suggested and bought a size up. I got the medium which I had hoped would give me a little room. I use too (before my issue got worse) wear size 6-7 shoes. I am glad I did not get smaller! they would not have fit otherwise. The medium is a bit tight but stretches so is not too uncomfortable. the padding on bottom is VERY soft and cloud like which is real comfy. I hope they stretch out a wee bit but my toes are not scrunched any so I would suggest to go up at least one to two sizes in number then pick that size (ie if you wear a size 7-8 in shoe I would go for large to be safe)as to the aesthetic value I am pleased, I wish they would take that stupid tied bow off them though that surely makes them look like slippers ugh.... I plan to snip that off and add some sequins and pearls and other beads that I have left over from my wedding dress to that spot but otherwise from what I can tell they seem well made, not falling apart. soft, very shiny and pretty satin looking and the pearls all seemed well attached not loose or falling off. I really do like them (except for that silly bow)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.17384325", "2": "0.11723646", "3": "0.3169893", "4": "0.06217145", "5": "0.26997465", "6": "0.057178866"}}
