{"text": "This is a great sturdy, light, well-organized bag to carry in emergencies. It saved the day on a recent trip as I took back much more than I brought over, & this worked well as my carry-on because my purse and all gifts fit into it. It folds up small, but holds a lot of contents once opened. Baggallini makes great products.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12166581", "1": "0.2501428", "2": "0.1359309", "3": "0.12830637", "4": "0.09817471", "5": "0.09965212", "6": "0.16612728"}}
