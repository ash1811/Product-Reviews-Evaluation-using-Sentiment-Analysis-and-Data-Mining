{"text": "The Le Mystere bra is about the best undergarment I've ever had.  The only thing about it is that it MUST be washed before being worn or it is, for some reason, itchy.  Maybe it's the sizing they put into it before it leaves the factory, but make sure you wash this bra on the most delicate cycle you have and absolutely add a good fabric softener.  Use cold water and whatever you do, DON'T put it in the dryer.  It will ruin it permanently.  The Le Mystere dries quickly overnight when hung on a hanger.  It fits beautifully without adding to your size.  Instead it adds shape.  It is the same bra sold by many on-line specialty shops, but it's much less expensive through Amazon.  One thing I did not like was the way it was packed; one cup was inverted into another and this temporarily deformed the cup.  I had to really work at it to get the outside material to fit the inner foam perfectly.  Never store it by inverting the cups.  It will definitely ruin it, and when you receive it, get it out of the package immediately and put it \"into proper shape\" by un-inverting the cup that the packer inverted.  You'll be glad you did it as soon as possible, because the longer it stays inverted, the harder it is to set right.  The bra is worth every cent.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.17318557", "2": "0.19073565", "3": "0.3010824", "4": "0.18091455", "6": "0.14945109"}}
