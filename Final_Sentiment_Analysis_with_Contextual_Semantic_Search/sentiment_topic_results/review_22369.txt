{"text": "Since only one pair of these fantastic injinji socks costs around $10, and the fact that they seem like they won't last a while, one star gets docked.  That's it.  Everything else about the sock is amazing.Now that that's out of the way, I purchased two pairs of these socks to go with my KSOs.  I run barefoot with the KSOs, but wanted to see how these feel.  They merely added an extra layer of cushioning, and are very thin so as to still provide that barefoot feeling.  They're very comfortable, and I find myself wearing them without the Vibrams.However, they do seem cheaply made for $10 socks, as one other reviewer noted, so I'm hoping they'll last longer than they seem.  My Hanes crew socks feel much sturdier, so, as I mentioned before, these socks get 4 stars.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.052711636", "1": "0.12622175", "2": "0.10792558", "3": "0.22981445", "4": "0.1730034", "5": "0.30821747"}}
