{"text": "I purchased this to replace the Timex I had for many years - the wristband broke and would have cost more to replace than to buy a new watch.  I particularly like this watch for Indiglo. I have a young son that still wakes during the night and I like to just tap the button to see the time.  I read other reviews that indicated that the buttons were difficult to push, but I had no problem and my toddler also likes to push the buttons for the beep so if he can do it, I think an adult should be able to also.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08761462", "1": "0.11576128", "2": "0.1904112", "3": "0.17461754", "4": "0.11832857", "5": "0.10677238", "6": "0.20649444"}}
