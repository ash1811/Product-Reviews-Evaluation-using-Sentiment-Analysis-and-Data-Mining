{"text": "Some call this cosmetic bag pricey, but once I used it, what I paid for it didn't matter. It is fantastic. I can fit everything I need for a 2 week vacation plus my usual makeup. The quality is excellent, the zippers, stitching, vinyl fabric. I have never had a hanging cosmetic bag before and my first use was in a small bathroom with no vanity space. It is so convenient, hangs on hooks or doorknobs. Highly recommend!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14310476", "1": "0.18712611", "2": "0.16996686", "3": "0.16163577", "4": "0.073225975", "5": "0.10195639", "6": "0.16298413"}}
