{"text": "I love these shoes.  I have three pairs of the exact style and color.  When one wears out, I move on to the next pair.  I always keep them in reserve, just in case they discontinue the color or the style.  Great running and walking shoes and very comfortable if you stand on your feet all day.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.14245309", "2": "0.17796655", "3": "0.084184326", "4": "0.1728579", "5": "0.3337303", "6": "0.08387383"}}
