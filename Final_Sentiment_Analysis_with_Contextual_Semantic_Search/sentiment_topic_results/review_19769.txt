{"text": "I bought these based on the 4 & 5 star reviews. However, they are not thick & warm like some people say they are, 11oz & up are thicker & warmer.These look like I could buy them at a local discount retail store. I turn these inside out when I wash but after a 4-washes, I noticed they started pilling.These are not &#34;high&#34; quality & are made of a cheap cotton base. If you don't care about the pilling & just using them around the house or in the yard, I'd say go for it. However, I can get the same ones, different brand that will pill at my local retail stores for less $$.The elastic waist fits as expected. The bottom of the legs are also elastic & are comfortable around the ankles. One other thing that I do like, is the pockets are actually deep & come partially up my arm, about a third of the way.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07286488", "1": "0.2967272", "2": "0.19346333", "3": "0.10848111", "4": "0.13671367", "5": "0.027934197", "6": "0.1638156"}}
