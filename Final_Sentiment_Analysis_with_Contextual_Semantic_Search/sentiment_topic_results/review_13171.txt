{"text": "I've learned that companies make varying degrees of quality. And UnderMoments must get the lowest quality! After washing twice these are still the most bumpy, itchy, horrible feeling tshirts I have ever felt!Walmart gets poor quality too...matter of fact I learned while working there that even their lawn mowers are made more cheaply with a few less coats of paint!Anyways...I was HOPING that ordering them on Amazon I would get a higher quality Hanes shirt. Nope. Same cruddy quality that walmart carries.Returning and going to Macys or Dillards for higher quality Hanes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06792456", "1": "0.35748026", "2": "0.037549995", "3": "0.22077242", "4": "0.056025933", "5": "0.23613527", "6": "0.024111612"}}
