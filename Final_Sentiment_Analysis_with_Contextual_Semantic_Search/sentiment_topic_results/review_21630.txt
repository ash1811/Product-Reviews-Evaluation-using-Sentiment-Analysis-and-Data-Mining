{"text": "The picture has red wings, I liked the wings; that's why I picked this bag from several other options of bags; the bag that came is plain, no wings. It's a black canvas material, kind of faded. I bought it as a gift for a friend, he likes bags that look old and his birthday was yesterday, the day the bag arrived, so I'm not going to bother returning it but it's not the bag pictured; I'm disappointed.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.2665793", "2": "0.2275005", "3": "0.16183694", "4": "0.072149046", "5": "0.21805269", "6": "0.050376385"}}
