{"text": "I have a long torso for my height and I have never had a belly band reach comfortably over my belly... until now. I can pull these babies all the way up to the bottom of my bra (which is where my belly starts, welcome to the ninth month ladies).Pre-pregnancy I was 5'6\" and 120 lbs, now in the ninth month I'm 162 lbs. I purchased size C and they feel great! I wish I had found these earlier on in my pregnancy. I suffered through a lot of footless tights that exacerbate swollen feet and compression tights that are too snug on the belly.The black color is a little shiny and semi-opaque (I can see a little color from my legs; these are not to be confused with leggings or pants, ugh despite the fashion these days).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16057377", "1": "0.1888995", "2": "0.15767287", "3": "0.22183599", "4": "0.047644373", "5": "0.14643751", "6": "0.076936014"}}
