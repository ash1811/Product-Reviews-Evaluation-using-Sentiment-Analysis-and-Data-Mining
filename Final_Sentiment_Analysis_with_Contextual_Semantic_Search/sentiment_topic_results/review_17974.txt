{"text": "This is a very nice, simple to use watch.  Controls are well laid out. Operation is easy and intuitive.  Display is easy to read and night illumination works great.  The watch would have received 5 stars was it not for the band, which is a bit on the stiff and thin side.  Hopefully it will not break too soon.  Overall, I would recommend this watch to anyone looking for an inexpensive, nice looking sport watch with a good set of useful features.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07677773", "1": "0.33206874", "2": "0.18142672", "3": "0.123983376", "4": "0.09058069", "5": "0.048413113", "6": "0.14674965"}}
