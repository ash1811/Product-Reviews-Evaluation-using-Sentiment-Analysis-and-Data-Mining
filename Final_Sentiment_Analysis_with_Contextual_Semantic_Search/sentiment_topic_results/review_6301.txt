{"text": "I have used sock liners for years while hiking. I started with nylons in the Army then graduated to normal liners. Using these liners is like getting a Graduate degree in comfort. I noticed that my normal liners, from Bass Pro Shop, were not letting my feet breath. What the point of wearing great wool socks if my feet cant breath due to the liners? So I spent a few dollars more and grabbed up these liners and have worn them for over a week straight, to facilitate trail conditions, and they have held up wonderfully.You won't be disappointed.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15512861", "1": "0.1875911", "2": "0.18378797", "3": "0.2129244", "4": "0.081075996", "5": "0.114778355", "6": "0.06471357"}}
