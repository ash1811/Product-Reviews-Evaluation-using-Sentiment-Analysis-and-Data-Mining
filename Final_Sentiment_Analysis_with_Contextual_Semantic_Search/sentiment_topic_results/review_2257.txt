{"text": "Here I thought they only made clothes. LOLI usually wear a 13M, but my old ones were feeling tight. I ordered a 14M and they are so much more comfy.By the time I put socks on and a Gel insert in them, they should fit perfect.The uppers are a heavy, quality leather. What a nice surprise for something not made in the USA.The soles are a gummy type, soft manmade material. It is approximately 1/2&#34; thick.They should provide me with lots of wear. Time will tell.At present, I am extremely happy with my purchase.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04138511", "1": "0.39802104", "2": "0.09036256", "3": "0.16889973", "4": "0.03656518", "5": "0.1903386", "6": "0.0744278"}}
