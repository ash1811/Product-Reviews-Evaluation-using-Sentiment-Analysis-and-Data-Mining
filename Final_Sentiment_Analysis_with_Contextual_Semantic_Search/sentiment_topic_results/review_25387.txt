{"text": "I guess I got lucky because my bags have never had a chemical, kerosene or mildew odor.  I bought the black bag first, back in 2008 and liked it so much for travel that I bought a second one in red as a spare-up-worried that when the black one wore out, they would no longer be available.  I use them when I fly as a huge travel handbag for my netbook, full-sized camera, paperback book, water bottle, and medium-sized Baggalini wallet bag.  The bags have held up beautifully through multiple flights around the US and rest of the world.  For ground travel, I use them to carry a water bottle, small purse and my camera so everything is handy in one place.  I am not at all careful with them and both still look virtually new.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1267867", "1": "0.15779696", "2": "0.25840548", "3": "0.1421633", "4": "0.13217443", "5": "0.03236668", "6": "0.15030648"}}
