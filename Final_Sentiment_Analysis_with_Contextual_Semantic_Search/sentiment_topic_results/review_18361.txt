{"text": "I gave 2 stars because the shoes are cute and I received them quickly.  Those are the only positive things I can say about them.  I ordered the size that was supposed to fit my feet - the shoes were too short.  Had I kept them and worn them, my big toe would have poked a hole in the tips of the shoes - probably sooner rather than later.  The knit upper is thin giving the shoes a very cheap look - I could see my skin through the weave.  There was absolutely no arch support - none.  I've had better arch support in a bedroom slipper.  To be fair, I have flat feet; if you have a normal arch - meaning one that does not require orthotics - then this shoe might work for you.  I also think that these shoes are overpriced given what appears to be mediocre quality.  Suffice it to say, I sent them back almost as quickly as I received them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.19256547", "1": "0.21152997", "2": "0.2844182", "3": "0.16055389", "4": "0.070091344", "6": "0.07841192"}}
