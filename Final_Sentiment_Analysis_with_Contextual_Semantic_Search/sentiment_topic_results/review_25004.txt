{"text": "The insole is high quality and very stable with a hard foot bed, but the arch was too high for me -- and I have high arches.  The insole arch missed my arch by about 1/2&#34; (it hit the back of my arch) and that was uncomfortable, but feet are shaped differently so this may be an issue for you or not.  Try them on and that will tell you.  Before I bought these insoles, I read about this issue in Amazon reviews of the product.  I returned them after trying them on.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08996961", "1": "0.09845283", "3": "0.39769843", "4": "0.23187736", "5": "0.13188954", "6": "0.046617415"}}
