{"text": "Excellent fit compared to the Bushacre, which runs large. The Clarks desert boot is simple in design, but quite comfortable and pairs with jeans and khakis equally well.Excellent dark leather with the light-colored crepe sole is a nice contrast. The leather is thick and durable (again, better quality and finish than the Bushacre), and wears well, showing distress and creases like a patina. Wouldn't ever polish or treat these--they just look better a bit worn.So they're made in Vietnam or China, unlike your favorite 10-year old British or or Italian pair of Kenneth Coles or whatever, but these guys last a good long while and they're basically impervious to shifts in fashion (like any good piece of menswear) but remain a little edgy. And the price is right.Quick note for the high school or college student: these can literally dress with anything, including suits, so if you need a pair of shoes for weddings, commencements, interviews, churches or making a nice impression on parents or whomever, these work in lots of situations.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.02805735", "1": "0.16338217", "2": "0.122500405", "3": "0.11699388", "4": "0.14587688", "5": "0.26341227", "6": "0.15977709"}}
