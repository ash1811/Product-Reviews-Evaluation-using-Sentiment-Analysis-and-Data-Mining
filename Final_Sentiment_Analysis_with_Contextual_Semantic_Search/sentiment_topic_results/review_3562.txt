{"text": "I like this bra as I like the fit and the underwire is comfortable. The only thing I would suggest is for the straps to be more substantional, especially for size D and above. I do have trouble with one strap slipping off my shoulder.. Also, I like when bra straps can be adjusted from the front instead of having to remove bra to adjust the straps like which has to be done with this one.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11348545", "1": "0.08880148", "2": "0.3674386", "3": "0.15294693", "4": "0.09953135", "5": "0.076945744", "6": "0.10085037"}}
