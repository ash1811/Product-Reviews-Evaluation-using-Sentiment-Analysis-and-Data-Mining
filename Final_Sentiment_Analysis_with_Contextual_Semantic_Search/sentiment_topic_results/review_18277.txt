{"text": "When my children were toddlers I had this Casio watch. I used the stopwatch and the timers for everything from \"15 minutes more of play\" to 10 minutes in time out for one. I loved this little watch. It was faithful, accurate and kept on ticking no matter what.It is water resistant- which I accidentally tested several times.  Like several other reviewers have said - usually when I bought a new one it was because the band broke or I lost it.I was unable to find them in stores in recent years, even though I asked. No one seemed to have heard of them. Then I found it on Amazon and ordered it. Hurrah! I love it. As before it is great. My only concern is I have gained weight over the years and with my fat wrist it is only able to hook on the very end. But that's my fault - not the watch's. I appreciate things that are made with quality, and this is one of them.I have wasted money trying to find a watch that keeps running and lasts. This one does.  They even have a similar one with a metal band for dressier occasions.Update - I bought this in Sept. 2012. It is now July of 2013 and this little watch is still going strong. There are some things that are still well made. :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.115678556", "1": "0.13684511", "2": "0.25367984", "3": "0.21029578", "4": "0.17881794", "6": "0.1023688"}}
