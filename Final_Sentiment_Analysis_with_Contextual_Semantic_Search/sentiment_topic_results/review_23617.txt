{"text": "I am so impressed with the quality of this costume, and it got here in two days, like magic! My daughter is 4 years old but wears a size 6 , she is big for her age, but not over weight , her weight is appropriate for her heighth , so I ordered a M which is a 7/8 , so that she could wear clothes underneath, it's very cold here in Michigan around Halloween. After reading so many reviews on so many different web sites about this particular costume, I ordered it from Amazon(9/23/12) knowing that I would have time to return it if need be, because of the conflicting reviews, some said they didn't get the product pictured, I can assure you, at least in my case, it is exactly as pictured, and the quality is well beyond any Halloween costume I've purchased in the past, and since it's a little on the big side for her, she can wear it next year as well! I'm very pleased, and I know she's going to be the happiest little girl this Halloween !Update; well it's nearly Christmas now and this dress has gotten a lot of use, I'm always careful not to mix food or painting or something messy with dress up time, so I haven't had to clean this dress, but I'm impressed at how well it's held up it still looks brand new, it's made very well and my little girl definitely feels like a real princess in it, so all in all yes I'm still VERY PLEASED !!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1898031", "1": "0.21741623", "2": "0.09040143", "3": "0.15835732", "4": "0.1006583", "5": "0.13741726", "6": "0.10594639"}}
