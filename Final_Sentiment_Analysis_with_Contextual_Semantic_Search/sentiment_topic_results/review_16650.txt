{"text": "I don't really have any complaints about this watch except the loop thing that slides over the tip of the band just plain sucks.  It doesn't stay in place and I have to constantly readjust it.  Otherwise it seems pretty rugged and stylish.*** As an update I am reducing this watch to 3 stars because of the annoying band issue alone.  The loop that slides over the end of the band simply does not stay in place and works its way to toward the clasp, making the band start sticking out too easily.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1849805", "1": "0.18284768", "2": "0.23290381", "4": "0.13656329", "5": "0.11247851", "6": "0.14717847"}}
