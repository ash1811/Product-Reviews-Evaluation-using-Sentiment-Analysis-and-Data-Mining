{"text": "Good traction, fits well and seems to have extra cushion or sole in the heal area. Stepping in them you will notice they are taller than a tennis shoe and more like a boot as far as adding a little height in the sole. First couple of times I wore them I wasn't sure what all the hype was about but by the fourth or fifth time I was quite pleased. Will be interested to see how well they hold up over time and use.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13315776", "1": "0.11662392", "2": "0.17365703", "3": "0.37153453", "4": "0.075916424", "5": "0.12553261"}}
