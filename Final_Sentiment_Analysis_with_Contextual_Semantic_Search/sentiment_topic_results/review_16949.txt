{"text": "I drive tractor trailer and pull a step-deck trailer for a living and the nature of my job is murder on work clothes. On a daily basis, I'm climbing around on sharp steel and machinery that would shred lesser clothing. There's been several times where I have snagged my leg on a sharp steel corner hard enough to leave a nasty, deep bruise, yet the sanded duck material remained unaffected. I shutter to think about the damage I'd have done to my leg had I only been wearing blue jeans or other light weight clothing.These things are  little warm, so I only wear them in the cooler months or cooler places. The nature of my job is that this morning I might have picked up in Northern ND where it is -20 degrees, and then deliver two days later in Laredo, where it might be 85 degrees, so I carry a wide selection of clothing in my truck (all of it Carhartt). I have one pair of lined bibs (Carhartt Men's Quilt Lined Sandstone Bib Overall), that when worn with thermal underwear, I have been warm and toasty working outside for several hours in windy, minus 15 degree Fahrenheit weather. The non-insulated bibs, I wear when the weather is colder than 30 degrees and above zero, and then I have blue jean material Carhartt bibs (Carhartt Men's Washed Denim Bib Overall)that I wear when the weather is above freezing.These things may seem pricey to some, but taking into account that they last virtually forever, they are a steal at this price.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04837765", "1": "0.27368465", "2": "0.16223653", "3": "0.18733229", "4": "0.08179575", "5": "0.20951687", "6": "0.0370563"}}
