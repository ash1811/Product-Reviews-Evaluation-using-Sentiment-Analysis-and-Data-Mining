{"text": "I gave this product three stars, because I had accidently ordered a size 45-Inch shoe lace and thought that it would be tall enough for my shoes, but it wasn't. It was still short. I knew that I should've ordered a 54-inch shoe lace, because my feet are a little big and I wear size 11 in shoes. Now I would have to order this product again this time in a 54-Inch shoe lace. A little waste of money on the 45-Inch shoe lace, but I'll still keep it though.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06361251", "1": "0.2824453", "2": "0.21066086", "3": "0.22760786", "4": "0.059027422", "5": "0.15366049"}}
