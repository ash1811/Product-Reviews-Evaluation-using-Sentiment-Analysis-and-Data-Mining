{"text": "I love fashion and have a glam type of style. So these shades caught my eye because they appeared,stylish, unique and high quality on amazon website I collect all kinds of shades: high end designer or cheap doesnt make a difference to me as long as they look great. I liked the fact that these shades looked great but to be honestly they dont look any more unique than shades purchased from a local discount store which includes Dollar General or Dollar Tree. In other words the only reason I kept them was because its  not worth the effort to return them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14842632", "1": "0.18886255", "2": "0.072999455", "3": "0.18191347", "4": "0.28049573", "6": "0.1246473"}}
