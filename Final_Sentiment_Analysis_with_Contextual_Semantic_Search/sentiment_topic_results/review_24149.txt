{"text": "I purchased this bra because it was less than $20 and came in my 48B size. I didn't have high expectations and when I got it I was blown away. This bra fits beautifully, has a ton of support and a larger hook and eye closure so the support is consistent all the way around the garment. For an impulse buy it has fast become my favorite bra.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.051258493", "1": "0.11927443", "2": "0.20182498", "3": "0.30165875", "4": "0.14986372", "5": "0.051881034", "6": "0.12423858"}}
