{"text": "Ok, here's my criteria for a perfect sun hat:Must be cheap. I'm not paying big money for this. It's a hat, it doesn't have to be pricey.Must be washable. This is something that will get dirty, guaranteed.Must be one size fits all. Why? Because the standard sizes (Small, Med, Large, Extra Large, etc) just don't fit me well. Medium is too small, large is too big.Must be packable and crushable.So, that's why this hat is perfect! What you don't see in the pics is how well it's made. The brim is thick, rigid and plenty big enough at 2 3/4 inches, the material is of good quality, the stitching and strap looks like it will hold up well.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.045308866", "1": "0.38034746", "2": "0.11774749", "3": "0.23697099", "4": "0.073442414", "6": "0.14400798"}}
