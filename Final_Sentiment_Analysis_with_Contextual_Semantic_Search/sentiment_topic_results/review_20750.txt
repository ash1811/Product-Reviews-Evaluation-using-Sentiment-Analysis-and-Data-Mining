{"text": "The shirts fit well and are long enough to stay tucked in well, but not overly long for someone of an average build. The material is a bit lighter than some other simple v-neck Ts that I've worn.I would give this 5 stars if they were just a bit softer. I've bought much softer shirts for a similar price at an actual department store. The cotton is not rough by any means, but when compared to higher quality fabric, the difference is noticeable.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10001956", "1": "0.4202716", "2": "0.085874215", "3": "0.1329398", "4": "0.073521905", "6": "0.18431383"}}
