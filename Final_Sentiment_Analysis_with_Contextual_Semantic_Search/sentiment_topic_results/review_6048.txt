{"text": "I love the slipper, but they did not last very long for the high price I paid for them.  They are not true to size, I wear a size 8, and my toe was at the end of the slipper.  They were hard rubber sole which I liked for wearing indoor or outdoor, and genuine leather......but....when I needed to wash them, I washed them by hand with a mild soad, and after a few washes they fell apart.  The sole which is glued to the bottom of the leather gave way, and I now can not wear them anymore.  I still have them, hoping that I can somehow glue the sole back onto them, but I dont really know if they are worth all that trouble.  I now buy washable slippers.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.028209955", "1": "0.2773015", "2": "0.11422463", "3": "0.21797876", "5": "0.16485076", "6": "0.19486749"}}
