{"text": "I bought these shoes and liked the feel. However, within a month, many of the nubs broke off. I contacted Adidas for a return pair . They don't reimburse for return postage. No one from Adidas ever responded. Don't waste your money on these; buy another brand, or expect to find that they will deteriorate in short order.As an update, I bought a pair of the men's version and they appear to be holding up much better. Like so many things, men's products are also made better. Additionally, I got a better price on them than the women's also.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13026005", "1": "0.14142", "2": "0.09859118", "3": "0.19155125", "4": "0.19796939", "5": "0.15467408", "6": "0.08553407"}}
