{"text": "These shoes fit very well, true to the sizing information.  My feet are standard width so I can easily purchase shoes online without trying them on.  If you have non-standard feet, you may want to go to a store and purchase your shoes.  The quality of these shoes is very good.  The laces, as other reviewers have noted, are a bit flimsy but that is easily remedied - just go out and buy some good laces.  You will still have spent less than you would have otherwise.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.575396", "2": "0.16510704", "4": "0.06197368", "5": "0.07929865", "6": "0.11171318"}}
