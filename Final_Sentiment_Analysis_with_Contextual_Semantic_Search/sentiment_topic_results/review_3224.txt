{"text": "I ordered the jet pack for my 6 year old grandson for Halloween 2011 to go with his Buzz Lightyear costume.  Unfortunately, when we blew up the jet pack the day before Halloween and my grandson wore it for about an hour, it began to deflate quickly.  We found a hole but were unable to patch it up so that it stayed inflated since the break was in a crease in the plastic material.  Luckily, I was able to find and purchase another jet pack at a nearby store in my city which held up fine on Halloween.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06580289", "1": "0.23337273", "2": "0.23700899", "3": "0.077679835", "4": "0.16570383", "5": "0.11873994", "6": "0.101691775"}}
