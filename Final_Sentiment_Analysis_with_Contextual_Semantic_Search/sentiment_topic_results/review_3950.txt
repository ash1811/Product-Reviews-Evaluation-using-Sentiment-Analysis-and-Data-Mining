{"text": "I but these every year but it seems like they changed them a little bit and they are not as comfortable immediately like before. I have had surgery on the top of my feet and usually these fit great right off and then even better once worn in, but they seem to hurt one foot. I am sure once I wear them and wear down the foam they will fit.
