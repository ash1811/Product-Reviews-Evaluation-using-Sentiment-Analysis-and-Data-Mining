{"text": "My husband is not a person with a shoe wardrobe. Indoors he is barefoot; when he goes out, whether it is to work, to run an errand, or for pleasure, he has one pair of shoes. One. And he wears them everywhere.I bought these for him for Christmas 3 years ago, and the uppers are still in great shape. Since the 2 year mark, they have needed polishing every 6 months or so to get rid of scuffs. We have cement stairs out front, and they are rough on leather if one brushes against them. But with a little black polish, they still looked new.The insole has never been a problem, and he's found them quite comfortable.Now it's time to shop for his gift again, and I went down to give these shoes the eye. He has an uneven tread, and has worn the heels down. Since he has back issues and this may make them uncomfortable, I am going to give him another pair, but this pair isn't ready to toss; we will polish them again to use as backup, though I must admit, he never seems to step in puddles or have any other mishap that would call for another pair of shoes.All told, it's one hell of a good pair of shoes!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.047345612", "1": "0.14239982", "2": "0.28418866", "3": "0.1772682", "4": "0.08850631", "5": "0.12538348", "6": "0.13490793"}}
