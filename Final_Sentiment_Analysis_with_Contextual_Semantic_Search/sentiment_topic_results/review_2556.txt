{"text": "Bought this hat for a cheap headcover for an African safari. It definitely did the job, but it's a bit small for a size M/L. I'd say it's closer to a S/M, or even just a Small. It still provided ample cover.It's also ugly, but I guess I can't really knock that since the pictures wouldn't for a moment suggest otherwise.Also, it's really ugly.... Like... really ugly.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11553139", "1": "0.12455311", "2": "0.04460477", "3": "0.37681487", "4": "0.0663892", "5": "0.13444564", "6": "0.13766105"}}
