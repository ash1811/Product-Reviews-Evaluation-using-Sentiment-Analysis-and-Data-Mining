{"text": "Very true to size and the Ascot by Uggs can be a household slipper or soft (run to the store) shoe.  The soles are sturdy enough for taking in the mail or going shopping.  The black leather is very sturdy and can be cleaned with a mild detergent and water.  Mostly waterproof and extremely comfortable.  This is the first pair that I've purchased for my son.  They are traditional slippers in style with great stitching and comfy sheepskin inside.  I would recommend the Ascot to anyone!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07893247", "1": "0.3201132", "2": "0.17980374", "3": "0.28149438", "5": "0.05836207", "6": "0.07817988"}}
