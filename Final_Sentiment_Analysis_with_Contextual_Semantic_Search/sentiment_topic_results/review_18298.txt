{"text": "My girlfriend just bought me this watch today. I'm an avid collector of digital retro style watches.Pretty easy to use, and feels very comfortable on my wrist. I was surprised that the light wasan actual light and not the blue indiglo/illuminator style but still works well. For the price its a greatwatch. I mostly wear digital dress watches but this will def change up my style and will make a greatwatch for doing any kind of work.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18741573", "1": "0.22046725", "2": "0.100008056", "3": "0.13952845", "5": "0.13135001", "6": "0.21781228"}}
