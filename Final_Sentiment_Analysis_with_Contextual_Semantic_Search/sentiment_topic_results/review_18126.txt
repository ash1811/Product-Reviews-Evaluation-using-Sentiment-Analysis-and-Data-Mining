{"text": "Great little watch that has held up well for the past six months. I use it at work (I am a nurse) and for everyday wear. It's nothing fancy, but I like the fact that it doesn't have jewelry or other pieces that could fall off or get dirty. It keeps time well and I have yet to replace the battery. Great watch!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3585252", "2": "0.18627", "3": "0.10591453", "4": "0.06729186", "5": "0.22455326", "6": "0.053104833"}}
