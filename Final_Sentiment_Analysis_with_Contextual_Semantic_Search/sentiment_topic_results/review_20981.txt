{"text": "Beautifully made, love this product, lovely fit (I ordered a half size up from my street size to get perfect bloch dance fit)But the tongue where the shoe laces up, is AGONY! the only way I can wear these shoes, is to lace up until the vamp of my foot, then lace under the toungue, leaving it sticking out and laces directly against the bridge of my foot. Which is fine but not ideal. The tongue is sewn with many layers, sponge inside, and those edge seams where the thickness of it really digs into your bridge is just uncomfortable.Good support, good cushioning both on the ball and the heel, I can do excellent pointes, even pointe work in these sneakers!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1576953", "1": "0.07943926", "2": "0.19591816", "3": "0.20747939", "4": "0.16837232", "5": "0.12473207", "6": "0.06636349"}}
