{"text": "I had a similar watch for years; never had a problem with it (I would get batteries at Kmart and Sears - but then 1 time I went to a jeweler instead and he spent an hour to put the battery in and broke the watch so that it was dead - never again to a jeweler)I tried another watch and was very disappointed - day hard to read, discolored and broken band in less than 2 years.Now I have found the same style again - easy to read both time and date, easy to set without even looking at instructions (though I  did have my old one for many years)Like everything about it, comfortable strong band.So happy I found this Casio watch. Great price too.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.29826972", "1": "0.19788803", "2": "0.14105849", "3": "0.1488257", "4": "0.13612154", "6": "0.07554952"}}
