{"text": "I plan to use these snorkeling in Hawaii. Untried in the ocean as yet but the fit is perfect and the color is flattering to the legs, cuter than black.  Plan also to have the insole glued in at the Shoe Repair.I read a comment suggesting this because the insole slipped around inside the shoe. I have been wearing them around the house and they are incredibly comfortable with a sole that's light but thick enough to deal with rocky sea floor. You'll love 'em.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.046202324", "1": "0.10421668", "2": "0.19097976", "3": "0.2529432", "4": "0.16626921", "5": "0.23617046"}}
