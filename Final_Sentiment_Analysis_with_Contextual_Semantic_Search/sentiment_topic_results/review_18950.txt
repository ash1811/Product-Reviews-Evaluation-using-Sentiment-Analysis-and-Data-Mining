{"text": "These are the Levis to get if you find 505s to be a little too baggy around the waist and seat. The 514s fit more snugly and trim in those areas but otherwise the same in sizing as 505s.There are three minor issues to be aware of. First, many of the 514 colors have the fake &#34;wear&#34; areas instead of uniform color gradations. Second, the pockets are markedly tighter than on 505s and tougher to get your hands into. Third, the fabric seems to be a little thinner than 505s (which is not a bad thing for traveling, but also probably not as tough). None of those are a big problem, just something to know.Overall I'm very happy with them and they fit much nicer than the 505s (if you want slimmer fit). After trying 1 pair, I ordered several more.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.044481274", "1": "0.27139768", "2": "0.23234823", "3": "0.17982082", "4": "0.16748928", "6": "0.10218202"}}
