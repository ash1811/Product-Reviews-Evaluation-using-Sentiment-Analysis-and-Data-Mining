{"text": "Thick, soft fabric. Sturdy and not too stretchy.  Very long adjustable straps will go longer than any bra I've ever had, good for tall or long torso. The cups are softly shaped and thick enough for modesty but are small and far apart; my cups runneth over with any bending. The soft band is almost padded because of the thick fabric and has 4 adjustments, not the usual three. I ordered 36C but will order 34D next timeI buy Jockey brand.This is a problem solver for my fibromyalgia because most bras, with their wires, stiff fabric or too much stretch, press uncomfortably on the tender skin over my ribs. This band is comfortable when snug, and the many adjustment options make it possible to avoid the transient tender areas. I'd love to have this bra with a straight top line, not V-neck, but it that's not available, I'll buy this again.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.20806447", "1": "0.19848439", "2": "0.059186574", "3": "0.16593535", "4": "0.12168004", "5": "0.14424637", "6": "0.10240284"}}
