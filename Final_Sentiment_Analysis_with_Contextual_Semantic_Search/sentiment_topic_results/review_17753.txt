{"text": "I hope this helps anyone who cannot decide which G shock to buy.There are a few hundred different models of G Shock watches out there. I own a few of them, and they are all great. They are all tough as nails, extremely accurate, and are nice looking, especially if you appreciate gadgets and technology. If I had to choose only one model, it would be this one, the DW5600E. It is simple to set, and has all the information you need at a glance. No need to push the button multiple times. It's all there. It makes sense!! It looks nice with everything you wear, and the band is soft, but tough, and very comfortable. (Theres a time, and a place for expensive dress watches.) With the price Amazon charges for this model, you really won't feel bad about abusing this piece, and believe me, it can take it!!Please, do not think because the newer models have atomic/solar, multi-band, blah blah blah, they are better. I will say they are more expensive, and bulkier, but definitely not better. Interesting technology, but gimmicky at best. If you treat this watch normally, and limit the use of the back light, the batteries last 5-7 years or more, very easily. Once the watch is set, it is extremely accurate, and may lose seconds over a LONG period of time. If you want to pay more for new features (atomic) that are not necessary, go for it. I learn the hard way that sometimes less is more. In this watches case, it is. I wear all my G's from time to time, but this one is on my wrist 90% of the time. Once you figure out that this watch makes the most sense, there's no turning back... NASA and the military can't be wrong about this model. Buy one already, you won't regret it! Oh and if you have your eye on another G, go for it!! In the end you'll wish you bought this one...", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03778703", "1": "0.31561264", "2": "0.07111599", "3": "0.12239749", "4": "0.1402776", "5": "0.07246981", "6": "0.24033943"}}
