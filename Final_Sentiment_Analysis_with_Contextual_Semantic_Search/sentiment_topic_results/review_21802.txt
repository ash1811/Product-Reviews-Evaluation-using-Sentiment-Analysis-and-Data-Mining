{"text": "I am very happy with this purchase. I received the item fast and was happy with the price.  I normally wear an XL or size 14 and wanted to make sure they fit good so I got the plus size and they do fit well.  They are pretty good quality material - had no issues when pulling up the hose with snagging and have worn them several times now with no issues.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24871771", "1": "0.36481255", "2": "0.04948588", "5": "0.104999274", "6": "0.22378315"}}
