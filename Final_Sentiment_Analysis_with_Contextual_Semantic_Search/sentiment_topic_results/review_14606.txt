{"text": "These are my favorite brand of jeans. Firstly, they are very well made; thick rugged denim, good zippers, pocket stitching, etc. Secondly, the fit for the \"Regular Fit\" jean is quite good. Room in the places that you need it while retaining a snappy styling. The length tends to be on the long side, so watch for that. Be advised that the \"Regular Fit\" jeans differ greatly from the \"Classic Fit\" jeans.  The \"Classic Fit\" jeans are for guys who are pretty darned thin; I am thinking seventeen year old types.  If the \"Regular Fit\" fits you right, as it does me, the \"Classic Fit\" will be too confining.  On the other hand, the \"Regular Fits\" are good for grown men of average build who are not unusually skinny.
