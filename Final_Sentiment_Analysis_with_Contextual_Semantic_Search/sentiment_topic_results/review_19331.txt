{"text": "Edit- you can see my previous review below.When the watch arrived the movement was not working. I went out and paid $15 to get the battery replaced and the watch started working. It periodically would be 3-4 minutes off but I would adjust it and move on with my life.Then it really started getting bad, it would be off my 15-45 minutes and finally completely quit. I thought, \"no problem\" I'll just return it to Amazon! However, I looked and saw that I was 48 hours past the return date. \"Ok,\" I thought....no problem, I'll just return it to Invicta! Then I looked and saw that there is a $28 shipping charge for warranty service.So I bought a $50 watch, replaced the $15 battery and am now expected to pay $28 to get it fixed. No thanks.  I'm done throwing good money after bad. The watch is trash, do not buy it!!!!!!!*******************************************************************The watch looks great, and that's all that I really cared about.However, the watch arrived with a dead battery which required me to spend $15 at a jewelry store to get it replaced. When you're buying a watch this inexpensive that's a huge negative.It also doesn't actually have a rotating dial for diving, which many of the other reviews have noted. Which begs the question, why doesn' the seller just change the description?", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.069172315", "1": "0.20821424", "2": "0.17898387", "3": "0.10098745", "4": "0.13662592", "5": "0.14107691", "6": "0.16493925"}}
