{"text": "i was looking for some t-shirts to camp out in, and use in town if i had to.  i picked the graphit color to go with black cargo shorts.  the color is excellent.  i'm 53 years old, 5'7&#34; normal build, with a desk job.. and because of that, i have a big gut, so i ordered 2x large.  they fit me good, no problems.  i still have some room (some).  i wanted polyester for the durability of camping, easy clean, and hopefully long lasting.  i intend to use these shirts for camping only, but of course would like to look normal if i get stuck going into town.  i believe these shirts will do well for me.  they fit me good.  i washed/dryed them once in the machines and they came out fine (with static).  i'm ok with that.  if you want to look great, then probably you'll have to look like the male model in the advert.  for myself, i only wanted durable, easy clean, and a manly color. i'm quite happy with the shirts.  for me, they suit my purpose.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07338254", "1": "0.474478", "2": "0.1741357", "3": "0.07942048", "4": "0.1247884", "5": "0.071624555"}}
