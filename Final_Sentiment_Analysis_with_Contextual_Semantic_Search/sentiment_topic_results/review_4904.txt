{"text": "This is the fourth Timex Ironman I have owned. It is not as advertised. I asked for a wrist wrap/velcro wrap watch. I received a normal wristband with holes.Also, the Timer feature has no tone at all. I really liked all my previous Timex Ironman watches, but this one has minimal instructions for usage. I am having trouble figuring out whether it works or if it has manufacturing defects.I hope there will be support for how to use this watch (with the wrong wristband)Help please, Amazon.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20362972", "1": "0.07809662", "2": "0.34438646", "4": "0.18017", "5": "0.17344256", "6": "0.017015563"}}
