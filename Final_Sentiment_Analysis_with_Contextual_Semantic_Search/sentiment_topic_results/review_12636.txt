{"text": "I am an adult woman who chose this watch to wear.  It has several features that I wanted.  The elastic band is far more comfortable than a metal expansion band and is the most comfortable type of band I've ever worn.  The watch is light weight, has numbers big enough for me to read without my putting on my glasses, and the dial lights up with a push of the button.  The only thing I don't like is that the second hands are lizards and do not allow from exact tracking.  They seem to be mainly for cuteness.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15548581", "1": "0.21307671", "2": "0.103469454", "3": "0.18397269", "4": "0.10450546", "5": "0.12960418", "6": "0.10988572"}}
