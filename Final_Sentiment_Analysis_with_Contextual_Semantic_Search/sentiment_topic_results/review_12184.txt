{"text": "My mother in law saw them on the Oprah show about 7 years ago, and told me about them, since i have such a hard time finding a good supportive fit and a pretty bra (if you are above a D, you know what I mean). Make sure you read the sizing or go to a place that sales them to get the correct size and then buy them on amazon at a 50% discount vs major department stores. My only complaint is after about 6 months the underwire will snap in the middle, or wiggle its way out of the fabric and puncture your armpit, But I also wash mine with the rest of my clothes, maybe if I handwashed with fancy detergent they would last a little longer, but i concider 6 months of supporting these girls a good long run. I love them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.080149494", "1": "0.2875334", "2": "0.107176", "3": "0.21191885", "4": "0.14520983", "6": "0.16557255"}}
