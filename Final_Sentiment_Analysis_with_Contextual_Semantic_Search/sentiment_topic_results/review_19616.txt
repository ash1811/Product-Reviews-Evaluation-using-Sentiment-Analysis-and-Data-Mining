{"text": "I searched hard to find a good quality police belt to go with my 6 year old grandson's police costume and this is the only choice I came up with.  It is better than nothing, but the belt is very poor quality.  I would pay more to have a police belt that would last, but I guess no one has decided to make one.  I had to sew the holster loop back on the third day of it being used.  However, my grandson didn't take this off except to sleep for days following his birthday.  He is happy with it even though the metal hole covers on the belt have all come off.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15064098", "1": "0.37005574", "2": "0.26540634", "4": "0.14777751", "5": "0.06117038"}}
