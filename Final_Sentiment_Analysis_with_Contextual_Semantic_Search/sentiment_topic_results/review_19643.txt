{"text": "I have owned probably 5 pairs of these in black and 4 in brown.  For some reason the insoles on the black ones all have worn out directly under the right big toe within a few months for unknown reasons while the brown pairs have never had this issue.  They are very comfortable but unfortunately due to this insole wearing out problem i'll be switching to something else this time for my black shoes.  If you are ordering a pair or whiskey/brown shoes these are a solid 5 star shoe, the black ones though are 1 star garbage. There must be some type of manufacturing difference in the insoles of the black and brown shoes that causes the black ones to be much less durable.  And before someone asks why I went through multiple pairs of the black ones the answer is that I hate going to actual shoe stores and trying them on, once I find something that fits I stick with it but in this case i'll be forced to visit the shoe store.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04493345", "1": "0.23104215", "2": "0.38941756", "3": "0.099547826", "4": "0.18074064", "5": "0.034367744", "6": "0.019950617"}}
