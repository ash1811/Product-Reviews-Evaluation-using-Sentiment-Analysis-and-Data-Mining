{"text": "Bought these 2 days ago, they arrived in 2 days after selecting standard shipping to Canada - amazing service! I have the arizona sandals with the regular footbed and loved them so much I wanted some clogs. But, because I will be standing in these more than walking, I decided I wanted the soft footbed. The soft footbed soles are much more plush and not entirely comparable to the regular sole. They are still supportive - that distinctive birkenstock footbed feel is there with great metatarsal and arch support - but they definitely have a lot more give to them. The leather upper is thick but soft and very comfy. The leather on the soft footbeds feels a little softer and thinner than on the regular footbeds. For those who love their birks but just want something a little more cushy, these are the answer! For those who wanted to love birks but couldn't take the \"hard\" footbeds, this is exactly what you've been looking for.I ordered the same size as my arizona sandals - I measure a size 10.5 medium US mens shoe on a brannock device, which according to the Birkenstock chart is a 43. But I find the 43 too large, with my toes a bit far from the end and unable to grip the toe-bar properly. So I fit a 42 regular in birkenstocks. The boston clogs fit very similar to the arizonas in terms of length and width, but the heel cup is very slightly less deep (but still quite supportive), and perhaps slightly narrower than on my arizona sandals. Because they have only one strap, they do fit looser on my low volume feet. I can wear them barefoot on the last notch, or on the second notch with regular socks. But since they are new, they will no doubt stretch, and I might have to cut a new notch for the buckle eventually.All in all a great piece of footwear. I am a recent and now devoted birkenstock convert after shunning them for years.Finally, my feet are getting the support they need, and in a handsome and comfortable package. And at the reduced prices offered here, it's a no-brainer!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17534685", "1": "0.17424098", "2": "0.056992855", "3": "0.2060914", "4": "0.10293062", "5": "0.12948588", "6": "0.15491141"}}
