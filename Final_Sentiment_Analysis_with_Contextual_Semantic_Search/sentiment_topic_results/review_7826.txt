{"text": "This item has quite a good feel to it when first using it, and doesn't feel very \"plastic-y\" like most of the other tools out there, but from there the praise ends.The height adjustment tool is a notched springboard at the end of the tool.  The purpose of this being that if you've got a thicker band, you can press down on it to align it with the pin.  The problem with this system is that it causes the band to be unstable, and if it slips on the surface of that spring board, the pin will bend and snap off.Also, the pins included with this tool, while longer than most, are the flimsiest item I've ever seen.  I realize these pins are supposed to bend to protect your watch under too much pressure, but minimal pressure not only caused them to bend but snap completely!  I went out and bought another link remover, frustrated with this one's flawed design, and it worked much better.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22824039", "1": "0.17181355", "2": "0.081347", "3": "0.1274664", "4": "0.15865056", "5": "0.09587921", "6": "0.13660285"}}
