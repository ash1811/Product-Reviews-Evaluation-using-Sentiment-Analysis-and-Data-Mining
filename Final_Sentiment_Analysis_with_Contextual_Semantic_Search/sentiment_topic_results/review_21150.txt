{"text": "Great slippers!  I recently bought these and a pair by Ellie (I believe called \"Phoebe\") in light pink and black, respectively.  I wear them around the house to make my ankles and calves stronger for when i wear heeled shoes when I go out.  Anyway, these are true to size (don't listen to the suggestion of ordering a size up) - I am a 7.5 or a 7 wide, and I ordered a 7 and they fit perfectly.  Very pretty, fluffy and not as cheap looking as other brands.  Definitely order these and not the ones by Ellie.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15049228", "1": "0.24010237", "2": "0.14631814", "3": "0.29325074", "4": "0.06130264", "5": "0.04294949", "6": "0.06558435"}}
