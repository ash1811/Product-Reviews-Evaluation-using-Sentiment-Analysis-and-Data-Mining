{"text": "I have gotten very interested in watches and have this one with a white face.  I liked the look of this one in the photo and I wasn't disappointed.  I have to have a couple of links taken out because my wrist is small but it looks great.  It looks way more expensive than it really is.  I love the black face because I wear a lot of black and a lot of silver jewelry and this compliments them well.  My engagement ring is platinum and the watches look great with it.  I just may order another one with a different color face!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1498369", "1": "0.39641374", "2": "0.20996201", "3": "0.069047", "4": "0.07057095", "5": "0.101248905"}}
