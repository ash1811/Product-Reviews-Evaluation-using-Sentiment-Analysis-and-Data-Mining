{"text": "I got these for my fiance to replace a poorer choice I had made as a Xmas present. While he's only had them for a month (so I can't comment on long term durability) he absolutely loves them! He often forgets to take them off for short trips to the grocery store, etc, and he keeps mentioning how supportive and comfortable they are. He has pretty bad back problems so it is really something that he finds them so comfortable. Good purchase!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1324547", "1": "0.4607127", "2": "0.17382777", "3": "0.06276406", "4": "0.09075222", "5": "0.055924233", "6": "0.023564272"}}
