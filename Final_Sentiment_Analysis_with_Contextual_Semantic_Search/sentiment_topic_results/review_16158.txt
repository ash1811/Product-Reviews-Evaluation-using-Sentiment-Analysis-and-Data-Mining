{"text": "I bought this for a trip to Disney, because I had read that if you keep toiletries on the counter, they sometimes get sticky from the cleaning spray the housekeeping uses.  I just love it for keeping all your toiletries in one place, and then you can hang it up in the bathroom to keep organized.  It folds in half so it fits nice and flat in your suitcase.  Tons of pockets for different sizes of items.  And very reasonably priced.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.18985477", "2": "0.23181121", "3": "0.116624884", "4": "0.26939896", "6": "0.18455632"}}
