{"text": "Don't expect this to be a cast iron product. Its plastic, but if you know what your doing, take your time and treat the watch and this tool like its more of a delicate instrument instead of a hammer and chisel, this item works great. I have removed links in 4 watches so far. Slow careful pressure on the tool and make sure its all aligned properly and the tool works great. Not sure why people have so many issues. And its only $3 bucks. Even if it breaks the next time I use it, it will already have paid for itself. Great little tool if used properly.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.10923842", "2": "0.23047191", "3": "0.2331098", "4": "0.20245539", "5": "0.16190101", "6": "0.06035312"}}
