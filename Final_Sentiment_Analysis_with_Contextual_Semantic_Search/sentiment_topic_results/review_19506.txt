{"text": "The only (slight) disappointment with this shoe is the color. In the picture it's reddish-brown; in person, I would consider it a dark tan or a light brown. Still, the color wasn't a deal breaker. I have trouble finding a comfortable shoe and this shoe is very comfortable to me. I had a couple of concerns because of the comments, 1. I was concerned that it might be too heavy, but it's not any heavier than some of my tennis shoes, 2. I was concerned that I would have to go up 1/2 size because of the fur lining. I wear a 7 1/2 and the shoes fit perfectly. The tread is great for snow, not DEEP snow, obviously, but good traction on light snow.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.089025855", "1": "0.2685747", "2": "0.20411459", "3": "0.2157334", "4": "0.04043308", "5": "0.13748696", "6": "0.044631384"}}
