{"text": "I was looking for a bag to keep my larger camping items. This bag is perfect. It holds all of the following: Coleman 6-person instant tent & rain fly, large Kelly shade house, two queen size inflatable mattresses, electric air pump, and 2 folding camp chairs!!!!!!!! Yea it takes 2 people to load/unload it from the truck, but all my stuff is in one place, and I only use this equipment for \"car camping\".", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08977586", "1": "0.12919402", "2": "0.2918146", "3": "0.23607624", "4": "0.08224966", "5": "0.05180707", "6": "0.11908255"}}
