{"text": "I bought these directly from Merrell many years ago andI am still wearing them.  They really are my go to shoe, as others described.  I also do a logo f walking for work.  The only thing that I don't like is the big ball shape of the heel and the way the rubber runs up the back.  I went onto the Merrell website and they stopped making them for some reason.  I have purchased a lot of different Merrel shoes through the years and I love them.  I am sure that I will buy more.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12276383", "1": "0.20592728", "2": "0.12067316", "3": "0.32337457", "4": "0.1345314", "5": "0.040324606", "6": "0.052405156"}}
