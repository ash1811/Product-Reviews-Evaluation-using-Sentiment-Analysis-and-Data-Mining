{"text": "I absolutely love my UGG bedroom shoes.  I wear them in the Fall and Winter when it's cold outside.  We have a wrap around deck and porch so I'm constantly going outside with these shoes.  Plus, I even walk out in the yard with our dogs.  This is my 2nd pair in six years.  I would definitely recommend them.  They keep my feet so warm and toasty.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.3364207", "2": "0.23140384", "3": "0.19418676", "5": "0.22636251"}}
