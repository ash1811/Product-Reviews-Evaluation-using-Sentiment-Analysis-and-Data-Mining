{"text": "I like the Playtex bras.  I'm not huge, 36B, the fit is perfect for me.  Playtex  may have a bra with padding that would good to wear under tee shirts, but I haven't found it.  This one only has lining.  I don't mind the wide straps with shirts or tees with sleeves, but with sleeveless shirts and tanks the straps show and that bothers me.  This is a good bra and Amazon has them at a good price, I think.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.041916948", "1": "0.2796375", "2": "0.118726015", "3": "0.29549232", "4": "0.13177949", "5": "0.060687725", "6": "0.071760006"}}
