{"text": "This boot does run a bit on the large side.  I am usually a 14 in athletic shoes, and this runs large enough so that even with thicker wool socks the boot is still a bit large.  I would go a half or full size down from what you wear in athletic shoes.The boot is a nice casual boot that matches with a lot of different outfits.  I would prefer a bit more arch support, but overall I really like the style and comfort for the price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1805291", "1": "0.087893285", "2": "0.03254888", "3": "0.42447236", "4": "0.15159814", "6": "0.119938545"}}
