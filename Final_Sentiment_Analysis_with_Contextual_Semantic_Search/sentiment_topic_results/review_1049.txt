{"text": "These shoes are so damn comfortable it's ridiculous.  A classic look, great materials, plus they'll make ya taller! How can you go wrong? If I had to pick something wrong with these shoes I'd say the sole just because it will wear away with regular use and I'll have to get another pair in a few years.  Also, make sure you get some mink oil, I had them for a couple weeks before applying it and they got a little scratched up but no big deal.  Great shoes though!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.23468961", "2": "0.20609118", "3": "0.27186078", "4": "0.12188658", "5": "0.13910092", "6": "0.023431012"}}
