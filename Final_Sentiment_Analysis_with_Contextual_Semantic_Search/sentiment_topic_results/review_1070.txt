{"text": "I gave this 5 stars because it's a great item.  I bought it for my BF to do yardwork.  He's had it about 3 years now and it's still in great shape.  As a matter of fact, he wants another if I could just find it in blue.  It's easy to clean too. Just drop it in the kitchen sink and clean it up.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04120566", "1": "0.37104434", "2": "0.2713868", "3": "0.12589511", "4": "0.09518843", "6": "0.0905061"}}
