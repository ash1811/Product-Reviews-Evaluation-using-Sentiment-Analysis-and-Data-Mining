{"text": "these slippers are super comfortable and cute..very fuzzy but not annoyingly fuzz or big.  They fit true to size for me. The hard sole is great for walking outdoors.  This is my 4th pair of Acorn slippers in the past 15 years.  They are great quality and last a long time!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0533452", "1": "0.37554505", "3": "0.23470643", "5": "0.19691499", "6": "0.12987635"}}
