{"text": "I like this watch. So far it's solid and reliable. I do have a tendency at times to hit buttons which flip it off the time setting but is easily reset. In addition this watch is big. If you are a large man with big arms it will probably look just fine. if your average size like me it might appear a bit overlarge.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.102254316", "1": "0.25877392", "2": "0.21459673", "3": "0.10619581", "4": "0.24017127", "5": "0.07351795"}}
