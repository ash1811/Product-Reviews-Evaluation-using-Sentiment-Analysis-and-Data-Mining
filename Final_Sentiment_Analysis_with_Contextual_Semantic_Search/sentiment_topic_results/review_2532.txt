{"text": "I am shocked sometimes when I pick this toy up off the floor how heavy it is. It is a heavy toy and has stood up to many hours of play, and being dropped on the floor from 'dying' hands. If you have small toddler hands this pistol may be too big and bulky for them. If you have a four or five year old who needs Cowboy Props, this is the gun for you. I don't know how educational this toy is but it is a great prop for pretend play.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04821461", "1": "0.39966515", "2": "0.18690209", "4": "0.22227469", "6": "0.13610555"}}
