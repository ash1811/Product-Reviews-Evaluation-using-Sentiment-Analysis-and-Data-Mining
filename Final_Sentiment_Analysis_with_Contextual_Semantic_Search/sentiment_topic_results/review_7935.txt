{"text": "This Wally Bag is very well made.  Solid and very useful.  Especially when traveling by car.  As a travel writer I sometimes fly, sometimes drive to destinations.  When I drive this bag is always with me.  I have larger garment bags I use for air travel.Note that they make these in different lengths.  Mine is the 40 inch.  It is perfect for my 42L sport coats.  Shorter and longer versions are available.  Different models also have different pocket configurations.I will note that the clever snap/holder at the top of the bag is difficult to close if you use thick plastic hangers like mine.  I sometimes move my stuff onto wire hangers (Yikes!!!!) and they work better.Only suggestions would be to extend the zipper down the full side of the bag and to add a biz card/ID holder on the inside.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.105182104", "1": "0.16439289", "2": "0.17051123", "3": "0.24659291", "4": "0.09229991", "5": "0.08617096", "6": "0.13484998"}}
