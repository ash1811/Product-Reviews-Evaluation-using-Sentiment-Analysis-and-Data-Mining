{"text": "Bought this watch for my brother in law. First off you have to know how to adjust the strap yourself or your gonna have to take it to the watch shop( more $$$)You will need one of those small screw driver sets to push out the pins, take off some links and adjust the length of the SS bracelet. The watch was a bit bulky for my taste and did not ooze of quality but you get what you pay for. Tricky to set up so put on those magnifying glasses and read the tiny manual(belongs in a doll house)So far my brother in law has not destroyed it(and he will) but for the 17 odd bucks I paid, I'll buy him another from Amazon.The data bank is a plus as is the ten year battery and dual time zone.Will update this review as we go along.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08830686", "1": "0.30510372", "2": "0.2093326", "3": "0.06261671", "4": "0.118593976", "5": "0.09608175", "6": "0.11996437"}}
