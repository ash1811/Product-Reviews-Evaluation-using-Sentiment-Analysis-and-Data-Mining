{"text": "I bought these pants to replace an Ultra Force pair my husband had worn out over several years of hunting and farm work.  These are true to size in the fit, and are the same good quality we loved about his old pair.  He especially likes the zipper fly, the adjustable waist and the drawstring ankles.  And of course he loves all the pockets.  I recommend these pants to anyone who works outdoors or just likes BDU pants.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10652867", "1": "0.38780603", "2": "0.15112646", "3": "0.1490654", "4": "0.070327505", "6": "0.13164105"}}
