{"text": "I wanted some socks that were warm and had more padding, as I wear socks around the house.  My feet were getting cold with my other socks.  Since these are so expensive, I ordered one pair to see if they were really as good as some of the other reviewers said.  They do run large and I would never wear them with my shoes.  For my purpose, they are perfect.  My feel stay warm and they have enough padding that they make walking on hardwood floor more comfortable.  I'm glad I ordered these.  I have not washed them so do not know how much that will deteriorate the padding.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.020811167", "1": "0.25698742", "2": "0.03353314", "3": "0.29124838", "4": "0.11712593", "5": "0.2774312"}}
