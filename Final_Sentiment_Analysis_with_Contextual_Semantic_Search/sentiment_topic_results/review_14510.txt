{"text": "This is a typically fabulous Birkenstock shoe.  It's easy to slip on and adjust the straps.  I just had foot surgery, so these soles really are helping get my feet back into tip top shape.  I love how the footbed supports my arches, toes and where my bunion used to be.  I have an &#34;inside&#34; pair and an &#34;outside&#34; pair and I  highly recommend these for anyone experiencing any foot problems.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.26150626", "1": "0.23452362", "2": "0.09900429", "3": "0.25080764", "4": "0.14660831"}}
