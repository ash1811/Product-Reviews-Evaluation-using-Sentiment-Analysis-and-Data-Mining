{"text": "I am new to Zumba, have plantar fasciitis, arthritis and have 1970's shag carpeting (I know, really?). I wanted to be sure I wouldn't aggravate existing issues or create new ones. Based on Amazon, Zappos and blog ratings, I purchased three different shoes to try find the best for me. Thank you to all the reviewers who suggested getting 1 1/2 size larger in the Capezios. I usually take a street size 8.5 and bought both the 9.5 and 10. I kept the 10s and returned the 9.5. The other shoes were Nike Musique and the Ryka Studio D. I kept the Ryka in 9 just to have a backup and to have a black shoe in addition to the white Capezios. I use my orthonics in the Dansneakers without any problems. They have plenty of padding and are easy to slide but also control. So far, so good.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.045884527", "1": "0.1622342", "2": "0.22521265", "3": "0.15067239", "4": "0.18401", "5": "0.11126605", "6": "0.12072024"}}
