{"text": "Review Summary:  I bought these for my 6 Foot 6 Inch Tall Son.  I needed black jeans which won't fade quickly and jeans that would look nice on a 6'6&#34; frame that is medium to large.  And they LOOK VERY NICE on my Son.  Fits him perfectly in all areas - waist, hips, crotch and long enough that he can fold them or just leave them &#34;bundled&#34; around the top of his shoes (as most teens do nowadays) but above all, they look very nice and fit beautifully and MY SON LOVES THESE JEANS.Rating:  We gave this 5 Stars for the following reasons - 1)  The service as always was on time and efficient; and 2) My Son is so happy with this pair of jeans; 3) The fact that I had this mailed directly to my Son in college and it made it (not that I thought otherwise but this does not always work out as SMOOTHLY with other Vendors - but Amazon is just awesome).Like/Dislike:  Love how this pair, 40x34 fits as expected.  The black color is TRUE BLACK.  We've washed them once and they still retained it's &#34;true black&#34; color.Recommend?  Yes, I would recommend this to any Teen in college who wants a pair that is Cool looking, Very stylish and current and goes with any shirt (to dress it up) or simply T-Shirts for a casual day/night.Thanks to Amazon and it's Vendors - yet, ANOTHER awesome customer service experience.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04652487", "1": "0.41935956", "2": "0.23245893", "3": "0.076849274", "5": "0.17600653", "6": "0.04651805"}}
