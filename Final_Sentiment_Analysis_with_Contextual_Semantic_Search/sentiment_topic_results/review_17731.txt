{"text": "I am a cook. I have been wearing this watch to work for the last 2 weeks. It comes in to contact with water,grease,chemicals,flour and various types of breading,various food juices, and gets knocked around a lot more than you would think. It has preformed flawlessly. I use the timer and stopwatch all the time since I usually have multiple thing cooking at same time.It has flour paste all over it and I just rinse it off under the faucet at full blast.I will try to give another review after a couple more months.Been about 2months now. Watch still looks new. I figured out I can take the soft rubber cover off with the 4 screws and clean the gunk that builds up in there. I do this about every other week. It has lost about 1/2 min. according to my atomic clock. Also I rub a little Armor All on the band and outside every once in a while.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.25373498", "1": "0.20655264", "2": "0.21064703", "3": "0.1194602", "4": "0.08247526", "5": "0.056472834", "6": "0.070657074"}}
