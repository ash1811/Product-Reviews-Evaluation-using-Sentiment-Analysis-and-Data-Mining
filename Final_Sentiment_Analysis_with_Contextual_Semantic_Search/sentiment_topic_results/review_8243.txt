{"text": "I only buy Levi's.  I buy two styles.  I know my sizes well - fortunately they have not changed in over 20 years.  Unfortunately, Levi is incapable of delivering a consistent cut (both waist and leg length).  This is the second pair (of 5 recent purchases) where the pant size is not close to the marked sized.  THis one is monstrous in the waste (at least two inches too large) and short in the leg (at least one inch short).
