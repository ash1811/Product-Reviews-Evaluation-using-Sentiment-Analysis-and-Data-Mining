{"text": "The original Orange Monster! What can one say but that this watch is the standard in collectible and affordable auto divers. This one along with the Black Monster are staples in any diver collection. This is a real dive watch and it is an every day wear as well. The Monster is high quality with fine detail/fit/finish and for the price there is nothing better on the market.You cannot go wrong. If you like the bold orange dial go for it...if you want more laid back and casual go with the black dial...or do like most and get both! For the cost of these classic watches you cannot help but collect them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.113629386", "2": "0.39195776", "3": "0.17531224", "4": "0.023934253", "5": "0.103955746", "6": "0.1888619"}}
