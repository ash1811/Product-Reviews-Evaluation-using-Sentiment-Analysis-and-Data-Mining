{"text": "I've worn Rockport brand for many years and I've purchased more than a few pair of these very shoes.  However, when I purchased this most recent pair of the World Tour Classic,  the decline in quality workmanship was very noticeable. The shoes are now made in Vietnam and the look of inferior materials is very obvious on this shoe. The logos and Rockport brands are still in the same place, but \"made made materials\" (cheap plastic?) has replaced what used to be leather.  Very disappointing for a $ 100 shoe.  What has happened to what was once a good company?", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.102676205", "1": "0.29755223", "2": "0.23271598", "3": "0.16196057", "4": "0.17261535", "6": "0.029549832"}}
