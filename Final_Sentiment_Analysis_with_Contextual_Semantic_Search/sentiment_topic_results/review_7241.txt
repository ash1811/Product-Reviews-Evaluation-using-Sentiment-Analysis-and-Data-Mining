{"text": "I looked into transition tights because my daughter has suddenly developed a major sensitivity to toe seams on socks and tights. She takes ballet/tap once a week and started complaining to her teacher that her tap shoes hurt. Turns out it was the tights seams. I read on a dance mom forum to try transition tights for a girl who hates seams because &#34;the seam is a hole on the bottom&#34;. Clearly it's not the case with this particular pair. I slid the seam under her toes and she seems fairly satisfied so we'll see how it goes.On a sizing note, my daughter is slim, 34 pounds, and 3 months shy of her 4th birthday. The waist band is snug, the legs are snug, and there might be a 1/2 inch of room for height, but in my opinion these would not fit the average 6 year old.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03978218", "1": "0.16467234", "2": "0.14375858", "3": "0.23291181", "4": "0.09478956", "5": "0.18693542", "6": "0.13715014"}}
