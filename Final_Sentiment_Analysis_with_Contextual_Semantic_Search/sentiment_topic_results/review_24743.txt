{"text": "As a basic short to lounge around in, these are pretty comfy right out of the box.  I expect them to get even more comfortable after repeated washings.  I got the large size, however, and though I was worried that they would be too big (I usually wear a medium for this sort of thing), they actually wear a bit smaller than expected.  So those of you who normally wear 'large' sizes may find this to be smaller than what you expect.  Otherwise, a solid product.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04288561", "1": "0.17741396", "3": "0.26651236", "4": "0.09697019", "5": "0.30470696", "6": "0.108385004"}}
