{"text": "I originally tried to pull out links by using a push pin and hammer, what a big mistake, end result - had to take it in to a jeweler and paid more than I wanted, so when I got a new watch, I once again decided to do it myself but this time I ordered this Paylak.  My first impression of this product - I thought what is this piece of crap, but I'm here to tell you, looks are deceiving, never judge a book by it's cover, comes to mind.  LOL  I was so shocked that It was so easy, the pins slid out so quick and with ease and left my watch intact.  No ding or bangs from hammer as my other watch.  So before you go on Youtube like I did to learn to remove a link, get this device, you won't be sorry.  As of January 13 -  I've help two family members remove the links off their watches too!  They were so impressed with the ease of the links being removed and no damage to their watches.  Great Product!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.083084494", "1": "0.27270454", "2": "0.22135887", "3": "0.091117114", "5": "0.10024057", "6": "0.22877961"}}
