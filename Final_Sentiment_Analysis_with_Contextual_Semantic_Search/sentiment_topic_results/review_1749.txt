{"text": "I am hooked on these panties. I am about 160 lbs these days and ordered the size 7 which is Large.They don't ride up; are very comfortable and have a flattering fit.The fabric is lightweight, nice and smooth along with the cotton crotch lining.The fabric is very giving/flexible material and easy to care for.My only problem has been in the wash....The lace comes apart a bit after being in the washing machine and I have to cut the string bits off. Not a major problem. I think the recommendation is to hand wash. Maybe gentle cycle is the ticket.Either way, these are my favorite. I have upwards of 20 pairs.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.34421372", "2": "0.23621179", "3": "0.08477221", "5": "0.09423357", "6": "0.23544626"}}
