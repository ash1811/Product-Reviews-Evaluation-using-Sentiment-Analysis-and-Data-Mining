{"text": "The set was actually really nice looking. BUT, the center stone is tottally crooked! It really throws off the look of the ring and the center diamond has no height to it at all. I really dont know how to feel about this set because its a really beautiful set. But it also has a really big flaw. 50% good and 50% bad. But otherwise nice and believable. Im returning my set that i just recieved today. Not happy about the center stone at all.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.092185706", "1": "0.44272098", "2": "0.084593534", "3": "0.089005835", "4": "0.08188007", "5": "0.16934985", "6": "0.04026406"}}
