{"text": "Bought these for \"house shoes\" as an alternative to the hot, overpriced and uncomfortable products a local specialty store was pushing.  Other reviews didn't make it clear- you heat these in the oven for 3 minutes and mold them to your footbed.  The arch support is fantastic and I'm having no plantar fasciitis pain.  Truly wonderful.  There is no way these are just staying in the house.  I can envision needing several pairs of these shoes.  Plus the Amazon price was much lower than other internet options.  I bought a size 9- I normally wear a 9.5-10 but these accommodate my wide foot so well they fit like a glove.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08313738", "1": "0.21647766", "2": "0.11049805", "3": "0.18790165", "4": "0.21402396", "5": "0.079571635", "6": "0.10838969"}}
