{"text": "I really needed an outdoors shirt for when working in the brush -..mostly to protect myself from poison ivy and scratches. This is a great shirt for that use. I normally wear a 2XL tall dress shirt, so ordered a 3XL version. Perfect fit with good room for stretching and for wearing a longsleeve tee underneath. Nicely prewashed and soft to the touch but its is very strongly constructed. Highly recommended.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12897383", "1": "0.43810192", "2": "0.13255881", "3": "0.11283864", "4": "0.08175651", "6": "0.10227498"}}
