{"text": "I have a pair of the mid height boots in the Targhee style and I love them, I'm going to do a lot of walking and wanted the low cut version for the warmer weather. Great tread and great support. Fit was definitely what I expected and needed.One of the previous reviewers mentioned something like feet would sweat. Well, mine do too, more so then my boots which is strange.  This is the ONLY think I wish KEEN could figure out better.  I know they are 'water proof' so I know the downside of that.I would buy this shoe again and of course other shoes from KEEN. I've purchased many in my life.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05215146", "1": "0.3206245", "2": "0.112264864", "3": "0.21294984", "4": "0.12189462", "5": "0.0826477", "6": "0.09746702"}}
