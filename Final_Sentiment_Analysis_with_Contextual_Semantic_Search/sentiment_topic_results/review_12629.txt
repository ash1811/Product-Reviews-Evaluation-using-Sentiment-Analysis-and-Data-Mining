{"text": "I have high arches so I always wear Birkenstock's Arizona, but when winter and bad weather come around, it's important to have a closed clog for more protection and warmth. I generally buy Merrell clogs for this purpose but their prices are just getting out of hand. I wear a 38N (narrow) in Birkenstock and I ordered an 8 1/2 medium in this shoe; with a black pair of crew socks, I have a perfect fit. These Easy Spirit Slip-ons do not have the arch support that I need but I replaced the insert with a Merrell insert and this brought the arch of the shoe up to meet my own. This is a good way to determine if you have the proper arch support.For the moment, (until they are completely broken in), I am using these shoes as slippers around the house as I have never found a supportive slipper with enough arch support for my needs. These keep my toes warm and I can certainly run outside with them if need be. They are light as a feather and have a good solid non-slip sole. They also have a good sized toe box which is something very important for me. These shoes support my feet on the sides as well and keep my feet balanced within the shoe. Great price for a very good shoe, highly recommended for fun, style and warmth.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.069761656", "1": "0.30636075", "2": "0.111311354", "3": "0.30476505", "5": "0.100920565", "6": "0.10441421"}}
