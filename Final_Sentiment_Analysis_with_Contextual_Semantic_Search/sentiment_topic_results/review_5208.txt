{"text": "If I had read the earlier reviews then maybe I would have not had my Husband invest in buying these Ugg slippers. They are warm and cozy. But what I didn't like is how the intereior lining of the shearling wore off on where your heel sits. Mind you I wear a size 6 and only 104 lbs. So believe me it wasn't my weight or if I wear them endlessly day in & out. Just got them 3 months ago. Wanted to just wear around the house for the winter months which my feet gets cold. The bottom sole is a bit hard to walk on but please do not waste your money. I didn't even buy this on Amazon. They were bought in a dept store and yet the quaility of this slippers are disappointing. Especailly from a high end name as Ugg's. I wanted to share my comment here anyways so I can spare the disappointment.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09141921", "1": "0.24815479", "2": "0.024477111", "3": "0.20690647", "4": "0.06072152", "5": "0.22171415", "6": "0.14660674"}}
