{"text": "We live in the Northeast part of the U.S. which means a short cycling season for those of us who love to ride.  Much of the time it is not foul weather or ice slicked roads that keeps us from rolling out but the cold. We have really good outer gear that we like but knew that the base layer would make the diffrence between heading out for the day or sitting inside.  The silk stuff we currently use works great but we wanted to push the envelope and see just how cold it could get and still be comfortable.  We also did not want to bother with the expense of heated gear so we decided to try this product.We went out today, temps ranged between the mid 40's to low 50 degree range.  Instead of our heavy weight outer gear we wore our mid weight stuff (mesh jackets with liner in  a tee shirt and fleece pants) over this product.  That is it. The base layer preformed beautifully.  We were dry, comfortable and most importantly warm.  Today was supposed to be a short two hour trip but we ended up staying out all day. When we got home and peeled out of our gloves Poly was bone dry as was our skin.  Love it.We are not finished yet.  We are waiting for temps in the 30 degree range and will try the product under our heavy gear. I am confident that it will work just fine. Stay tuned.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11365205", "1": "0.24429062", "2": "0.21678782", "3": "0.16979133", "4": "0.0672481", "5": "0.08400099", "6": "0.10422912"}}
