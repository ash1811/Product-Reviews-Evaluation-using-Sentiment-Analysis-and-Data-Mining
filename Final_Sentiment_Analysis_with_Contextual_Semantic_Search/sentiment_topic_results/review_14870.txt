{"text": "Just requested shipping label. Although nice in appearance it it is flawedThe strap is velcro attached with a weird huge heavy buckle that holds thethe short straps together when an adult tries to use it and the ends don't meet.Nice color and all but useless even for very light loads.What angers me is this is the perfect size for me and the light sketching stuff I carry around except for the 2 or 3 inch too short strap.Also not waterproof or water resistant.I like the makers style , so I hope they read and learn cause I think they would hit pay dirt with a few changes", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.3532671", "1": "0.13755499", "2": "0.17286378", "3": "0.17485493", "4": "0.094875336", "6": "0.064192675"}}
