{"text": "This bra is pretty, but has very pointy cups! The cups did not have much lining, and the center seam where the lace met the bottom solid portion seemed to contribute to the problem. It was not the look I wanted so I am returning. I did try the Glamorise Magiclift Seamless Support T-shirt soft cup bra, in the same size, with much better results. Just round curves with that bra, instead of sharp points. I will stick with seamless design and a little more lining in the future.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11730639", "2": "0.088158", "3": "0.4571453", "4": "0.08974902", "5": "0.13181268", "6": "0.11271212"}}
