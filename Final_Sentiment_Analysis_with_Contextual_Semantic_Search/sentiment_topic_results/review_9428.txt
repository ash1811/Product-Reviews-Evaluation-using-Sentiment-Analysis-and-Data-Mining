{"text": "I wanted to get some comfortable slippers for my husband, and me loving the comfort and quality of my UGG boots, figured this quality could be translated into a men's slipper.  I gave my husband a pair similar to these two years ago, but were of courderoy-type fabric.  I had to come back and get the suede because he WEARS THEM OUT OF THE HOUSE!  These at least can pass for shoes at first glance, and with longer pants, no one looks twice.Needless to say, I will be buying these again -when- he wears through the last pair.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.37839726", "2": "0.03609593", "4": "0.17511721", "5": "0.23788708", "6": "0.16653344"}}
