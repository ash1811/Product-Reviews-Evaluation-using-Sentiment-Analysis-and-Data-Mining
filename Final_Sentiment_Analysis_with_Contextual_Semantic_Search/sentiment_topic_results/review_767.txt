{"text": "I've worn these for years now as a vet tech, and love them. Finally, a scrub pant that is tall enough and looks a little stylish.  I normally wear a XLT, and have probably 6 pairs of these. Well, this pair is way too big. Since I've worn them for so long, I didn't even bother to try them on, just tossed them in the wash, put them on and off to work. I can wear them, but they are really baggy. Quality is also a little less than my other pairs. I can actually see through these.  Not happy with the quality control. I highly recommend trying them on before you wear or wash them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10174142", "1": "0.32618725", "3": "0.2760817", "4": "0.095848", "5": "0.057096064", "6": "0.14065473"}}
