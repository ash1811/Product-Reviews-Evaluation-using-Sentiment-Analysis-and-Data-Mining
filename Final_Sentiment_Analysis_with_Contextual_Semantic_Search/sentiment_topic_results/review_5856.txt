{"text": "This necklace is extremely pretty; while the pendant is significantly larger than I was expecting (it's about an inch across, maybe a bit bigger), it still works as formal or casual jewelry.  The matching earrings (Sterling Silver Open Double Flower Earrings) go perfectly and can really class up an outfit.  I was worried that the \"double\" flower aspect would make both the necklace and earrings too busy, but that is not the case at all.  Generally speaking, I think they can go with any outfit and I would recommend them highly.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.26567227", "1": "0.3201369", "2": "0.18671966", "3": "0.21902215"}}
