{"text": "I have owned this balaclava for three years now, and have much appreciated the warmth it has provided to me.As an asthmatic who has cold-induced asthma flares, it is important that I keep my nose and mouth warm when I am outdoors.  Most other asthmatics I know just wear a scarf in front of their faces, but I can't easily do that because I am also alergic to wool (lucky me!) and most synthetic scarves are too thick to safely tie around my face.  This balaclava is PERFECT for me, though, because it covers my nose and mouth, but it thin enough that I can breathe through it safely.In addition to having legitimate health issues (asthma) that restrict my comfort in the cold, I have a much bigger issue with cold-- I am a pampered brat when it comes to &#34;extreme&#34; cold and &#34;extreme&#34; heat (&#34;extreme&#34; being my definition, not an actual scientific measurement. :) ).  Therefore, I complain incessantly when I am cold or hot.  It is unrelenting, and therefore, for the comfort of those AROUND me, I need things to make me comfortable.  This balaclava provides that comfort I need in order to make OTHERS comfortable to be around me!Made of polypropylene, this balaclava isn't as soft as fleece, but is still comfortable.  It is *slightly* water-resistant, so it can be used in a light snow or mist without getting soaked.I have now used this balaclava in wind, snow, and just &#34;darn cold,&#34; and have been thrilled with its performance in each situation.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.083364315", "1": "0.27868646", "2": "0.10089071", "3": "0.14383379", "4": "0.15955034", "5": "0.07438088", "6": "0.15929352"}}
