{"text": "After just having bought a pair of bad jeans for my husband, these Lee jeans were a very nice change.  The color, \"Steel\",is a blue that is fresh looking and does not appear too worn.  The fabric is sturdy while not being overly heavy and stiff.  The fit is perfect on my husband. I know Lee is a quality manufacturer of jeans.  Don't know why I didn't order these before.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.0559365", "1": "0.30269876", "2": "0.059851795", "3": "0.049816407", "4": "0.1566649", "5": "0.17376155", "6": "0.20127015"}}
