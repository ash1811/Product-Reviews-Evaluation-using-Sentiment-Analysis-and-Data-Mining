{"text": "I read some of the reviews on this shoe and decided to buy the size based on the largest shoe I fit and then go up a half size.  Perfection!  In regular shoes/dress shoes I fit an 8-81/2 but in boots I am a 9.  I bought this shoe in a 91/2 and it fits perfectly.  This shoe provides the perfect traction as it lets me twirl around on the dance floor with ease, but not slide out of control.  I have high arches and this shoes seems to fit them perfectly.Besides books and appliances, this product has been my most favorite buy from Amazon!By the way, the price is great!!  In the store it's almost $20 more!!!!!Thank you Amazon and CaPEZIO!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.022439139", "1": "0.24682935", "2": "0.36720777", "3": "0.14196415", "4": "0.09443747", "5": "0.065166846", "6": "0.06195525"}}
