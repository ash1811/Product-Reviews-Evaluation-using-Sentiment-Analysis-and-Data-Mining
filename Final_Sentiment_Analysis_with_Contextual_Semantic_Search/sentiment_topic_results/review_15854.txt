{"text": "Some reviews of this bra say it does not have enough support.  I am a 44DDD, and I have no complaint.  Rather, I say this bra gives plenty of support and is very comfortable.  Also, it does not have the wires pushing up in the middle, as some other underwires do.  Wonderful, supportive, and comfortable.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.4741265", "3": "0.19173235", "4": "0.16292334", "6": "0.15332417"}}
