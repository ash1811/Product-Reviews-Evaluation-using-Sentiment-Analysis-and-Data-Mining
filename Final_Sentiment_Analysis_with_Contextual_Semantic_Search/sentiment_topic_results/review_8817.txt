{"text": "Pretty good work socks. I wear steel toe boots at work and need comfortable well cushioned socks that keep my feet dry and these work pretty well for that. The only negative is that they seem to shed quite a bit of black fuzz. I've had them for about a year and they don't seem to have lost any of the thickness though. I wear these year round and while my feet do get hot in the summer these seem to move the moisture away from my feet. Solid choice though I wish they didn't shed as much.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.21724752", "2": "0.037634715", "3": "0.33573702", "4": "0.2517308", "5": "0.083259135", "6": "0.0716889"}}
