{"text": "Nice watch, excellent price (under $10) but not as nice as one I owned in the 80's.  It's sold as a 'UniSex' but it is so small in diameter that it has the look of a ladies watch (and I'm not that large of a male 130lbs.).  The watch itself is very thin, and the strap is also very thin.  Bought it because it's cheaper to buy a new one then have the battery replaced!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.2839418", "2": "0.29057774", "3": "0.15934904", "4": "0.19051042", "6": "0.067435876"}}
