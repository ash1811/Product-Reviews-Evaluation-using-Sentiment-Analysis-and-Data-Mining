{"text": "Anybody who has owned Clarks knows they are extremely comfortable.  This model is no exception, for sure.  I like my shoes a little on the shiny side.  These shoes come with a nice shine to them, and they shine up nicely, as well, with a little polish.  I have been wearing them to work 5 days/week for about 7 months now, and they look like the day that I bought them.  Importantly, they are just as comfortable as on Day 1, too.  For the price, I cannot imagine a better pair of shoes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.26216528", "2": "0.16048282", "3": "0.16467611", "5": "0.12695085", "6": "0.27975425"}}
