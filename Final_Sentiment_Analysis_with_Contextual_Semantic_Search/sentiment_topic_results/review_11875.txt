{"text": "No need to write a long review on these jeans. QUALITY. SUPER (as advertised) FIT. MAKES ME FEEL GREAT.  And, I still feel this way after 6+ washes!  I will buy more!

The jeans just make me feel younger.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.27066135", "3": "0.27679387", "4": "0.034596715", "5": "0.16808091", "6": "0.24320857"}}
