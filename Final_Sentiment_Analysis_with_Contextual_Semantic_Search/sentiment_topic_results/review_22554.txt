{"text": "I really like this costume. I got a Medium size and my measurements are 34D in the bust, that's the only part that was very snug on me, but I with some help I was able to comfortably stay in the outfit. I'm 6foot and the length was not as short as I thought it would be so that could also be a plus for anyone wanting to wear this in public without something underneath. I even purchased a petticoat to make it poof out more, and it still wasn't too short. The gloves are terrible though. I'd definitely suggest purchasing a better set if you want to include gloves in your outfit. The crown is kind of eh, it didn't break on me at all, and stayed in place in my wig, so that's good. It's just not peaches crown, so if you're trying to do a true cosplay, you might want to buy a nice one from a seller on etsy or something like that. The jewel on the front is not sewn on, it's a broach that you pin onto your dress, so make sure you remove if you're going to wash it. It does not come with any knee highs so you're going to want to get some for it. Also, I recommend not wearing black heels with this, as princess peach wear some pink pumps under her dress. The sleeves stayed up on my shoulders, a little itchy at times, but they were a nice effect. Overall it was a good buy, I recommend going up a size if you're more endowed in the breast area for sure.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.19188958", "1": "0.27743903", "2": "0.102184296", "3": "0.21919733", "4": "0.032288577", "5": "0.09919013", "6": "0.07781106"}}
