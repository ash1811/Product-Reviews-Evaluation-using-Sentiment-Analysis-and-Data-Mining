{"text": "These flip-flops have a very nicely cushiony sole and the typical rubber straps, and are well made with no irritating edges or lumps like I've experienced with cheap (or sometimes not so cheap) sandals. The 37/38 BR fit fine on my 71/2 wide feet. How durable they are, only time will tell - every flip-flop I've ever had ended up with the thong part between the toes pulling out of the sole or breaking.As the description says, the shoes are labelled with the men's size. Mine are marked size 6 but are a women's 7/8.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08656181", "1": "0.22860286", "2": "0.24026181", "3": "0.21188746", "4": "0.03461719", "5": "0.07068896", "6": "0.12737991"}}
