{"text": "This is a great pair of workout shorts.  I wear mine to the gym 3 times a week.  I bought the navy.  It is soft and comfortable material.  I like that the cut is above the knee much more comfortable for workouts without the pulling on the knees when changing leg positions.  I like that it is solid and not the least bit see-through.  The drawstring waist is convenient and secure.  There are two rather deep side pockets.  Deep enough to hold my keys without having them fall out on the floor when raising my legs in different positions.  I wash regularly in regular warm water mode with no color fading after a full year of washing.  Nice price too.  I am going to get another one, black, as soon as I am done with this review.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06628092", "1": "0.47550893", "2": "0.033217393", "3": "0.099369474", "4": "0.08469609", "5": "0.06568624", "6": "0.17524092"}}
