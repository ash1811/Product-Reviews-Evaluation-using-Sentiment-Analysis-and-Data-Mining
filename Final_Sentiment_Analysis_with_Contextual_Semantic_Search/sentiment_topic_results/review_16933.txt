{"text": "And he is very familiar with the brand and how it fits...however these bib overalls didn't fit as expected. They were to small and so were going to have to return them for a bigger size.  We ordered a size 38 34 which is what his jeans size are, .and they fit like jeans should from hips down...however from hips up, not so much...he sYs they were a little tight in the crotch area and pretty tight around the chest and stomach area. The length was right, just didn't measure up,on the rest. So if your a big guy that carries a little bit of a belly or plan to use them for getting on the ground or floor to work on cars and need that moving space in your pants and waste  I'd go with a size up with these. Everything else was great about the overalls, the color, the stitching on the seams...double layered knees and the straps had a section that was stretched type material for the even bigger guys. Very nice overalls they just run a little small.  I'll come back and hope to  give it 5 stars when we can get a proper sizing back. The package was done properly and they got here on time. I'd order from this seller again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10387323", "1": "0.232965", "3": "0.31023785", "4": "0.20274402", "6": "0.14505349"}}
