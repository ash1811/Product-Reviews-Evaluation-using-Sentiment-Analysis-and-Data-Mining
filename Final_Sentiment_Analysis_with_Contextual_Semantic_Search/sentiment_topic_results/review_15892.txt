{"text": "I am really happy with this purchase. I bought this to wear with my wedding dress that is strapless and want to feel supported and sucked in for my big day.I normally wear a size 34DD bra so that is what I ordered here.The 34DD fits me perfectly.ADVICE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ISSUES WITH FITTING:I used to work in lingerie and know that about 80% of women wear their bras in the wrong size. If you feel like you fluctuate in sizes you really dont, you are just wearing the wrong size! I suggest that you go to your local department store and have a lady trained in lingerie just measure you so that you know and you beat the issue. Some brands run a bit different but in that case its the brand, not your measurements. I wear a solid 34DD but can wear a 36D (in some bras) or a 32DDD (in some bras) However the only bras that work for me are my correct size. Take the guess work out if you plan to order online.-The fit is tight like it is supposed to be. It flattens and smooths my stomach and gives me that perfect hour glass shape I wanted and needed.- It is sexy and stylish with removable garters I will tack on later and hook up to some thigh highs when I take my wedding dress off... it is hot enough that I can wear it like lingerie. form, function, and sexy- cant beat it!-the back is low which is nice for dresses that plunge.. fits under my dress discreetly-good support and I know Im not going to pop outThe things I didnt like were the price, which is a bit steep I believe but I wont dock it because I could have opted for  something cheaper and more crappily made! I have no regrets!The other thing is I wish that the front came down just a bit farther. I have a short torso but still found that I wanted it a tad longer so I wasnt worried about any stomach getting smashed out the bottom.I am 5'6&#34; and weigh 140lbs 34DD bra.There are also two settings for hooks and mine was attached on the looser of the two (I am hoping that by my wedding in 5 months I can cinch it to the tighter clasps- fingers crossed!) I was really worried that it wasnt going to be as tight as I wanted but it truly does the trick!Very happy!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.30771738", "2": "0.13169879", "3": "0.19728468", "4": "0.061756514", "5": "0.08798197", "6": "0.21104473"}}
