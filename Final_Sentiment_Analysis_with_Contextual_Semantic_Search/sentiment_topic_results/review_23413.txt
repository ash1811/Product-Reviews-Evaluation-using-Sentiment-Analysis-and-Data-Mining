{"text": "These pants are ones that you don't want to pass up. First of all their price it not seen this low anywhere else and the quality is quite nice. They are double stitched all the way through with what feels like extra cloth in the knees and butt. The color is pretty close, with only a slight difference from true ACU. The material that these are made of is a tough nylon, with a good and solid feel to them. This can easily be fixed with a few washes like I did. Overall these pants are ones that you don't want to pass up for the price and quality.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.101074144", "1": "0.39259186", "2": "0.13360009", "4": "0.1000016", "5": "0.15845041", "6": "0.11146949"}}
