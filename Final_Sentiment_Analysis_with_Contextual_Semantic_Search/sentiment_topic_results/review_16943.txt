{"text": "I like and work in these almost daily they are that durable. I'm normally rough on my clothing but these do take the abuse of farm life. The stretch of the elastic strap is an added benefit for my extra range of movement.  They first came abrasive and stiff but nothing a couple of washings didn't take care. The extra padding in the knee is outstanding for now I don't hesitate to get down into the dirt.  BUY them again?  YOU BET! I'll also buy some for the 6 yr old grandson, who is my main helper.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14785342", "1": "0.28873342", "2": "0.15273066", "3": "0.13082506", "4": "0.07736755", "5": "0.1996216"}}
