{"text": "I have several pairs of Birkenstock sandals and love them.  Birkenstocks tend to be durable and high caliber.  To make a good thing even better still, you get a ready-made, built-in arch in Birkenstocks.  However, for those who do need orthotics, you can wear these without and still get good arch support.  They are also extremely comfortable.These shoes are ideal for long walks and are very attractive.  As another reviewer on the Amazon US boards pointed out, these shoes do come in European sizes, so it is important to know what size you wear.  I like the heel or backstrap as it provides extra support.Birkenstocks meet just about every foot/walking need.  I find these shoes a Godsend and of extraordinary caliber.  They do tend to be expensive, but they are worth it.  Birkenstocks will meld to your feet and once your food leaves its impression, you will walk with comforot.  If you order online, you have a wider price range.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15153149", "1": "0.12505", "2": "0.14531101", "3": "0.28114584", "4": "0.07306804", "5": "0.09550451", "6": "0.12838912"}}
