{"text": "I got the Large for an upcoming 10 day boating vacation. It is plenty large, the XL would definitely have been too big. The side pockets are roomy and there is also a zipper pocket on the front. It came all folded up in a little pouch, so that's pretty cool it packs down that small. Unfortunately, upon opening it had a very strong factory odor. It has been sitting outside to air out for about 24 hours and it still smells strong. Also I can see a little hole in the bottom where the stitching is overlapped. I may need to wrap my pieces in other bags inside this bag. I hope it holds up!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1309304", "1": "0.22512129", "2": "0.05158492", "3": "0.20588124", "4": "0.13832629", "5": "0.077510215", "6": "0.17064565"}}
