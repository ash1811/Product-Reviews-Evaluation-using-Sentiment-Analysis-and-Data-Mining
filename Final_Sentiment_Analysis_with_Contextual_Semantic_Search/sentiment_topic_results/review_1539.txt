{"text": "I bought this because I used to walk to and from work and wanted to be able to carry everything I needed. I used this backpack everyday and sometime stopped by the store and carried all my groceries in it. It has held up pretty well - no holes or zippers that won't work. Its been over a year and it still looks like the day I got it. And its pretty compfy too. I don't mind carrying it on hikes for hours.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.101637974", "1": "0.32475698", "2": "0.29653278", "4": "0.05853716", "6": "0.21117234"}}
