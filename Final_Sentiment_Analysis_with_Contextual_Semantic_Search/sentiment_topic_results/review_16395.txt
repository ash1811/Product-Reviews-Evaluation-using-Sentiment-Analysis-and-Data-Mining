{"text": "Great pair of sandals. The arch supports work great as I have fallen arches. They fit to size. They do require some breaking in though. The first time I put them on I went for a long walk and ended up rubbing a soar into the bottom of my foot. They also tend to squeek when I walk from my foot rubbing against the flip flop. I'd buy another pair.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07078264", "1": "0.33379006", "2": "0.09034304", "3": "0.13290009", "4": "0.21539927", "5": "0.07250923", "6": "0.0842757"}}
