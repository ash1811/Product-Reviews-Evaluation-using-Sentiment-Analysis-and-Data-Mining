{"text": "I've had these for a little over a month now.  They fit OK but if you're barefoot, which I usually am, the fur not the inside sheds terribly.  When I take them off I constantly have to pull fur off my feet.  The interior fur feels really, really fake so they don't even have that going for them.  They are very, very warm.  I've worn them outside several times (in the winter) without issue.  However, inside my feet become boiling hot very quickly.  With the shedding issue I'm afraid to wash them lest I be picking fake fur out of my washer, dryer and clothes forever.  Overall I wouldn't buy these again.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.056436185", "1": "0.2233887", "2": "0.10112755", "3": "0.21529362", "4": "0.18848841", "5": "0.146235", "6": "0.06903051"}}
