{"text": "I bought a new pair of these shoes to 'supplement' the pair I've been wearing for five years.  The old ones are still in great shape, still look good, but I didn't want to chance a problem.  Bought the 9-1/2 regular width.  Slipped them on...a little snug, wondered if I'd make it through the work day, considered bringing my broken-in pair just in case.  Well, by the middle of the first day, the new ones had broken in and fit perfectly.  These are really well-made shoes, they last forever, they're always in style, and what more can I say?", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.029529035", "1": "0.2957432", "2": "0.085989766", "3": "0.26049435", "4": "0.08563787", "5": "0.19573836", "6": "0.046867426"}}
