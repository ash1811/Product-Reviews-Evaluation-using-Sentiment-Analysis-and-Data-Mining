{"text": "It is getting harder and harder to find well-made, long-lasting women's underwear. The brands we've depended on for decades, Fruit of the Loom and Hanes, are deteriorating in quality by the year, to the point that within a few more years they might as well be labeled \"disposable\" underwear meant to be worn once and then thrown away.This pack does come with assorted \"fashion\" colors, which is nice, and there are six in the pack. But even if you hand-wash them, they will begin to fall apart after only five or six washings. The stitching on the elastic goes first, then the elastic itself begins to fray, then it loses all its stretch. After that, into the trash they go.In order to get undies that last longer, unfortunately, a higher price has to be paid. So far brands like Jockey, which are about four-five times as expensive, do seem to last much more than four-five times as long. One model to look into is theJockey Staycool Bikini. They cost about $6.00-8.00 per pair, so I suppose it is definitely a case of \"you get what you pay for.\"", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14996022", "1": "0.30223984", "2": "0.02995358", "3": "0.1674904", "4": "0.06002473", "5": "0.12728035", "6": "0.16305085"}}
