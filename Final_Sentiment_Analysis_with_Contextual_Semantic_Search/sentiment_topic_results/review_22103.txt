{"text": "I purchased these Fox River Ragg Gloves for wearing while driving during the winter. Fingerless gloves allow me to have a more secure grip on the steering wheel and I can hold things like cups easier. I found these glove surprisingly nice and thick. They are warm and the size small was a perfect fit. My ring size is between 5.5 and 6.5, and the size small gloves were exactly the right size, not too tight at all. While I don't find the material itchy, it isn't super soft either. You're not going to mistake these for cashmere or anything like that. It reminds me of what some pairs of wool socks feel like, not exactly soft, but still warm. They look really cute and at this price, they are a good deal.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14502099", "1": "0.30396", "2": "0.14003204", "3": "0.19298156", "4": "0.05146643", "5": "0.118717276", "6": "0.047821682"}}
