{"text": "When I ordered this product there were 2 colors offered - white and black.  Should be clear as black and white, right?  But the color picture of the \"black\" shorts showed as grey which was my preference.  I figured the pictured color was considered black.  Drat, wrong again.  The shorts arrived and are a very black black, not a grey black.  Not a big complaint for me but still a little annoying.  Everything else appears OK.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13271487", "1": "0.2456614", "2": "0.13798706", "3": "0.24903628", "4": "0.063834384", "5": "0.16736145"}}
