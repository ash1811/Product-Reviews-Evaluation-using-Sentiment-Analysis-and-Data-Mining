{"text": "I had a watch like this for years. When it went dead, I was disappointed. I was delighted to see that the same type and brand  was offered on Amazon and immediately purchased another. It is my favorite. It does fit very loosely and is not a stretch band. However, I like the loose bracelet fit and find it comfortable. The watch arrived promptly. I am satisfied with the purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18519217", "1": "0.27402204", "2": "0.1301668", "3": "0.12635064", "4": "0.1524367", "5": "0.05067996", "6": "0.081151694"}}
