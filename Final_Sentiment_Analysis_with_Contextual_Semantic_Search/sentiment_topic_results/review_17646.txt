{"text": "I have been buying these silk \"pointelle\" long tops and bottoms for several years now. They suit my purposes perfectly, and there is nothing else like them.  First of all: they are very thin and sheer, but that's how they are meant to be. Silk will keep you warm, without overheating you, that's the nature of the fabric. I love them to sleep in--they are just right. It's not often terribly cold in my area, but when it is, wearing these tops and bottoms is a good solution, to give that extra bit of insulation without bulk. In fact, you hardly know that you are wearing them.Because they are made of sheer silk, they are delicate and need to be handled accordingly.  Hand wash (I put mine in a mesh bag, and use the \"handwash\" cycle on my washing machine). Dry on low. And be careful that you don't snag them when you wear them.The fit is snug, so I order a size up.Enjoy!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3141686", "2": "0.08303801", "3": "0.25627056", "4": "0.06969423", "5": "0.07580262", "6": "0.19875367"}}
