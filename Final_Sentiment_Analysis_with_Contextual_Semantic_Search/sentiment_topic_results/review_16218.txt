{"text": "First reaction is it is a good slipper, warm and comfortable.  From past experience I get slippers a bit smaller than my regular shoe size because I've never had a slipper that didn't stretch and in a short time fit loosely. This slipper fits like expected, except maybe a bit more narrow than expected.  I can't seem to keep the laces tied. No problems with quality so far, I will update if that changes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1267611", "1": "0.39997935", "2": "0.088821284", "3": "0.18867543", "5": "0.043394282", "6": "0.14903817"}}
