{"text": "Very nice ring organizer. The actual box is relatively cheap looking, but it's an excellent organizer for rings.....any size rings. I have quite a few huge rings that I didn't think would fit, but it will hold them, plus thinner rings. Great purchase, very pleased!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.6487532", "2": "0.11432034", "3": "0.17538576", "4": "0.046182524"}}
