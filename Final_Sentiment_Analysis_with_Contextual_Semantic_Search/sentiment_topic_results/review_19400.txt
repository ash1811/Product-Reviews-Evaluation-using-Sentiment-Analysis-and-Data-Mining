{"text": "Im 5'6, 150 lbs, with a medium build. I was looking for a 100% Poly Shirt for undershirts and these are great. I have purchased other 100% Poly Brand t-shirts, to include 5.11 Tactical, Under Armor, Walmart Brands, Hanes, Champion, and the list goes on. I guess I am picky when it comes to the way a shirt fits but in my opinion,  these fit extremely well. Other brands were either to short in the sleeves, neck to stretched out, fabric to thin, faded to quickly during washing, or the vertical length was to short, which was a pain if you tuck your shirt in and then when you bend down your shirt comes out. This shirt has a snug neck, not tight, which I like. The sleeve length falls just above the elbow about 1 inch, and the vertical length extends mid crotch level, so if you tuck your shirt in, it should not come out. I was also surprised on the thickness. It is thicker than most 100% poly sport t-shirts. It also looks good for casual wear as well. This is only based on the black t-shirt. I purchased only one to see how it fits. I would recommend this to others. I plan on buying more. Also, for the price and free shipping, it beats or meets other brand prices.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14683811", "1": "0.43435115", "2": "0.12569024", "3": "0.14258273", "4": "0.028626584", "5": "0.046321437", "6": "0.07558972"}}
