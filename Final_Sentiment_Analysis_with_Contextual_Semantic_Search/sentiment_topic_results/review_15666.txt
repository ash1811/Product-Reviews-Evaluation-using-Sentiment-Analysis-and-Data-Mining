After a few months of use they stretched out a ridiculous amount, now they do not hold everything in place at all - they might as well be boxers.  I recommend \"Calvin Klein Men's Prostretch Trunk\"  they are made of a thicker material that seems to be holding up much better than the \"Calvin Klein Men's Micro Modal Trunk\".", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03413228", "1": "0.5294574", "2": "0.08908683", "3": "0.18513268", "4": "0.035855714", "6": "0.122844964"}}
