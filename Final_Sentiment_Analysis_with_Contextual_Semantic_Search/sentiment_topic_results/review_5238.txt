{"text": "I am so happy with my purchase of \" Isotoner Women's Classic Ballerina Slippers.\" I ordered the large but I probably could have gone with the medium. I wear a size eight shoe, but I did not want them tight either. I think after I wash them once they will be perfect. They are made extremely well, and just what I was looking for. They are very light weight, with fabulous cushioning on the inside sole. Great for wearing on hard tile floor's; that was my main reason for the purchase. I would highly recommend these slipper's.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08282261", "1": "0.44714206", "2": "0.07787323", "3": "0.12277123", "4": "0.076955654", "5": "0.08065397", "6": "0.11178121"}}
