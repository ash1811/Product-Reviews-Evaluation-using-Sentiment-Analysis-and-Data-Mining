{"text": "I bought a Timex just like this one, only silver colored, 25 years ago at a flea market. It finally gave out and I went back to the same flea market for another Timex water resistant watch. Imagine my surprise when  similar items were now going for more than $40, and none were quite what I wanted (my old Timex back!) So, I searched on line and found this, the exact same one! Love it. And, I paid a few pennies less than I had 25 years ago. Great service, too, as the watch arrived sooner than promised .", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21530205", "2": "0.35187027", "4": "0.034776296", "5": "0.20953278", "6": "0.18363959"}}
