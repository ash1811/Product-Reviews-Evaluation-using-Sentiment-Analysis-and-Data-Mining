{"text": "I called Levi's to see why they are now low on the hips.  They informed me people called and asked us to.  I said, well people that LIKED the way they fit weren't calling!?! Why don't they make NEW designs, instead of changing what people like!?!  We also had to get 2 pairs.  1st pair the seam went across the front of your leg, instead of the side.  They were also super long.  I am so dissapointed.  I told Levi's we are going to have go to another company, there isn't anything left for my husband with them.  They don't have anything to replace these now that they are changed.  On a side note for people smaller sized they said the closest thing to these are Silvertab Levi's.  Sadly, they don't make them up to 44, they stop at 42.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.0904102", "1": "0.17269066", "2": "0.13088857", "3": "0.20552087", "4": "0.1978404", "6": "0.20032272"}}
