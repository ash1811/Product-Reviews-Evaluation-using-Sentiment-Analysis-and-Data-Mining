{"text": "I bought these for my husband after he admired my pair of women's Frye 12R boots (which is not something he typically does!).He is very particular about what he likes and dislikes but I thought I'd take a chance. He also has quite wide feet so I was a bit unsure if the regular width Frye boots would fit.As soon as he tried them on I knew he loved them and they're now his favorite boots! I bought him an 11.5 medium in the Gaucho colour (this is the same as the women's Tan colour). It's a gorgeous natural light brown.Perfect fit and perfect boots!Thanks Frye and Amazon!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10473921", "1": "0.3488086", "2": "0.046175197", "3": "0.04721518", "4": "0.2697465", "5": "0.08194434", "6": "0.10137095"}}
