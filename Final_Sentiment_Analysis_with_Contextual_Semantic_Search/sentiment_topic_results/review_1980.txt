{"text": "to any wardrobe! The thing about these panties are: you HAVE to size up. If you are not sizing up, they are NOT going to fit right, or control what you need them to control. I bought one pair - according to the manufacturer's sizing - and quickly found out that they were too small. Tried the next size up, and got the rolling effect. Tried two sizes up and I was in the zone. They squoze in tight though, so I went three sizes up and found the pair for me. Now, I'm not saying that YOU have to go three sizes up to find the right pair for you, but it is doubtful that the right size will be your normal size. I would start two sizes up to be safe. This seems to be the general consensus from everyone that I know that owns a pair of these.  Besides, who wants to feel like a stuffed sausage under your clothes??  Final word: buy the right size. Once you find it, you will see that these are a must. Let's face it, this designer found a niche in the market and now everyone is trying to capatilize on her initiative. Most of them do the trick, but how comfortable are you? The feel of these power panties are fabulous, and once you find the perfect size for you, you can be stylish, smooth, AND comfortable in your clothes. I don't leave home without mine!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.029632432", "1": "0.16995792", "2": "0.17848513", "3": "0.5070912", "5": "0.030206019", "6": "0.08211254"}}
