{"text": "I am happy with this backpack--it's well made of good materials and the strap system is much better for my back than the typical configuration.  My only gripe is about the capacity:  it's advertised on amazon as having a capacity of 2332.69 cubic inches, but the tag with the pack specifically states that the capacity is only 2015 cubic inches. A difference of over 300 cubic inches!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.21440798", "1": "0.4146647", "2": "0.102213554", "4": "0.19352287", "6": "0.066759594"}}
