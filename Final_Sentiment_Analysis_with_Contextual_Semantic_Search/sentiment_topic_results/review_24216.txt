{"text": "Have owned this bra for several years.  Holds up well.  I am between sizes.  35 would be a great size!!  I have to order 36, because 34 is too tight.  It cuts off my air, unless I add the spacer onto the bra.  That's why this time I ordered the 36.  Only real problem with any bra I have would be the bands always \"roll\".  Have never found one Not to roll.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14392745", "1": "0.19248798", "3": "0.48732376", "5": "0.060278792", "6": "0.10840829"}}
