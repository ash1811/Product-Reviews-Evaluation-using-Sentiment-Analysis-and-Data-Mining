{"text": "I looked everywhere locally for white pants  when I started volunteering at the local hospital.  No luck anywhere.  So I found and ordered these on Amazon and was very happy that they were a bit baggy and long even though this is the size I always get for all pants.  They are more durable than painters pants but not as heavy as jeans. They were very comfortable at first until my wife washed them for the first time. The wash and dry methods was the same we use for my jeans and most other clothes.  They shrunk over 2.5 inches in length and 1 inch in width, even at the leg. I took pictures comparing a brand new second pair I have, but I can't post them on here on Amazon. But trust me the visible shrinkage is astonishing. While they still barely fit, one more regular wash and dry and they would be done.  So I have to add these to the other cold wash and hang dry clothes I have.If you plan to use hot wash and dry method I strongly suggest you get at least one size bigger and wash them before the first wear.  Other than the shrinking issue they fit the bill perfectly for white pants.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.26360345", "2": "0.10552587", "3": "0.11963279", "4": "0.18596171", "5": "0.14326459", "6": "0.17954034"}}
