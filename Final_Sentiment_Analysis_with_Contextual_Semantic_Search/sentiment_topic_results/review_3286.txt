{"text": "It has been 33 years since my husband has been wearing Levi's, and refuses to try any other brand.  They really are great and last forever.  Good quality, well made and they wash really well.  The &#34;BIG SECRET&#34; , for him is the sizing.  He wore a 32 x 36 , when we married in the regular boot cut Levis, but after years went by he  had to go up to the 34 x 36,  and that was kind of OK for him until that size got snug.  When I came across the 550 relaxed fit, AND he could still wear the same size, and they were comfortable and looked the same as regular fit, all was right with the world! So I have to say, after all these years and his refusal to even look at another brand, really says something.  He runs a rather large truck body business, and spends a lot of time in his office, but he still loves to work on them, and weld and all that other stuff,  and they hold up extremely well.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12784016", "1": "0.3203274", "2": "0.05560835", "3": "0.23930073", "4": "0.101904176", "6": "0.15254417"}}
