{"text": "There are many styles of 18 hour bras and I was trying to find the one I tried on at a local store. This one is not as soft and the straps have about 5 inches of elastic in the back. It fits, still feels good at the end of the day, is fairly lightweight and doesn't have underwire. Plastic O rings attach the straps to the cup and one was broken when I got it. The man in my life substituted a metal keyring; so far that is holding up well, even in the washer.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11667484", "1": "0.38213933", "2": "0.10550538", "3": "0.07729224", "4": "0.21723439", "6": "0.09810614"}}
