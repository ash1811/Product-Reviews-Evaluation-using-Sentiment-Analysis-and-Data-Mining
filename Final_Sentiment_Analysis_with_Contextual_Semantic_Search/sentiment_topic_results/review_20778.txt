{"text": "Here's what you as a perspective buyer needs to know:It's great QUALITY and very WARM. I'm 5'11\" and 140lbs, I ordered a large and although it's a bit big in the shoulders and chest, the length is perfect. It doesn't look too bulky, but if I wanted a \"snugger\" fit I would've gone with a medium (at the cost of a shorter length).My ONLY complaint is that the material on the inside is very itchy and rough. I don't always wear long sleeve under my sweatshirts so it's definitely uncomfortable to an extent. Overall, it's minor compared to how warm and thick the jacket is.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.041060086", "1": "0.46038243", "2": "0.15649405", "3": "0.12791006", "4": "0.07330976", "5": "0.08913722", "6": "0.051706374"}}
