{"text": "My brother bought this case for his watches a few years back, and why I was somewhat jealous of it, I didn't own enough watches at the time and already had a smaller display box. As soon as my collection outgrew the display box I had, I knew what I wanted. This is a gorgeous display box, two drawers (as pictured) and includes a lock. In my opinion, the lock is really only going to protect your watches from a small child and otherwise, is just a nuisance (if you actually lock it). Nonetheless, each watch sits in its own little protective shell on an individual cushion. That was one thing I disliked about my previous box - it had 5 individual cushions and one long cushion. If you put more than 2 watches on the long cushion, it was a pain to get the watch you wanted off of it. This display box avoids that by providing individual cushions for all 20 watches, each in a sectioned-off area. My only gripe is that you can't really put anything else in the box besides watches. I can't fault it for that, since it is only meant for watches, but I was hoping I could store some things like my wallet, passport, sunglasses, etc in the bottom drawer. Because of the individualized sections built into the box, you can't do that. Oh well. All in all, this is a great watch display case.Summary: Beautiful display, two drawers, individualized cushions with built-in sections for each watch.
