{"text": "This is just what I was looking for and so reasonably priced you can afford to have several different colors!  The grippers are very sturdy; you don't need to worry about the grippers popping loose.  The inside of the gripper is plastic, not metal, so you don't have to worry that it will tear holes in the fabric of your pants.  I like the 'X' design that has two grippers in the front and two in the back, so that when you are sitting in a hard-backed chair you don't have that metal clasp digging into the middle of your backbone.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16104999", "1": "0.27301425", "2": "0.08368583", "3": "0.06995563", "4": "0.27255362", "6": "0.13614304"}}
