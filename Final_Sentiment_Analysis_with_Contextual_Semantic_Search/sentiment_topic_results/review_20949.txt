{"text": "Given that the only thing harder than tungsten carbide is diamond, my ring has remained free of any scratches since I bought it 2 years ago.  It still looks brand new.  I've dropped it countless times and done things that would scratch up normal rings (rock climbing, yard work, etc) and all it needs is a quick wipe on my shirt and it's back to new. The metal has a distinctive dark gray/pewter bluish sheen to it, and it often grabs people's attention and starts up conversations.The ring is very comfortable, easy to take on and off, and the fit is perfect.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24344094", "1": "0.25270584", "2": "0.06337572", "3": "0.17546684", "4": "0.060411785", "6": "0.202252"}}
