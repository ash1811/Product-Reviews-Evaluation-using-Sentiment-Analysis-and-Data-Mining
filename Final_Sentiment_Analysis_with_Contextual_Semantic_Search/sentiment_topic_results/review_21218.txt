{"text": "This is husband's second pair of Keens. He chooses this style to protect his feet from the rain and cold, otherwise he wears his Birks. His other Keens were quite worn. These arrived in 2-3 days. He popped them on, then out the door he went. Says they feel &#34;fine.&#34; High compliments from him. The inserts are not glued in, so he can use his own inserts, as he needs the extra arch support. No complaints here.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10922905", "1": "0.12309201", "2": "0.08595974", "3": "0.12345157", "4": "0.16576569", "5": "0.16647786", "6": "0.22602408"}}
