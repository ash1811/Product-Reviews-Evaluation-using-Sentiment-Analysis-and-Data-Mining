The band is a little snug-feeling by the end of the day - but that's why I opted for a front closure (and can reasonably unhook the bottom 1 or 2 hooks).Hopefully some ladies agree with me:  the bra I put on in the morning (comfy) is not the one I take off at night (band is too snug).  This bra is as close as it comes to being the best answer to that problem.  I look the array of colors it came in too.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.27865043", "1": "0.21743037", "2": "0.059423458", "3": "0.1734357", "4": "0.14135185", "5": "0.066644736", "6": "0.06306349"}}
