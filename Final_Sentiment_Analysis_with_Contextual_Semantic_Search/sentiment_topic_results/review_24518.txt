{"text": "I searched on line for days and days to  find a brand which featured long  straps to  cover the &#34;sticky&#34; part which tend to eat pants cuffs.  One  popular brand was returned  with short straps.  These straps are long enough, but the inside quality is  the same as any other brand.  The sock liner is  rough  (and I cannot wear socks, which makes it kind  of scratchy) and the arch support  does not exist.  They were almost returned  because the quality is the same as less expensive brands but I decided I do not need any more hassles with  shoes which will  always be used indoors and never  outside.  If you walk a lot, this ain't  it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.02656963", "1": "0.24091175", "2": "0.2074272", "3": "0.29892108", "5": "0.101093635", "6": "0.12271912"}}
