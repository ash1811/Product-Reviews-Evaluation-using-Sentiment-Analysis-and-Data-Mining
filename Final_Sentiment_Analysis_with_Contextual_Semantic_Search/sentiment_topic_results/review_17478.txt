{"text": "These boots are great!  They fit true to size and I haven't noticed any pinching or rubbing that could cause discomfort in time.  The one thing I have noticed is they are fairly snug across the top of my feet, nothing that would deter me from wearing them and they have stretched a little as they have been worn.  They are also surprisingly water resistant.  The first day I wore them we had a big dump of snow and I was a little worried about how they would hold up as I trucked through a foot of snow.  But I had no issues, the rubber soles had decent grip and my feet stayed dry.  My calves measure 13 1/4&#34; and the boots fit very snug which is great for bare legs or thin leggings, but I'm not sure how well they will fit over top of jeans or other thicker pants.  The heel is a perfect height and I can easily wear these to work with dress pants, a skirt or dressed down with a pair of jeans.  I would definitely buy these again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.033242203", "1": "0.2423875", "2": "0.12100758", "3": "0.119969405", "4": "0.23182456", "5": "0.09748478", "6": "0.154084"}}
