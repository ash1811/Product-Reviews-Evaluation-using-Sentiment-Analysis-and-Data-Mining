{"text": "The watch is great but the strap was too long.  I bought a different strap and now really enjoy wearing it.  The watch face isn't really black but more of a dark brown color.  I find the numbers on the watch and the date very easy to read.  Overall I am very happy with my purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.48958567", "2": "0.32229224", "3": "0.07491901", "6": "0.09784978"}}
