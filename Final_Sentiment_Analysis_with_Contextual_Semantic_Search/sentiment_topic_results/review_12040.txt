{"text": "Consumer reviews on Amazon and Zappos convinced me to try this brand. I had been searching for a brand I wore for years, 3 in fact, all with all leather soles, and all leather uppers . . . they are not made any more but mine have lasted for a long time, and my cobbler loves me! Now I found the Trotter Liz shoe.To give you a hint of what I deal with I have a high arch, high instep, and one foot is a size wider than the other and a 1/2 size shorter (polio did that). So, I have always bought very good shoes, but even those \"very good shoes\" could \"KILL\" me at times. This size is a bit too long, and wide for me, but . . . I'm not letting either pair go! This navy is a very dark navy but it really shows \"its' color\" when paired with greens, white, and Khakis.Fast forward to now - I love this shoe! I have this in navy and a caramel brown color - and have compliments on them all the time. I read one woman's comment someplace saying she had one in every color and know I know why - it's a comfortable, attractive, and stable shoe that can be worn all day. I hope Amazon let's us know when each one goes on sale and I am still afraid of trying the other styles so I never face disappointment in Trotters.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.039683625", "1": "0.2061005", "2": "0.1997412", "3": "0.35304767", "4": "0.11987502", "6": "0.07911514"}}
