{"text": "Great jacket! Very warm! I've only warn it a few times but it fits great.  I got a Tall size because I'm 6'5\" and I don't think I've ever had a jacket fit so well.  Looking forward to having this for the bitter Chicago winter.  It's stiff at first, but that's what you'll get with tough gear like this.  If you want something soft and fancy looking, go somewhere else (i.e. northface, columbia). This is definitely a tough jacket for tough guys!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.0376882", "1": "0.3798505", "2": "0.20783368", "3": "0.13428645", "4": "0.06662584", "5": "0.07428942", "6": "0.09942593"}}
