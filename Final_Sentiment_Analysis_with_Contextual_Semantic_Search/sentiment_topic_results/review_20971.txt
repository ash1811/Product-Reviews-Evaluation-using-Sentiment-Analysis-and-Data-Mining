{"text": "Ad shows description for composite toe, that's the 2272 GX-8. What you get here is the 2268, it's the same boot WITHOUT COMPOSITE TOE. I had to return this and pay another 13 bucks to get the right ones. Description clearly stated COMPOSITE toe, so hopefully somebody changes this. Otherwise they run a bit small in width compared to similar boots. Once I get the right ones I'm sure they'll be awesome.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07130637", "1": "0.18897572", "2": "0.32360327", "3": "0.14167106", "4": "0.114625", "6": "0.15676405"}}
