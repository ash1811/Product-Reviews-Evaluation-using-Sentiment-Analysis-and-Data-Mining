{"text": "Nothing, and I mean NOTHING shows through this bra.  It's the perfect t-shirt bra.  Padding is very thin but stiff and hides better than the softer contour cups for me.  Takes a bit of breaking in but so worth it!  Once it's on, you need never worry about showing more than you'd like, you've got perfect round curves all day.  I did find the band a bit tight at first but it loosened up within a week of wearing and is now comfortable.  I didn't get the torpedo effect at all.  For me, one size smaller in the cup fit best.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.22324155", "2": "0.06305172", "3": "0.24763899", "4": "0.07879603", "5": "0.12997799", "6": "0.254678"}}
