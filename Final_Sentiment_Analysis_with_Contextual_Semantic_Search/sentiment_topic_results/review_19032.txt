{"text": "After spending hundreds of dollars on Victoria Secret bras and having to throw them out after a month I decided to give this a try. I just didnt know where to go anymore for comfortable, fitting bras. I bought this before I went to Linda the bra lady for a fitting and of course found out that I was wearing the wrong bra size so I was a little scared about getting this before going to her but as it turned out the bra fits perfectly even though is not the size I was told I actually was. To my surprise this was a perfect and it is so comfortable I may just get more.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.038548898", "1": "0.31321704", "2": "0.09959686", "3": "0.31386042", "4": "0.03313272", "5": "0.09597525", "6": "0.10566879"}}
