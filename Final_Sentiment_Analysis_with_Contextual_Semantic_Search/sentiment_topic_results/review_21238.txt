{"text": "About a month ago we took a vacation that involved a lot of walking.  I wish I'd had these shoes then!  The fit is exactly as shown, the arch support is excellent, and the shoes are as comfortable as any shoe I've ever owned.The first time I wore them we ended up walking over two miles.  I had no hot spots or any discomfort with no break-in.Possibly as impressive is the appearance.  The quality of the leather is excellent, and the shoes, although designed to be worn as a dressy shoe, do take and hold a shine.I'm noting this brand so I can re-order when or it I wear these out.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.19030192", "1": "0.19723901", "2": "0.28142256", "3": "0.16404475", "4": "0.042310387", "6": "0.12202235"}}
