{"text": "I have been looking for a comfortable, lightweight sneaker to take on an overseas trip where we will be doing a fair amount of sightseeing.  These sneakers fit the bill.  They are the most comfortable sneakers I have ever owned.  I have been wearing them on my 2 to 3 mile daily walks and the shoes provide the right amount of support.  The leather tops are soft and keep my feet cool.  I also like the fact that they only weight 9.6 oz.  Most of my other sneakers are much heavier and after prolonged use leave my feet and legs feeling fatigued.  Overall these sneakers are an excellent walking shoe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20027156", "1": "0.27134892", "2": "0.0930172", "3": "0.16382737", "4": "0.05324292", "5": "0.2157336"}}
