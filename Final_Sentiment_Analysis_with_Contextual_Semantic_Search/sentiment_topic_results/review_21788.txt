{"text": "I use this shaving bag to replace a very heavy leather one that was quite large. The Ensign Peak is at least as roomy, but much lighter. I keep a lot of items in my bag, so this is saying quite a bit: shaving cream, razor with extra blades, toothpaste and brush, bottle of shampoo, nail clipper, tweezers, safety scissors, steptic pencil. The zippered outer pocket is very convenient for a few bandages, tweezers, etc.  Other reviewers were unhappy with the thickness of the material, but it's much thicker than I expected. I had a similar product that lasted over 20 years but was much thinner, in fact.  I highly recommend this product.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07534043", "1": "0.21824817", "2": "0.17139314", "3": "0.11825907", "4": "0.13270478", "5": "0.12512039", "6": "0.15893403"}}
