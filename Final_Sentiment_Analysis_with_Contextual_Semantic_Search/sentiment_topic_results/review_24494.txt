{"text": "I have worn the green Superfeet insoles for years based on the recommendation of my podiatrist. I stand, walk and run in heavy work boots all day long.Recently after a foot injury he recommended I switch to the orange Superfeet for a little more padding. I have worn them in my regular shoes and work boots for months and my foot has fully recovered from the strain injury. My feet also feel less tired at the end of the day with these insoles.These usually retail for about forty bucks, everywhere. So if these are below that price-point or at it, buy them quick.I would highly recommend them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.027125014", "1": "0.05816816", "2": "0.19266278", "3": "0.15346375", "4": "0.19861284", "5": "0.113857426", "6": "0.25611"}}
