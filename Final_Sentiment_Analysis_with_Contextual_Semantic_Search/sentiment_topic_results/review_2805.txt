{"text": "I love these shoes.  Went to the mall today and tried on several gray casual shoes, including Superga.  Some which were highly recommended.  I knew I had these arriving today but thought I had better cover my bases and see what else was out there.  My favorite are these keds.  I have been wearing them all afternoon, and they are very comfortable.  Leaving for a trip to the New England states  in two days and these are definitely going on the trip.  I wear a 5.5 and they fit perfectly.  I did have a problem with the shoe strings.  They came with two pair, one yellow and one white, and the white ones were frayed really bad.  Amazon made it right.  Was very pleased with there service.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14640576", "1": "0.2766364", "2": "0.1953409", "3": "0.07157547", "4": "0.14009623", "5": "0.11091208", "6": "0.059033185"}}
