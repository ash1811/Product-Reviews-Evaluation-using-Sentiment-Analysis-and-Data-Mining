{"text": "The Heather Latte in Large looked like a baggy paper bag.  I wear a Woman's 10/12.  The Large was oversized in an unflattering way.  The sleeves are VERY wide.  You don't get much coverage at the bottom, even though the robe runs large.  It will \"gap\" along the legs.  I am 5' 10\" and the length was just below the knee (not a plus as far as I'm concerned). As another reviewer noted, the fabric is almost translucent.  It DOES cling.  Okay if you want something to travel with that doesn't take up a lot of space and is very light-weight.  It IS warm given the weight.  I tried hard to like this robe (given the very positive reviews other buyers had given it), but gave up in the end and returned it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13449131", "1": "0.22453068", "2": "0.069296196", "3": "0.24113607", "4": "0.055332314", "5": "0.15844423", "6": "0.116769224"}}
