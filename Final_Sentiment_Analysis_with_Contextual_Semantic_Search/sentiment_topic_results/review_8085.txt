{"text": "Great shoes. They fit to size.  The only issue is in the insert.  There is a gel pad that after time will start to loosen and the sticky part will bunch up the bottom of your sock.  I brought this to the attention fo Dockers and they sent me a bag of replacement inserts that don't seem to have the same problem.  This is my third pair of brown.  I have also gone through two pair of black and am on my third pair.  Love these shoes!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.22785084", "2": "0.18372193", "3": "0.11733", "4": "0.09139819", "5": "0.25156873", "6": "0.12446214"}}
