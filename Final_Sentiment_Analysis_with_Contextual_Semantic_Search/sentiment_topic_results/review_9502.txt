{"text": "These are quality sandals.  I originally ordered size 10s, but they were too big.  Returned those without a hitch, and ordered 9s.  These fit much better.  The velcro straps make for easy adjustment.  Nice thick soles and solid construction.  I've taken up hiking/backpacking and got these for camp shoes; I suspect these'll serve for a good long time.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07051928", "1": "0.36621514", "2": "0.09664057", "3": "0.16628397", "4": "0.12023222", "5": "0.07054134", "6": "0.10956748"}}
