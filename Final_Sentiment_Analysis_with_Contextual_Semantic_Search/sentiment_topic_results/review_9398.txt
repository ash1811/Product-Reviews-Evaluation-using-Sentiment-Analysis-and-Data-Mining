{"text": "The model I purchased was described as a 'small' size. But I can't imagine what a medium or large bag would be.  I doubt that I'd easily fit this bag in the locker of a spa I sometimes go to.  I'm certain that I'll have to empty everything out, and collapse the bag before it would fit in the locker. And the material has a 'cheap nylon' feel.  It would be fine for storing a lot of items in the floor of your closet, or if you were planning to take a trip around the world and needed to carry as much clothing, etc. as possible.  But it's just too massive for a quick trip to the gym.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10875742", "1": "0.37008342", "2": "0.11202466", "3": "0.08609907", "4": "0.14757995", "5": "0.05424064", "6": "0.121214785"}}
