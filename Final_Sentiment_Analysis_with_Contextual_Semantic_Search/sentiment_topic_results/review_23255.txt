{"text": "I gave this 3 stars because I like it for sleeping in, but I am a very small person and even on my small frame it seems to ride up really bad on me as if the shoulder straps aren't long enough (I generally keep my bra straps on the tightest settings so beware if you don't!).  I originally got a medium and then bought a large later on, but even the large was too tight over the shoulder.  Other than that it works great.  I will say I usually pull the whole thing up over my boob rather than try to pull the cup down and keep it there.  Overall, comfy and cheap.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.073545545", "1": "0.2525585", "2": "0.1970767", "3": "0.20723267", "4": "0.050987653", "5": "0.15967707", "6": "0.058921844"}}
