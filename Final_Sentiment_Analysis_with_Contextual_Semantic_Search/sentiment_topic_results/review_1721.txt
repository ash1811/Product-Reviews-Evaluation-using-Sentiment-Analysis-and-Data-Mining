{"text": "I love these boy shorts.  They are perfect for me.  They fully cover my derriere and there's no creeping, there's no pinching, the lace doesn't roll up (that's a big plus), and they are great for wearing when you want no visible panty lines.  I know I'm going to slowly build my collection so I have one in every color.  I seriously wear these and jockey no panty line boy shorts.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.20166726", "1": "0.4085249", "3": "0.06187486", "4": "0.09337089", "5": "0.12777768", "6": "0.10319712"}}
