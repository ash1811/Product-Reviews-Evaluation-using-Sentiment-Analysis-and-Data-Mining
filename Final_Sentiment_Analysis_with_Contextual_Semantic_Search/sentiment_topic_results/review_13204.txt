{"text": "I bought this for my 18lb baby in Medium size, but the diapers is WAY TOO small.  There's no way my baby will fit on it.  However, my baby's legs are quite chubby (thicker than a bottle of water).  So I had to exchange the diaper, which was super-easy.  I got a Large size, but I'm already regretting not buying an extra-Large.Haven't tried the diaper in the swimming pool, but once I do, I'll update my review.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2910213", "2": "0.09028426", "3": "0.17465155", "4": "0.0344918", "5": "0.2713156", "6": "0.13474435"}}
