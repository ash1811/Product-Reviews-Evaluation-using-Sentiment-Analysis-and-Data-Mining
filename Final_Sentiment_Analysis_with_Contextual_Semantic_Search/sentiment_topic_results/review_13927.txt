{"text": "I picked this one up. A little cheaper than I see here on Amazon.  For the price I paid, I like it.  I like the fact that it has an alarm. I have read other reviews about the alrm being too quiet. I don't use mine to wake up, I use it as a reminder.  It's fine for me. It's a nice looking watch. I've owned it for a few months and haven't had any strap issues.I like this more as a  suit watch, not so much casual wear. The contrast on the face is not as bold as it looks in these photos. I like it overall.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.12338117", "2": "0.22147048", "3": "0.2822519", "4": "0.25945032", "6": "0.10747364"}}
