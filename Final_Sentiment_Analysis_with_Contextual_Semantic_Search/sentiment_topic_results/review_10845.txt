{"text": "Not only did these slippers not fit, after wearing just a short time the insole padding goes flat.  Not up to Isotoner's reputation sorry to say.  I wear a 9.5 by the way and these were large even after washing in HOT water trying to shrink them some.  I will wash again and give to my granddaughter.  Sorry but I had to replace with something else.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05328717", "1": "0.409039", "2": "0.12306524", "4": "0.2200134", "5": "0.08587475", "6": "0.10423447"}}
