{"text": "I have used these style of boots for about 7 years now for while at work.  They are good looking and very light weight. I love how they unzip and are easily removed without having to untie and tie every time.  They hold a nice spit shine on the toe and are comfortable.  I wear these at work every day and I can usually get about a 1 and a half year of use out of them before the rubber sole starts to come apart or wears too badly.  One minor complaint is every time I buy a pair of these boots the price goes up, whats the deal?", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07995548", "1": "0.36717513", "3": "0.18364266", "4": "0.12242236", "5": "0.1921008", "6": "0.05212673"}}
