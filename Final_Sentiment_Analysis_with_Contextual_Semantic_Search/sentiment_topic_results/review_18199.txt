{"text": "Pros-1) It cost $20.36 for a fantastic looking watch.  I've already received compliments on it.2) In addition to the Analog feature, the watch features a \"full\" Digital menu of options (Alarm, Timer, Stopwatch).3) I like the Light because it's Yellow, and most watches have green lights... I think it's more pleasing to the eyes.4) Easy to set time & date.  But, you should read the instructions -briefly- to set the analog time.With today's cell phone & \"iPod\" technology, I'm not sure who uses a watch \"databank\"... I certainly don't.  It's a bonus feature.  I mostly bought the watch for Pro #1 listed above.Con-1) NO Second hand, but the Digital portion's seconds replaces the need for one.  Still, I think it would look better with a second hand.Well, I hope this helped.  Happy Shopping!  :-)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15712187", "1": "0.14180799", "2": "0.21116531", "3": "0.2002977", "4": "0.18921341", "6": "0.098483816"}}
