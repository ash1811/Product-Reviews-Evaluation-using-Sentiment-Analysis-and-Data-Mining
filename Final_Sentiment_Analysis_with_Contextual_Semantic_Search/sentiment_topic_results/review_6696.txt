{"text": "This is a very very large canvas tote. I use it to go shopping as I can place all my parcels in it without getting bogged down and best of all, no one can see what I bought either. It is very durable, great straps which allow you to wear it on your shoulder. Great for holding exam papers and scripts without damaging them. It was worth the money. You will have no regrets with this bag.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.062311333", "1": "0.29329672", "2": "0.16790728", "4": "0.2521232", "5": "0.21641184"}}
