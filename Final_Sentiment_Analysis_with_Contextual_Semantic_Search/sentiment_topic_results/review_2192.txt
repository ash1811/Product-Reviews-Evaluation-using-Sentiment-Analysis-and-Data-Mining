{"text": "It's difficult to find athletic sneakers with extra wide widths in retail stores...none of these hugging your feet while working out or athletic activities for me.  But luckily these Skechers Afterburns X-wide lives up to its claims.  They're a no nonsense style with a clean, sharp design, well-padded soles and tongue with a good supportive heel, and a perfect fit with room to wiggle my toes!  If you're after a flatter and more flexible running shoes, this model is not for you.  However, I always liked the Skechers brand for their style and quality and you won't regret purchasing this pair.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0261153", "1": "0.29563662", "2": "0.10384842", "3": "0.22710878", "4": "0.047936153", "5": "0.2202158", "6": "0.07913891"}}
