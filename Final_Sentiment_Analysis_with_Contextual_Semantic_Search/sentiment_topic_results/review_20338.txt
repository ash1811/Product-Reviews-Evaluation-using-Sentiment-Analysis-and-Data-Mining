{"text": "This boot is the most comfortable boot I've ever owned, great on our snow and ice, though for long treks I would still want more traction.  Snowshoes and other types of traction devices attach easily.  This boot fits my high arch and high instep, and also has enough room for additional support insoles.  After wearing for two months I bought a second pair.  Love them.  These were shipped quickly and arrived in great shape.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.062263627", "1": "0.21236934", "2": "0.076367505", "3": "0.26201805", "4": "0.23892021", "5": "0.14507622"}}
