{"text": "Yeah....$10 less than if you bought it at the store...but...these feel kind of cheap.I had bought a pair at the store and they felt instantly soft and just nice. These were the exact same style, same everything...but they feel different. Kind of cheap.I just use them for exercise, so I don't really care. I'm not going to the prom in them or anything. But still...was expecting the same quality.I gave em 4 stars because other than the cheap feel, they are comfortable and well, they still look good.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07393585", "1": "0.19435485", "2": "0.1942391", "3": "0.22672313", "4": "0.046406824", "5": "0.20800471", "6": "0.056335554"}}
