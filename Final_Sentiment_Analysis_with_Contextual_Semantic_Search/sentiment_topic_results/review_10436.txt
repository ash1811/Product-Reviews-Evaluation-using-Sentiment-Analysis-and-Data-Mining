{"text": "I really love the way Uggs feel on my feet.  This is my third pair (Ansley slippers and Bailey Button Boots) and they all feel wonderful.  I usually wear a size 8 1/2 and from the reviews on the Bailey Boot and Classic pages I ordered a size 8.  The sizing is perfect.  These boots keep your feet toasty without making them sweaty.  The sheepskin feels luxurious on my feet and ankles.  I am excited to try a tall Classic somewhere down the line.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13537039", "1": "0.1366641", "2": "0.13505423", "3": "0.20533964", "4": "0.18049769", "5": "0.09157598", "6": "0.115497984"}}
