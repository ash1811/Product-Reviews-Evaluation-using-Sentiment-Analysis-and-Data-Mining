{"text": "The dark brown color matches my brown shoes perfectly so that is excellent.  These Berkshire socks are a mid weight, slightly thicker than really cheap ones but still in the dress sock category.  I also like the fact that they are a plain weave.The main problem I have with them is that they simply do not stay up.  My legs are thin and medium length and they pull very comfortably up to just under my knee with no feel of stress on the fabric.  HOWEVER, every time my leg muscle flexes I can feel the top of the socks slide down a wee bit more.  They do not slide down all the way to my ankles like another brand did, so that is a plus.I was hoping these socks would truly stay up as many other reviewers claim, and was hoping to order more pairs in other colors.  I will continue to use the 3 pairs I ordered but probably not order more colors.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05259475", "1": "0.2431671", "2": "0.1800915", "3": "0.20929961", "4": "0.052188165", "5": "0.2603431"}}
