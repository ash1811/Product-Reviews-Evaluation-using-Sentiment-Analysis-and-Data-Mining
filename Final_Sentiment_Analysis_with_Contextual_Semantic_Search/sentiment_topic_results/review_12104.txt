{"text": "As a femme crossdresser, I can't recommend these panties. They aren't sexy and they don't have that silky feel to them to make me feel dainty. I guess its the small amount of spandex in these panties that ruin the feel. I like microfiber but these feel more like cotton. When I put on a pair of panties, I want that silky sissy feeling. Oh well I've bought some other wonderful panties here.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.29110798", "1": "0.067221895", "2": "0.10233554", "3": "0.3518423", "4": "0.14794627", "6": "0.035771202"}}
