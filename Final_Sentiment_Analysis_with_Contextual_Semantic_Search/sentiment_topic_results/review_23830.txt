{"text": "I ordered this for my Dad. Since we can hardly find it here in Miami, we ordered it online. My Dad was so happy with the purchase. He likes the material for the fact that it keeps him warm during cold weather. Very fast delivery too! It arrived a day before the expected date of delivery. Thank you. I would recommend it. Haven't tried it with winter/snow.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.23880972", "1": "0.33440703", "3": "0.11649285", "5": "0.06365461", "6": "0.23817699"}}
