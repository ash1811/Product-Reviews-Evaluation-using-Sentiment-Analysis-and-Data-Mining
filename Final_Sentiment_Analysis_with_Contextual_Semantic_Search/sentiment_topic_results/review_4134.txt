{"text": "I have about 6 pairs of these pants in different colors.  I am tall and the long length is wonderful.  The pants don't shrink even when washed in extremely hot water during the sanitary cycle of the washer. Oddly, the pants are warm in winter and cool in summer.  They are really great, quality pants.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.6402104", "5": "0.2728219", "6": "0.067835286"}}
