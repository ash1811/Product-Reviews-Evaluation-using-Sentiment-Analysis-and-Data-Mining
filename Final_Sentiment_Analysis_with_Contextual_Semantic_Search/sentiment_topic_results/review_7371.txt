{"text": "These are a pretty rugged pair of pants. I've worn them 5-6 times and washed them multiple times to loosen them up but the stay somewhat stiff. Now, that could be good or bad depending on what you use them for. I feel these will last a long time in construction, outdoor work or sports but maybe they aren't the best (comfortable) pants for long periods at a desk or being stationary. I could see myself loosing it off a bike or board on some cement and they would take the damage.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.5210047", "2": "0.03509171", "3": "0.06442619", "4": "0.18956299", "5": "0.105572216", "6": "0.0813562"}}
