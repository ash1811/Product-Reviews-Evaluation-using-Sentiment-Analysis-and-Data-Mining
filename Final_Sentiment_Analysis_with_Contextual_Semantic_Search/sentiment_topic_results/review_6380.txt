{"text": "I love Carhartt T-shirts.  They are oversized, usually with a longer tail to prevent \"Plumbers Crack\" for a man with a heavy belt on.  They are very thick cotton, and will keep you warm in the cold, and reasonably protected from sparks.  Just a good quality, sturdy shirt that will last a long time.  I own many of them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1222985", "1": "0.30445772", "3": "0.12446892", "4": "0.09293662", "5": "0.23386708", "6": "0.117487065"}}
