{"text": "This is a great backpack. I have bought a backpack at a variety of stores every year for my teenage son and every year we can barely find one that will hold the ever increasing amount of textbooks required without falling apart, zippers breaking, being uncomfortable on the shoulders or something. This one is different for the same or less cost it is extremely well-built, sturdy with plenty of room and then some. It even has a hidden pouch on the bottom that holds an attacked fitted raincoat for the backpack that fits and works great. Would give it 6 out of 5 stars if they let me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07382382", "1": "0.39195293", "2": "0.21065705", "3": "0.099218346", "4": "0.03227941", "5": "0.14319575", "6": "0.04887268"}}
