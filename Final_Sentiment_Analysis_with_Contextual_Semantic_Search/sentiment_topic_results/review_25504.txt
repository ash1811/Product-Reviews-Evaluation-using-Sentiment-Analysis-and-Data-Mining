{"text": "i originally ordered these and was super happy when they arrived.  they provided great coverage and generally, were not noticeable.  I knew this was something that would come in handy during summer months with lighter clothing.  though I didn't wear them every day, they lasted quite some time.  well, as soon as I got them, I ordered two more sets to have on hand.  the second 2 sets are quite transparent, meaning, you can see the nipple through the product and therefore, through your bra and clothing.  this makes no sense.  the item should be opaque.  what good does it do to keep your nipples from protruding when you can see them, if they are dark enough, through the clothing.  I don't think there is a choice of which ones you get, either.  bummer!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15555139", "1": "0.3912574", "2": "0.052567855", "3": "0.22395378", "4": "0.075224124", "5": "0.03252262", "6": "0.06892279"}}
