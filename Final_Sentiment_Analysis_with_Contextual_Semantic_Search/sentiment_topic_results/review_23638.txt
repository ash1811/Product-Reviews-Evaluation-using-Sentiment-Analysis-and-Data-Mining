{"text": "The Armitron 75-2447BLK NOW is a very elegant watch.  I am impressed.  It's sleek, with wonderful gold dots for numbers, a diamond accent at the 12 spot and gold hands.  The band is a nice soft leather.  Definately worth the $29 I paid for it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.3954169", "2": "0.18495439", "3": "0.18418662", "4": "0.08204533", "6": "0.14236066"}}
