{"text": "I got these for my daughter because I favor black Converse Chuck Taylor All-Star high-tops myself when I wear sneakers, and she likes to clomp around in them, so I thought I'd get her her own pair. Once she found out they come in pink, no other color would do.  Sigh.  But they are SUPER cute, and the lacing up the ankles means they fit tight and won't come off, but lots of room to grow through the toes.  One drawback, the laces are hard for a toddler to manage, and she has extreme difficulty getting them off by herself.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12182958", "1": "0.26646906", "2": "0.165626", "3": "0.17483301", "4": "0.08209783", "5": "0.08380712", "6": "0.105337426"}}
