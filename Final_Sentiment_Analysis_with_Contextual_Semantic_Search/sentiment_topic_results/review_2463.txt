{"text": "Rainbow is such a great company!!!! I've worn flip flop sandals for years and never come across a brand as good as these!  If you have ANY problems with them contact Rainbow.  They are soooo helpful and courteous!  I can't say enough!  I've had three pairs.  My husband wears them.  My daughter had a pair that was getting really worn out after a few years of wear.  They replaced them!  How cool is that??? No hassle at all!  I do recommend you know your size first.  I personally prefer the wide straps.  I first had the women's fine straps and they wore out a little more quickly.  I am hard on shoes especially if I love them.  This last pair I got was a men's small.  I'm an 8.5 women's size street shoe, and this fits me PERFECTLY!  Also, the womens' sizes are a bit narrower and my foot spilled over the sandal.  The men's is a bit wider.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08226234", "1": "0.21594335", "2": "0.17000797", "3": "0.24648482", "4": "0.05188861", "5": "0.16914436", "6": "0.06426851"}}
