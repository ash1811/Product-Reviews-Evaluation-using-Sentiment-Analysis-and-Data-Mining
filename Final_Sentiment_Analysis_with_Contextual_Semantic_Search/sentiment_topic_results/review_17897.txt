{"text": "I bought this cause I wanted a cheap watch I can wear for exercise walking. I had bought a handful of those big-face jelly watches in assorted colors to go with my sports tops. but those watches are kinda heavy, though easy to read.I decided to try and find a lighter watch for the same purpose and found this one on Amazon--cheap, simple color (can wear with any of my exercise clothes--and it looked like my  middle aged eyes could see the time without glasses (as I don't wanna haul readers along with me on my 30 minute walks). This has a second hand that's really fine/thin, so very hard to see with presbyopia. BUT..I can barely make it out. So, to take one's pulse, this works, too, to make sure one is in the aerobic zone.For me, it's about being useful, readable, and cheap. Utilitarian. Lightweight. Lies nicely flat against the wrist. Not clunky ugly like those rhinestone encrusted jelly watches that cost a bit more.Will update if quality is total pits. :)Enjoy...", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12694463", "1": "0.18677017", "2": "0.15750873", "3": "0.14055513", "4": "0.08321042", "5": "0.119776085", "6": "0.18523489"}}
