{"text": "I've owned these Minnetonka slippers for well over 10 years. The hard sole is a little worn out, and the knots came out of the leather ties and have to be re-tied with glue now and then, but I would buy them again in a minute. I recommend trying them on with socks at a country fair to be sure you get the right size. I wear them every day of my life for at least 3 - 4 hours minimum. I run around the house, down to the basement to do the laundry, out quick to get the mail, etc. They are comfortable as can be and wear like iron. Highly recommended. No other brand compares.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03096871", "1": "0.22250263", "2": "0.14961644", "3": "0.24765328", "4": "0.052946005", "5": "0.1573924", "6": "0.13892056"}}
