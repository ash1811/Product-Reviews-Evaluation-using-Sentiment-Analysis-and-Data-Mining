{"text": "I probably pay too much for these, but I think they're the best heel liners I can find. The material is soft and supportive and does not slip. They stick to the shoe very well and not only do they not come off with wear, they're not that difficult to remove if you have to do so. The only heel liner I have found that comes close these are the Rite Aid brand. Rite Aid ones feel similar but they're thinner and not as soft. They're pretty good as well, but I like Heavenly Heels better for the increased cushioning.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07876341", "1": "0.3123443", "2": "0.17019007", "3": "0.116196044", "4": "0.15816063", "5": "0.12313676", "6": "0.041208766"}}
