{"text": "The fit and finish is great. Not a single missed stitch.  The packaging was also first-rate.  Very impressive for the price I paid.  The watch cusions fit well and the dividers are sturdy. Fits my larger watches very well, though they tend to snag upon opening when placed within the bottom tray.  I could honestly live without the ridiculous gold handle on the front of the bottom tray.  It looks out of place and something you'd find on a cheap item bought at a street corner swap meet in Beijing.  Other than that minor gripe, this is a decent watch box.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13231932", "1": "0.26267993", "2": "0.19877765", "3": "0.08328034", "4": "0.11403454", "5": "0.11181468", "6": "0.09709356"}}
