{"text": "I love Invicta watches especially their divers watches. It looks great and I have received many compliments on it. I own several but only two with the stopwatch function. The only problem with it is that over time the stopwatch wont reset back to zero. I have read many reviews on it and it states that it is a poor design flaw on these types of watches. I never use the function but I am displeased with how fragile the stopwatch function is. I have not tried to see how much it would cost to fix and that will be my next step. I will definitely order more Invicta's but I wont order anymore with that function.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15309574", "1": "0.26015595", "2": "0.09349781", "3": "0.09019458", "4": "0.22668192", "5": "0.10551678", "6": "0.070857264"}}
