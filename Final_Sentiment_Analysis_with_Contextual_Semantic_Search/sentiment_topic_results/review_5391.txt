{"text": "I bought Carhartt work dungarees since I wanted durable pants I could use for snow blowing, cutting the grass, and doing other work around the house.  I also am a teacher, so I need pants that will look good for me in school.  These pants sure are just right for outdoor work and school.  What I like is the back pockets are nice and large.  My over-sized wallet fits perfectly.  The front pockets are big enough and sturdy enough to hold everything you want to put inside. The other benefit is that since they are work dungarees, the pockets are designed to carry all sorts of items in them without getting holes in them.I am a physically larger person and these pants actually make me look good.  They fit really well.  The best part is that when you bend, stretch, or pick up something you aren't going to have a blow out on the side of the pants or in the crotch area.  I just wish I had purchased these about ten  years ago. There are also added side pockets for tools or whatever you want.  The material is great and also the pants fit a bit loose, which I like. The material doesn't chafe you, but you can tell it can stand up to wear and tear.  If you are a hard-on-clothing sort of person, then buy these pants.  You won't regret it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.40137714", "2": "0.15048745", "3": "0.03501595", "4": "0.16155733", "5": "0.14473397", "6": "0.10468229"}}
