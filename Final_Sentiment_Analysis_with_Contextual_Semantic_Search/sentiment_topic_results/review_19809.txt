{"text": "I've had this for about a month. Have been in light rain and it still works. I wouldn't take it swimming.It works fine. Great to take on vacation especially in a plane when you want to know what time it is but your cell phone is turned off. My husband sets it for me since I have little patience for that kind of thing. He doesn't seem to have a problem with it. I don't expect it to last for a long time. I guess I have low expectations and with a watch that costs only $13.50 I think that's a good thing. I do recommend it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.05894519", "1": "0.37620592", "2": "0.246799", "3": "0.09311499", "4": "0.11987895", "5": "0.042039596", "6": "0.063016355"}}
