{"text": "I was so excited to receive these boots, only to be let down a total of three times. Each pair I received from amazon had either weird cut/score marks in the leather, or they had obvious manufacturer defects. By the time I had received my third pair in bad condition (second exchange), I'd given up. Two of the pairs looked like they were previously worn by being tried on around the house for half a day. For the ridiculously premium price, I would've expected a brand new pristine set of boots, that have not seen the likes of someone else's feet or abuse. I really would've loved to have had this purchase work out, but the quality just wasn't there.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.031118408", "1": "0.2979155", "2": "0.062318355", "3": "0.26940343", "4": "0.18727367", "5": "0.09623034", "6": "0.055740252"}}
