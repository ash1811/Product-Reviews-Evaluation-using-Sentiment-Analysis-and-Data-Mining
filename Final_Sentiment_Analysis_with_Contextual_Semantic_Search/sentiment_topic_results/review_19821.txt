{"text": "The watch is attractive, with nice features like a timer and a stopwatch.  It also has a second time zone that one can set, an alarm, an hourly chime, day/date/seconds showing on the face. It is not difficult to set.  The backlight helps a lot since numeric-display watches are inherently more difficult to read than regular face watches.  My biggest disappointment is that I cannot hear the alarm and hourly chime, due to my own hearing problems.  The pitch and volume of the chime make it impossible for me to hear.  Maybe when I get a hearing aid, I will be able to hear it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10696113", "1": "0.052353792", "2": "0.2662702", "3": "0.21763398", "4": "0.15368706", "5": "0.060168587", "6": "0.14292525"}}
