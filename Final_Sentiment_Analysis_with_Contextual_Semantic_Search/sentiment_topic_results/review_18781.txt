{"text": "Good costume for the price ( i think we paid 20$) but oh my did it have an awful smell! The Pleather parts of the costume (belt wrist band and boot covers) has a very strong fishy odor coming from them and despite my best efforts to wash, freshen and deodorize the smell just kept coming back Also the boot cover elastics broke super easy. I ended up returning it. If you are ok with not using the boot covers, belt, and wrist bands then I say go for it because other then the smell it was a very good price for what you got.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21512572", "1": "0.32036835", "2": "0.032817215", "3": "0.092268124", "4": "0.14427856", "6": "0.19252527"}}
