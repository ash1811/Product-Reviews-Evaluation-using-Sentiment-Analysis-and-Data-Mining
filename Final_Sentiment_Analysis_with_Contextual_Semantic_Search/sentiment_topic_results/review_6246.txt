{"text": "We bought this for my 2 year old son.  He is shorter than average but this worked out perfectly since we live in the North and he needed to wear a winter coat underneath!  With the bulk of the heavy winter coat, the length was perfect so he wasn't tripping over it.  I can't imagine it would fit a 4 year old as well.  The head piece fit my son well.  We angled it forward to cover his hair so it was shorter on the back and showed his hair.  I kept fluffing the hood up onto the back so his neck wasn't exposed to the cold air.  He was absolutely adorable!For sizing, I don't think I would recommend purchasing this for a 4 year old since I think the head piece would run small.  I think the robe would be a little short for an average sized 4 year old and would recommend the next size.  The fleece material is a decent weight and the costume seemed to be put together well so my son will be able to play with it now.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09118342", "1": "0.39982173", "2": "0.05006415", "3": "0.15078789", "4": "0.043983594", "5": "0.15344024", "6": "0.110719025"}}
