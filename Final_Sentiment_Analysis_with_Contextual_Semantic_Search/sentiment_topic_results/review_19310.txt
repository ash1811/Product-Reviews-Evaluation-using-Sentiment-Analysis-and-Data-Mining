{"text": "This watch does not have an expensive feel to the pushers and the movement does not have an exacting appearance.  It has a less expensive dispostion about it.  But, it is a less expensive timepiece.  For the money it is a great purchase.  The only real dislike is that some of the chrono hands are brushed metalic and it almost looks like foil - sort of cheese looking.  To have held the watch in my own hand, I probably would not have purchased it.  However, the band was exceptional in fine leather.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.27403435", "1": "0.24445127", "2": "0.2526476", "4": "0.08152784", "6": "0.14082657"}}
