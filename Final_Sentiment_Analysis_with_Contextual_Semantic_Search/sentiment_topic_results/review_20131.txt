{"text": "I have a laptop for work now and my shoulder bag was starting to be painful so I bit the bullet and ordered a backpack. The color are chill enough to wear to work and not feel like I'm in grade school - and, honestly, it feels like I have nothing in it! It is really well-constructed and fits a lot (I stick my purse and a couple other things in there as well). It's got a few pockets - large and small - so it's GREAT! I've taken it to the grocery store and stuck about 9 bottles of wine in there and it was fine (the last packpack I had ripped with just 4 in there!).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11809462", "1": "0.41583735", "2": "0.16690461", "3": "0.056149624", "4": "0.092782594", "6": "0.14771442"}}
