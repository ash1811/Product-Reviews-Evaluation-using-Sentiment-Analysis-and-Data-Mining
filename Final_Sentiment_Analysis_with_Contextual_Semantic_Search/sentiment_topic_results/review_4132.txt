{"text": "Adidas is one of my favorite brands. Usually I buy directly from the Adidas website, but these caught my eye because of the cheaper price. First of all, they did not fit well. They were much too big for the Medium that I chose, these bagged out in strange areas, I was swimming in them. I compared these pants to the ones that I purchased right from Adidas and these appear to be a poor counterfeit. The stripes on these pants are not the same quality, nor are they sewn on the pants as they are on the originals. Don't buy these!! I believe they are not a true Adidas product. They are made in Thailand and I am convinced these are fake. I have ripped them up and am using them for dust rags! Expensive dust rags!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17083901", "1": "0.45045733", "3": "0.10815119", "4": "0.07183397", "5": "0.1931004"}}
