{"text": "I use this bag (in black, with a Star Trek insignia on one of the pockets) as my purse that I carry around every day. My ASUS Transformer tablet, in a 10\" laptop case (thisis the specific one I use, but any of that size would work fine), fits perfectly into this bag, and it has plenty of room for my wallet and other items as well.The front pockets are too small for my wallet, but fit my digital camera, cell phone, business cards, small change just fine.I'd recommend this bag to anyone who is looking for a good way to carry their 10\" tablet and doesn't want a big clunky laptop case that is designed for a much larger computer.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.045341305", "1": "0.22507803", "2": "0.22079273", "3": "0.03932914", "4": "0.21359551", "5": "0.09190151", "6": "0.16396175"}}
