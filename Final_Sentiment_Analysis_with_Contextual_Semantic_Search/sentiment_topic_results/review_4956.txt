{"text": "I love these Birkenstocks! I've had a pair of blackberry suede arizona's years ago and the Florida version. I stopped wearing them a long time go.  Then I eventually sold them and it doesn't matter because my feet had grown so much since having 4 kids.  In the spring of this year, I was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis and heels spurs on the heels of both feet. My goal has been to stretch, massage on only wear proper shoes (expensive shoes) since. I have orthaheel slippers that I wear consistently in the house and those have helped a lot. I also have inserts for my sneakers (from the podiatrist) but I love sandals. Back to the Birkenstocks. Wish I had gotten these sooner so I could have used them more this summer. By the way, I have high arches.I went with these because the price can't be beat. I paid $58 for these on Amazon while my favorite online shoe store (Zappos) is charging $89. I got the stone color and I just love them. It took me a couple of days to get use to them. I chose the size 41 because I wear size 10 in all of my other shoes. This size fit's me perfectly. I also chose the narrow width and normally I wear medium or regular. I have worn these in the house and they are comfortable but will easily slide on hard wood floors. I almost wiped out. So for the price and comfort, these can't be beat, but be careful on hardwoods.  I also have prime and these shipped fast.As for the care of the birkibuc material, according to the Birkenstock website, you just wipe clean if you get a stain on the material. You can't beat that. No problems with rubbing on the tips of my feet.  These shoes are awesome! Moderate to excellent arch support. I just love them!  I highly recommend these shoes and obviously buying them from Amazon.  A great experience.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04147866", "1": "0.19533248", "2": "0.06431638", "3": "0.1453375", "4": "0.29169413", "5": "0.16875562", "6": "0.09308523"}}
