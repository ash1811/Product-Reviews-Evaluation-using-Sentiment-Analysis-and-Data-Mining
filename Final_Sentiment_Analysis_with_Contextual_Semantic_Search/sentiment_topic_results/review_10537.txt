{"text": "After much research I found the (Campus) Frye Boots I wanted on Amazon.  I did a lot of price checking and found the boots for $236.00 instead of $299.00.  What a great deal!  I was a little hesitant not being able to try the boots on before I purchased them but when they arrived and I tried them on they fit like a charm!  Super comfortable and of course wonderful Frye quaility.I have purchased many items off Amazon and have been very satisfied with all.And, I saved a good deal of money for the same boots Nordstrom's sell for $299.00.  I call that SMART shopping!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16837358", "1": "0.19956861", "3": "0.106887676", "4": "0.20735294", "5": "0.20369937", "6": "0.11141931"}}
