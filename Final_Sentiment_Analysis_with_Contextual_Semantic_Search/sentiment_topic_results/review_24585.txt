{"text": "Brought this for my daughter for her 4th birthday. She's 50%for height and 40% for weight. Based on reviews, I purchased the small (4-6). It fits with no room to spare. Issue is that after wearing it around the house on just 2 occasions, the front of the leotard pilled in 2 different places. Pilling must have been caused by a combination of the nylon material and my daughter's sharp edged toys. So, if you are purchasing this strictly for dance classes, this is fine. But if you are purchasing this for playing ballerina at home, consider a cotton/spandex leotard.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.26178104", "1": "0.14854975", "2": "0.1626876", "3": "0.20830032", "4": "0.1101431", "6": "0.10577495"}}
