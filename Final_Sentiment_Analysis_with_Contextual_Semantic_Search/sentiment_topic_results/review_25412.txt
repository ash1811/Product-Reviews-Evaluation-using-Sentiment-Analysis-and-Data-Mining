{"text": "These slippers are much better than any other slippers I've ever had before. To say these are \"just slippers\" is like saying Einstein was \"just a scientist.\"1. The lining in the slipper is bouncy, fluffy, and feels great on my feet.2. The bottom of the slipper is thick and protective non-slip rubber. OK to step on a thumbtack.3. The upper is soft pliable stuff that feels like my feet are getting a gentle hug.4. They appear to be extremely well constructed with no loose threads or other mistakes.5. These look like indoor/outdoor slippers. Something I could walk to the mailbox in, or for a quick emergency trip to the 7-eleven.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11800006", "1": "0.16161142", "2": "0.13351396", "3": "0.05360515", "4": "0.14191881", "5": "0.076784894", "6": "0.3145657"}}
