{"text": "This is  a good size for my 3-4 day business trips.  2 suits, 3 shirts, accessories (shoes, ties, etc.) all fit easily with room for workout clothes and toiletries.  I have read comments that this luggage will fall apart if checked often.  I will update after a few more trips because, as stated above, this is NOT carry on luggage.  I fly Delta regularly and this bag is nearly double the recommended size for the overhead compartment.  If you fly first class you might have a chance getting it overhead but, otherwise, it's going to be checked.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.053168777", "1": "0.21741183", "2": "0.21893393", "3": "0.24446417", "4": "0.08477031", "5": "0.14629439", "6": "0.034956627"}}
