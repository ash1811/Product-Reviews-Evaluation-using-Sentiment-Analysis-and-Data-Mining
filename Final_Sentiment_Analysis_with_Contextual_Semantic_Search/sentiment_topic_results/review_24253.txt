{"text": "I usually wear thermals most the winter as an underlayment of all my clothes. I try to pick out a couple pairs of long-john type thermals a year and try them out. So far this is the second best I've found (Terramar Thermolator 2 being #1). This is very thin so it wicks fairly well (especially well when you compare to most straight cotton/polyester alternatives). It does a fine job at keeping you warm with this and a long sleeve button down I am usually fairly comfortable down to about 55. It does a good job of keeping the odor down too and can be worn for several days between washes, no problem.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13681427", "1": "0.5304801", "2": "0.10818323", "3": "0.10736748", "4": "0.053458907", "6": "0.061136294"}}
