{"text": "I'M ON MY THIRD PAIR OF KEEN TARGHEE HIKING SHOES AND THEY HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE VERY BEST MID-WEIGHT HIKING SHOES I'VE EVER OWNED. SUPURB,COMFORTABLE FIT RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX WITH PLENTY OF TOE ROOM AND A VERY SUPPORTIVE FOOT BED AND HEEL COUNTER. THE SHANK IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO FOR A GOOD PUSH OFF BUT STRONG ENOUGH TO PROTECT AGINST THE SHARPEST OF ROCKS AND SCREE ON THE TRAIL. IT FEELS LIKE YOU HAVE AN UP-ARMORED HUMVEE ON YOUR FEET. SUPPORTIVE, CUSHIONED AND PROTECTED. THE WRAP UP TOE BUMPER IS A NICE FEATURE. THESE ARE MY FAVORITE LOW RISE HIING SHOE. I'VE WORN THEM OVER MANY MILES OF VERY ROUGH TERRAIN AND NEVER ANY SORE FEET. A WINNER......", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.089766815", "1": "0.177731", "2": "0.15793176", "3": "0.21361832", "4": "0.26182875", "5": "0.028345054", "6": "0.070778236"}}
