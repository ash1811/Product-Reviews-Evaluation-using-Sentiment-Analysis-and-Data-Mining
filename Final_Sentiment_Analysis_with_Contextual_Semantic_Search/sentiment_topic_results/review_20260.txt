{"text": "So I own several different tree's and this one is the best. Spring loaded to it's a auto fit for shoes as long as you buy the right size. I have 4 sets of these and I would recommend for anything but travel (due to the weight). I usually buy these from the factory for $20. I would recommend a visit to Wisconsin if you haven't been and if you go during clearance time you can buy shoes for upto 50% off. Call them Allen Edmonds has the best service period!If your not happy they will give you your money back!MADE IN THE USA....
