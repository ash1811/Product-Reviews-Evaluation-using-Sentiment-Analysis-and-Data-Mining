{"text": "I bought a 6-pack of socks like these for double the price and those seem like a better deal.  I just thought maybe these would hold up longer but they feel just about as thick as the other ones.  They do feel much smoother and softer though. These are the softest ones I have ever felt so they have that going for them at least, even at this higher price than the other product. If I bought again, I would go with the 6 pack.  Nothing this soft is durable so you might as well get more for your money.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07346464", "1": "0.19915894", "2": "0.13347891", "3": "0.22410637", "5": "0.30366537", "6": "0.0630699"}}
