{"text": "I bought these for running, I need sunglasses that won't budge or slip and I wear them all the time. The price was so good that I thought I'd chance it and they are perfect. They are not particularly cool looking, not bad either. The polarization is good, they are lightweight and don't budge while I run. There is enough room from side to side and between eye and lens that they keep fog free, very nice for full or large faces. I would buy this same pair again if and when I lose this pair. The mirror lens, which I bought, is very low key. It's not that super flash mirror, they seem to be a medium darkness too. Perfect for running or exercise in low light.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22231431", "1": "0.3103023", "2": "0.042405747", "3": "0.22483552", "4": "0.029113917", "5": "0.036228362", "6": "0.13479982"}}
