{"text": "I'm a regular collector of diving watches and this is one of my favorite ones.  There is something about diving watches that is really attractive though it could be subconscious and because of the fact that you can get it wet and it would still work.  This watch feels rock solid like it just came out from a huge chunk of metal.  For such a quality feel, the price is super amazing.  I would have to go for my Submariner for a similar feel and on some days, I prefer the feel of this than of my Submariner!  The luminated markers are the brightest I ever seen on any watch, diving or non-diving.  Clasp is super-awesome, better than the Submariner.  Bracelet is not as nice looking but ok.  The moveable bezel has the best click of any of the diving watches I own and this is the least expensive dive watch of all but unfortunately I paid a little too much.  The only downside and may not be for you if you don't adjust your bands, but if you do, it's a chore.  I spend hours trying to do this and was only successful after improvising as the linking system is very unusual.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20854816", "1": "0.27015147", "2": "0.22824372", "3": "0.09647444", "4": "0.124468155", "5": "0.026229458", "6": "0.04588461"}}
