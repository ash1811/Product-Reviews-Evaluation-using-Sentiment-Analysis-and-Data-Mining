{"text": "When I purchased this, I was looking for something larger than my conventional insulated lunch box.  This pack easily lives up to that requirement, and more.  There is plenty of storage in the main insulated area, enough space for lunch for several people.  Beyond that there is a handy place to drop your water bottle in.  There are several other outside pockets for all kinds of purposes.  I normally pack my lunch, a twenty six ounce insulated thermos bottle, a Kindle, and various and sundry other pieces of equipment.  It is not perfect, I would like a little more space on some mornings, but for most of time it is a great solution.  I would heartily recommend it to anyone looking for something slightly more commodious than their current lunch box.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3337046", "2": "0.2588585", "3": "0.10326123", "4": "0.05962387", "5": "0.19898671", "6": "0.04332429"}}
