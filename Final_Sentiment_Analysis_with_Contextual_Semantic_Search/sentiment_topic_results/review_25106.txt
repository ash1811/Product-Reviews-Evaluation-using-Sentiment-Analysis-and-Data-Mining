{"text": "The insoles of my EMU boots typically last one year and then they are shredded. The only replacement insoles* I found looked kind of cheap and had \"iffy\" reviews. The reviews for the UGG insoles were good but I wondered if they would work with the EMU boot. I decided to take a chance on it because I am tired of buying new EMU's every year simply because the insole is destroyed. Well, these insoles fit perfectly and are almost as good as the original EMU ones. The only downside to them is that they don't have as good of arch support as the EMU had. I ended up just putting these insoles over my old EMU ones and they feel a bit tight but I am sure that will resolve itself as the insole wears.I will update this review if there are any issues but for now - highly recommend!*I can not find EMU brand replacement insoles here in the US. I did see that another vendor had them in Australia but apparently they are not the same quality as the original and the reviews say they are absolutely not worth the money.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2603729", "1": "0.17751513", "2": "0.17547138", "3": "0.09829927", "4": "0.20816132", "5": "0.043931715", "6": "0.036248296"}}
