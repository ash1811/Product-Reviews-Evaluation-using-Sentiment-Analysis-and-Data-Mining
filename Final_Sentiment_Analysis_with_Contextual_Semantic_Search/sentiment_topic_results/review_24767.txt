{"text": "I ordered two pairs of these shorts for my husband, in Black and Navy.The inseam on the Navy shorts is more than an inch shorter than the Black shorts.The Black shorts are made from a completely different fabric. It's a thick and uncomfortable fabric, almost like canvas.Both pairs of shorts have the same label, but they are very different from each other. I don't understand how the quality control can be this inconsistent--buyers beware.We decided to return the Black shorts, and keep the Navy ones because at least the Navy had a decent fabric.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1883486", "1": "0.17144729", "2": "0.13194337", "3": "0.102245934", "4": "0.18399532", "5": "0.08788263", "6": "0.13413686"}}
