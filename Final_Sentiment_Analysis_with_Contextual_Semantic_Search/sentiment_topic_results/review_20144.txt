{"text": "I purchased this item for my eighth grade daughter to use at school.  After struggling with the zipper most of the year, it finally broke completely at the start of her freshman year.  I contacted the company regarding their lifetime warranty against product defects.  With one simple email showing pictures of the problem and another picture showing how I cut the logo from the bag (per their request to make the old item unusable) I am now awaiting the arrival of a new replacement backpack.  The company was great to work with and gave me no trouble with replacing the item.  I really feel the trouble we had with the one zipper was a fluke.  The rest of the backpack has held up beautifully and works great.  I look forward to many more years of use from this item.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0688795", "1": "0.11152028", "2": "0.11759983", "3": "0.19906543", "4": "0.10981986", "5": "0.22131015", "6": "0.17180493"}}
