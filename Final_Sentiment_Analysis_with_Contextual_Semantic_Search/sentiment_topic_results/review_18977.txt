{"text": "I bought this bra as a convertible bra to wear with a backless shirt, however it should be noted up front that the straps only detach in the front, and not the back. I normally wear my backless shirt with a convertible bra and one strap looped around the back of my neck, but because the back straps are stitched and cannot be removed, I can't wear it as intended.That said, the bra is really comfy, and I do plan on keeping it around as an everyday bra.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06255605", "1": "0.10705957", "2": "0.1993549", "3": "0.35999045", "4": "0.11642213", "5": "0.12167366", "6": "0.032943256"}}
