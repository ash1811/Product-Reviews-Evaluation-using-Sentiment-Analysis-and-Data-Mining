{"text": "Jeans are notoriously variable in their fit, and these are no exception.  I ordered 2 pair of 35\" waist pants, and although they were both labeled as 35\" waist, 1 pair was closer to 34\" & 1 pair was closer to 36\".  I'll keep them anyway.  The tighter pair will work fine with an untucked shirt, & the looser one will be fine with a bulky winter wool shirt tucked in.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.043459006", "1": "0.21856888", "2": "0.30138928", "3": "0.20493785", "5": "0.09184037", "6": "0.13637787"}}
