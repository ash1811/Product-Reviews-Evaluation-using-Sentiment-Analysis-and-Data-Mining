{"text": "This watch is inexpensive, not cheap, and holds up.  I had the analogue version of this watch which succumb to the water torture I put it through, so I stepped it up and bought this bad boy.  Got to go digital, it's 2013, okay...The ladies love it.  The grandmas love it.  And personally I wouldn't go without it.The digital format is pretty regular, it is effective in that it keeps proper time, and I can do second by second planning.  I would say if you want to spend $10 properly, and you need a watch, get yourself this guy.  It is as it is advertised, nothing more, nothing less, and the delivery was fast.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15502363", "1": "0.10303121", "2": "0.18396358", "3": "0.10285392", "4": "0.1430995", "5": "0.10895332", "6": "0.20307483"}}
