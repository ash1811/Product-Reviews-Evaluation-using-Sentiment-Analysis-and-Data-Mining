{"text": "The fireman hat we got was not like the one in the picture.  It's very poor quality.  The sticker in the front is not as attractive as the one in the picture.  It's a small round sticker that says \"fire chief\" on it that is extremely cheap looking.  Actually the sticker has been halfway unstuck from the hat from the day we got it.  Even the plastic is flimsy.  Maybe a nice hat shipped with this at one point in time but the hat that is being shipped now is not the same hat and it isn't worth buying.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.101618424", "1": "0.049129933", "2": "0.055679362", "3": "0.39108965", "4": "0.14979625", "5": "0.108799085", "6": "0.14388731"}}
