{"text": "These are great.  I just purchased my second one.  The one that I have had for about 3 years has finally stretched out too much, but I got a couple years of use out of it (with a LOT of time in the chlorine of the pool).  This is so much cheaper than buying the overpriced disposable swim diapers, and I feel much better about reusing this instead of throwing away the disposables.  Definitely recommend this.  (Especially for twin moms like me!)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06884129", "1": "0.47480345", "2": "0.1672344", "4": "0.08655548", "6": "0.19587743"}}
