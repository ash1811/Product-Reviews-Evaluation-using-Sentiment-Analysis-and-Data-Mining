{"text": "Great watch - the attention to detail is fantastic for the price. Not too large, solid without being too heavy. Mine has taken steady abuse, never sustained any permanent scratches to the glass, the steel is standing up well, and it holds dead-on to accuracy, never more than a minute off when I adjust for the time-change each year. It has the ticking second hand of a quartz - but does have the winding sound of an automatic - kind of a cool hybrid. The only time I've had it off for more than a few days it went into suspend - when it woke up - it snapped right back to accurate time - very cool.Seiko makes a fantastic watch - this is a beautiful, durable, if somewhat plain watch that would serve anyone well.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.36558026", "1": "0.07044974", "2": "0.112216", "3": "0.16039315", "5": "0.12867206", "6": "0.16006202"}}
