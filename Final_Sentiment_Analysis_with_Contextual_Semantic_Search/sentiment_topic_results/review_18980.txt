{"text": "I love this watch. It's easy to see and doesn't haven't a bunch of alarms or crazy stuff on it that no one can figure out how to use or turn off. The reason I gave it four stars is that the band doesn't seem as sturdy as it looks. It doesn't feel like leather or suede.It's a great watch though, I love it and I wear it to work everyday.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.25751868", "2": "0.2332117", "4": "0.49186677"}}
