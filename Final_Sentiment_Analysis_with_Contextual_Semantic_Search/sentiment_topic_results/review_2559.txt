{"text": "LOLLIPOP has long been a leading brand of 100% cotton underwear, and the quality is still very good.  For everyday wear, I much prefer cotton over silk or nylon, because of cotton's superior comfort and absorbency.  I've worn Lollipops since childhood, and I still prefer this \"cotton leg band\" or \"cuff leg\" model over the equally good model with the elastic cuff.The Lollipop package claims that \"Lollipops keep their fit wash after wash without shrinking\".  Maybe that's true if you follow the recommendation to \"machine wash cold, hang dry\".  However, my Lollipops are machine washed and machine dried with other whites (using settings for permanent press and low heat), and they ALWAYS shrink.To allow for shrinkage, I go up one or two sizes when I buy ANY brand of cotton panties.  For Lollipops, the package recommends:  size 5 (hips 36-37\"); 6 (38-39\"), 7 (40-41\"), 8 (42-43\"), 9(44-45\"), 10 (46-47\"), 11 (48-49\"), and 12 (50-51\").  I wear women's size 10/12 pants, and my hips measure 40\" over clothing.  I find that size 8 is my best choice for Lollipops.  Either size 7 or size 8 will work for me when new (7 fits, 8 fits loosely), but size 8 continues to fit after the panties shrink from multiple machine washings (and dryings).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12690511", "1": "0.17140947", "2": "0.0536309", "3": "0.22852373", "4": "0.20254438", "5": "0.04418234", "6": "0.17280406"}}
