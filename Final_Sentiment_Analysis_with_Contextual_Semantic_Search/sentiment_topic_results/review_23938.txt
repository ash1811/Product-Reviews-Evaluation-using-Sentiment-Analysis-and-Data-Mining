{"text": "I was fearful that I wouldn't like these socks when I saw that the design had changed.I've been wearing Hanes black cushion crew, and they've always served me well.The new design is made of three materials, rather than just being thicker on the bottom, there is a cushier fabric down there, and the top is now made of a lighter, plasticier, more breathable material, like my tec workout shirts. The ankle seems to be the same old material as ever.As I said I was afraid I wouldn't like the new design, and would have to find a new brand and style to replace my wearing out socks with, but I love them. They fit snugly, and are more comfy in dress shoes, than the old style was, even new.Not sure if they'll wear as well in the long run, but for now, I'm continuing to replace my socks with Hanes cushion crews as they wear out.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.29420865", "2": "0.042636707", "3": "0.2872749", "4": "0.08121981", "5": "0.14232144", "6": "0.14998789"}}
