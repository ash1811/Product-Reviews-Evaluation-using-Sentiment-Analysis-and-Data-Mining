{"text": "I've been using this almost daily to throw in my gym bag with toiletries to shower at the gym.  It easily fits full-size shampoo and conditioner bottles, a full-size can of shaving cream, a razor, a small loofah, a full-size bottle of hair gel, a comb, and some make-up.  There are no interior compartments, but one zippered compartment on the outside.  Very thin, something you could maybe put your phone or ID in.  It doesn't leak at all- After my shower I throw everything in there still dripping wet, and open it to dry when I get home.  Never once had a problem with anything leaking out, which is pretty impressive considering it's just jammed into a back with a bunch of other stuff and jostled around a lot.It is just a toiletry bag so I can't rave too much, but I see absolutely no flaws and would recommend it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10588468", "1": "0.29100937", "2": "0.21309854", "3": "0.08964054", "4": "0.095178016", "5": "0.11655702", "6": "0.088631816"}}
