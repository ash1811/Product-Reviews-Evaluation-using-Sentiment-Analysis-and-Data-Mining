{"text": "I have a Nike pair of hiking boots that I thought were waterproof, found out the hard way that they were not.  I have had these boots for only 4 days, but each of the 4 days I had to walk through the snow/slush and I was kept dry and warm.  The shoes do come loose, which I think is due to laces and the leather being tough now, it should get better once I broken them in a bit more.They also look good.  I wear inserts on all my shoes, I put in a pair of in-soles from an old Nike running sneakers and it is a lot more comfortable to walk in.  I am so glad that I bought these and they have paid for themselves in the past 4 days.Highly recommended!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1054024", "1": "0.2879864", "2": "0.08164085", "4": "0.20875059", "5": "0.21400562", "6": "0.09950203"}}
