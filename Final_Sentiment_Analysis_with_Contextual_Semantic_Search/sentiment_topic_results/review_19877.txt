{"text": "I ordered this jewelry box as a gift for a girl that will be turning 6. I took it out just to test it and make sure it works fine. The music worked well,it was not too loud but not too soft either. However, the swan lake tune played way too fast. I don't know if it was maybe just overwound or it was just made like that. It is different from the speed of the music of another music box we have that also plays swan lake. Anyway, other than that the box is very pretty. The top picture is beautiful, the colors are pretty. One thing that I did not like is the fact that the paper covering the box is not a perfect cutout and at the side of the box it is smaller than the box. I don't know if all boxes are like that, but it is not a big deal. It still looks good. I would recommend this box overall.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1664177", "1": "0.28766036", "2": "0.21457388", "3": "0.10194634", "4": "0.10514101", "5": "0.06546047", "6": "0.058800217"}}
