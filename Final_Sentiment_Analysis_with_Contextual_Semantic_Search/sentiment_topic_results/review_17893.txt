{"text": "This is an inexpensive watch, but it suits my needs for daily wear.  The face of the watch is nice and easy to read.  I like that.  The band is an inexpensive plastic-kind of material.  The band doesn't cause me to sweat like other inexpensive (plastic) watches I've had, so that is a bonus.  Seems to keep good time.  I've only had it about a week.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.20857923", "2": "0.27325323", "3": "0.26496786", "4": "0.16619153", "6": "0.078573026"}}
