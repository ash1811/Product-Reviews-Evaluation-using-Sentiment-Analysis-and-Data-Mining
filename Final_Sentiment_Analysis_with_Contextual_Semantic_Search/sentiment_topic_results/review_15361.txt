{"text": "These sun glasses look and feel great. These are the \"New Wayfarer\" style from Ray Ban so they are slightly smaller than the previous iterations.The crystal green lens is great for bright weather and driving on sunny days. Might be a bit too dark in partly cloudy or overcast weather if you are not accustomed to them.The glasses themselves are typical Ray Ban quality, which is quite good and they are not too heavy and don't really cause me too much fatigue wearing them for long periods of time. They fit quite comfortably actually.I would definitely recommend them for a good daily use pair of sunglasses.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09835289", "1": "0.36681592", "2": "0.17642154", "3": "0.16055349", "4": "0.06499981", "5": "0.08527183", "6": "0.047584552"}}
