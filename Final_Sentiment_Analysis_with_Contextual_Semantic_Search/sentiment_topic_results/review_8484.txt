{"text": "I have worn this shoe exclusively for playing tennis over the past 20 years.I was a bit surprised to find Reebok no longer has a toe guard on this model.  It has the same upper and the same hard court ripple pattern with a wear guard for the ball of the foot, but no toe guard to wear out (rather than the inner side of the shoe) while dragging your rear foot forward before launching the serve!I'm a bit disappointed because that is the area I typically wear out first or at the same rate as the ball of the foot wear guard.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1575332", "1": "0.14241527", "2": "0.1523808", "3": "0.17153783", "4": "0.11890419", "5": "0.16180815", "6": "0.0954206"}}
