{"text": "I love these shoes, but I had to wear down the bumps in the padding to get them to fit just right and get the back straps set to hold my feet in just the right place.  It took about one week of continuous wear to get feeling great.  The straps, being leather are stiff which means I had some blisters.  I took to wearing socklets and that works for me.  Plus I get them less dirty.  I do not want to wear when it is wet or muddy.  They do &#34;grip&#34; the ground lots better than my other sandals.  However, the gaps in the bottom of the soles picks up pecan pieces from the driveway.  The squirrels are busy this year, lol.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.118341185", "1": "0.25246194", "2": "0.26468062", "3": "0.087485805", "5": "0.14251943", "6": "0.1320376"}}
