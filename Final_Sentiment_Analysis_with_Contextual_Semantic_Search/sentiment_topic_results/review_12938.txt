{"text": "I tried these shoes about a 8 months ago with a Gold Box deal.  I am delighted with these shoes and in fact I am wearing them now.  You might fine yourself wearing them all day, even going to a ball game or a cruise.  I have since ordered and received an additional pair and will order more.  Be aware that the you should order your simple shoes about one size larger as I normally wear a 10 or 10 1/2.  In this particular shoe I wear an 11 1/2.  Additioally, they wear long before showing any signs of wearing out.  You will be happy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12660977", "1": "0.2010242", "2": "0.19482182", "3": "0.22088678", "4": "0.15025198", "5": "0.054671552", "6": "0.051733896"}}
