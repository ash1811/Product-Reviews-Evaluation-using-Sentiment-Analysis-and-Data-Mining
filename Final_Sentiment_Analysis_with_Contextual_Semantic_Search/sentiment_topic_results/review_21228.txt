He has pretty much worn these shoes (has 8 pairs) since he discovered them in NH in 2009.  He is not particularly hard on shoes, but likes the different colors, and although his other pairs are all size 10, this pair was too short.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20337652", "1": "0.18180272", "2": "0.13266754", "3": "0.08210099", "4": "0.18889448", "5": "0.059101634", "6": "0.1520561"}}
