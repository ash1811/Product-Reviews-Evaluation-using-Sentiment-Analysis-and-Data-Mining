{"text": "Cons- I have a 36\" inch waist and all of my pants are 36\" inch... Purchased XL and was still uncomfortable, particularly in the waistband...* Note: Bought these for sleep shorts and I went up a size to allow for extra comfort at night...Pros- Material seemed durable yet soft (limited time since I quickly returned the shorts).- I would strongly consider re-purchasing these if they came in a size XXL or a more loose fitting waist.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21968706", "1": "0.2127566", "2": "0.087988175", "3": "0.31697702", "6": "0.15621726"}}
