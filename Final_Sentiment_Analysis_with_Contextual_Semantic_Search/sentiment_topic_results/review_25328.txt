{"text": "I bought this shoe for days when I know my feet will be getting dirty and or on rough terrain. 13 wide is what I wear in new balance tennis shoe and Lowa Ranger boots. The fit did not disappoint.I haven't taken them on any serious hikes yet so I cannot attest to durability.These shoes are hot for me, hence the 4 stars. They have an extremely soft inside that almost feels like a blanket. It is good for comfort but gets hot quickly.Overall I am pleased and would recommend them for a general purpose outdoor shoe. If hiking in summer with these you better be wearing shorts tho!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24927792", "1": "0.069670774", "2": "0.24225979", "3": "0.22152866", "4": "0.106804274", "5": "0.040768486", "6": "0.0696901"}}
