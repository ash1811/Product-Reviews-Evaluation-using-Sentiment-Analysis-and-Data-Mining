{"text": "I was excited when the slippers arrived, but they were a huge let-down.  Everything except the uppers, even the \"leather\" strings are fake.  I'm okay with synthetic materials, but I expect to be able to tie a bow in my new shoe strings without breaking them.  They broke the instant I gave a tug to tighten the bow.  It wasn't a hard tug.  That's when I noticed they don't even look real.  The  lining looks fake as well, and looks like it would wear out in no time.  They just don't look or feel like high quality, and with stuff breaking within 20 seconds of my putting them on, I  felt sort of ripped-off.  With this experience, I contacted Amazon and arranged a return.  UPS just picked them up, and my experience with Amazon, at least, has been good.  I just ordered a different slipper that costs a little more and made in USA instead of China.  I was tempted to rate these slippers 1 star but I was feeling generous today.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.26465446", "1": "0.08486342", "2": "0.24485257", "3": "0.29689473", "4": "0.07822887", "6": "0.028364627"}}
