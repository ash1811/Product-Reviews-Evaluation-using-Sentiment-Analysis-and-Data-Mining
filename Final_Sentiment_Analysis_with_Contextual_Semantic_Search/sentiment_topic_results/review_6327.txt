{"text": "These boots are SO cute, I almost wanted to keep them as a decoration.  My niece is 5 and she has wide feet, she usually wears a 10 or 11 but these in an 11, she couldn't even get her foot into the boot.  They were also a little shorter than they were in my head - but that's entirely my fault for not reading the description well.I do think they are made undersized which is my reason for the 4 stars, and I am not reordering a size up because narrow - is narrow .... but for the right little feet, they are the cutest little boots for sure!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.038924657", "1": "0.14814271", "2": "0.1403928", "4": "0.31552467", "5": "0.25264007", "6": "0.10131973"}}
