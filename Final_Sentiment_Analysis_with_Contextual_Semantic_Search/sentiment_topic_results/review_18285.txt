{"text": "I LOVE this watch. I buy it mainly because of the awesome, easy timers. Just one press of the timer button and you have a 1 minute countdown timer. Press it twice for 3 minutes, again for 5, etc. I also love the small size. It's not bulky at all, so I can comfortably wear it with any long sleeve shirt without the shirt bunching up. I just wish the band was tougher though. It only lasts about a year before breaking.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.26698127", "2": "0.21574587", "3": "0.16924797", "4": "0.20021708", "6": "0.14127669"}}
