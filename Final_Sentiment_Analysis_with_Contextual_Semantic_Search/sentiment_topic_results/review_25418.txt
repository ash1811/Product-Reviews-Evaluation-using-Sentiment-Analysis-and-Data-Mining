{"text": "I wear my first pair every day for probably 5 or 6 hours. Mostly worn in doors, but I don't hesitate to walk outside in them. The bottoms are durable rubber, yet still flexible and soft on carpeting. The tops are durable suede leather with heavy cord stitching. The upper material is holding up very well. First pair color is &#34;Camouflage Stony&#34;. New pair is in &#34;Chestnut&#34;. Both are the same high quality, just a change in color.The inside is lined with sheepskin. Very comfortable, durable and warm. Eventually, after 2 years this is the part of the slipper that shows wear. I wear these every day, so it's no surprise the loft has gone out of the lining. The lining is not worn out, it just lost some of the loft.To be clear, these are my all time favorite slippers. I will continue to buy and wear these as long as they keep selling them and maintain the high quality. They are priced accordingly. Priced a little on the high side for common slippers, but these are not common slippers. You DO get what you pay for. I'm still wearing the first pair and will likely wear them for a long time. They will become my knock around pair and I will start to wear them outside more often. The new pair will become my indoor, kick back and watch TV in comfort pair.I highly recommend these slippers to anyone, and I have recommended these to family and friends.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.045666058", "1": "0.3583205", "2": "0.18459241", "3": "0.116878904", "4": "0.020725142", "5": "0.20257838", "6": "0.07123858"}}
