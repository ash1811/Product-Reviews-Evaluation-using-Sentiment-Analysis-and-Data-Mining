{"text": "I am typically a D and purchasing a DD was certainly the right choice! It is very comfortable once you get it on but a little painful when peeling it off! I had purchased a silicon one of these and wasn't a huge fan of the feel. The fabric one is much sturdier and far more comfortable. I wore it under my backless wedding dress. I have to say after a few tries to get the placement right it did its job. I am a size D with a child that was breast fed and to many years of gravity but it certainly did its job!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2030253", "1": "0.25556183", "2": "0.07569017", "3": "0.31880683", "6": "0.14037016"}}
