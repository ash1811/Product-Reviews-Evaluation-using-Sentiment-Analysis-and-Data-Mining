{"text": "I bought this for my father, who has bigfoot status sized feet lol, We usually have difficulty finding shoes that will fit him in the width. But these were amazing. He put them on and absolutely loved it! The fit was perfect and they were very soft on the inside. Worth the buy, and they actually withstand quite a bit of wear Had them for almost a year now and they still are holding up pretty good for him and he uses these as his main shoes :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03825141", "1": "0.5027913", "2": "0.19916524", "4": "0.1388542", "5": "0.08159577", "6": "0.035662524"}}
