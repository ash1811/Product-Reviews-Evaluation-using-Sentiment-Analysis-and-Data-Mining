{"text": "This is hands down the most comfortable shoes that i have ever own.  I loved them so much that i bought a second pair.  I wear these every day for work.  Only down side would be is that the laces tend to shred after a while from tying the laces.  I wrote to timberland and they sent me a few more laces.  I hope they dont ever stop making these shoes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0674034", "1": "0.46142727", "2": "0.23943542", "3": "0.06688068", "5": "0.10167893", "6": "0.058702502"}}
