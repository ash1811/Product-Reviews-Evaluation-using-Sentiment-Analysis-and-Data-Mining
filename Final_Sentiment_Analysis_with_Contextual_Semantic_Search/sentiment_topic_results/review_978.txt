{"text": "I love my Desert Boots. I had a pair in High School in the 70s and when I saw them on Amazon I had to get a pair. They still feel just as comfortable as ever. I bought men's even though I am WOman. I did this because of price and also men's are usually a little wider. Couple things to consider before buying though. I agree with those who say to buy a size smaller than it says. According to the sizing chart I would wear a size 7 but a 6 fits perfect. Also they might feel kinda tight across the top of foot but they loosen up within just a little while wearing. Because of this I would recommend wearing them around home a couple times before trying to wear all day. This way you can take them off after a bit. After doing this they will give you all day comfort. And they look fantastic.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06645521", "1": "0.36954623", "2": "0.088028565", "3": "0.14241181", "4": "0.22792456", "6": "0.103245534"}}
