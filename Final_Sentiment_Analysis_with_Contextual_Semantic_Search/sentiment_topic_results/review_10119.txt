{"text": "I bought this thinking that they would be like the old pair of Danskin microfiber skating tights that I had but I was SO wrong. These tights are literally comparable to a pair of $4.00 tights you can by at Walmart. They are not thick and sturdy like my old Danskin figure skating tights are, but rather thin and nothing special. I think this is the first purchase that I have ever made on Amazon where I actually felt ripped off for what I paid compared to what I got (and I order a lot on Amazon). I can't believe these tights are selling for what they are when comparable tights are at Walmart for less then half the price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.046773713", "1": "0.1490036", "2": "0.14911625", "3": "0.069044456", "4": "0.23834498", "5": "0.31025386", "6": "0.037463173"}}
