{"text": "These are perfect! The leg opening is tapered to the calf, but by the ankle the leg keeps straight. The result is a slimming, easy-to wear look. I wear them with boots or flats. The jean will stretch and shrink with wearing and washing, so I'd recommend ordering a size down (esp. if you don't wear junior's sizes). The color does stain a little, but mine stopped bleeding after 2 washes. I like Levi's a lot and these jeans will last a long time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19301021", "1": "0.26009694", "2": "0.080756776", "3": "0.29888186", "5": "0.12389273", "6": "0.040224627"}}
