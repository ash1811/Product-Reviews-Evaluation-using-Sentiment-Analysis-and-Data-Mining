{"text": "I purchased this pair of shoes for my 95-year old father and he really seemed to like them.  He said they were quite comfortable and they were easier for him to put on (velcro closure rather than laces).  I ordered his size and thought this pair fit him perfectly.  Unfortunately, my father passed away shortlly after receiving this gift, so I brought the pair of shoes to a homeless shelter... and pray that someone else is enjoying the comfort and fit as much as my father did.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11008776", "1": "0.2464976", "2": "0.19119483", "3": "0.15668675", "4": "0.08441317", "5": "0.04508272", "6": "0.16603719"}}
