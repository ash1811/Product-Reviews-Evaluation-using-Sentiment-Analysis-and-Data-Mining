{"text": "This is a great work boot especially for someone who has to stand and/or move around extensively throughout his/her work day.  In comparison to other work boots, these boots are more resistant to slippery surfaces.  Great for snowy/icy areas.  They are designed nicely and the Caterpillar quality is there.  Only drawback is that these boots are not as waterproof as they could be.  If it snows more than six inches in your area, your socks will get drenched.  Even though your socks are almost guaranteed to get wet, the boots actually dry rather quickly.  Great steel-toe too.  I would recommend this product to my friends.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.24707112", "2": "0.2051227", "3": "0.06839222", "4": "0.23061989", "5": "0.20146134", "6": "0.04498585"}}
