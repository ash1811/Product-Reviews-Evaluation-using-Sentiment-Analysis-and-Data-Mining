{"text": "These fit my husband really good. He is tall...well not that tall but taller than me for sure. He is 5'8 and is a size 32 on his waist. Everything he wears is a medium so I ordered these in medium.These fit him perfect. Not too big and not too small. It fit just right. I like that they are very soft but are not that thick. They are a bit on the thin side. Aside from that, they had a hole in the crotch area, my husband told me when he tried them on. I should have checked them for holes. I will always check clothes I order just to either sew them or return them depending on if they are repairable or not. Other than being on the thin side and the hole, they are alright. I don't think I would buy these again especially if they are expensive. Not worth it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.029906055", "1": "0.35861325", "2": "0.21228178", "3": "0.04581166", "4": "0.18407822", "5": "0.039596308", "6": "0.1297127"}}
