{"text": "I just got my new DW9052-1V in the mail today. The pictures online don't do the watch any justice. I opened the package and was shocked to see such an awesome time piece for around $40. The watch is BIG, bulky & tough looking. If it were a piece of bread, it would defiantly be classified under the Texas Toast variety. Suit wearing yuppies need not apply. This thing won't fit under your button up shirt sleeve. Very happy with my purchase. Thanks Amazon!UPDATE: I've worn the watch for a day & sadly had to return it. The watch band was very uncomfortable. I have since been wearing my G Shock 6900 1V. It feels & fits much better.2ND UPDATE 6-4-14I repurchased this watch once I got a solution from some amazon responses to my review. The band is interchangeable with the classic G Shock 6900. I purchased a band for around $13.00, The fit is awesome. Thanks Amazon readers / reviewers for the tip.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.116407014", "1": "0.32493663", "2": "0.1734941", "3": "0.04533677", "4": "0.10940356", "5": "0.05137603", "6": "0.1790459"}}
