{"text": "I only buy/wear Acorn slippers, usually the thongs; therefore believed I knew my size. WRONG> ordered usual L, 8-9 and it was too tight. I won't be wearing socks because these are already warm enough, but just to get my hoof in comfortably, I had to go to XL. BUT...If you like your slipper to fit as your shoe fits, DON'T size up.I'm especially impressed that I've not gotten 'sweaty feet', which is what has kept me from buying a full covered slipper before. Maybe it's because I did go up a size and have more breathing room.Also nice is the durability of the sole, so they can be worn outside without getting foot chilled/damp. I will update as I wear them, if there's durability issues. Curious to see how they clean up/wash. My other Acorns have seen many washes and still haven't fallen apart and look decent for being 'thru the mill'.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.062603325", "1": "0.2755137", "2": "0.0803751", "3": "0.15296535", "4": "0.06454952", "5": "0.18913896", "6": "0.17485404"}}
