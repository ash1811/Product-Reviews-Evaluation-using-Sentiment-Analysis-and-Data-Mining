{"text": "Fit is as expected -- Due to no wide shoe option available on the day that we purchased these we were forced to go up a size to hopefully get a wide enough shoe.  So the shoe is longer than it should be but fits okay in width ( still a little snug) but is is a similiar shoe to my wife's previous Easy spirit that she loved and that have lasted a long time,  but alas, everything good wears out ... and it seems that one can never find the same thing again.  Anyway, they look to be good shoes and they are functional so she hopes to get years of wear out of them like she did her previous pair of Easy Spirits.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11999185", "1": "0.44697312", "2": "0.19040404", "3": "0.07900373", "4": "0.06193479", "5": "0.056782696", "6": "0.044909794"}}
