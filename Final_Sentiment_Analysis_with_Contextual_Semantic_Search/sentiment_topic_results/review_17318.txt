{"text": "I have been plagued with foot problems for years!  In desperation, before I spent hundreds of dollars on specialists, I decided to try these shoes.  After wearing them for a few days, I noticed that my feet had quit hurting.  I have been wearing these shoes for two years now and I don't have any pain at all!!  (If I go barefoot for any length of time and sense that my feet are beginning to hurt, I just slip these back on and instantly I get relief!  I had to buy another pair because my original ones are looking grubby - I wear them on the beach.  Now I have indoor shoes and outdoor shoes.  How wonderful!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15971428", "1": "0.2239394", "2": "0.19264941", "3": "0.11832926", "4": "0.16871515", "6": "0.13393675"}}
