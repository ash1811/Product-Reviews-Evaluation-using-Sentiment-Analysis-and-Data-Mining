{"text": "Short version:Love them, great price, bought four pair, would buy them again, great service from Amazon (as always)Long version:Colors are accurate, and the red is really like Santa C. red :)I bought the 5XL and have a 31\" inseam - am 6'0\" tall - after washing in 'warm' and in the dryer for 50 minutes they fit me perfectly - so, they do shrink in the length (my fault by how I wash - but was planning for this) unless you take steps to keep that from happening - a 34\" inseam is too long for me, so I did the above on purpose.The cuff at the bottom is *not* tight (which is good for me).I would both recommend these to others, and will buy them again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.217196", "1": "0.3926915", "5": "0.22257577", "6": "0.16100164"}}
