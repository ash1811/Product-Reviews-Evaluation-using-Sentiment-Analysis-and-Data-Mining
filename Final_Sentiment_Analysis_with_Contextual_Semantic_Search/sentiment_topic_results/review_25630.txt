{"text": "I live in San Diego, and we do have a few chilly mornings. I bought these socks to warm my feet around the house, and to wear when I ride my bike around town. They are great...comfy, warm, and they really stay up nice on my calves. Not too thick & not too thin. If you're looking to wear them for more active wear...basketball, tennis, handball, etc...you might want a sock that is a bit thicker. I really like them for my purpose.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2431732", "2": "0.043258492", "3": "0.3475598", "4": "0.18950965", "5": "0.16933683"}}
