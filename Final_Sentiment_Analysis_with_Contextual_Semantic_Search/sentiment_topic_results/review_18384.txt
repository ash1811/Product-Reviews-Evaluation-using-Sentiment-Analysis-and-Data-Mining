{"text": "There is no question that when it has came down to Citizen, they have definitely made some excellent watches over the past several years. But there is no question that the Eco-Drive watches have came in all shapes and sizes that have definitely been worth their money. Titanium has also shown it, considering that there have been few lightweight titanium pieces on the market. This classic Citizen Eco-Drive handles well in weight, and comfort. It is very easy and simple to operate in the twist of the crown. I also like it because the hands really illuminate very well in the dark. It definitely is a great piece that is very easy to setup, without much hastle. I like this watch a whole lot, and it is definitely worth the money.Price: BSetup & Comfort: B+Overall: B 1/2+", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10518222", "2": "0.1685843", "3": "0.30411386", "4": "0.0741697", "5": "0.13601154", "6": "0.20941323"}}
