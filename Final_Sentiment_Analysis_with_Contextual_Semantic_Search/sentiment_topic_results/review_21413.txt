{"text": "This is my third pair of Keens and I'm not as happy with them as my other two pair.Sizing information: I normally wear a size 10 but in reading reviews of these I saw it suggested to bump it up a half size, so I did and ordered a 10.5 and they fit me perfectly; any smaller would have been too tight.Pros+ Very nice looking shoe and I get compliments on them. Mine are the Coffee Liqueur/Ceramic ones and the color in the picture is very accurate.+ Good for running errands, short walks, gardening, basic running around stuff.+ Easy to get on and off+ Washable.  No damage after washing (I use the delicate cycle and let air dry which inside to dry completely took about a day...outside less than a day)+ Cord pulls nice and tight and stays that way, I don't have to keep adjusting it.+ Great for riding my bikeCons- Slippery when wet. If I go in water or if my feet start to sweat (which they seem a little more prone to do in these), they get slippery.  Not to where my feet come competely out of them, but it's still annoying.  I have to pull them super tight to avoid them coming off when wet.  That is my biggest complaint since these are H2 water shoes.- They stink. If I wear them all day especially during high heat...they stink really bad, to the point I have to wash them after only one day.  My Keens before have never been like that.- Not that comfortable with long wear.- Made in China.  For the price of these shoes, you'd think they were made here and I'm disappointed that they aren't for that price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.045176543", "1": "0.32522357", "2": "0.07214831", "3": "0.17163375", "4": "0.04855543", "5": "0.18822609", "6": "0.14903627"}}
