{"text": "Far and away one of the best digital watches on the planet.The Casio 5600E is 30% lighter than its predecessor the 5600Cand therefore feels more comfortable on the wrist, although not ascollectable. Also the 5600C featured dual time.However, the styling was left unchanged, except for some very minorcosmetic changes with the writing on the face.You cannot perfect what is already perfected.The comfort is simply amazing for a what appears to be a bulky watch.The G Shock has internal dampners installed to provide outstandingshock resistance, including full contact sports, chainsaws, jackhammers, etc, 12 rounds with Mike Tyson and full cage fighting :-)Not to mention skydiving, space missions and scuba diving.Features: Classic Casio 1980's looks, which many people love.24 hour stopwatch, but...the time is kept displayed, very useful.24 hour countdown timer, again, with the current time displayed.Backlight, which flashes for the duration of the alarm and hourly time chime & timer.One alarm, not 3 0r 5 0r 19, as some people are annoyed by this, which I find kinda interesting.Extremely comfortable resin band.And of course the Illuminator...bring it on.I could go on all day and night about this watch, or perhaps write a novella on it, or evenbase my whole life memoirs, that is how much I love this watch, but I won't, for fears of repercussionsfrom my wife, my boss, my friends, and maybe even Casio themselves.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19127582", "1": "0.11562116", "2": "0.16136917", "3": "0.11653668", "4": "0.12053678", "5": "0.097880304", "6": "0.19678007"}}
