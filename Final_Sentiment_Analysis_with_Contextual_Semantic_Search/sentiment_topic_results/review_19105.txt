{"text": "My cousin wanted only New Balance shoes.  So I bought these for him.  It is too bad that I bought them in mid October, because I didn't see him to give them to him until November 22.  It was too late to return them.  They were not only too small, he was shocked that they are New Balance brand.  He said they are plain junk.  He handed them back to me.  What do I do with a pair of junk shoes?  And what is New Balance thinking to make shoes like these?", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.14798962", "2": "0.19175825", "3": "0.39474723", "5": "0.12475713", "6": "0.13356483"}}
