{"text": "i ordered these pants around 9 pm last night (January 24th) and was shocked to see them arrive at my doorstep at 1:30 today, super fast delivery. i ordered a size 13 i went up a size so i could have a little flair to the bottom of the pants, they fit perfectly. good quality for the money (im actually really surprised at the quality i was expecting way less) its great for work or in my case i paired it with a corset top....i would definitely recommend these pants.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06589253", "1": "0.4462274", "2": "0.070543796", "3": "0.08703362", "4": "0.082885034", "5": "0.09070878", "6": "0.1567088"}}
