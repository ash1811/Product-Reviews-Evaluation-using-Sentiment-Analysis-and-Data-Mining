{"text": "Like the title says this is my second Credit Card holder after my 1st one finally gave up after 5 years of use, actually it was the stitching that came apart not the leather and for the price I don't think 5 years of service is bad for the use I got out of it.  Nice supple leather and enough room for about 10 to 15 credit card or store cards.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.31443906", "2": "0.20892191", "3": "0.1371233", "4": "0.08135821", "5": "0.17916222", "6": "0.07541077"}}
