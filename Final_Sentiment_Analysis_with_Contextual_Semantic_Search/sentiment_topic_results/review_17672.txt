{"text": "I first encountered this watch in a big--box store, and found it a good value.  It's got an alarm which is excellent for travel, a stop watch which I seldom use, though good to have in a pinch.  In the default mode, it shows the time (duh!), the date and the day of the week.  It seems to keep good time (though it is hard to get it adjusted to the second), so that's a plus, since I hate to be late.The only downside to the watch is it's limited lifespan.  It will inevitably break at the area that attaches the watch band to the watch itself.  The old, old version of the watch was solid stainless steel.  It lasted forever.  The newer version is chrome-colored plastic, and just doesn't hold up as well.Oh, well, such is life.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.031865254", "1": "0.17340426", "2": "0.23117395", "3": "0.15469761", "4": "0.17714907", "5": "0.04824411", "6": "0.18346576"}}
