{"text": "I just bought one of these watches. It is a nice watch and feels solid and is well-built. The rubber-type strap is decent and I can't see anything bad in it. I like all the functions on this watch (date, alarm, chronograph, diver bezel, etc., etc.). Has it all. The metal base or housing piece is solid too. All-in-all a nice, solid watch (you can't of course tell from the web site how heavy the watch is, but it feels more solid than the image might suggest, and to me feels similar to my $ 250 Casio dive watch, albeit a not quite as heavy. In other words: perfect for summer, when you want something a bit lighter on your wrist. One thing I noticed is how BRIGHT it is in the dark. I pulled into the parking garage and literally said, \"Wow !\" out loud the first time I saw it in the dark. It has a luminosity that rivals that of my Luminox tritium watches. Very impressed by that.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.098033994", "1": "0.20306008", "2": "0.29449734", "4": "0.1696611", "5": "0.035167012", "6": "0.19746478"}}
