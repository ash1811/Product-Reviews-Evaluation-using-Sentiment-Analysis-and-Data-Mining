{"text": "I collect watches, and I am NOT one to shy away from big watches, and in some cases, the bigger the better.  What I really love about the X-Lander is that it is big but also very light-weight.  Normally when you see a wrist watch this large you have to exercise your arm quite a bit just to get used to telling time, but not so with the X-Lander.  And best of all: it does WAY MORE than just tell time!Interested in knowing where you are going?  How about the current temperature?  Are you just the slightest bit interested in what your current altitude may be?  GO BUY THIS WATCH!  'Course for those Suunto enthusiasts, this ISN'T a watch, its a Wristop Computer that just so happens to be able to tell time.  Unlike the Suunto Observer which is about half the size (and more than a little extra spendy), this baby will do all that and still look great doing it.  From the 3 different Suunto models I personally own, I must admit that they make a great wristop computer, or for the picky out there, watch.  I mostly use mine to tell simple time, but I must say that as I drive over the mountains up to Montana or over to Oregon and Washington, it IS handy to know a few extra details just by looking down at my wrist.  Oh, I almost forgot the barometer!  It tracks the barometric pressure and helps you track and even predict the weather!  I must say that I haven't been able to figure out the finer points of how to do that just yet, but I AM working on it.I guess if I HAD to point out one flaw, I would say that the night-glo feature it comes with isn't all that bright, and the alarm could stand to be louder -- but it IS about 5 TIMES more audible than the absolutely embarassing alarm built into the Observer.  Other than these minor complaints, I whole-heartedly endorse pretty much everything manufactured by Suunto, and especially the models I own, the X6HR, The Observer and of course the X-Lander.  Sylish, multi-functional and quite durable.  Choose one of these models and you will no doubt be as satisfied as I am.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08759657", "1": "0.28754067", "2": "0.21493717", "3": "0.039993986", "4": "0.120757386", "5": "0.18137841", "6": "0.06779581"}}
