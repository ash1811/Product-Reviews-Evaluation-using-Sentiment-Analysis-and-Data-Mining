{"text": "Just purchased a pair of these Dansneakers and I love them.  They are very comfortable and give me arch support, which is what I need.  I am a dance instructor and with hours on my feet teaching, I need a good pair of shoes I can teach in.  The last pair of Capezio Sneakers lasted several years.I highly recommend them for anyone who is active and needs a little more support for their feet.  I can also wear these Dansneakers with my heel inserts, which I need for the Plantar Fasciitis.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13892977", "1": "0.09360703", "2": "0.090563044", "3": "0.17681205", "4": "0.2488237", "5": "0.1054894", "6": "0.145775"}}
