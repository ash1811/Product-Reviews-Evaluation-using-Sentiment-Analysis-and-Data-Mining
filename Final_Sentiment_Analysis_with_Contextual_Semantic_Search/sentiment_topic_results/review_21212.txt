{"text": "I have a pair of similar leather favorite Keen oxfords I was trying to replace after years of wear (hole through sole bottom). These Austins ( and Finlays also) are just too wide for my medium too slightly slim feet. I own 5 pairs of Keens & they are comfortable, wear like iron though can be a little warm but the Austin exaggerates the broadness of the signature toebox to the point they feel like I'm wearing the shoebox. If you have wide feet they should be OK.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.031149765", "1": "0.2504294", "2": "0.1290434", "4": "0.28602418", "5": "0.15750168", "6": "0.14272982"}}
