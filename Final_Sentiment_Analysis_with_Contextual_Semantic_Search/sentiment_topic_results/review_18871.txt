{"text": "Levi Men's 514 Slim Straight Jeans, Dirt Rush color, 34x34The sizing is spot-on, I normally wear size 34x34 pants and these fit properly. The Dirt Rush color looks like a bronze/brown/mud color mixed in with dark blue denim. It is not apparent on Amazon's photographs, but it is not a bad color.The fit is definitely straight, and it actually feels a tad looser but is perfectly fine. The waist is very low-rise. I'm not usually one for following fashion trends, but magazines for men's fashion seem to indicate low-rise jeans are \"good to go\". These definitely don't look old fashioned, but the pricing is good, and the styling is sharp. The material and construction quality is excellent as well.I have a pair of Kenneth Cole reaction jeans that are a slim straight cut as well, but are sized tighter. Unfortunately, the material is paper thin. I actually burned a small hole in those when I got too close to the exhaust of my Ducati motorcycle. I was able to fix that with blue permanent marker, so that tells you how much I liked the styling. These Levi 514 jeans are a close match but with an even lower-rise waist. The pockets are great, and I have no serious complaints.Overall: 4/5 stars, great styling, sizing is good, and the color scheme is contemporaryUPDATE: 11 JAN 2013After wearing two pairs of these jeans for a long period of time, I find that the hems could have been tighter (at the ankles). They are advertised as straight cut, but they could be \"straighter\" in my opinion.The front pocket openings need to be wider. I can barely fit my hand in there, let alone with a pair of winter gloves. My latest pair has a really lose fitting button that comes undone each time I unzip the fly to use a urinal.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.3077403", "2": "0.14829303", "3": "0.13358188", "4": "0.12557578", "5": "0.14588048", "6": "0.13701402"}}
