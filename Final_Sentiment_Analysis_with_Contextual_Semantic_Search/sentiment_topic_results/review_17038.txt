{"text": "Beyond a doubt this is one of my all time favorite shoes.  I must admit to having four pair of them.  They are comfortable in the extreme and almost impossible to kill.  I am extremely hard on shoes and spend most of my time off the beaten path (literally).  I have had no problem with these shoe/sandals what-so-ever.  As bad as I have beaten the main pair I wear, the still took good when I hit civilization.The sandal has several features I love and the toe caps are at the top of this list.  I tend to run into things and with regular sandals I am constantly stubbing a toe, or indeed, cutting one!  No problem with these shoes.  They give the ends of the toe plenty of protection.As with another reviewer here, I had no problem with sizing and ordered my regular shoe size (of which I am not about to tell you what it is here), but trust me, they fit.I walk over some pretty rough and varied terrain and am completely satisfied with the tractions these shoes give.  Even over loose shale and rather slick creek bottoms, they hold me up well.I love the no tie stretchy lace on these.  They are fast and efficient.They clean up well.Most importantly though, these shoes are simply comfortable and extremely functional.  Also, you cannot beat the price they are asking here.  I paid a heck of a lot more for my first two pair.It must be noted that these do pick-up sand and dirt but to be honest, I have never owned a pair of like shoes that did not...it is in their nature to do so.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.054726016", "1": "0.28110427", "2": "0.20568587", "3": "0.16852066", "4": "0.13578935", "5": "0.1083914", "6": "0.045782458"}}
