{"text": "I am very pleased with this watch. It feels well on the wrist, looks good and keeps perfect time.  The manual is written clearly, and it is quite easy to set the analog and digital features of the watch.  I set it  to an atomic clock so that it is accurate to the second and remains so a month later.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.40762925", "2": "0.14570835", "3": "0.18975586", "4": "0.053043712", "6": "0.19395527"}}
