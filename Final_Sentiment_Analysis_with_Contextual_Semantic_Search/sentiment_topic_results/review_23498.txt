{"text": "This is a great looking watch for the price. Well worth it if you like this style of diver watch. I had a bad experience with an Invicta before in that it was so huge it was like wearing a grandfather's clock on your wrist and took wearing a wrist brace to lessen the pain associated with wear, so was hesitant but this watch is perfect size. Looks like a watch which would cost 3 or 4 times more than the price that I paid. I would highly recommend this watch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05738849", "1": "0.34302232", "2": "0.23326756", "3": "0.094457224", "5": "0.13625689", "6": "0.13246015"}}
