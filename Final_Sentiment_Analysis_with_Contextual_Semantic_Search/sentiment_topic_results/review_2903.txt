{"text": "I've got this bag 2 months back. It currently fits a Nikon d300, 17-55, 70-200, Sigma 10-20, Nikon 50mm f1.8, sb400, extra battery, couple lens filters.Pros:-construction. This bag is built very well. Material used seems of high quality, and the stitching is excellent. I really like the straps mechanism, as they feel very secure. The main strap also has some kind of rubbery strips on them, which helps keep the strap from sliding off your shoulder (and have your thousands of dollars come crashing on the ground)There is also a smaller hand strap, as opposed to the main sling strap, which is very convenient for helping you precisely lift the bag and place it, which I really like)-discreetness. This bag doesn't look like a typical photography bag, but rather just a standard sling bag. Makes me more comfortable when carrying it though airports, or places that I am not familiar with.-comfort. This bag is very comfortable to carry, even fully loaded, for hours. Because of the canvas nature of the bag, it molds to your body (assuming you pick it right), which makes it feel more secure at your side.Cons.-padding. This bag does not have too much padding, (it comes with a 4 compartment padding sleeve, which i have converted to a 2+1+1 padding sleeve, to fit my 70-200 lying at an angle), and no padding at all on the top. I think the padding is adequate, but probably could be improved.-price. Compared to other equivalent photo bags, this bag seems a little pricey.-weather proofing. This bag does not come with a waterproof cover, though, from what I read from other review, it is pretty waterproof, however, in pouring rain, I'm pretty sure that it will drench through. (not quire sure what you would be doing in pouring rain with your equipment). This can be fixed by packing a large garbage bag with you all the time, tacky but works.All in all, this is a very nice photographer's bag. Highly recommended.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17854697", "1": "0.20326263", "2": "0.18133761", "3": "0.2159326", "4": "0.10859599", "6": "0.11043943"}}
