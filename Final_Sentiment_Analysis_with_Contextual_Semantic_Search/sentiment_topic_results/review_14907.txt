{"text": "This bag has great quality except I don't like how the handles are not attached at the top, but in the middle of the bag. I think this is so you can tuck in the extra fabric if you don't need it, but that makes it hard to see what's in side and kind of sloppy looking. I'm returning and ordering the town tote, which may work better for me. This bag is probably better for travel than everyday.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.051789604", "1": "0.3698915", "2": "0.06305737", "3": "0.14914544", "4": "0.13498744", "5": "0.10562912", "6": "0.12549949"}}
