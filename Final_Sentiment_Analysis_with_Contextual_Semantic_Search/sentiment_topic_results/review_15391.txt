{"text": "The watch I received did not have the word \"Titanium\" on the dial as shown, which led me to think that it was a fake. Returned and waiting for a refund. I'll be buying this watch again but from a different merchant. Do not purchase this particular Skagen model from Jomashop.Updates*: So I returned the watch and ordered another one, this time, from Watchstar. And guess what? It doesn't have the word \"Titanium\" on its dial either. I suspect that Amazon just sent me back what I had returned. I guess I'll just take the 30% off they offered for this faulty product.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13384908", "1": "0.1129917", "2": "0.09704121", "3": "0.19018108", "4": "0.26207855", "5": "0.035511605", "6": "0.16834676"}}
