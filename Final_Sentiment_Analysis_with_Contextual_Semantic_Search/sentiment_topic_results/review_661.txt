{"text": "I use to own DR. Scholl's exercise sandals back in 1982 and at the time they use to be 19.99. I wore the sandals every day and gradually got my calf in better shape, no hip or back problems. I eventually worn them out by 1986 and had a hard time finding them since then, until I searched Amazon.com and found them again and the price is still reasonable. I love the navy and the white colors. I put mine in my wish list for my birthday or mothers' day.here is how you measure. put you foot ( if even doesn't matter wich foot, if uneven use the loner foot to determine your size). take a 11x12 paper and make two marks one at the heel and one at the big toe then look at the chart put your finger on the inches (foot measurement) and run across  to see your size. remember these sandals only run in whole sizes, so if your half go up one. also know your widthWomen:Size  Inches  CM4  8   214   8   21.65  8 5/8  21.95   8   22.26  9  22.96   9 1/8  23.27  9   23.57   9   24.18  9 5/8  24.48   9   24.89  10  25.49   10 1/8  25.710  10   2610  10   26.711  10 5/8  2712  11  27.913  11   28.6I hope this helps you to determine your size.
