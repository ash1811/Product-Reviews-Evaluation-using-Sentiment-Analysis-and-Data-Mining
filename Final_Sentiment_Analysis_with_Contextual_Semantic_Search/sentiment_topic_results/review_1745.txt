{"text": "This is the same product I usually purchase from Macy's Department store.  However, after a recent move I no longer have practical access to the store and am now shopping online more often.  I will say I am not a &#34;fancy&#34; person, and these are very practical.  My only complaint is that the price does not match Macy's sale prices which occur often.  On the flip side, as a Prime customer I do not pay shipping, and Macy's charges shipping.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.19085047", "2": "0.16270298", "3": "0.09730402", "4": "0.26170352", "5": "0.22624588", "6": "0.057427432"}}
