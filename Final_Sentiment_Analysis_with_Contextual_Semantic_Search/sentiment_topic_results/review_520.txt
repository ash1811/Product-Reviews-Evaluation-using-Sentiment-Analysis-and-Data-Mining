{"text": "I also bought a pair of the same size Carhartt jeans on Amazon at around the same time I bought these.  They are both nice jeans, but personally for my body the Wranglers seem to fit my form even better.  I like both but will probably buy these Wranglers exclusively going forward.  The material seems thick enough but not too much as to cause discomfort or scratchiness, and the cut is great for me.  I'm impressed.Just a warning, I just clicked the link to the size and color I bought and within about a week and a half they are offered now by a different seller at almost twice the price I paid.  So, if the price seems too high for you, be patient and keep checking your size every few days.  I'd bet the prices vary greatly depending on whether amazon sells them or if they run out of your size and another seller sells them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07757577", "1": "0.4417933", "2": "0.061948027", "3": "0.12260477", "4": "0.24056415", "6": "0.05319951"}}
