{"text": "This bag didn't last me a month.  So floppy and felt like a school kid really.  It's huge, so I will give it that.  But otherwise, the straps are twisted and mangled, in the first use.  The velcro is a large strip and attracts, a pile of hair, lint, ect. and before you know it doesn't serve a purpose anymore.  If you are have tons to carry, and just want a massive shoulder crusher this bag will do.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.06909551", "2": "0.3404548", "3": "0.14230274", "4": "0.1258158", "5": "0.10761696", "6": "0.21101396"}}
