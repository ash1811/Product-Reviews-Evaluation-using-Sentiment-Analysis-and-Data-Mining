{"text": "I received this wallet today and it is very nice. It's small and compact. It has plenty of room for credit cards and cash. The picture is a little wrong. The flap folds a different way but that doesn't affect the wallet in any way. This is a great wallet for the price.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.50816804", "2": "0.26115182", "4": "0.147522", "5": "0.065943085"}}
