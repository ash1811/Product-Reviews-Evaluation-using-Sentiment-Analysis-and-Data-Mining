{"text": "I usually take a 7. These are so huge. I've ordered 2 pair (1/2 AND whole size) smaller, hoping they arrive in time for my trip. I wonder if this is true of all Sketchers, as I see other styles I'd like. These look good, and I think they will be both versatile and comfy, hence the 3 stars. But if I cannot wear them, they're not getting more stars.So here I am, back weeks later, to say that the full size down was the pair that worked out for me. But they were fantastic on the trip, which involved a lot of walking on uneven terrain and cobbled streets! I have added another star,but not to five, so others will pay attention to the size difficulty.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12785333", "1": "0.21614835", "2": "0.07661221", "3": "0.3573442", "5": "0.11935512", "6": "0.100364365"}}
