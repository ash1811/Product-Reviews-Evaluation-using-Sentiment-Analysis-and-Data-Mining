{"text": "I ordered the size small, and my feet tend to be size 8 or 8.5; in running shoes I'm an 8.5.  The small is very snug, but if they weren't snug, they'd certainly slip and skid around on my feet.  I couldn't imagine doing yoga or pilates without these. It would be like spinning without bike shorts.  My only regret is that they probably will need to be replaced in 6 months of 1-2/week use; I had hoped they'd last a full year, but then again, I'm overweight, so you may wear yours out in less time!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14295408", "1": "0.2604992", "2": "0.047281925", "4": "0.20800121", "5": "0.13648589", "6": "0.2020722"}}
