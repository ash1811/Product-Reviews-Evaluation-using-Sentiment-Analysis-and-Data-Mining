{"text": "*****I just bought this shoe horn last week and LOVE it! I was skeptical at first because of the high cost over regular plastic or even wooden long shoe horns, but was convinced by the Amazon reviews. I agree with them now wholeheartedly. I also wanted to explain that the spring that people write about is just above the shoe horn part, and enables you to maneuver your shoe and foot around so that you can easily slip into the shoes. It is a really sturdy spring; in fact the whole shoe horn is very sturdy, and ends in a hook so that it can be easily stored on the wall. I will be buying another one of these for our home, because despite the expense, they are so easy to use that I don't want to struggle with others at all.Even if you don't have trouble bending over, who wants to sit down on the floor in dress clothes to struggle with their shoes? It's so easy just to slip them on with this. I'm very glad that this was invented to address a common problem.Highly recommended.*****", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.054115586", "1": "0.20361833", "2": "0.24418733", "3": "0.11519418", "4": "0.09238977", "5": "0.2455495", "6": "0.04494528"}}
