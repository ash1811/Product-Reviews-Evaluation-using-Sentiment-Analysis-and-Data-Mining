{"text": "I almost sent these back because when I first put them on the seam across the toes seemed to rub uncomfortably catching on my toenails, and I have to be comfortable. I decided to wear them around the house for a bit for a couple of days. I'm glad I did, whatever was rubbing and catching stopped, and these shoes are really comfy and go with skirts, summer shifts, shorts and jeans. The first day I wore them to work I was on my feet for 7 hours and they were great. I kinda wish I'd gotten the cute pink ones with black webbing but for some reason I switched to the yellow/green color at the last minute. But I like them. Also I saw these same shoes for $90 in one of my fav catalogs....SO A SCREAMING GOOD DEAL!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1510757", "1": "0.19565389", "2": "0.10655921", "3": "0.100091614", "4": "0.15069006", "5": "0.14679511", "6": "0.1491344"}}
