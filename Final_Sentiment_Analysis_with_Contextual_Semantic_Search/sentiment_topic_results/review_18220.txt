{"text": "I saw a friend recently with a similar calculator watch, and to be honest, I had to copy him.  I always wanted one as a kid, and my older brother had one, making me crave on even more.  When I found out they still make these suckers I had to jump on the opportunity.  So far the watch works wonderfully, and I have no doubt it will last for years.  If I had to complain about anything with this watch, it would be lack of water resistance, and lack of a light...but I knew of these before purchase, so I can't hold it against the watch.  Overall, it is wonderful, and I get more compliments on this watch then on some of my other much more expensive watches.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.033923905", "1": "0.09573669", "2": "0.41850442", "3": "0.17647968", "5": "0.11623611", "6": "0.15641524"}}
