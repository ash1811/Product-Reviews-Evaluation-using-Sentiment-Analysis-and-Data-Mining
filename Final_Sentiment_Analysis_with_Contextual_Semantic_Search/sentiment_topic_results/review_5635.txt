{"text": "After reading all the reviews, I ordered a size based on the size chart provided on the listing.  Glad I did because it fit as expected.  Unlike most &#34;t shirts&#34; this one is stretchy with a rib knit so no matter what size you are, it likely will be form-fitting but not strangling tight with a regular material tee.  It's really comfy and I'd buy more.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09158029", "1": "0.28963462", "2": "0.1573444", "3": "0.2930977", "4": "0.16016108"}}
