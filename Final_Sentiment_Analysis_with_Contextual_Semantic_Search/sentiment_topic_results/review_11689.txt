{"text": "My two year old niece has fallen in love with horses but is an only child and has almost everything imaginable!  I remember being a little child and loving the music box that I had so figured this would be the ideal gift for her.  Not only is the character adorable, there are lots of little storage compartments and the music doesn't sound \"tinny\".  I doubt this will become a family heirloom, but she is mesmerised by the movement and loves to keep her little precious things locked away.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.25481427", "1": "0.06762283", "2": "0.20475565", "3": "0.2859191", "4": "0.0691951", "5": "0.06263788", "6": "0.055055205"}}
