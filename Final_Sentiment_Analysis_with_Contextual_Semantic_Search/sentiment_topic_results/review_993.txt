{"text": "I love these boots. I have wider feet and these stretch to fit comfortably and mold to your feet. The soles are very soft and make little to no noise when walking, great for the urban ninja. They do lack tread so probably not great for walking on ice but otherwise very good looking and comfortable boots. I've had for a couple of months and they have gotten a bit stained which only adds to the character and rugged look.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.30426183", "3": "0.18664977", "4": "0.20862389", "5": "0.23586111", "6": "0.05744494"}}
