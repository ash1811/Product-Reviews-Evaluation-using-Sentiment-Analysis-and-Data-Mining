{"text": "So I had to send the first pair back. I normally wear an 11 tennis shoe, however these in 11 were way to big. Good thing amazon has free exchanges and I returned them for a size 10 (43). I had not tried them on in a store and even the soft foot bed was harder than I expected. The arch support is good and so far they are pretty comfy- no break in needed for my foot. I am almost certain that these are going to turn my feet black after lots of use. The good news is they will stay looking decent for a while becuase a little black shoe polish will touch them right up. They seem to be very high quality and they should be for $100", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04462349", "1": "0.2335644", "2": "0.12421815", "3": "0.3002805", "4": "0.23631637", "6": "0.058688276"}}
