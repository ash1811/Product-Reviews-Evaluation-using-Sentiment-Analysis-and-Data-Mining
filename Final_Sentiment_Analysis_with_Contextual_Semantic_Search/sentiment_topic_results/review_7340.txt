{"text": "The RIGGS WORKWEAR pants are very well made and will offer the user a long time of wear and comfort.The one item I can live with but was a bit disappointed in was the size.  I always buy my wrangler jeans in a 42 as after a wash or two they fit comfortably loose.  These RIGGS were a bit tight at the first try on.  I hope they do not shrink as they will become (for me) uncomfortably snug.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07567575", "1": "0.34609765", "2": "0.045693927", "3": "0.17709498", "4": "0.08083589", "5": "0.14845115", "6": "0.12615061"}}
