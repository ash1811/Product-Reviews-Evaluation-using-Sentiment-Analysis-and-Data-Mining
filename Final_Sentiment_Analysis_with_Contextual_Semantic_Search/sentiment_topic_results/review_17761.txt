{"text": "what kind i say what hasn't been said before?  its a great watch that does just that, tell you time and date.  i personally like the square design of the watch and i have seen them around a lot.  i find myself reaching for this watch more than my automatic watches.  the strap is comfortable and overall its light on the wrist.  would highly recommend for someone looking for a basic no frills watch.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06896843", "1": "0.100143805", "2": "0.38354608", "4": "0.23486802", "5": "0.11276605", "6": "0.09583478"}}
