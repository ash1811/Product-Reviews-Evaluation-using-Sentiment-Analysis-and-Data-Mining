{"text": "I purchased this watch because my prior experience with Casio has been excellent.  Casio makes a dependable, accurate, inexpensive watch.  I find this particular watch quite attractive and though lightweight, I like the metal band.  I have a perfectly good Casio watch almost the same as this one, but what good does it do to have a watch with a cheap resin band that will fail within a year with a ten year battery; and with a replacement watch band that costs more than a new watch.  I expect excellent use from this watch at a very low cost.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0519098", "1": "0.15706608", "2": "0.3224517", "3": "0.09683975", "4": "0.17151563", "5": "0.060444273", "6": "0.13977279"}}
