{"text": "I bought these for my son who pounds around on his feet all day and is in and out of rain, beaches etc.  He has had many Reefs and other brands and NOTHING is as comfy as Sanuks &#34;Squish&#34; sole sandals.  I highly recommend them for anybody who has to be on their feet and like really comfortable sandals.  My son wears them in a size below his normal shoe as they don't make half sizes.  I would highly recommend these.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0813749", "1": "0.32681772", "2": "0.07878715", "3": "0.36891636", "4": "0.13673417"}}
