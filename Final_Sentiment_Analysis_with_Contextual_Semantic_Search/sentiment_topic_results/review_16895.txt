{"text": "These are perfect.  They fit like a glove on my upper ear cartilage.  Comfortable and snug, yet I can't even feel them there.  For me, there was no fussing or bending, they are the perfect size for the upper ear and the quality is very high.  They look classy, and are very well made.  As usual, I am very happy with Amazon Marketplace for their super prompt and efficient service!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.40442708", "2": "0.14942828", "4": "0.039080314", "5": "0.115576595", "6": "0.28351444"}}
