{"text": "Money was not an issue in selecting this watch.  I shopped online and in several stores.  This was the perfect size (moderate), not very heavy or thick analog watch with easy to read numbers, day and date.  Love my iPhone, iPad, AirBook laptop but for telling time, this still seems the best for me.  The face even lights up at night or in dark restaurants.  Had to purchase a larger band for my pudgy wrist, but still less than $50 all in and still 4 to 10 times LESS than anything else that came close to my &#34;specs.&#34;  Great bargain and a great watch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.17767423", "2": "0.1838107", "3": "0.12694804", "4": "0.123495795", "5": "0.27265748", "6": "0.11302361"}}
