{"text": "I had a pair which lasted for over 15 years!!  Finally cracked this spring so I ordered a new pair.  I am at the gym by 5:30 a.m. five days a week and the weather here in Southern Maine/NH border can change very quickly.  I hate wet, cold feet and these boots keep me warm and give good traction.  I have received quite a few compliments and I've a friend who ordered a pair.  I also ordered a pair for my husband as a Christmas gift.  Great seller fabulous product!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.066132076", "1": "0.21425904", "2": "0.096218586", "3": "0.29939216", "4": "0.13988495", "5": "0.18124849"}}
