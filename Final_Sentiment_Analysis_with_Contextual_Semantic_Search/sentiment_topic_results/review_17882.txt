{"text": "Between my hands-on job involving solvents and my toddler, I can't wear pricey watches anymore and was looking for a cheap, reliable replacement. I normally go to Timex for my every-day watch but after my last one broke, I decided to give this Casio watch a try. I'm happy to say it looks very nice and stylish - I particularly like the sleekness of this watch which seems to make my forearms look slimmer. The strap is comfortable, the watch is water-resistant (at least so far!) and it tells the time accurately. For myself, that's all I need in a watch at the moment so this has worked very well for me.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1684949", "1": "0.1886447", "2": "0.2894456", "3": "0.14247438", "4": "0.058481604", "5": "0.037478648", "6": "0.11498018"}}
