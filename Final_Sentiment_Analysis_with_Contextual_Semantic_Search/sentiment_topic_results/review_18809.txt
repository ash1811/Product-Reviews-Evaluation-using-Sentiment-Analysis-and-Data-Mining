{"text": "I've been wearing my Levi Cargo Pants for a couple of weeks now and I love'em. They're loose fitting and baggy and very comfortable. They are definitely for casual activities only!The material used for these pants is a bit limp for my taste with almost no 'body' to them. I suppose come summer time these pants will feel a lot better.The front pockets are very shallow, and the material the pockets are made from is very thin and will probably not last very long, from experiences I've been through with pockets of similar construction.They're a very comfortable pair of pants, but judging from the material and the construction of the pants, I have a feeling these pants are not very rugged. I also have a feeling that these pants won't last very long in MY world!These pants will probably last a year in MY world, maybe two if I baby them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.4730277", "2": "0.07907426", "3": "0.20355856", "4": "0.13229899", "5": "0.023084361", "6": "0.08651314"}}
