{"text": "I bought a pair of these last year that were sadly eaten by my puppy. I bought an Aqua pair as a replacement this year. I couldn't imagine going through a summer without a pair of sandals this comfortable. Apparently I didn't pay enough attention to the picture of the product. I didn't realize the sole would be brown instead of black. It looks nice with the Aqua blue though. The sandals look great with my whole wardrobe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.31309167", "2": "0.10863933", "3": "0.26020768", "4": "0.124246925", "5": "0.18699543"}}
