{"text": "I purchased this watch  and my son wantedone so I bought another for him. At the priceit is cheaper to import from Amazon than buyingin my country.Light weight and comfortable to wear, thedigital display is easy to read and I never takeit off. Water resistant in the shower and greatwhen sailing it is the perfect 'beater' watch.Inputting data was a breeze and the light works well,the luminous hands keep on glowing all night long andglow brighter than my Timex. Every digital feature ofthis watch is useful to me, the perpetual calendar inparticular.I'm hard on watches so if I get 3 years use from itbefore I break it or the battery needs replacing, Iwill be more than happy.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13080502", "1": "0.13874155", "2": "0.11238724", "3": "0.14022796", "4": "0.2843661", "5": "0.10895443", "6": "0.084517665"}}
