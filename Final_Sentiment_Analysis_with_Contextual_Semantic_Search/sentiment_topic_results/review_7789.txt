{"text": "ProsGood designGood quality.ConsSizing is missleading, it runs LARGE. I usually wear 10 but this 10 is too large even with heavy winter socks.It says, it is ok for -40 F. It is cold even for -10. So if u plan to wear it somewhere close to north or south pole, try something else.Overall - it's good for mild Russian (Moscow) Winter.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.0703993", "1": "0.2154142", "2": "0.16141868", "3": "0.05737675", "4": "0.17713636", "5": "0.16115268", "6": "0.15710206"}}
