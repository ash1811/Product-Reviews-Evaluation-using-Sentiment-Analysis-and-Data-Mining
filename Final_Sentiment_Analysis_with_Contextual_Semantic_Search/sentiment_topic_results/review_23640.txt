{"text": "This is my second one of the same design. I love it because you can dress it up or down. Simple, sleek yet sophisticated. Another added plus is it is great for small wrists so it fits perfectly since this is problematic for me with larger watches.The only reason I had to replace it is because I cracked the faceplate after buying a new battery  trying to put the back on which was very difficult.For me, I agree with some of the other reviewers this watch looks better in person. As long as this Armitron watch is offered I will be a loyal owner.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2673869", "1": "0.25340274", "2": "0.14500864", "3": "0.13142766", "4": "0.08465998", "5": "0.021886691", "6": "0.09622737"}}
