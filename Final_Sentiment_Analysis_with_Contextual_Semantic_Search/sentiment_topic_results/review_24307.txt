{"text": "I hate wearing pantyhose - period.  But when I put these on, I almost cried.  They were super soft, they didn't tear too easily, they didn't make me feel stuffed or itchy.  It also matched my skin tone so well no one knew I had them on!!!  I wore them so many times, washed them over and over, and finally I got a run and a hole in them.  Still, it matched my skin color so well I actually had to lift them off of my thigh to show anyone my hole - my coworkers thought I was crazy for talking about the mysterious hole in my stockings.  However, I will say that hole grew pretty big and I ended up looking like somebody's cheap thrill for the night!  So thankfully it happened towards the end of the day and no one noticed!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.122562684", "1": "0.31272155", "2": "0.23426862", "4": "0.08017085", "5": "0.065055296", "6": "0.18282254"}}
