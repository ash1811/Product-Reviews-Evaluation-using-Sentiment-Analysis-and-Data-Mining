{"text": "I have had this watch for about 3 months as a replacement for another brand that finally malfunctioned after many years of frequent wear.This watch simply doesn't keep the right day and date. It reverts to Jan. 1 and Friday. I have been wearing watches for decades and this is the worst watch I've ever had.The watch's crystal somehow got dry paint on it within a week, and I didn't treat it harshly.The paint eventually came off.I've had the problem that some reviewers mentioned of previous watches breaking where the metal pin connects to the main (round) part of the watch, but I don't remember what brand they were, maybe this one.Next time I buy a watch I'll ensure the crystal (clear window) of the watch is recessed below the rest of the watch so if I put it face down somewhere the crystal won't get scratched. Otherwise the watch is fine but the scratches are disappointing.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2508703", "1": "0.22392367", "2": "0.23222037", "3": "0.20774785", "4": "0.01996781", "5": "0.063163444"}}
