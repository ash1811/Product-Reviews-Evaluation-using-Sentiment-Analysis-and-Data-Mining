{"text": "My son who is 4 is very picky about shoes. The way they feel or flop on his feet. He will not wear flip flops or the Velcro type of sandals and he loves these! Now we don't have to wear socks and shoes all of the time! I find they fit him true to his usual shoe size. Fun colors to choose from too. Mine wanted them brown like the dirt. Go figure :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.42400375", "2": "0.32626566", "4": "0.12294423", "6": "0.11465876"}}
