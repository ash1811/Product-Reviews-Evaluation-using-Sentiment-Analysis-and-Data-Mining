{"text": "We used these at the beach, and they're great. They don't make the kids' heads too hot, and they keep the sun off their necks and faces. They're a thin material that doesn't soak up water so they even work in the pool (for my kids who don't put their heads in yet). The only thing not to love is the way the bill will crease if it's bent. I've learned this and try to keep them flat in the suitcase, but they keep getting bent in backpacks or the carseat etc. It's not a big problem but worth mentioning. The youth and kid sized hats do have different straps to keep them on. The youth size has the adjustable toggle that you slide up under the chin. The smaller hat has a more regular strap adjustment. We do use the straps on windy days.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.22573581", "2": "0.120091714", "3": "0.18134345", "4": "0.19422473", "5": "0.2178253", "6": "0.058351304"}}
