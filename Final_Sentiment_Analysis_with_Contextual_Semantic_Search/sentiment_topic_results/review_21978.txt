{"text": "These shirts were a great disappointment for me. The temps are on the decline and I work outdoors so I decided to order three of these shirts. I thought that they were a little pricey but If they were heavyweight I would give them a try. Upon arrival I found that they were very small even though I ordered xxl. And the material was not soft at all. I returned all three shirts and found three replacements at the local Costco for $12.99 each.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.31793445", "1": "0.09532426", "2": "0.13650097", "3": "0.43975863"}}
