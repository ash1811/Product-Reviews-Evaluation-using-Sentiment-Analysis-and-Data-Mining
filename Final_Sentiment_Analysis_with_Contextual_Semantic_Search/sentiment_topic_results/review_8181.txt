{"text": "I have had this bag for ten -- count 'em 10 -- years. After a decade as my everyday purse, it's finally starting to show its age, so without hesitation I'm going to buy a direct replacement. (My only argument with myself is whether I should invest in the leather version.)I over-stuff my purse, demonstrating to my husband that yes, a woman's purse IS a black hole from which anything might emerge... and its weight shows it, too. But this bag has never complained no matter how many items I shove into it. Because of the microfiber, the bag has gone through the washing machine and dryer (on delicate, just for safety's sake) so it has continued to look good.I'm a klutz, too, so I have long appreciated that almost EVERYthing can be closed up with a zipper. This has saved me from many \"dump my bag upside down\" experiences, so I have no qualms about using a purse that is not uber-fashionable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.1688403", "2": "0.16830276", "3": "0.27129674", "4": "0.19533668", "5": "0.09174217", "6": "0.102240324"}}
