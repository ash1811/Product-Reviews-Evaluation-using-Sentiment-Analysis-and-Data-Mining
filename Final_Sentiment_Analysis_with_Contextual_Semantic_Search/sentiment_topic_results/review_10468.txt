{"text": "I was very excited to purchase the Dakota Slippers and was so dissapointed for the following reasons:1. Ugg sizes are so unpredictable. I own a pair of ugg boots size 9 (usually wear 8 1/2) and they fit pretty good. I read the reviews and decided to order a size 9 for this shoe, my feet barely fit and feel squeezed. I order a second pair of boots size 9, they were big.2. I tried to walk around with both shoes on and it was very uncomfortable, the sole seems too narrow for the width of the shoe (plus the fur) so it feels like my ankles were going to bend anytime.3. The inside fur sole appears to be glued to the bottom of the shoe with very cheap glue, The sole from shoe I first tried on was starting to come off4. The heel is very low so when you step forward it very easily slips off.I decided to return the slippers and probably will not purchase ugg shoes again, they are quite expensive for the quality I product.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16660127", "1": "0.30046177", "2": "0.09779286", "3": "0.187016", "4": "0.09789415", "6": "0.14803024"}}
