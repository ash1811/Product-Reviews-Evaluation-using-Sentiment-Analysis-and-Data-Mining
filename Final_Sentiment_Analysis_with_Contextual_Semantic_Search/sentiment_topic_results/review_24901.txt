{"text": "After sever pain in one foot, and months too late, I finally went to a Podiatrist to find out I don't have a burr, but a torn ligament. After a grateful shot of cortisone in my foot, he recommended only these insoles! They are better then all the Dr. Scholls I've bought - way better. Also Amazon seems to have the best price, about $10 cheaper then other places I've seen them. I'd recommend them - highly!  Now I'm going to buy 2 more pairs because the pain has come back and these are the only relief I get for my foot.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16146678", "1": "0.097474724", "2": "0.084498964", "3": "0.11435963", "4": "0.3777779", "5": "0.109791", "6": "0.054630954"}}
