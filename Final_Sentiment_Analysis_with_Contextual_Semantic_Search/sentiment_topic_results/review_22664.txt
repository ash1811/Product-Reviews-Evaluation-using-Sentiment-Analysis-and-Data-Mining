{"text": "I have purchased Hanes underwear in the past, and they fulfill their purpose and the price is right. The reason I only gave this purchase 3 stars is that, even though I washed the underwear before wearing them, the first one I put on caused me a red, hive-like rash around the waistband. This had never happened to me before with past Hanes underwear or any others (or ANY clothes). Therefore, I was afraid to wear them again; and since I had purchased other packages of Hanes and packages of another brand I use, I never wore any from that package since.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13195564", "1": "0.2980916", "2": "0.10591382", "3": "0.23279181", "4": "0.22593309"}}
