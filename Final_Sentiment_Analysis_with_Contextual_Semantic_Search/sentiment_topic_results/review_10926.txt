{"text": "I purchased the Nubra for a recent wedding in which we wore backless halter dresses. I wanted something that would provide a little coverage and wasn't confident that the little pasty stickers would get the job done. The Nubra worked like a charm. It remained in place from about 2pm in the afternoon to almost 2am that evening, even with a few hours of dancing thrown in. I have only worn it once so far but would absolutely wear it again for an occasion like this.Before purchasing, I had tried the sticky bras on in a store and found that I needed to go a size up to get what felt like adequate coverage and didn't create a cone bra look. I am typically a 36-B and went up to a C. Despite claims on the box, I couldn't figure out how to get the cups positioned in order to create lift. The adhesive covers the whole back of the bra and is very sticky but didn't cause me any issues in removal. It took me a couple of tries to get the cups positioned evenly. After taking it off, I rinsed the adhesive off as instructed which was easy enough.I did try the bra on with a looser tank top and felt less confident that it would stay in place. It does feel a little weird. I hope to give it a shot in a low risk situation.One final comment is that the bra comes in a rather large plastic box. The manufacturer recommends keeping the bra in plastic so that the adhesive doesn't get dirtied with dust or whatever. This makes it very inconvenient for traveling.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15398318", "1": "0.16359714", "2": "0.11563178", "3": "0.21988708", "4": "0.06514925", "5": "0.1364838", "6": "0.14526783"}}
