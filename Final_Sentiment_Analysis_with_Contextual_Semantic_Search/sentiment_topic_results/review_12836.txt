{"text": "A mistake to buy for younger kids Igift for six year old) because so hard to make out the hands with moving lizards going round and round. an excellent design were it larger but it is smaller than expected - my fault as i didn't check the size. however it is sturdy and attractive, so i will wear it for myself at times - for fun. I didn't return as it was so inexpensive and just replaced it for intended gift, with a digital watch. haven't seen that yet.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09382512", "1": "0.16969284", "2": "0.122890815", "3": "0.24656682", "4": "0.12632366", "5": "0.11796589", "6": "0.122734845"}}
