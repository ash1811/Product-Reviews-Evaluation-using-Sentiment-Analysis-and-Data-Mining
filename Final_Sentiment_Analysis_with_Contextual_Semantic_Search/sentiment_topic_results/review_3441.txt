{"text": "Got this bra because I am pregnant and needed an inexpensive, wire-free bra.  I am pleased with the support, the look under my clothes, and the comfort of this bra. It stays in place and does not need adjustment during the day.  Seems to fit true to size. I just wish it came in black.  Had to get another style in black and it is not nearly as comfortable as this one.  Would purchase again in a second.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2914821", "2": "0.13589841", "3": "0.29551703", "4": "0.077092595", "6": "0.19205122"}}
