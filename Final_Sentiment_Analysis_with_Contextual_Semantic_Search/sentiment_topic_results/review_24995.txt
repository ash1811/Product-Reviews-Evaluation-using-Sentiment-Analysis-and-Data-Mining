{"text": "After spending years and thousands of dollars on podiatrists and cortisone injections and accupuncture, at the recommendation of an individual at a running store I tried superfeet inserts.  I purchased my next pair on Amazon.  These, along with a good (not cheap) pair of athletic shoes (Nike Vomero 7) for me did the trick.  I am on my feet alot and I wear them everyday.  I truly would not be without them.  I was skeptical at first because they are so hard but if you break them in properly and are religious about wearing them, it has been the best pain relief for me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08440237", "1": "0.29079375", "2": "0.21764931", "4": "0.22652203", "5": "0.116173424", "6": "0.061691366"}}
