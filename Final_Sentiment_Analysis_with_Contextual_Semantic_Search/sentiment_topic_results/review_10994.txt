{"text": "My husband wears a 9 - 9.5 so purchased the size 9.5 in these shoes.  The style is great, as is the brown color, but they were too small.  He has narrow feet but had a hard time getting his foot into the shoe.  I guess shoes are something you really have to try on yourself for the proper fit.  Returning them but sad to do so because they were a great price, great brand, and great style.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04328716", "1": "0.48891222", "2": "0.10271477", "3": "0.11991496", "4": "0.15379992", "5": "0.05090504", "6": "0.040465906"}}
