{"text": "We live at high altitude in one of the dryest states.  The sun can be brutal.  These hats help my children by protecting them from the sun and limiting the amount of sunblock needed to be slathered on.  They are much more protective than other style caps owing to their wide brim that curves all the way around to the neck flap.  They're very comfortable, light, and even the chin strap is both comfortable and effectively holds the hat on.  They adjust and fit well.  My kids wear them.  My 2.5 year old likes hats and wears them, my 1.5 year old likes to take hats on and off but this one stays on.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.023289496", "1": "0.3272633", "2": "0.08075336", "3": "0.2398187", "5": "0.17925528", "6": "0.14741234"}}
