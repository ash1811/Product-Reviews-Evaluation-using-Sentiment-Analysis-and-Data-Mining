{"text": "I love these socks. They are a bit expensive, so I waited for a sale, but they are really top of the line. One easy way to tell a well-made sock?  When you take them off at the end of the day, are stray sock fibers sticking to your toes?  That's a sign of a sock that will fall apart on you. These Thorlo socks don't have that problem.The sizing is true. I wear shoe size 6 and I have wide feet. I ordered these socks in Woman's Small (5-6.5) and they fit just right.The cushioning is great. I use them for everyday in my tennies - you don't have to be hiking to appreciate both the cushioning and the CoolMax wicking.I noticed that sometimes the Thorlo sizing on amazon pages states Sm(4-6). I don't know if that's an actual difference in the sock sizes, or just a difference in how the seller enters the sizes on an amazon page.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14296927", "1": "0.24071118", "2": "0.16050686", "3": "0.07696776", "4": "0.092040785", "5": "0.21058173", "6": "0.07622244"}}
