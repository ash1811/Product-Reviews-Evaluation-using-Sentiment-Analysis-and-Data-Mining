{"text": "I brought these, brand new and unbroken in, on a trip to NYC just to wear around the hotel and such, as a backup for an extremely pricy pair of \"comfort\" sandals. Well, by the end of day one, the alleged comfort sandals had given me a horrific blister, and it was these Sanuks that I wore around for the rest of the trip. They have the most amazing, cushy footbed, and the straps/toe-piece do not rub at ALL. I wore them for probably 5+ miles each day, and though yes, my feet ached at the end of the day, I was mercifully blister free. They're pricy for flip-flops, but so worth it. Some of the reviews I've read here have down-rated them because they're apparently not great in the rain or at the beach, but since that's not my purpose in buying them, I can't comment on this. All I can say is, if you're looking for an exceptionally comfy pair of flip-flops that can be worn for miles and miles, these are them. The moment I got home I bought another pair in another color!UPDATE 07/01/13:Ok, I just have to add about the whole 'rain' thing. I unexpectedly got caught in a rainstorm in these the other day. Like, torrential rain. And yep, they're TERRIBLE in water. So if you want to wear these to the pool or beach, pick another kind of flip-flop! They become very squishy and slick when wet... but okay, whatever. The more noticeable and annoying thing is that they foam up. Literally, I looked like I had little soap bubbles coming from my shoes! They dried out alright overnight, but I am going to be A LOT more careful about wearing them when the forecast calls for rain...", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11049232", "1": "0.06640609", "2": "0.075388625", "3": "0.36343867", "4": "0.04637533", "5": "0.21192878", "6": "0.12597018"}}
