{"text": "I've had one pair of these shoes for several years now (Bison color full leather) - the inside heel counter needs to be relined, but even the sole doesn't show much wear. My feet are hard to fit - but the Eur 46 size is a brilliant and comfortable fit (I replaced the original insole with Superfeet Green, as I have plantar fasciitis - no more pain!) and a fantastically comfortable walk; they are rugged but relatively lightweight for such a build. Especially when traveling, I walk these shoes 4 - 6 miles a day, pavement, cobblestone, etc. and have taken them all over the world. The GoreTex keeps my feet dry if it rains, the soles cushion one's step well, the leather holds up and holds up (I give them a polish with two layers, and with a month of travel just need to use a shoe cloth to take the dust off and bring back the polish) for street, moderate trail or city use. European craftsmanship is is reflected throughout in the fine build and fit.(I am writing the review because I just ordered a new pair so I can wear them while my older ones get the heel cup relined). As in all shoes, get measured properly and order the size you need - if you don't know you may as well go and get your feet measured.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11346264", "1": "0.27436203", "2": "0.24784943", "3": "0.068833075", "4": "0.190709", "5": "0.0462339", "6": "0.05854991"}}
