{"text": "My true size is an 11.5 EE and this pair nailed it down solid. I usually have to settle for a pair of 12 D (E - if I'm lucky.) A bit apprehensive I went on a prayer and am so glad I did. They do scuff a little bit too easy but they are beautiful and I have received several compliments already. I'm still breaking them but I can tell you already that won't be long. The fit was almost tailor made. I am most pleased and they were about $20-$25 less than local stores.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.036907382", "1": "0.15588456", "2": "0.13950618", "3": "0.2568376", "4": "0.11083419", "5": "0.12805867", "6": "0.1719714"}}
