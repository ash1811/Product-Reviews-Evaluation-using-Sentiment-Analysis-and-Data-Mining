{"text": "Many years ago, did a review on these jeans when I sort of starved myself, so I did wish to update what I said.  Was a 6 then; now I am a healthy size 8.  Took the 10 short, and while a little big, they are still that wonderful Wrangler quality, fit and style.  These are cut for real women with curves, tummies, that look like real people, not stick models.  I am now over 60, and they fit in all the right places.  If you like a slightly snug fit, then take your real size.  If you like a little loose, size up.  Here in Austin, we go for comfort!  I cannot say enough good things about these jeans.  The fabric is also nice and soft, not that fabric that feels &#34;cardboardy&#34;.  So go for it!  These are wonderful!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.025695456", "1": "0.3795685", "2": "0.02629342", "3": "0.10083066", "4": "0.04175128", "5": "0.16521122", "6": "0.2606495"}}
