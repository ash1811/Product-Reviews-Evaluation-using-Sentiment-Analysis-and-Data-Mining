{"text": "My husband, before he was my husband did not like doing laundry. He had THOUSANDS of socks, of all shapes and sizes, and these were not only the last ones left after 5 years (durable for a guy like him working on billboards and the like) but they were the ones he said are the most comfortable. So since the socks he had were practically gray (but not worn out) I decided the man needed new socks and looked them up. Amazon beat even Wal Mart. He is a very happy camper!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.038704988", "1": "0.20924062", "2": "0.06569814", "3": "0.08593272", "4": "0.25415322", "5": "0.2262094", "6": "0.12006091"}}
