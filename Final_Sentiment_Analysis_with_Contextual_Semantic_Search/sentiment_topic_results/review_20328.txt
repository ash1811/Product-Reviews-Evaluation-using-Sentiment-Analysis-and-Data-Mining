{"text": "Awesome, comfortable hiking boots. I have worn these a few times and haven't been uncomfortable at all -- no blisters, etc. They're very sturdy, too. I'm usually a size 9 (which I ordered) and every once in a while my toes hit the ends so maybe if given the opportunity again I would have ordered a 9.5 but it's not enough discomfort to complain about. I'm pretty picky about needing arch support, which these have. I got a cast off from a broken ankle about 5 weeks ago and these took me nicely through my first 2 hour hike since February this year. Definitely recommend.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15348034", "1": "0.30068862", "2": "0.025474185", "3": "0.25267032", "4": "0.13588941", "6": "0.12932585"}}
