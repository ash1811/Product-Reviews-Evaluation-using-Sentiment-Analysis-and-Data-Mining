{"text": "I have several versions of this watch. The others are easy to read: black hands on white background (with numerals or just tick marks) and gold hands on black background (elegant look).  They get 5 stars.  This one--gold hands on a gold background--is very hard to read. The contrast between hands and face is not as good as shown.By the way, it's easy to replace the battery on these watches. The batteries can be had for $1 apiece if you look online.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0418905", "1": "0.2285451", "2": "0.13275097", "3": "0.40855154", "4": "0.047859732", "5": "0.10379249", "6": "0.03660969"}}
