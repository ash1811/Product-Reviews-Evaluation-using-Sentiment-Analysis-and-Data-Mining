{"text": "My last Jansport lasted 15 years and aside from being a bit dirty and scuffed., it will probably last another 15 years easily! I got this backpack to fit my laptop, 5 full sized books, a hefty graphing calculator, a ton of notepads and supplies, a hard drive, headphones, and my IPad. This backpack is easily big enough to carry all this stuff without the need for dozens of pockets. A well made product from Jansport as usual, and in 15 years I will probably be in need of another.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.101135194", "1": "0.2526941", "2": "0.21743958", "3": "0.23703098", "4": "0.09237019", "5": "0.0347306", "6": "0.06459931"}}
