{"text": "As someone who loves her high heels more than her feet do, I was excited about these inserts. Easy to insert, they help alleviate and to a certain extent the knee pain and general exhaustion that can come from a long day of running around in my heels, and are a life saver when going dancing or to a party. While they aren't perfect, they are definitely a step up (!) from Dr School's versions.They come with velcro \"dots\" to help them stay in place, especially for strappy or backless shoes. In general, I have found these to be ineffective. Either the insert would move around too much, or be too visible to make them worth it.They won't fit all shoes. Especially in those shoes that are already a snug fit, these can make the shoes too tight.If, like me, you'd appreciate some more arch support in your favorite pair of heels, these are definitely worth a try!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.040330846", "1": "0.15029722", "2": "0.054064367", "3": "0.34651968", "4": "0.115697764", "5": "0.1276171", "6": "0.16547298"}}
