{"text": "I have been buying this style of Reebok for years & I just love them!!!  I know from past experience that they are comfortable, will keep my feet warm & dry; plus, most of all, they will last a long time.  My foot took a sudden growth spurt so I could no longer wear the ones I've been wearing for over 10 years.  I'd been unable to find them in the stores locally; so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon & immediately ordered them.  Some complained that they had to buy a larger size; but I've found them to be true to size.  Due to the quality of the material, they might feel a bit snug when you first put them on especially if you wear thick socks.  I just wear a thinner sock for the first few days & they mold to my feet within a day or two.  I'm practically living in my new Reeboks now!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.31924146", "3": "0.31211135", "4": "0.25557172", "5": "0.061374668", "6": "0.046847112"}}
