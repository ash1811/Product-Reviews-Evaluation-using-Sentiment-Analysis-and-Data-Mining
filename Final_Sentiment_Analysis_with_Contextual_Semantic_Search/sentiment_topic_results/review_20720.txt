{"text": "The plus is that these are sized very well. I have size 11 gloves and these fit my hands and fingers perfectly. When I first put them on they seemed to add some warmth underneath my cashmere lined leather gloves. But after a half hour walk in wind chills in the high teens and low twenties they didn't seem to do much good. I bought them because my fingertips tended to freeze up with just my gloves. But they freeze up about the same with these liners too, so I don't think they actually provide much extra warmth.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12616232", "1": "0.25898975", "2": "0.19838193", "3": "0.22130439", "4": "0.14151736", "6": "0.050582923"}}
