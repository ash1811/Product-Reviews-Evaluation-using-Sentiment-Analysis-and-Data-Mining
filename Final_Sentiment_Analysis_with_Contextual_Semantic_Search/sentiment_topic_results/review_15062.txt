{"text": "Had to walk up to the post office to pick up package and didn't even wait to get home to open the package. Opened it up took a peak inside to check if they were the sneakers I ordered. They were. When I finally got home I tried my sneakers out and took a walk in them around the block walking my pet and I love them. I would order another pair from this buyer.
