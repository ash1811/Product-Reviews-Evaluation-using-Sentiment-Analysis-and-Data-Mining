{"text": "This is perhaps the best jacket I have ever purchased.  It is a medium weight coat, not something you would wear as a heavy duty parka in the coldest of conditions, but because it is waterproof I find it to be a fantastic top layer in almost all conditions.  I will generally wear this coat any time the high temperature is predicted to top out in the forty degree or lower range.  When it gets to the depth of winter, and you are looking at highs below say twenty five, I throw a sweatshirt under this coat and I am fine, and more prepared for all conditions because of the aforementioned waterproof attribute of this garment.  After two years of steady use it shows a few marks of consistent wear, but over all durability has been excellent.  I am a real supporter of Carhartt products, and this jacket has proved to be no exception to this rule.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.034315", "1": "0.4151229", "2": "0.13808939", "3": "0.22157344", "5": "0.08865247", "6": "0.09967237"}}
