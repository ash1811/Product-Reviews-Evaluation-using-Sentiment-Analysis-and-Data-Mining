There is a small ridge of material on the very back under the heel so you will feel this as you walk, even if you order the shoes in your size.UPDATE:  Over time, your feet will flatten the padding, creating more room and ending the 'stepping on the ridge' bit I mentioned previously.2nd UPDATE:  I have never worn these outside my carpeted house and now, just a year after purchase, there is a huge hole worn into one of the soles.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12168025", "1": "0.1727125", "2": "0.082593925", "3": "0.14419872", "4": "0.046884406", "5": "0.108617805", "6": "0.3233124"}}
