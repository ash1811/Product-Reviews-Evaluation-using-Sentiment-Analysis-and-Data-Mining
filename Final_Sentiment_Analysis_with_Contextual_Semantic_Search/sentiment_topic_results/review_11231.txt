{"text": "I don't know what I would do without this shine - I keep it in my desk drawer at work, and touch up my shoes regularly. Because I am walking up and down stairs at work all day (and I am relatively clumsy), my shoes end up scuffed very quickly. A quick coat of this magic sauce and they are back to good as new! My biggest concern initially was that it wouldn't dry quickly enough, and would leave marks all over my pants. This is not the case however, and It dries nearly instantly on my shoes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2707158", "2": "0.32820016", "3": "0.12124385", "5": "0.14658959", "6": "0.12700093"}}
