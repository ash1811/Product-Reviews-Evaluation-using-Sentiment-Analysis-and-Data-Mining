{"text": "When you have small feet you better have skinny calves or tall boots are a problem. I have small feet (6 or 6.5) and slightly wide calves. If I buy a size 8.5 or 9 the calves will fit while my feet slide around the far too big bottoms. When I read the reviews on how these fit, and that the calves part of the boots can be adjusted I decided to give them a go. I was able to make them work, but I had to loosen them as much as possible. I also bought a size bigger than my size. They may not fit perfectly, but they fit none the less. They are very cool looking boots and I hate heels so my oddly sized feet and I are very happy with them. Best of luck to the rest of you and your tootsies!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.26415536", "3": "0.32920834", "4": "0.18711409", "5": "0.14745864", "6": "0.06712833"}}
