The bag drapes over my left shoulder and hangs on the back which takes the pressure off the shoulder.  I have the purple and it is very pretty.  I'm going to order the turquoise and the hot pink.  I don't think I'll use either of these enough to worry about the stitching coming undone and it's a very good price on a nice sling back bag.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05506675", "1": "0.46388635", "2": "0.10050149", "3": "0.13850123", "4": "0.1635024", "6": "0.07504702"}}
