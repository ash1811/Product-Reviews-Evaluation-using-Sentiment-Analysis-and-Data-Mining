{"text": "This is a quality, well-made top that is long in length so will stay tucked in.  A true scoop neck (not a crew neck),  The rib-knit fabric is soft, comfortable, shapes to your curves, and is not sheer.  Very flattering garment.  I normally wear a size small, but usually order a medium in Bella tops; the exception being that I need a  large for their crew-neck, long sleeve baby rib tops..  I have found the Bella brand to be top quality.  The neck-line stays nice after washing and doesn't look rippled like bacon, if you know what I mean.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10933363", "1": "0.27109784", "2": "0.045377806", "3": "0.31013948", "4": "0.07798508", "5": "0.08122312", "6": "0.10484307"}}
