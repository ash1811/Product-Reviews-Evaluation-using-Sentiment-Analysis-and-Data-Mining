{"text": "I recently bought a pair of these.  They are really comfortable and the fit is great.  The fabric is light, but that makes it feel all the more comfortable.  I did buy these during the summer, so the light fabric is great for now.  It might be different in the winter.You do need to be on the skinny side to wear these.I was afraid that the 514s were going to be discontinued, so I bought a second pair.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.4846344", "3": "0.16960788", "5": "0.19757454", "6": "0.13589995"}}
