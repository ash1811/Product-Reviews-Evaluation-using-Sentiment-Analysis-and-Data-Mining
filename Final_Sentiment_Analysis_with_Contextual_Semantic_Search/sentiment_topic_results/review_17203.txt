{"text": "I can't recall when I bought my first NB Cameron, but it's probably been 10+ years ago.  I like them so much I stock up whenever they're on sale.  They're a shoe but feel like a running shoe.  The browns are my favorite (actually only) casual shoe and I just bought the black to push the envelope a bit as a dress shoe.  I recommend this shoe without hesitation.If you need a wide toe box, as I recently learned that I do, this is an excellent choice.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04063971", "1": "0.3276432", "2": "0.24461532", "3": "0.07121899", "4": "0.1116496", "5": "0.054107107", "6": "0.15012608"}}
