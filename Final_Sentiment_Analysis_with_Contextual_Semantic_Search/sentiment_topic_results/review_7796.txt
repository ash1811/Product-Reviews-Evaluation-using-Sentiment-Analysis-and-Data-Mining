{"text": "I buy a new watch every month or so, so investing in a pin remover was a good idea.  However, the actual pin on the pin remover is weak material.  I broke my first one due to improper alignment.  Granted, this was my 1st time and I didn't exactly know better.  I would gladly pay extra for stong steel or titanium pins. Overall a good buy though for 15 bucks.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.124014646", "1": "0.3223848", "2": "0.17325348", "3": "0.19138782", "5": "0.10537012", "6": "0.08040445"}}
