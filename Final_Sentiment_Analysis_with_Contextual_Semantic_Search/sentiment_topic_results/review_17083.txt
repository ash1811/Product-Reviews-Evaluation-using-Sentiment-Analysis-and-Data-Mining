{"text": "Crocs shoes are my kids favorite shoes. He is 1.5 years old and he loves them that he wants to wear them even when he needs dress shoes. They are easy to put on and off. They clean very easily. They look better after 3 months of wear and tear than regular shoes. As his foot grows he can still wear them rather than having to purchase another pair. They don't make his feet stinky compared to some other sandal/clog that I previously purchased.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3500128", "2": "0.15749429", "3": "0.095497675", "4": "0.11651295", "5": "0.15882844", "6": "0.11839277"}}
