{"text": "As with other bras made by this company...the band runs EXACTLY at the size in inches of the band at the outer hook set. Meaning if you want a bit of extra space just in case, you will want to order a size bigger that you actually are.I'm a 40H, ordered a 40G and it fits snugly in the band and in the cup on it because of the way the bra is sewn. The other bras I have gotten from this company ran a little larger in the cup size that the letter indicated.If I were purchasing again, I would most likely order a band size up and a cup size up - the one I got DOES fit but snugly enough that it is not as comfortable as it clearly would be if it were a looser fit for me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14299709", "1": "0.15140297", "3": "0.401867", "4": "0.16451341", "5": "0.13419041"}}
