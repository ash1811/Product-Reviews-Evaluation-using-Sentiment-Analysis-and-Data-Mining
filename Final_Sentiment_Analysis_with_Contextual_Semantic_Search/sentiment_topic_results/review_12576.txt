{"text": "My first pair was from a department store. These are great shoes. However the reviews Ive seen saying you need them less wider is not my experience. In fact, i wish these were wider. Now granted I just put these new ones on and expect the will expand but after wearing the old ones for years, they won't expand much. Order your size and for me I would have ordered the wider version but was not available on Amazon but since I had these to begin with, I think they will be fine with thin socks. They are comfortable for everyday use. Long days not so much. We will see how these are. The padding in these new ones, even though tight now as new, I expect them to be as the other ones have been over time hopefully.Ordering shoes online is a bit of a gamble though and we will see. Tight now but look great and padding feels the way it was before. Again leather expands and I like these so far. Will update if not happy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3626651", "2": "0.1622702", "3": "0.1289275", "4": "0.12119963", "5": "0.16790605", "6": "0.05455321"}}
