{"text": "As a Invicta collector I have many of their watches in a dozen different configurations. Too many in fact (at least my wife thinks so) she plays her games I play mine :-). Back to this watch. This particular watch has been one of Invictas best selling watches for a very long time. It uses a proven movement and for the most part keeps time as well if not better than many of its more expensive counterparts. I have two autos with the same Miyota 21 jewel movement that keeps time with the Naval clock within 2 seconds a day. That says a lot for a $100.00 watch. If you are a novice and buying your first automatic and don't want to break the bank, do yourself a favor and \"Buy This Watch\". As I said, I own them and I know the quality and you wont be disappointed at all. Oh sure you can get good and bad with anything. Sometimes QC lets some piece slip through the cracks and a bad one shows up, hey it happens, get over it! Return it and get another. With Amazons liberal return policy you can return a watch and have a new one on your wrist in just a few days.That is one of the reasons I shop Amazon.com. They simply are the best people in the world to work with. Just for the record, they have a revision of this rock solid performer with the newer Seiko NH35A movement. They made significant improvements with this upgrade. Which ever you choose, you can be confident that your money was well spent. The best part about it is at those prices you could afford to buy several with different color combinations. I have 15 different Pro Divers, I can coordinate a watch with just about any thing I wear from day to day LMAO. Im not that vain really, but the fact still remains. BUY THIS WATCH!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.25063795", "1": "0.11578858", "2": "0.16198318", "3": "0.08232717", "4": "0.11730953", "5": "0.20854904", "6": "0.06340459"}}
