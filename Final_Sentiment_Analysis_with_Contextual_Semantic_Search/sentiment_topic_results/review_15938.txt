{"text": "I had some Cabelas polarized sunglasses that were getting old and they didn't sell them any more. So, I stumbled on Calcuttas. I got a different model and like them a lot. The sizing is a little tight on the back of my head - I'm hoping they loosen up some to be more comfortable. In terms of sun blocking, they are not super dark, but fine for low light to normal sun light. I like them and would buy them again.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12808934", "1": "0.39924702", "2": "0.114797726", "4": "0.12609944", "6": "0.22460267"}}
