{"text": "I used to have a pair of flip flops for the casual outdoor outing - to the nearby store or to the beach or for the quick after hours trip to my office to pick something up.The problem was they weren't very comfortable between the toes, and they didn't last very long.This time I went with a pair of black Crocs, and they're ideal for the casual and quick outdoor trip.  Perfect for the beach; great for grocery shopping.  I like that I can just slip my feet in and be off.Not so good for hiking or travelling or even just days out walking downtown, I think.  They don't quite have the comfort and support level of, say, a Birkenstock.  The contoured plastic of the inner sole feels fine for a few hours but can be irritating after several.  If I walk very long or very far, I find myself needing to take them off and give my foot a rest.  Still, the price is right and the feel is great for occasional spontaneous use - and that's exactly why I own them.My kids have colorful Crocs and love them - they wear them everywhere except to school.  I love that they have them, too, since I like to make spontaneous trips to the beach or to the park and having these means they can throw them on and we're out. No need to search for socks or to tie shoes.  I hadn't been able to find them in my size (15) until I saw them for sale here and quickly ordered a pair.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13380453", "1": "0.22460835", "2": "0.05221751", "3": "0.12980354", "4": "0.18212353", "5": "0.12978072", "6": "0.14766182"}}
