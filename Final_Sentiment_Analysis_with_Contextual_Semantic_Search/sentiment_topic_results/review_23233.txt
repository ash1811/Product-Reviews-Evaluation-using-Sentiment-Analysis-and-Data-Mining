{"text": "This bra is soft and stretchy making it in theory a good sleep bra for nursing moms, however I wish I had ordered larger than the other reviewers recommended.  I am not a large woman, typically a size 6 in clothes, however now that I am nursing I have a DD cup size.  So I ordered a large in order to accommodate my breasts and the nursing pads.  Unfortunately, even that is small in the cups of this bra, even though the fit around my rib cage is a little big.  This means that when a lay on my side my breast are nearly falling out and I have had problems with leaking onto my shirt or the sheets because the bra isn't keeping me contained where the nursing pad is.  It is very comfortable to wear, so if you are a smaller cup size this would probably be a great bra,  It just doesn't work well for me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19517636", "1": "0.1734278", "2": "0.087816425", "3": "0.24658377", "6": "0.2921365"}}
