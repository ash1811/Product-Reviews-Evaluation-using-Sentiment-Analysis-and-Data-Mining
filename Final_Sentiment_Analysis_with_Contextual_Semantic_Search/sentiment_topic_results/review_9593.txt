{"text": "Not this one.  It starts and stops so often that I don't think it's ever been right even once since I got it.  I had to come back to read the description to be sure I hadn't accidentally bought a self-winding watch and just wasn't swinging my arm around energetically enough.  Nope  This one supposedly has a battery.  I just needed something cheap for work.  Well, if it doesn't work, it isn't cheap.  Of course, I threw the packaging and receipt away and never filled out the warranty, so it will just lie around in my junk drawer until the next time I do a purge.  If Timex can't make a watch that runs, what can they do?If it told time, it would have been just what I was looking for.  Comfortable, not hideous, big numbers, and ... Indiglo.  I'm a sucker for Indiglo. But you don't need Indiglo to find out what time it isn't.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10267532", "1": "0.17906754", "2": "0.21228649", "3": "0.13083428", "4": "0.055429775", "5": "0.18585365", "6": "0.13385294"}}
