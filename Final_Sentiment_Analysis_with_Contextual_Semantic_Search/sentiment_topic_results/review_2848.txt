{"text": "These shoes dont fit very well and are awkward to walk in. Not like shoes I bought from them a few years ago that fit well and were very comfortable to walk in.

Very disappointed but will keep to wear around the house.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3836935", "2": "0.19849612", "3": "0.1501225", "5": "0.11017255", "6": "0.14853102"}}
