{"text": "What a great little lace garter belt!  I was concerned since it was listed as &#34;One Size&#34;, but after receiving it, it fits me perfect.  I have a 29&#34; waist, and it does have a little stretch giving it some room for different sizes.  I absolutely love the delicate and feminine lace.  It is extremely sexy, and love the way it looks on me.  And the price was great!  If you are looking for an inexpensive garter belt that looks great and functions perfectly to keep your thigh-high stockings in place, this is it! Looks terrific with my lace-top stockings and stiletto pumps!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1968056", "1": "0.35863808", "2": "0.15866588", "4": "0.050581604", "5": "0.08906119", "6": "0.14363821"}}
