{"text": "I wore these socks for the first time yesterday for a yoga class.  I have a fungus on one foot that I acquired somewhere in the distant past (probably at a yoga class!) and I don't want to spread it around or pick up a fungus in the healthy foot.  So socks are necessary for me to wear, no matter what.One minor problem I had with them was putting them on.  I imagine that someone with longer, straighter toes would have an easier time, but with my short, curly toes it took a couple minutes to fit them comfortably.  Once they were on, they stayed in place through the class, and they were the correct size, small for a size 7 foot.In the class, there was one posture that involved the placement of both feet on the wall, and that's when I discovered the limitation of these socks.  My feet just slid down the wall because the little beads actually made it more slippery. However, they seemed to work OK walking on the wooden floor of the yoga studio, and of course, they worked fine on the rubber mat I did my asanas on. I haven't worn them around the house yet so I'm not sure how they'd do on stone floors. I'm guessing that they might be a bit unstable. I would also hesitate to walk fast or run with these socks on, on any hard surface.Despite the negatives, I plan on wearing these socks for warmth as well as at exercise/yoga classes.  They're not perfect but they're close enough, and they prevent the spread or acquisition of nasty athlete's foot-type conditions.  They're also cute and they look sturdy.  I bought a grey pair and a hot pink pair.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.101989344", "1": "0.21242574", "2": "0.17429599", "3": "0.13348688", "4": "0.07692148", "5": "0.15735598", "6": "0.14352456"}}
