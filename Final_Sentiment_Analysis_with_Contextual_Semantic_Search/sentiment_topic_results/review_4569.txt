{"text": "This is my first pair of Lee's jeans.  I usually buy one of the other two major brands..  That has been a mistake.. The others are good but I really like these better..and the fact that they were a couple of bucks cheaper helped even more.  A bonus was that my cell phone fits nicely in the oversized &#34;watch pocket&#34;..  Great fit, great price &#34;phone pocket&#34; and they look really nice too..", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14579281", "1": "0.47496822", "2": "0.04366617", "3": "0.096304275", "4": "0.2005468", "6": "0.035306405"}}
