{"text": "I have owned the same exact model of Reef sandals in previous years and they were great. My last pair of Reefs broke a while back, so I wanted to replace them. I wanted to have the same Reef sandals, since the previous pair was so comfortable. I ordered these and expected the same experience, but was heavily disappointed.The sandals are very comfortable, but I think that Reef have changed their formula for their materials recently, because they squeak as I walk. Within the first 20 minutes of using these sandals, I noticed a horrible squeaking noise. I had my headphones in at the time and was still able to hear the squeaking noise over my music. The squeaking noise continued so I went home and washed them, thinking that it might be a residue from the factory or that it was my feet. I tired many things, but all failed to stop the noise, so I scratched the soles with sandpaper. It stopped for a while, but continued a few days later and still hasn't stopped.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1591469", "1": "0.38379797", "2": "0.044327635", "3": "0.09802113", "4": "0.11095902", "5": "0.14543022", "6": "0.05831711"}}
