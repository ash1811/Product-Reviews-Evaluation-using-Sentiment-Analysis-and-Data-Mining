{"text": "I wouldn't say the shoes are too small, but Amazon gave me limited choices for how the product fits.  Length and width were as expected. However......  I wanted to love these, but the part of the shoe that sits against my arch immediately rubbed as soon as I slipped the shoes on (standing still). After taking a few steps and seeing this was not going to work, I took them off and looked for a seam, because the straps meet at this location, too. There is no bulkiness in the shoe.  Sadly, the shape of my foot (medium width, mild pronator, and lowish arch - but not flat-footed) did not work with these very cute shoes.  Had to return them.  I have other Skechers that are as comfortable as my favorite running shoes; I will continue to seek out new styles!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12754966", "1": "0.092934616", "2": "0.29072005", "3": "0.2577617", "4": "0.071275614", "5": "0.07449235", "6": "0.085266024"}}
