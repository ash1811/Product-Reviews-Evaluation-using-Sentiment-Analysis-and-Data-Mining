{"text": "I have a wide foot and large calves so I bought a size larger.  Should not have.  They fit my leg well and the wide width made them a little large.  I put an insert and they fit better.  Only problem is they are so soft they are a little floppy when I put them on. Very comfortable.  Don't buy larger than your normal shoe size.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.073032215", "1": "0.37553903", "2": "0.080186315", "3": "0.34291604", "5": "0.11961411"}}
