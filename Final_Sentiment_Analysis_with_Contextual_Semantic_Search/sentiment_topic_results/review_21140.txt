{"text": "Ordered these in a size three because all the reviews said to order up. They were huge. Fell right off. I am normally a size 24 or 0. I would not recommend these pants to someone who is shorter than 5' 6\" because they are also very long (if you're shorter). Overall for the price, the pants were cute but based on other reviews and my experience the sizing is so off, if you want to know how they truly fit all you can do is order them and see. I returned these because of the size and length.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10823187", "1": "0.24073184", "3": "0.35749745", "4": "0.17170003", "5": "0.11543135"}}
