I'd also consider them slightly narrow but again not so much. I would definitely recommend these; however, I do not plan to wear these for &#34;hiking&#34; more so because I find hiking shoes to be about the most comfortable out there if you are on your feet a long time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04594652", "1": "0.2508682", "2": "0.1022193", "3": "0.23233879", "4": "0.15314694", "5": "0.21206596"}}
