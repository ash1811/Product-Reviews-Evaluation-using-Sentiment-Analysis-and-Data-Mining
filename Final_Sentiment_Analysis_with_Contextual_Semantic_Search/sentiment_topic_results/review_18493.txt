{"text": "I used this backpack maybe a dozen times this past season during triathlon training. It holds my wet suit and goggles and a towel on the bike ride to the pond (about 20 miles). It works fine for this purpose and when used occasionally, but if this saw daily use as a school bag, it would not have lasted more than a couple of months. The material is thin and the seams are not very well made.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.052201968", "1": "0.35766155", "2": "0.27770022", "3": "0.2347838", "4": "0.07049397"}}
