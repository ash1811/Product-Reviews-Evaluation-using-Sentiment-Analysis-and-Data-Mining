{"text": "I like the kinesiotape concept behind the design of these pants. I use these pants to hike mountains in AZ winter (where it is too cold to wear shorts, but not cold enough to wear traditional gear). The compression design adds support to my bad knee. They are very comfortable. They do tend to start sliding down and i have to adjust so the bands are in the correct locations, but no worries (I think my legs may be longer than average).They have lasted through a lot of scrambling over boulders, free climbing rocks, and technical rock climbing, yet they show no signs of wear (take that Lululemon and your horrible excuses for terrible quality, overpriced yoga pants). The screen printed symbol is starting to wear off (after owning them for more than a year), but that is about all the wear I have observed.They are pricey, but for me, one pair in my arsenal replaces about three other potential tights of worse quality, so worth it IMO.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18503325", "1": "0.31881794", "2": "0.10281637", "3": "0.12803462", "4": "0.037311222", "5": "0.11313932", "6": "0.11484726"}}
