{"text": "I was looking for a new pair of socks for running and after reading all of the good reviews for these socks, I decided to give them a try.  The socks are well made.  The material is very thin and tiny seams that don't irritate your feet.  However, they may not be for everyone.  I have toes that are bent and twisted and extend under each other.  I tried wearing these socks around the house a few times before running in them and found that the individual toe compartments of the Injinji socks made my little toes really uncomfortable if not painful at times due to the shape of my toes.  I think that if I had perfectly shaped toes, I would love these socks which is why I have given them four stars.  However, the discomfort in my toes would make me apprehensive of using these for long runs.  It is something to be aware of if you dont have perfectly shaped toes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.026234616", "1": "0.41853324", "2": "0.06310713", "3": "0.15739086", "4": "0.08284165", "5": "0.20325296", "6": "0.04863954"}}
