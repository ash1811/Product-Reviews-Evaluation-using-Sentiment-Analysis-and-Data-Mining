{"text": "I bought the dream tisha several years ago and fell in love, rushed to buy three more.  Since my original purchase, they have changed the fit.  I'm a natural 34D, with narrow/small shoulders...the straps are now too long on this bra and even at the smallest adjustment, there is no lift, \"the girls\" merely rest in the cups.  I even went to be resized, to make sure I had not changed, it was not me, it's the bra.  I'm very disappointed as this was a fantastic bra that gave lift and minimized at the same time, now I have to search for another brand.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13287963", "1": "0.17520444", "2": "0.16622503", "3": "0.25075606", "4": "0.17334677", "6": "0.09893649"}}
