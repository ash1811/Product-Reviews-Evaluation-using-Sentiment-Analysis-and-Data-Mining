{"text": "I bought this ring for my boyfriend bevause he liled it and the wonderful reviews. He wore it and in 90 days the stones start falling out. This is considered a DEFECTIVE PRODUCT I CONTACTED THEM THEY SAID ONLY 30 day gurantee would not fix replace or exchange. I buy alot of silver rings for example Avon silver jewelery lasts forever and will exchange or credit you no problem. PLease email me if u have had problems w/this company betsortiz@verizon.net they call themselves a customer service team with that kind of team the customer will lose everytime. I am questioning ring quality on this site i returned a womens ring same reason to a different amazon.co and they were wonderful. What is happening to customer service very hard to find now a days.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13005653", "1": "0.24658538", "2": "0.16389306", "3": "0.05887951", "4": "0.13803078", "5": "0.22511777", "6": "0.037436966"}}
