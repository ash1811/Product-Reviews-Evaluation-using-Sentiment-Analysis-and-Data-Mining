{"text": "The standard 8926 has a scalloped edge Omega style bezel.  The coin edge Rolex style bezel gives the 8926 a little more of a Rolex look.  It says Invicta on the face, side of the case and clasp, so it is not going to be taken for a Rolex counterfeit. For us old school automatic watch fans, the Invicta 8926 is a nice automatic for the price. Mine runs about 1 minute per week fast.  For me, this is fine for an automatic at this price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.061959147", "1": "0.21122423", "2": "0.18846212", "3": "0.045347583", "4": "0.20821176", "5": "0.14138709", "6": "0.14340806"}}
