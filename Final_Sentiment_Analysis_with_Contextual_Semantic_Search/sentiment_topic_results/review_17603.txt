{"text": "I've owned or own about 5 Casio watches and have always been happy with the low price as compared to their great durability and long life. However, I should have checked the size of this watch before ordering because it is undersized unless you are ordering for a smaller wrist (i.e. child or female).  I would not recommend this to a guy for this reason.Instead, consider Casio 87H-1V", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15219583", "1": "0.21034901", "2": "0.13834335", "3": "0.2234633", "4": "0.056773134", "5": "0.13787156", "6": "0.08100384"}}
