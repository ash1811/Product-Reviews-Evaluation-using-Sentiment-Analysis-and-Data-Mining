{"text": "I've been on the hunt for a good pair of flip flops to replace a pair I've had for years and love to death.  These are a decent replacement.- They fit as expected- The are comfortable- I didn't experience any blisters when I wore them*The only negative thing I will say is that I wish they were a little but softer on the bed of the foot.  They also seemed to get a little harder over time.  But that could also be because I wore them every day.  If I can't find another pair I like more next year, I will definitely reorder Reefs", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09666011", "1": "0.30495596", "2": "0.11776858", "3": "0.22407907", "4": "0.14426957", "6": "0.1094513"}}
