{"text": "Excellent boot.  I wear a 9.5 and have a somewhat wide foot.  So, when I ordered this boot I chose a 10 assuming I would be wearing thick wool socks with it and would need the extra room.  Um, its still a lil big but I don't mind as my feet stay completely dry and warm.  I live where it frequently gets 0 or below in the winter with snow, freezing rain etc and am perfectly happy with this attractive yet functional boot.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07746049", "1": "0.32882792", "2": "0.08688244", "3": "0.093379326", "4": "0.21198724", "5": "0.09895865", "6": "0.10250396"}}
