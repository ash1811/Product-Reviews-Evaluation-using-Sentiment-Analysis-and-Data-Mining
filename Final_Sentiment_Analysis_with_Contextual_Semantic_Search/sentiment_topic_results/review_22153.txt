{"text": "Got for my husband to wear under the mittens I knitted him - they are felted and warm but with the extreme cold we've had up here this year he needed something extra. These silk gloves are perfect. They keep his hands extra warm and are so soft. He even wears them while he is working just to keep his fingers warm at the office! I am very happy with them and plan on getting some for myself.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0929323", "1": "0.3528101", "2": "0.039543543", "3": "0.20741741", "4": "0.12350494", "5": "0.17957556"}}
