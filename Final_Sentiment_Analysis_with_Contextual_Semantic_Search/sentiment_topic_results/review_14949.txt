{"text": "I purchased this bag for way too much money at a local travel shop while I was holiday shopping one year.  I was intrigued by the story of how the Baggalini bags were created and I really think that the entire line is BRILLIANT.  This is by far my favorite bag, though. I have it in 5 colors now.PROS: It's an adjustable cross-body, which is far more secure and less prone to purse-snatchers.It can fit an iPad in a thick Otterbox Case, as well as my giant Target-clasp wallet.The additional front pocket has pen holders and small pockets for things like insurance or business cards.The front strap has a zippered compartment for smaller items/work badges or a small telephone.The colors!  Each bag is exactly the same, regardless of the color.They can be thrown right into the washer when they need a good cleaning!CON: I haven't found one yet, after years of usage now.I think that once you switch over to the Baggalini brand, which is in my opinion the most practical and useful bag series for busy women, I think it'll be very hard for you to go back!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.28571442", "1": "0.19659731", "2": "0.22183958", "3": "0.113386706", "4": "0.058643192", "5": "0.052470572", "6": "0.0713482"}}
