{"text": "Invicta 8926OB Automatic Diver WatchThe 8926OB differs from the 8926 due to the Original Bevel (OB) design, which is also called a coin-edge. The current 8926OB uses a Seiko Instruments NH35A movement, however the 8926OB's NH35A does not have any markings indicating country of origin for the NH35A. The SII manual for the NH35A shows either Japan or Malaysia, but it is not shown on the NH35A in the 8926OB! The watch face says Japan Movement, but the rotor on the NH35A should show this as well.The band feels very cheap, just like an average run of the mill Casio. The hinges are crimped/stamped steel and not like the higher-end Seiko, Citizen, or almost all of the typical Fossil watches. The safety clasp is extremely tight mainly to prevent accidentally releasing the band clasp while diving, but it is cumbersome to use. The band links are also made inconsistently. Some of them are a tight fit against another link, while other links are so loose that the pins fall right through. The links also bend forwards and backwards, not like the Fossil links which are sturdier.The unidirectional bezel is tight at first, but it has solid clicks and lines up properly. The watch face in my opinion is a bit small. I could confuse it for a lady's watch when used on a man's wrist. The watch itself is also plastered with Invicta logos and designs, which I feel are rather tacky. The magnifying lens / cyclops on the watch glass looks really out of place, as if they glued on a plastic lens to the watch glass. The worst part was that I actually found dust prints and residue underneath the watch glass.As for accuracy, don't expect any from this watch and movement. Even though it was within spec, I was losing 3-5 seconds per day when fully wound and inside an automatic watch winder. I understand that this is the nature of an automatic mechanical watch, but I just wanted to convey this again in case anyone was curious about it.I have another Invicta and was not impressed with its quality either. I won't be considering Invicta in the future. If you're fine with a cheaply made mall watch manufactured by a company with a questionable quality control reputation, Invicta is the brand to look at.Overall: 3/5 stars, feels very cheaply made with a cheap feeling wrist band - reminds me of department store Casio wrist bands.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.038878642", "1": "0.051610075", "2": "0.37393984", "3": "0.08727122", "4": "0.14729397", "5": "0.09056415", "6": "0.21044207"}}
