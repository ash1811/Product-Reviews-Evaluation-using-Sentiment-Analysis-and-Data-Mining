{"text": "This is the 2nd pair I bought for my son.  The pair last year are now work boots .  The pair this year are clean .  They are consistantly a great boot.  Comfortable and can take a beating.

A clean Timberland boot goes great with jeans and a button down relaxed shirt.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.32984793", "2": "0.14722866", "3": "0.15065193", "4": "0.25984555", "5": "0.10343185"}}
