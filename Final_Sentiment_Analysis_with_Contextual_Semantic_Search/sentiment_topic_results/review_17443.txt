{"text": "They have thin pockets, so one can actually leave the house with them, although one should carefully consider the wisdom of doing so. ;)They are thick and well made, and have elastic at the cuffs so that having the perfect length is not critical. The ones nowadays that are so popular with the young kids, with the open bottoms, are always dragging on the ground, and I can't see them lasting long.The elastic in the waist band is wide, so it doesn't dig into the ol' love handles.Quality is up to snuff, and that is the main thing I was looking for. I'll probably get another pair of these, as I will want to have them when the other pair is in the wash. I hope they don't get all cheap and ruin them with cost-cutting.Oh, one thing: They're not really (polar) fleece. They're just regular sweat pants, but thick. I think they say 'fleece' just because they're soft on the inside.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.115955696", "1": "0.16096619", "2": "0.24334468", "3": "0.1748109", "4": "0.124655895", "5": "0.13979852", "6": "0.040468123"}}
