{"text": "I am a bedside RN. I am on my feet on linoleum floors for most of a 12-hour shift. If my feet are happy, I can concentrate on taking care of my patients. Sore feet are a distraction when peoples' lives are in one's hands. I have been wearing the Saucony Women's Grid Omni Walker Walking Shoe for several years, and have seen it on other RNs, too.Thank you, Saucony, for helping me save lives every day at work!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06576415", "1": "0.3374911", "2": "0.04195096", "4": "0.35710338", "5": "0.19086893"}}
