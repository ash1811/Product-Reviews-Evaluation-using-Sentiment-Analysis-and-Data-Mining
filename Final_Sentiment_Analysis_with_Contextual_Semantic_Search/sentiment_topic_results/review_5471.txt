{"text": "The 50/50 blend offers comfort and washes well.  My husband likes the soft feel of the material better than 100% cotton.  I ordered up one size from a L to XL.  He is 5'10\" and likes being able to tuck the shirt into his pants. Unfortunately the shirt does have a tag, I would like it better tagless but unfortunately there is a tag thus I gave 4 stars rather than 5. Good purchase with excellent on time delivery!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17039098", "1": "0.28815696", "2": "0.14370967", "3": "0.015507406", "4": "0.090888396", "6": "0.2882322"}}
