{"text": "This is my second Hobo in the Lauren style.  My first one lasted for about 4 years before it started to look too worn.  And this one is sooooo bright and cute.  I get so many compliments on it.  Makes me happy whenever I need to pull it out.  I plop it in my tote bag and use it as a wallet, but it's great as a clutch on its own.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12663536", "2": "0.22920361", "3": "0.1286891", "4": "0.12662108", "5": "0.26455563", "6": "0.12018644"}}
