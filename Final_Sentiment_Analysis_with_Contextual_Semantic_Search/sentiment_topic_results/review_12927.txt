{"text": "Like a lot of reviews say....they run a size large so order one size down UNLESS you wear thick socks. My Ugg's arrived 2 days ago and I don't like taking them off my feet lol. Seriously, very comfortable! I don't wear socks with them, I tried but just more comfortable without and I'm usually not the type go sockless EVER.
