{"text": "I do like this bag, and use it for all my yoga and workout gear.  It is much bigger than I thought it would be but is well made and can hold quite a bit.  I would recommend this bag to mom's, students or anyone who needs a big tote for clothes, books or your stuff for the day.  It is very soft and has a big front pocket that I put my water bottle in and an inside zippered pocket for your keys or smaller stuff.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17538504", "1": "0.38804117", "2": "0.15493627", "3": "0.23054273", "6": "0.04426091"}}
