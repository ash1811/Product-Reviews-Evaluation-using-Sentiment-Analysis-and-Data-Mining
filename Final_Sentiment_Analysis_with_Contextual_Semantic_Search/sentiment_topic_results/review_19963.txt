{"text": "I bought this bag because it had lots of pockets and two water bottle holders. I have had about 2 months and some of the seems are coming loose. Also I thought it had a smaller pocket in the front above the lower pocket. This pocket goes all the way to the bottom so you can't place small items in it without having to dig them out. I plan on replacing this bag in the next few months.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14633733", "1": "0.31985787", "2": "0.14887366", "4": "0.12986673", "5": "0.19129589", "6": "0.05987383"}}
