{"text": "I love Raybans and been shopping around for a pair of aviators I like for a while now. I tried the larger, 62mm model, but they were waay too large for my face. I knew from previous experience that the 52 is too small, so, like Goldilocks, the third pair was jusssst right.Shipping was fast, the frames seem legit. I had some concerns buying them online, but I've compared them to the frames sold at Sunglass Hut and they're a match!Lenses are crisp and clear, and though I didn't spring for the polarized version, I'm very pleased with them. I've had these for around six weeks and they show minimal signs of wear. Very delicate though, so keep the case with you!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.05444999", "1": "0.16006695", "2": "0.12666528", "3": "0.33606666", "4": "0.09279681", "5": "0.09601409", "6": "0.13394028"}}
