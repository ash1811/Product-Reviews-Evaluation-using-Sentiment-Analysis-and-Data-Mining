{"text": "I am a size 15 and have a hard time finding shoes that fit right and are a decent price locally.  For some reason, Reebok shoes just always seem to be the most consistent from a size standpoint and also the best fit and most comfortable shoes for me.  This pair is no different, I've been wearing them for a little over a year and they're still in great shape.
