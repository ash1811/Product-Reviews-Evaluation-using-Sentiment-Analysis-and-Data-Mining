{"text": "I've been using this everyday for almost 2 months and I haven't had any problems with it. No loose threads or sticky zippers and it has more than enough room for a 17\" laptop. It has PLENTY of compartments and slots for everything I need to accommodate 2 classes worth of stuff. 4 textbooks and a laptop would be tight but will fit. The thing that is slightly questionable is the amount of padding around the edges of the laptop slot. Feels pretty thin but the front and back panel seem adequate.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17852768", "1": "0.16197367", "2": "0.22484131", "3": "0.10671942", "4": "0.13692847", "5": "0.07399", "6": "0.117019445"}}
