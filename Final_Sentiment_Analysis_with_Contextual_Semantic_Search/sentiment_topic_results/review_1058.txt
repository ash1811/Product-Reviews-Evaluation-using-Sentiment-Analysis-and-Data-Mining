{"text": "I love simple white underwear.  Easy to wash, easy to bleach to get that nice clean look.  Cotton is breathable and comfortable.  This design has the nice french cut, which means they go higher up on your thigh. I buy a new 3 pack about once a quarter.  I use the more worn pairs when I go on vacation or on a business trip, and then just throw them away instead of having to come home and wash them...:)These are not the most longest lasting underwear ever, but I sure like them right out of the package.  Which is important.  If you have to wash them for weeks before you like them, what a waste!Nothing fancy or sexy about these, but they are quality and comfortable.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1272123", "1": "0.25789747", "2": "0.090746455", "3": "0.17251028", "4": "0.07630165", "5": "0.09072261", "6": "0.18460926"}}
