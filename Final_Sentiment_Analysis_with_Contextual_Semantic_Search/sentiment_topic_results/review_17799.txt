{"text": "As a watch \"nut\" I can testify to the quality of this G. I have owned, traded, and collected dozens of watches.  I don't want or need atomic, solar, and other nonsense. This dw-6900 is a mans watch and will go through any scenario you can imagine. I have had G's with atomic, solar, baro,alti, you name it....but the more functions you have crammed into a module, the more you have that might go wrong. This is a working man's watch. Good as they get. Battle worthy. Strap it on and forget it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14397515", "1": "0.16220511", "2": "0.22624868", "3": "0.10068155", "4": "0.18705201", "5": "0.07036377", "6": "0.10947375"}}
