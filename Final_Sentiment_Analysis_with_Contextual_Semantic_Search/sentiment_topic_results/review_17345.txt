{"text": "I have been using the products for over 10 years: arctic bibs, coats, knit caps, jeans, double kneed work pants.  They wear nicely, and I think look better the more rugged they get.  I have have worn out  a few pairs jeans, and double kneed worked pants.  I wear them to work till they have holes, then I only wear them at home, then when they are super rugged looking I wear them to hunt, on the trapline, or to repair machines, and other dirty jobs.  The one pair was so ragged, frayed, patched up, and thread bare from wear, and just plain used up I feel a sense of pride when I toss them in the rag pile, but this was after years of hard wear! So again I say...it is hard go wrong buying Carhartt products.I think these are positives about the vest.  Originally, I questioned  the warmth value of the quilted lining of this vest,but after 6 weeks of temps ranging from minus 20 to minus 76, I am extremely happy with the vest.  The flexible cloth neck covering in comfortable, and is a key part of the design. It adds a tremendous amount of warmth, as it wraps around the neck area when zipped up.  The other nice thing is that it is washable, unlike the Filson brand wool vests, which I have one, you can wash the Carhartt vest, should you get moose blood on it while hunting.  I also liked the large front pockets of this vest, as I carry alot gear at work: keys, vhf, pens, markers,flash lights and what ever else I need that day. Also, the pockets are deep and I don't worry about things falling out, which is a nice positive.This vest has become a part of my life on a daily basis.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13031429", "1": "0.31477964", "2": "0.19223881", "4": "0.10363461", "5": "0.21105975", "6": "0.04564838"}}
