{"text": "I tried this particular bra twice, in two different sizes and although I love the color (the sailor blue) and the makeup of the straps, the cup is just too pointy and does not seem to contour correctly.  This is the only bra that I have experienced this \"overage\" with.  I went down a cup size and it did not make a difference ... I just could not get this bra to fit me.I've tried several washes (even drying on hot) to see if a little shrinkage would help.  No go.  What I am left with is a relatively comfortable bra around the back and shoulders with a cup that has too much fabric in the front and is too pointy for me.  Usually not a problem.  Unfortunately, this bra has been relegated to the bottom of my drawer and is only used under multiple layers where any kind of wrinkles or gathered material won't be visible.  I'm glad I only paid around $10 for it.Two tries though and it still didn't work for me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09128267", "1": "0.25926536", "2": "0.14960852", "3": "0.28710008", "4": "0.09681223", "5": "0.062548", "6": "0.053383097"}}
