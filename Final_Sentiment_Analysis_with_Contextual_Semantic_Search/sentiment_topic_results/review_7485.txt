{"text": "These are an excellent solution if you want to be able to wear jeans and use the pockets.  Coveralls work, but it is tough to get to your jean pockets if you need to.  These solve that issue and are not as bulky as coveralls either.I use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products. I do this so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product. You can look at my review which will be close to my purchase date and tell how the product is doing as time passes.  I am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very own.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.038387626", "1": "0.1200286", "2": "0.18418512", "3": "0.16904926", "4": "0.18057679", "5": "0.26320916", "6": "0.04456343"}}
