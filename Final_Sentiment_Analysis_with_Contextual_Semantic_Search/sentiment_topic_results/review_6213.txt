{"text": "Nothing much to add to other positive reviews.  These are good quality T-shirts of nice thick cotton knit.  I usually buy oversize to allow for shrinkage of cotton knit fabric but it is not necessary with these shirts.  They come oversize.  It's best to wash them before wearing since they will fit huge until they shrink down in length and girth.  It's also recommended that you wash the darker colors separately--at least at first.  I hand washed all the T-shirts I ordered before wearing and the Port colored one turned the water in the sink red.  Be careful until the excess color has washed out.  I have noted overall fading with the older black Carhartt T-shirt I have.  This is after several months of wear and washing.I've bought several of these shirts in various colors.  They are head and shoulders better than the cheap T-shirts you can find at Target or Walmart although they are more expensive.  They are comfortable for work wear and look nice under an unbuttoned sport shirt for casual get-togethers.  I really like them, except for the fading issue I've noted with the darker colors.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.088946216", "1": "0.34794056", "2": "0.11570336", "3": "0.1925711", "4": "0.028523544", "5": "0.19214018", "6": "0.034175094"}}
