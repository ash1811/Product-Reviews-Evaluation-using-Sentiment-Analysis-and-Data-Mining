{"text": "I purchased this bra because a few others I had purchased recently didn't fit very well. Even though they were &#34;my size&#34; there was something not right.So, this was taking another chance; but since Carnival is a well-known name in women's lingerie, I decided to try.Well, it is VERY COMFORTABLE.  Fits perfectly and doesn't tug or bind.Perhaps cups could have a little more padding but otherwise it is a very pretty bra.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03757289", "1": "0.47633007", "2": "0.043329526", "3": "0.15110663", "5": "0.22354533", "6": "0.064235166"}}
