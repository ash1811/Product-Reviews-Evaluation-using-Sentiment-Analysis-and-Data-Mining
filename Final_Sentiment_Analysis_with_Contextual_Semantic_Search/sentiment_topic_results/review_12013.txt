{"text": "I've been trying for ages to find a replacement for the perfect cami I had several years ago.  This runs longer and more snug than I would like, but I really need a navy cami, so I'm keeping it, even though I'm not completely happy.  I am only 5\"1\" and this covers my butt, but I've found most camis made now run this longer length.  We petite women lose out, it seems :(  This also runs small - I usually wear a large, and this was XX-large and fits very snug. Order up from your regular size!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03002976", "1": "0.2732398", "2": "0.052663323", "3": "0.27428955", "4": "0.1137661", "5": "0.073819034", "6": "0.18219247"}}
