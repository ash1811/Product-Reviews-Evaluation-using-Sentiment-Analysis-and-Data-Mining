{"text": "These were replacement slippers.  My husband has had several pairs of the ACORN slippers over the years.  Obviously he loves them or I would not continue to purchase them... My husband has a very thick foot and these slippers fit him, so they my actually be big for many people.They are very warm and comfortable.  Only issue is they are often too hot during the warm winter days in Texas.Only issue I had with this purchase is that the original delivery was &#34;lost&#34; and a new one was sent and therefore late for Christmas.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.027528362", "1": "0.30697006", "2": "0.13595077", "3": "0.12972423", "4": "0.13798898", "5": "0.11535589", "6": "0.14648168"}}
