{"text": "When I was 15, the coolest possible boot you could wear was a Frye Harness. Now that I'm 50, and can finally afford them, I got a pair - they are still the coolest boots you can wear. It's really a classic style, hasn't changed at all since way back when. On my Harley, or just walking around, these boots are super. Fit your regular size, really tough made - will last a LONG time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.040796626", "1": "0.14817345", "2": "0.034186173", "3": "0.2555621", "4": "0.1529423", "5": "0.2864535", "6": "0.081885874"}}
