{"text": "I have very poor circulation in my feet, so they are cold all the time (really bad in the winter). I got some of these to wear around the house to keep my toes from going numb. They are really comfy, and they keep my feet warm :)I also use them when I hunt, and they work great. They don't make my feet feel wet if I sweat in them, and they are comfy all day.They are holding up really well too, I have had them over a year (3 pairs), and they still look/feel like new socks", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.2982659", "3": "0.40800044", "4": "0.16389012", "5": "0.04777516", "6": "0.07609848"}}
