{"text": "This little gem was at my doorstep quickly.I have been very happy with it after wearing it for just a week.It is comfortable & lightweight, and it fits well. It looks exactly as thepicture(s) show.  It is the perfect size for a small wrist like mine.Those saying the instructions are hard to follow maybe need to work on their reading comprehension skills, because in just a few short minutes I had the entire watch set and ready to go.  I had zero problems with the instructions;  the print is a little small, but they are no-nonsense and stright to the point.I love all the features on this timepiece, it's exactly what I wanted in a non-flashy, workplace watch.  I am already about to order it's brother, the one with a darker face, just to have a choice of colors to wear.The only knock on this one is the light is a tad to dim, other than that, this thing is a huge bargain for $20!  I love it!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14060599", "1": "0.26021647", "2": "0.12717144", "3": "0.07305471", "4": "0.16508234", "5": "0.065823354", "6": "0.16804567"}}
