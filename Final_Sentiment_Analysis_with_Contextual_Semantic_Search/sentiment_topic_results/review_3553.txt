{"text": "I ordered a size 38A, which should have been a little big on me but it fit just right.  There is a little extra room in the cup so it makes it look pointy.  The one thing that really disappointed me was me was the back strap.  The picture shows a wide back strap but the bra I received only had 2 hooks and was thinner.  I was looking for a bra that would not roll or bunch under the arm.  Over all I would give this a 3 star rating but it is a bit comfortable, I just don't think it is the right bra for me...", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06245021", "1": "0.37671563", "2": "0.11066564", "3": "0.33918884", "4": "0.04548679", "5": "0.036872264", "6": "0.028620647"}}
