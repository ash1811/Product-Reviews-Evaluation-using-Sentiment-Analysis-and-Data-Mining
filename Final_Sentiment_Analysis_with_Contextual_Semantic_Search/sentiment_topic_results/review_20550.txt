{"text": "I bought this to take some links out of a watch also purchased through Amazon.  I can't complain too much because the thing worked, but it's really cheap and I don't think it will last long enough to use again (if I ever need that).  It took a really long time to ship too (over a week to get in the mail, and then another week until I receive it).  So I received my watch and then had to wait another week for this tool.  If I would have known it would take that long I would have just gone to a jeweler and paid them to do it.  It's only a few dollars either way.  Overall, if you're expectations aren't real high, then you'll be fine.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.3561356", "2": "0.14096166", "3": "0.16031618", "4": "0.20382774", "6": "0.13381103"}}
