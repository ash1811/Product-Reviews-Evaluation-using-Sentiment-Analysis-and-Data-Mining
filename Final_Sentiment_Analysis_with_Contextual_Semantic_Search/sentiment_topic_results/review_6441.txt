{"text": "I upped my miles from 3 to 5 to a daily 10 to 12 and blistered in the beginning. Then I ordered these moisture wicking socks with cushioning and I've had very happy healthy feet ever since. These have held up great through many miles and lots of washes!! My feet are amazingly not stinky - the moisture wicking is outstanding!! I did need to loosen up my shoe laces to make room for a thick sock. I love these!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.050626554", "1": "0.24060462", "2": "0.07285943", "3": "0.07241923", "4": "0.19832203", "5": "0.22333777", "6": "0.14183038"}}
