{"text": "The fit on these \"relaxed\" jeans is just that--relaxed but not loose. Compared to other manufacturers relaxed fit jeans, these are less full than you might expect. I find them to be something like a cross between the classic \"regular\" fit zipper fly 505, and the slightly wider thigh fit of the 501 button fly Levi's. In other words, they are somewhat fuller in the seat and thighs, but not much fuller in the waist. They are good looking, and have a slight taper to the leg. Because of the taper, they get pretty narrow near the ankle so you want to order your exact size--these are not jeans to roll up the cuffs", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.124713525", "1": "0.24591985", "2": "0.10439594", "3": "0.1805933", "5": "0.11550473", "6": "0.22644663"}}
