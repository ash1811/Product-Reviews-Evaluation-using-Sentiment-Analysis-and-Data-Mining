{"text": "I originally bought Sperry Top Siders in a medium (honey brown) brown color from Nordstrom. While they were comfortable, the lining came loose from the heel of both shoes within 2 wears. I was not pleased and returned them. I think found the classic dark brown color with white soles (called simply \"Brown\") on Amazon.com and bought those.  What a difference in quality. Looked like it would be the same shoe from the same brand, but it's not. The fashion colors are not made to the same quality as the classic, white-soled, leather upper ones. My dark brown ones from Amazon have much better linings that breath and haven't moved at all. Overall, a better quality Sperry at a lower price. Stick with the classic versions and you shouldn't have any issues.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1879147", "1": "0.36975116", "2": "0.18843886", "3": "0.11007718", "4": "0.116733536", "5": "0.025021592"}}
