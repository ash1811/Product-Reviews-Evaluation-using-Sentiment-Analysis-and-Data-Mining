{"text": "After a week of wearing the watch, it started to stop at random times until I pulled the pin used to set the time and put it back in. I sent for an exchange but Amazon has pulled this color saying several people complained about their recent batch.The watch itself looks amazing and is extremely light and thin. The clasp feels a bit cheap and does not seem like it really snaps closed even though it has yet to open on me without me pulling it myself. The strap is comfortable although if you wear a coat with fuzzy material, you will be picking some material off the band.If the watch works consistently, I would recommend it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06230176", "1": "0.5047417", "2": "0.15387797", "3": "0.060264222", "4": "0.07477931", "5": "0.1418308"}}
