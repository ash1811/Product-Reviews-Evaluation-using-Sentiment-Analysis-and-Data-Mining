{"text": "Pros:1. Easy to wash2. Stays on my boy's feet despite him doing whatever crazy things boys do.3. Protects toes/feet on the playground4. Doesn't smell after a whole summer of wearing5. Very durableCons:1. It's all my boy ever wants to wear2. It fits a little larger than other shoesSummary:This is the perfect summer footwear for little kids, especially if your 5 year old boy is anything like mine.  These little Crocs are tough and durable, and all it take for me to clean them is to hose it off (sometimes with my kid still wearing them).  Mud, sand, dirt, various pieces of plants and shrubs, whatever... it all gets washed off within a few seconds of getting the hose.  Last year's pair was worn almost daily from April to October and they're in good enough shape to give to his younger sister when her foot gets big enough.The only drawback is that he loves them so much trying to get him to wear anything else is like pulling teeth.  These Crocs are just a bit larger in size than standard shoes of the same size, but I think they're designed that way. Although they're roomy, the back strap does a great job keeping it stuck to my kid as he runs down the street, hill, beach, through the stream, down the path, into the mudpile, etc etc.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12188847", "1": "0.26464558", "2": "0.23144653", "3": "0.11850481", "4": "0.10361035", "5": "0.057185683", "6": "0.102718614"}}
