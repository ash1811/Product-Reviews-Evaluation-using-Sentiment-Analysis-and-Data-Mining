{"text": "Never really a fan of jeans as I prefer the more standard khaki pants which I wear on regularly for work. These jeans however changed my perception and definitely feels as though they are made to last a lifetime as the materials used are quality to the touch and even the stitches used are of a high quality. Would definitely recommend these to people who appreciate a good quality jean.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1828867", "1": "0.36960423", "3": "0.081832826", "4": "0.05617531", "5": "0.16848357", "6": "0.13733684"}}
