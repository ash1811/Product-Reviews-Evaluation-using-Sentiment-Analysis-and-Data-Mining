{"text": "Good quality product. The waist is true to size. Fits well. The legs however are quite loose. Loosest relaxed fit I have ever seen. Depends on what you are looking for. Great to work in if you squat or bend your legs. Lots of room. They feel really great. Almost like you are not wearing any pants. Very comfortable. I feel they look a bit funny for like wearing out. I have refered to them as my clown pants.LOL.. However I do like them. I would rather have them too loose opposed to being too tight. If you are looking for a work pant I recomend them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16156083", "1": "0.3911217", "2": "0.11966759", "3": "0.16423921", "4": "0.06621252", "5": "0.051534683", "6": "0.045663513"}}
