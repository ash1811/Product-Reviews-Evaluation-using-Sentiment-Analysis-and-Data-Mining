{"text": "I liked this shoe, but I had to return it for a fit problem.  The overall fit was just fine, correct to size, but the collar on the right shoe rubbed my ankle bone uncomfortably.  I own several hiking shoes but I've never had that problem before.  If not for that I'd have kept them although they really do have a wide toe box making your foot look broad.  I liked the color - a chocolate brown, darker than the photo, but certainly not black.  I really appreciate that Amazon provided free shipping and a free return.  Just go online and click return, print out the UPS label and drop it off at a UPS store.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11320029", "1": "0.26818556", "2": "0.13355073", "3": "0.17559996", "4": "0.17019644", "5": "0.038502146", "6": "0.100764886"}}
