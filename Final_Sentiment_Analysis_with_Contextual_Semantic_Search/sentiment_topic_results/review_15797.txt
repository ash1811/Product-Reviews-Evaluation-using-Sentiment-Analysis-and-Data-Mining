{"text": "This is an okay silver ring. It had a scratch on the side and inside,so I had to exchange it, but then after I received the exchanged ring, it was a little looser on my finger than the original ring. oh well!The seller was very prompt with service, though, so I do recommend the purchase.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09261172", "1": "0.40938428", "2": "0.0763964", "3": "0.094722584", "4": "0.12168878", "5": "0.13287501", "6": "0.07232122"}}
