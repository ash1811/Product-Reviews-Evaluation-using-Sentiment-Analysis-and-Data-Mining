{"text": "This is a very snazzy little watch that doesn't look at all unfeminine.  I wear it to work every day and it has been flawless in timekeeping.  Eaisier to set than most multi-function watches.  The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is because I wish the digits were either bigger or bolder for easier reading without my glasses.  Other than that, it is sleek, beautiful and does it's job very well.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.062034775", "1": "0.28516412", "2": "0.14913851", "3": "0.053669177", "4": "0.113411285", "5": "0.20259829", "6": "0.13398378"}}
