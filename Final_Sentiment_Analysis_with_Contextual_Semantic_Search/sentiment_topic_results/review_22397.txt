{"text": "Let's face it, everything changes constanly and these briefs are certainly no exception. They are not what they used to be in the past. I bought the last ones about 2 years ago and and they were actually \"briefs\". These, however, are much higher cut and the waist band is much narrower. I guess the higher cut is fine for younger generations but it would be nice if companies like Hanes would consider that the more mature customers would like a little more coverage. After all, our money is just as good as theirs and we'd like to see an honest description on the package. I will say that they wash and dry still well in the washer and dryer. but I can't say how long they will actually hold up as I only bought them about a month ago. I still have a bunch of my old ones and washed them dozens of times. Yet they still come out like new.BTW - I did not buy the new ones at Amazon as the sellers here have no choice of colors. At Walmart, at least, I can chose all white, pastels or darker colors. I love shopping on Amazon but for items like these, I still go to my local merchants. The sellers should take notice that customers like to know what they're going to pay for where colors, style, etc. is concerned.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19776258", "1": "0.2727288", "2": "0.19789611", "3": "0.06200953", "4": "0.14038402", "6": "0.12697743"}}
