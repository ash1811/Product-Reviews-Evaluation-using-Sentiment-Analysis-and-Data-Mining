{"text": "I'm a 16/18/40D normally, and would usually order a 1x/2x in something like this. I took other reviewer's advice and ordered a size up, but I wish I hadn't. The chest fits too big and I don't think the underwire would do much good no matter what size you order, but the rest is very form fitting and the material is very soft. I ordered this to wear as a nightgown and I think it would be comfortable enough to sleep in. My only suggestion would be to order true to size, and don't expect it to give you cleavage.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13063933", "1": "0.3700949", "2": "0.083754644", "3": "0.09329155", "4": "0.08325501", "5": "0.09020381", "6": "0.14876077"}}
