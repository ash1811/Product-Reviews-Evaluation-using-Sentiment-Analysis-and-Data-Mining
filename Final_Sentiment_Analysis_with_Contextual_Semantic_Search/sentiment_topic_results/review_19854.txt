{"text": "I really like this ring holder. Both my fat rings and slim rings fit beautifully. I also like the solid top instead of the glass top which lets in light. I am not too crazy about the lock so I will be removing it. I have no need for having it locked. This can also be nicely hidden in plain sight by layering it with books. The lining is very sturdy. Overall it is just a great ring box!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18216936", "1": "0.30354616", "2": "0.03901636", "3": "0.11182552", "4": "0.15170598", "5": "0.0979395", "6": "0.113797136"}}
