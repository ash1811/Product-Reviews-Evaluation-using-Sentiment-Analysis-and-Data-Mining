{"text": "These booties are very cute, soft, and would be easy to put on...except that they are entirely too long and skinny for the size that I ordered. I thought they would be good first shoes for my son, but they've never fit properly. They are overly long and narrow. I ordered a size 5; he now wears a 7 and these still don't fit. If your child has very long and narrow feet, I'm sure these would be great, but they did not work for us.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07066681", "1": "0.39729434", "2": "0.10901605", "3": "0.20503718", "4": "0.15808274", "6": "0.05656449"}}
