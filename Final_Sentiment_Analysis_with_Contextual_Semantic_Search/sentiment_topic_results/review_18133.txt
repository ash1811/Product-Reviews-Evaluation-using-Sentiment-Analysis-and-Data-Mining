{"text": "Although this is technically a man's watch, I wear it (65 year old woman) because I wanted a slightly larger size watch than the typical women's watch of this same style.  It lays flat, is lightweight, is comfortable and most of all, I can easily read the face of the watch.  It is water resistant, so it can withstand limited exposure to water (like washing dishes, etc.) ----- It's not fancy ------ just a great all around watch for work, and most activities.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13280171", "1": "0.2644719", "2": "0.29375428", "3": "0.14175195", "5": "0.16070677"}}
