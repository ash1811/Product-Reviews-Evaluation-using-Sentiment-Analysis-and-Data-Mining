{"text": "One of the better strapless bra I've ever bought! This bra is made for women who need support and provides a great silhouette...plus, they stay put.The sides have very strong boning and wide bands that don't just give support in the back, but they minimize the side/back fat that might be lurking.I was looking for a replacement for a much loved very natural looking Bali strapless, that I can't find anymore.I was put off when I first saw the bras; they looked humongous, like a D cup and not my 38C and I could not get past the hard/stiff/structured look....looked like a bullet proof vest ):They stayed in the box for a while before I tried them and at that time it was too late to return. Glad I kept them.I usually wear Maidenform, but their strapless is less natural looking under clothing.I have to use the closest hooks in back, so guess it runs a bit large....if I lost a few pounds, I'd have size down to a 36C.I think the smaller your bust size this bra would look less obtrusive.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06303367", "1": "0.30911186", "2": "0.03890008", "3": "0.3748935", "4": "0.06397416", "5": "0.10313432", "6": "0.046952453"}}
