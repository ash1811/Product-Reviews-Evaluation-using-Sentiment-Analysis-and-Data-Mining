{"text": "This shoe is fantastic! Beautiful color - fit right as expected (to size) and feels great.With any boat shoe, you have to break them in, I recommend doing so by either wearing socks and walking around the house, or making a pledge wear clean socks and doing so (same size feet recommended as you don't want to stretch them out)Once they were broken in, they're SO comfortable, and look amazing. Will buy again when I beat these to crap - most likely buying another color anyway b/c they look so nice.I've always been a Sperry guy, but am not switching my allegiance to Sebago.
