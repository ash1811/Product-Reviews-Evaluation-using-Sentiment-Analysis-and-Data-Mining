{"text": "This is a great gardening hat.  I didn't find it great for hiking though.  It blocked my views a bit too much for hiking, due to the slant of the brim.  I also wished the underside of the brim was black instead of the coordinating grey.  Black would be a great deflector of light(glare), and I believe the original ones were black.Even with the stated issues, it's a super hat for gardening.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.072260395", "1": "0.21224599", "2": "0.06790854", "3": "0.16595374", "4": "0.18501502", "5": "0.2620644", "6": "0.034551922"}}
