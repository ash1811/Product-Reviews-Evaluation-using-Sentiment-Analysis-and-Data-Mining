{"text": "I got these from Amazon in the Gun color which has fuchsia trim. It's sturdy, fits well - I wear a size 8-8.5 and ordered these in the size 8 -  and they fit fine. This is a good price, so I'll keep this pair, but it's not quite up to par of the new ones my sister bought just a month ago.These from Amazon are not quite a cushy as what she bought ( the model for this year 2014) so I went ahead and paid the extra 6 dollars from Sanuk's site and got the new 'style' in the coral color, which is not available here.The new model is indeed softer and cushier, and also fit just a bit better - the straps have slightly more 'give' when slipping the foot into them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04827187", "1": "0.37453213", "2": "0.09133617", "3": "0.237385", "4": "0.14361529", "6": "0.102473624"}}
