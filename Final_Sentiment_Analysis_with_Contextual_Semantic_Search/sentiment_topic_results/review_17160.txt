{"text": "I did a lot of shopping around for \"The Purse\" and decided on the Kipling Defea after much research. The thing that sold me the most was its ability to convert to a cross body bag, which I absolutely love. When I'm at the groceries or mall, the last thing I want to do is have to carry a purse by hand or constantly have something slipping off my shoulder. The cross body strap lets me be perfectly hands free and unhindered. The defea has a main compartment, 2 smaller pockets (with 1 zippered compartment in the front), 1 large zippered compartment in the back. Inside, it was 3 pen/pencil slots, and even more compartments! It's seriously amazing. I am able to fit a large 48oz water bottle, my wallet, cellphone in one of the front compartments, chapstick in the zippered, along with pens, paperwork, whatever. The defea is on the larger side, but when it's not holding a lot of stuff it lies pretty flat and doesn't look bulky at all.One of the best things about kipling is the nylon material it is made of. During a vacation, I had a pen explode inside. I simply took my things out, and used a wet napkin to wipe the ink off my bag. Easy as that! I haven't put it in the washer yet but I wouldn't hesitate to do that if the bag got too dirty. My mother in law loved my defea so much she decided to get one (or two) for herself. She ended up taking it to a wedding as her ONLY carry on, as it was able to fit a lot of stuff when the clothes were tightly rolled up.Best bag ever. I'd like to buy more in different colors :)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07392189", "1": "0.20842294", "2": "0.32359037", "3": "0.05071654", "4": "0.14787887", "5": "0.03079358", "6": "0.16467582"}}
