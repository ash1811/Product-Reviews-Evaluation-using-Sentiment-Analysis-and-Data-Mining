{"text": "I purchased second 8926ob past March 2013. Earlier I purchased one in 2010, when it used to come with Miyota movement. Watch with Miyota movement used to run fast (2-3 mins/week), however the updated version with NH35a seiko movement is much more accurate. There are some more upgrades which I want to highlight:1: Better Cyclop - Latest model have better cyclop with better magnification of date compared to old version.2. Decent Bracelet - Obviously this is not the best oyster bracelet, but it is really amazing for the price you pay. It have solid links but with hollow end links. But again, for under $100 watch it will be foolishness to expect any better.3: Amazing accuracy - So far (3 weeks) watch is running amazingly accurate. I believe in automatic timepieces it is pure luck what piece you get. I have seen people complaining of getting watches worth many $1000s but running inaccurate, even Rolex is also not dead accurate. NOM but I sometime wonder how can one invest $10 grands on a watch (if you have extra money then fine) but no idea if its worth it...even if it is worth it, can you wear it fearlessly like you can wear a under 300 watch in any weather or place....but it is all personal choice..4: Stunning Looks - this is a true tribute to big B Submariner. Now with this latest model, its even better. I just cant stop looking it :)Some small issues:1: Bezel - Very very hard to rotate. Also its not fitted properly ...overall not a smooth operation there. Not sure how long this bezel will last2. Cyclop alignment - Not aligned straight...minor issueOverall, no watch can come close to this for under 100, automatic with accuracy, decent bracelet, submariner look...", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08813613", "1": "0.18876223", "2": "0.2953933", "3": "0.039358947", "4": "0.13226329", "5": "0.1255764", "6": "0.13050972"}}
