{"text": "I purchased two of these Shemaghs, and they are VERY high quality.  Its funny how versatile they can be.  I have used them in tactical, business casual, and dress occasions.  Its all about how you fold and tuck these shemaghs, as you can manipulate them to have many appearances.  I use these as scarfs in the deep winter just because they can tuck deep into your shirt to keep you warm, and still look decent.  The material is nice and soft, doesn't irritate the neck as some rougher materials do, and holds its color after many rounds through the washing machine.  The patterns are also nice.Tactically, these are impressive!  They are very large, do a great job blocking the sun/heat of the desert, and remain lightweight.  Many of my friends are still using these when deployed.  This Shemagh is TOUGH!!!  Well worth the money..", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13211107", "1": "0.4459898", "2": "0.072139", "3": "0.10241712", "4": "0.16621703", "5": "0.032126445", "6": "0.048999574"}}
