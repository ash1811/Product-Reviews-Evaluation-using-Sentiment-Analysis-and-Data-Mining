{"text": "Bought these to go to Bali in February since a friend highly recommended them.  Decided to first wear these on a weekend vacation to Monterey and Carmel with lots of walking.  I put them on straight out of the box (with thin socks as it was a cool day) and walked miles in complete comfort.  I saw the other reviews that said go up a size but I ordered my regular size and they fit fine.  I usually wear a 7 or 71/2 and got the 71/2.  They are a bit wide in the toe box and I have very high arches but so far it's been OK.  Love the Sweet grape orchid color.  Cute and fun shoes.  They are going to Bali with me!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.103009954", "1": "0.31048632", "2": "0.09293663", "3": "0.16987215", "4": "0.03288192", "5": "0.28853315"}}
