{"text": "My husband is 6'5, my oldest son is 6'6, and I have four younger boys as well. Right now, 3 of my guys are wearing tall sizes. My husband was the one who wanted these Wrangler jeans, and they're a fantastic fit for him. My biggest gripe about Tall Men's clothing is finding items that are reasonably priced. These are fantastic, and much cheaper than shopping specialty Tall Men's catalogs. Once my husband finds a clothing item that fits well, he just continues to order more of the exact same thing as needed. These are going on our go-to list for jeans.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08431727", "1": "0.3211864", "4": "0.22394222", "5": "0.23650593", "6": "0.12911144"}}
