{"text": "This vest is a little more bulky than my old Columbia vest (that are not being made anymore).  I usually wear a medium and these fit as my other mediums do.  The length is fine and I am only 5' tall. I had to cut the tags off of the collar though because they were making the back of my neck itchy.  They need to make them tag free.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09379919", "1": "0.40948075", "2": "0.12282745", "3": "0.11327569", "4": "0.10809816", "6": "0.14803825"}}
