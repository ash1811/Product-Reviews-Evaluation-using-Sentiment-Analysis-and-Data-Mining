{"text": "I used a Domke F 2 bag back when I was  photojournalist. I stopped using it about 20 years ago and went with other brands. I'm trying to get back in the business again, and feel the F 2 is the way to go. It gives me plenty of room for camera and lenses plus my flash. I dig the look of the sand bag, and the straps work great. I really like Domke products, and will never switch again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.48350158", "1": "0.07791856", "2": "0.11000972", "3": "0.10321291", "4": "0.04334182", "5": "0.103783", "6": "0.07823242"}}
