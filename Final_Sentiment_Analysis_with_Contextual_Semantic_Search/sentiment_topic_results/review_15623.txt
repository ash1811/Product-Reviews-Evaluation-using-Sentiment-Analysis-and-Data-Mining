{"text": "I have to say, this costume exceeded my expectation. It is a black sheath dress with a cape that attaches by velcro. The belt is plastic and fabric and ties in the back. The boots also have velcro on the bottom so you can attach them to the child's shoe and the gloves are easy to put on.  My only concern is the size - as I purchased for a 4 year old and it fits her just right (no extra room) although the size says 4-6 - but the bag says for a 3-4 year old toddler.  I think this is for a 4 year old at most - and that most 5-6 year olds would be too big for it.  But that said, it looks AWESOME. Much less expensive and a much greater value than what you will find in the stores in October for Halloween.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.088329434", "1": "0.24757786", "2": "0.09556378", "3": "0.14808072", "4": "0.15948313", "5": "0.07182714", "6": "0.18913789"}}
