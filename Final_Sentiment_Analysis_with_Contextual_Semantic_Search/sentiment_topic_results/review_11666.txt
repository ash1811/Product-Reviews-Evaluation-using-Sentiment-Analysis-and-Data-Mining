{"text": "For those who like me want a genuine leather jacket, this is a great choice. I must admit to being befuddled by other reviews that complained of the odor. The odor is the odor of leather, and I would be concerned if it were absent! The five pockets are a big plus. Although a little thinner than some other leather jackets, it's a huge bargain at the price I paid ($34.80 with free shipping as my total order was over $35).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.073730595", "1": "0.18594606", "2": "0.26682055", "3": "0.12921584", "4": "0.08282208", "5": "0.10698788", "6": "0.15447702"}}
