{"text": "I hate to admit that I love this bra.  The short of it is, I think it is as supportive as the best underwire, and is comfortable and shapes really nicely.I'm in my mid 30s, with a large chest, especially post baby.  38 DDD.  I am an underwire advocate - \"It's the only thing that lends support\" - I've argued this with my mom, who refuses to go underwire.Well, Hurricane Sandy hit, and even though I wasn't originally in an evacuation zone, I had to get out of my building fast.  I grabbed stuff for the baby and ran, but took nothing for me.  So days later, as I lived on a couch with a relative, we made the trip to a big retailer, and I tried to buy some basics.  I didn't want to spend the $50+ I usually spend on bras, so I picked this up for 1/3 of the price, along with a pack of granny panties and all sorts of \"discount\" options - just to get by until I can eventually get back to my apartment.All I can say is it's 3 days later since I got this bra, and I love the shape and love the support, and I think this is my bra going forward, which is absurd for someone like me whose entire bra collection is in the $50-$100 range.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.32344696", "1": "0.11719691", "2": "0.057443462", "3": "0.27584374", "4": "0.11378553", "6": "0.10992918"}}
