{"text": "Yelp, I guarantee this costume will rip on the 1st day of play.  It is really cheaply made.  It's the same cheap costumes that you find in walmart for 7-10 bucks.  And I had to cut out a nose and mouth it doesn't give them a place to breath out of .  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR so don't pay over 10 bucks for this temporary costume", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1915252", "1": "0.22975187", "2": "0.10617372", "3": "0.16641465", "4": "0.089683436", "5": "0.21168596"}}
