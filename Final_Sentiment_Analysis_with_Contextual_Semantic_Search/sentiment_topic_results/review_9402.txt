{"text": "I do a lot of brisk walking, usually from 4 to 5 miles a day.  For that kind of walking I use a more athletic, cushioned and flexible style of shoe than this one.  I bought this shoe for occasions where I wanted a shoe that looked better but would be comfortable walking up to two miles. It fits that bill but I wouldn't recommend it for longer walks.  It is too \"stiff\" for that.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.2959775", "2": "0.19898003", "3": "0.103463575", "4": "0.086957715", "5": "0.30688006"}}
