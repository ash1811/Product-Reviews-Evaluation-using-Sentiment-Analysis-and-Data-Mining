{"text": "I longed for these and Santa brought me some for Christmas.  As others have commented, the top socky portion of these slippers is surprisingly slim, yea, constrictive.  It is necessary for many wearers (methinks!) to roll the slippers down into a cuff-like arrangement.  This is all well and good, but part of the reason I wanted these slippers was to keep my older, colder feet and legs warm during our chilly Michigan winters....feet are certainly warm and comfortable and slipper is VERY roomy to my wide, froggy feet...slippers conform to your foot shape over time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03901891", "1": "0.221955", "2": "0.14563629", "3": "0.2267379", "4": "0.17061262", "5": "0.09498957", "6": "0.101049684"}}
