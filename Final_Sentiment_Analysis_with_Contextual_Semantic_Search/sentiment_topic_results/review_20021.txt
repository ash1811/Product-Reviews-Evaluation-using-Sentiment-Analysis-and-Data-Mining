{"text": "This \"High Sierra Access Backpack\" is well designed and quite sturdy, making it perfect for my daughter's college book and laptop load. We bought this to replace the backpack provided the college when it finally gave out after two years of abuse.Here are my observations:+ Quality; this is made from good material and is well constructed+ Design; lots of conveniently placed pockets+ Comfort; nicely padded and distributes weight+ Size; nicely sized for 15\" laptops (a 17\" would fit) and sundry school supplies+ Rain Cover; stores nicely in dedicated compartment on bottom of packThere really isn't anything we don't like with the design, functionality, or durability.Highly Recommended!CFH", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1003281", "1": "0.38186726", "2": "0.1608068", "3": "0.036758758", "4": "0.09664286", "5": "0.10875849", "6": "0.11483768"}}
