{"text": "My husband is extremely picky and hard to please.  He needed new jeans but has been disapointed with the quality of Levi's brand.  I knew Carhartt makes tough work clothes and outerwear that lasts, so I asked him to try these.  I bought 2 pair and awaited delivery.  My husband loves them.  They fit perfectly in the waist and length.  I have washed them since purchase and they have not shrunk or faded.  I plan to buy more when I need to from Carhartt since he is happy.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12234039", "1": "0.26094213", "2": "0.13871309", "3": "0.15549518", "4": "0.20119843", "6": "0.11826061"}}
