{"text": "Fitting: I've purchased other denims along with these. I must say this is the only truly \"Straight Fit\" pair. Others are more suited to be towards slim-fit side. (though most would claim to be Straight or Regular Fit)Comfort: fairly comfortable. definitely no scratching in tighter (ie: thighs) area. it's between a summer and colder pair of jeans. there're others better choice if comfort is your main concern. but then you wouldn't even be looking at Lee in the first place if you want soft and comfy (over its tough/cowboy signature).Color: the color is pretty accurate though the real item would be somewhat darker. I consider it a good thing since color runs off with every laundry cycle.Style: as with many Lee's jeans, these are casual cowboy style and fit well with leather jacket and \"tough\" clothing.I love them. would wear them any time, any day.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06201523", "1": "0.34873173", "2": "0.043981895", "3": "0.29113123", "4": "0.08406764", "6": "0.168098"}}
