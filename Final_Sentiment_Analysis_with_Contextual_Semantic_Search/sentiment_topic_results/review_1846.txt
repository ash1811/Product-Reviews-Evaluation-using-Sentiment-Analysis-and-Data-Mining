{"text": "I love these Minnetonka Moccasins.  I have them in white, black, brown, and grey.  They are the MOST COMFORTABLE shoes I own.  They look cute with shorts, casual maxi dresses, or even casual shorter dresses.  I wear mine with just about everything.  They do run a bit big, so maybe order a half size down.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16743691", "1": "0.3029163", "2": "0.12285117", "3": "0.203559", "5": "0.1431015", "6": "0.055658113"}}
