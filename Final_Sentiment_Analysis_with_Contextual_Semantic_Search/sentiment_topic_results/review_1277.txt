{"text": "I found these shoes by searching the women's option for running shoes.  The name may say Unisex, but there is no indication that the sizing is 100% male.  Not even a note stating that a woman should subtract 2 or 3 or 10 sizes from her normal shoe size.When the shoes arrived here, they were huge. I tried to return them, but Amazon considers this to be MY fault, and planned to charge back any shipping, promotions and coupons against a possible refund.  I had done very well using a coupon, a sale, a \"buy $80 worth of shoes and get $20 off instantly\" promotion and Amazon prime, so my \"refund\" would be less than nothing.That's right -- if I return the shoes, I owe money.  Because Amazon made no mention that shoes found in the women's section of the site might be men's shoes instead.  Yeah, that seems fair.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14505224", "1": "0.19005911", "2": "0.2401922", "3": "0.08071916", "4": "0.17255567", "5": "0.1045383", "6": "0.06688327"}}
