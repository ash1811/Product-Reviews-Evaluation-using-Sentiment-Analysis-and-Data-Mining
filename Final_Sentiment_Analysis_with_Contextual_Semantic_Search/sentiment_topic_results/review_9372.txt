{"text": "I'm 6'1 and ~250lbs. I'm not &#34;skinny&#34; by any stretch but most of my weight is muscle.  I do a lot of powerlifting so I have substantially larger thighs and tushy than most guys my size.  I bought a 38w 32l pair and they're snug around the waist and thigh but they fit my butt pretty well.  This is actually a much better fit than most dress pants with those measurements.  Gotta lose five pounds off the belly to get them comfortable but the fiance says they look pretty hot (that's what I care about :D) and I can move comfortably in them.In general- The material feels strong and looks good.  The stitching is all quality and these feel like they will last a long time. I'm not usually somebody who spends more than about 30 bucks on pants but I think these are worth it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07814413", "1": "0.3312887", "2": "0.019415863", "3": "0.082604915", "4": "0.042778604", "5": "0.22340101", "6": "0.22236678"}}
