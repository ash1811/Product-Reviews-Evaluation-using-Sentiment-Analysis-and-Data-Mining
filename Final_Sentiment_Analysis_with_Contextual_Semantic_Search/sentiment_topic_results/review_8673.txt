{"text": "The watch is nice.  Small and compact, short profile (ie. height) on the wrist, no side pushbuttons to accidentally activate. I also like that you see the date, day, time and am/pm without having to push a button. However, the band is very inadequate. It is barely long enough to span my average-sized wrist. It's also very narrow and digs into the flesh. I will keep but by the time I replace the band, I will likely have exceeded the price of the watch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19553751", "1": "0.07251009", "2": "0.10473309", "3": "0.0400144", "4": "0.30823508", "5": "0.13260473", "6": "0.14636512"}}
