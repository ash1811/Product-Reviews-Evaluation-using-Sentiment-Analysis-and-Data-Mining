{"text": "I thought that since it \"claims\" to have a waterproof layer that prevents leakage and has a super absorbent layer to absorb wetness that my daughter would be safe wearing just that swim diaper while she waited to go swimming so I could put sunblock on her.  Here is what the incorrect claim reads on the product description that you should be made aware of:-Waterproof layer prevents leakage-Super absorbent layer absorbs wetnessShe must have had it on for only a few minutes and peed because there was pee all over her and all over my lap.  This diaper looked great and like another reviewer said, \"It seemed to have been made real well\"--but it totally did not do what it claimed to do--you'd think if it had super absorbency then it would hold pee for a minute, right?!  Since this is my first child, I guess you live and learn.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20309773", "1": "0.24788614", "2": "0.110293426", "3": "0.17410971", "4": "0.042226855", "5": "0.21993445"}}
