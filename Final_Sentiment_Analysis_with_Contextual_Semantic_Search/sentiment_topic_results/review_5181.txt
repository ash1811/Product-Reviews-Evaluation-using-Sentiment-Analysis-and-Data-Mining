{"text": "This is a good web belt for the price, to hand your bayonet, canteen, etc on.  It is not meant to go into belt loops as some have suggested but to go over your pants and belt, as a suspension device.  This one has a plastic buckle and snap to lock the belt but the loops that go around the belt to size the belt are made from metal.  In the old days of WWII and the army of the early 1970s the fastener was made from metal and a different type of fastener used.  However for today this seems a fairly sturdy belt and suspension system, for use with my M7 bayonet and canteen.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24500275", "1": "0.11041393", "2": "0.21624218", "3": "0.09417226", "4": "0.1639474", "5": "0.09698741", "6": "0.07323405"}}
