{"text": "I bought my first pair of Crocs while recovering from neck surgery over two years ago.  I was really looking for some walking shoes so I could exercise in the Mall.  Well, the Crocs were on display so I tried them on.  Cheap, lightweight and oh, so comfortable.  I figured they would last a few months and they would get tossed but, so what?  Well I've worn that original pair for all this time and I've been using them this summer for my yard work.  I hose them off and leave them by the back door.  They've gotten beat up and they're now pretty worn looking but they are still comfortable and still practical for a yard shoe.Of course, they're goofy-looking in all those electric colors and that funky toe shape.  Not an issue for me.These things are as comfortable as Birkenstock sandals and clogs but cost considerably less.  They're so cheap, I don't mind abusing them.  And they take the abuse and only need a quick hosing down to be clean and ready for more abuse.Since that original pair, I've bought two more.  One pair is kept by the front door and one in the RV.  I just ordered two more pair from Amazon on sale.  I can always justify comfortable shoes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08675161", "1": "0.2797379", "2": "0.06548069", "3": "0.16011062", "4": "0.13362586", "5": "0.16419679", "6": "0.11009659"}}
