{"text": "Ordered this as an accessory to the Buzz Lightyear costume my Son wanted to wear for Halloween. Was easy to inflate and put on. However, there is a pretty heavy chemical smell that comes off the item - not sure if it's from the materials it's made with or from the coloring on the jet pack. Rating would have been 5 stars if not for the smell.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.053355332", "1": "0.4110713", "2": "0.17663506", "5": "0.14926435", "6": "0.20070659"}}
