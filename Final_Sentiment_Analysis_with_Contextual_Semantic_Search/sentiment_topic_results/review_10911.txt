{"text": "These slippers are very pretty, soft and comfortable.  Because I have a problem with swelling in my feet, I ordered a size X-Large even though I wear a 7-1/2 shoe, and this worked out well.  The only drawback from my perspective is that it is a little challenging to put them on my feet, I can't just slide into them, but that is just me.  They are very cute and would make a great gift.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17476262", "1": "0.13821287", "2": "0.08115147", "3": "0.19521227", "4": "0.10532781", "5": "0.22295196", "6": "0.08238102"}}
