{"text": "I have difficulty finding a bra that is both comfortable and supportive.  I do not like underwire bras, because they tend to poke and always, sooner or later, the underwire will break through the fabric.  I have given up on underwire bras entirely.  However, bras that are wire free are notorious for not providing enough support for women with larger breasts.I am a 46DD.  When this bra arrived and I first tried it on, it was a little snug.  Because it is a front close bra, there is no adjusting the band width, as you can with a back-fastening bra.  However, since bras do tend to stretch out over time, it's probably good that it starts off a little snug.But this bra really does lift and support, and it is comfortable to wear.  I am satisfied with my purchase.  I am going to buy a few more, just in case they discontinue this style.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.100539595", "1": "0.17578836", "2": "0.055632826", "3": "0.30869216", "4": "0.08856806", "5": "0.06413024", "6": "0.20664878"}}
