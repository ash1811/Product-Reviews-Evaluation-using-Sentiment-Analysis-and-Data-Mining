{"text": "I LOVE the color of these pants but I gave it a four for the following reasons.1. They are a bit stiff, a few washes my help this.2. They are see through - If you wear a similar color underneath not as much.3. They don't stretch very well, I squat to work with dogs and this is a must.4. The fit is a little wonky tooOverall, the price is good and they look good I just have a few pet peeves.I typically wear a size 18 in all jeans/pants I ordered an XL and they fit well with plenty of room.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.3706112", "1": "0.3812351", "2": "0.0810068", "5": "0.051714905", "6": "0.1091849"}}
