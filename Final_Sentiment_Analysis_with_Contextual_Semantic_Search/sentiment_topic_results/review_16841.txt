{"text": "I have been searching for years to find a pair of Deer Stags Plain Toe Oxfords in size 14. It is difficult to find any shoes in a size 14 here in rural Oregon, the few that I do find are poorly made, ugly, and expensive. Certain that I was doomed to a string of $75-$150 that were too small, ugly, and needing replacement in 6 months, I logged onto Amazon and was astounded to find these for less than $30. I had a pair of these before and they lasted and looked good for constant use through 5 years, 6 moves and 2 states. These are the most comfortable and durable shoe of this type that I have ever owned.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.077393465", "1": "0.2404765", "2": "0.13321726", "3": "0.21345603", "4": "0.1741993", "5": "0.11034351", "6": "0.050913945"}}
