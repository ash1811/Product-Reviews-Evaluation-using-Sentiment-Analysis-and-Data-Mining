{"text": "This is my second pair of Sperry Top-Siders. I love the shoes: they are comfortable, the sole doesn't wear down as much as my other shoes (so I can wear them for a year), they don't stink (unlike my other shoes...), and they are a perfect balance of dressy and casual: you can wear them out/to work with jeans, or just walking around in shorts. Great shoes, good value.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11355067", "1": "0.27448797", "2": "0.21900104", "3": "0.20703168", "4": "0.04873002", "5": "0.09448651", "6": "0.042712104"}}
