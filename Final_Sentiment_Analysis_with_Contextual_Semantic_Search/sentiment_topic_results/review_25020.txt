{"text": "This is a well made footbed insert. It has one huge problem. It's too hard and does not have enough give for athletic shoes but where these will excel is as a work shoe insert and thats where I have mine.  Very good arch support but again the arch is somewhat high and that may be disconcerting to some. I really have not found it to be a big problem. The product description needs for reflect that this is better suited as a casual or work shoe insole and not as an athletic insert for sports shoes. You can do better with Sof Sole, Sole, and the upper end Spenco products.  I prefer the Sole products as they are the cream of the crop.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06197483", "1": "0.07528375", "2": "0.23725528", "3": "0.27441368", "5": "0.21605891", "6": "0.13250163"}}
