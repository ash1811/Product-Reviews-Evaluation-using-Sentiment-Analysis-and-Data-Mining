{"text": "As so many others have said here, these are a little big. Not so much in overall size, but in torso length. Because of this I selected Large instead of XL, and it fits fine. Another positive is the sleeves are slightly longer than normal, which is great. Better to have the sleeves bunch a teeny bit, than have them too short. I'm a little bit of a knuckle dragger, so the sleeve length is perfect. Stitching and material are high quality. You won't be disappointed.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13912423", "1": "0.39620703", "2": "0.053761125", "3": "0.15068768", "4": "0.10666909", "5": "0.032958556", "6": "0.12059233"}}
