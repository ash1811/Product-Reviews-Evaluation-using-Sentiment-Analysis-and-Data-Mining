{"text": "These are very comfortable for wearing around the house. They do run a little lose since you do not tie them on and there is no back.  I found when I wore them one day when I was doing a lot of walking out of the house they did not give me the support I needed and, since I was not wearing socks, the bottoms of my feet were sore from them slipping in them, but that being said, they are still very comfortable. I just know if I have a lot of walking to do to wear my tie sneakers. These are so easy, though, for slipping on and running the dog out, or hopping in the car to go pick up something at the store.  I would definitely recommend these and my elderly Aunt has 4 pair (2 of which I bought her) and she only wears these (with socks). She and all the ladies at her assisted living home love them.I think they are so cute and the patent leather touch dresses them up a little - I even got a purse to match perfectly. Love them!  They come in a lot of colors and different fabrics, too (I have the black/patent), so there are many choice to fit your wardrobe needs.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08398401", "1": "0.22854584", "2": "0.09354332", "3": "0.30322134", "5": "0.2845957"}}
