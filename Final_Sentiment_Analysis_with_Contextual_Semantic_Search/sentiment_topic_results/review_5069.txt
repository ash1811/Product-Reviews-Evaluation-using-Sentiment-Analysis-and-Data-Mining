{"text": "This is a good sock if you have thin calves. It was a bit tight on my calves, which are not large. I was disappointment that the sock wasn't thicker though, which made it less comfortable to walk in for a long time, and won't keep my feet warm in the snow.If you want a thick, warm, and cushioned sock, check out Thorlo Women's Thick Cushion Hiking Sock. Those socks are much better and not very much more money.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.038717784", "1": "0.35012773", "2": "0.09560168", "3": "0.18532032", "5": "0.25680897", "6": "0.069830805"}}
