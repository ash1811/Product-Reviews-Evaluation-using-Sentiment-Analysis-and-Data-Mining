{"text": "i  ordered the blitz gem and jewelry cleaner in the short bottle with the basket and the brush. i received the tall bottle of concentrate instead - that does not include a basket or a brush. I do not have a jewelry cleaning machine, and would have preferred the convenience of just letting my jewelry sit in a basket for a few minutes rather than have to worry about diluting a solution and then finding a bowl to use and a brush to clean off my jewelry.cannot attest to how it works, though i assume it works like any other jewelry cleaner. Will update if i have either amazing or terrible results. just wanted to post review to alert others you may not receive product ordered.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16448465", "1": "0.17800286", "2": "0.12978652", "3": "0.11061354", "4": "0.12921639", "5": "0.05524348", "6": "0.23265256"}}
