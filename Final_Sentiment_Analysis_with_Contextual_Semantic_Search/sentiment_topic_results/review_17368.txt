{"text": "I don't know what it is that Smartwool does..hire Rumplestiltskin to weave magical threads into their socks or something (!) because Smartwool socks are wonder-ful!I loved the women's lightweight hiking/athletic sock so very much, but also wanted something to wear to work so I ordered a pair of the Best Friend Crew Socks.O-M-G - they are perfectly named! These are truly my feets' best friend. I love them!If I could, I'd order at least a dozen more pair; and then another dozen to give as gifts because trust me, the recipients will thank you every time they put them on.I actually slept in them a couple of (cold) nights - one, because I didn't want to take them off, and two because they just feel so comfy that sleeping in them would be divine.And they are.All my socks will be Smartwool socks from now on.3/2012: Just wanted to add this note: Do yourself a favor and buy more than one pair because you'll kick yourself that you didn't. I know I wish I had. I can't part with them long enough to throw in the wash and won't wear anything else! Also, I bought a pair for my daughter and my sister and they love them, too!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12183757", "1": "0.28132194", "2": "0.22313657", "4": "0.10590917", "5": "0.23789342", "6": "0.027695073"}}
