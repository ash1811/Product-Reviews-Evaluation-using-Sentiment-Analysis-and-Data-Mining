{"text": "My latest pair of New Balance running shoes came with these laces and they are absolutely brilliant! They are made of soft nylon, just like the old style, but with little bubbles running intermittently along the length of the lace. These bubbles catch and hold the laces so they don't come untied. They truly work!! It may sound like a small thing in the scheme of life, but not having to re-tie my kids' shoes (not to mention my own) twenty times a day is a small miracle. In fact, I am ordering seven more pairs of these laces today to replace all my family's shoe laces. Also, I like that they come in a small variety of solid colors. No glitter or shiny little logos - just a nice, unobtrusive color. They come in different lengths, too, so be sure to count the number of eyelets on your shoes so you get the right length.As Martha would say - it's a good thing.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17140965", "1": "0.1939581", "2": "0.18337338", "3": "0.16232106", "4": "0.11550609", "5": "0.114871904", "6": "0.05855979"}}
