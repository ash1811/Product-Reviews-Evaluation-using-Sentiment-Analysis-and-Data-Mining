{"text": "A warm sock, but not so heavy that you cannot wear it indoors as well.  I love wearing these in cold weather with boots because it keeps my feet warmer when outside, but not too heavy so that they are sweating when I head indoors.  It also makes the shoe or boot you are wearing more comfortable.  Lounging around in just socks inside is also more comfortable, almost like wearing a slipper.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.24327858", "2": "0.08515604", "3": "0.18058978", "4": "0.25433275", "5": "0.061145607", "6": "0.17162852"}}
