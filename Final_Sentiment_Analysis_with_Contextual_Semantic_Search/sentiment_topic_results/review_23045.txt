{"text": "This thing is so bad I'm not even sure where to start. The size is off, the fit is off, and the overall design is a huge FAIL!!!!!! To call this thing a boonie is a slap in the face to all legitimate boonies out there. The chin strap came loose within 3 minutes of its arrival. And the way they roll this thing up and tie it with the chin strap to ship it should be a crime!!! I only gave it one star because you had to give it some rating to write a review. In reality it is closer to a -3 stars!!!!! A complete disappointment!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03168904", "1": "0.22292724", "2": "0.28085083", "3": "0.07485288", "4": "0.11072067", "6": "0.27619082"}}
