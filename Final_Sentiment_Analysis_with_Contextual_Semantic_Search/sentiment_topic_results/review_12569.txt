{"text": "I have bought Clark Shoes for many years. I always buy a 1/2 size larger than I usually wear.  It makes them just right for the type socks I wear.I get many compliments  and recommend them to anyone that likes a good looking, well lasting shoe.  Really comfortable to walk in. Will buy another pair soon.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.39106053", "2": "0.1162521", "3": "0.10702975", "4": "0.11585492", "5": "0.262056"}}
