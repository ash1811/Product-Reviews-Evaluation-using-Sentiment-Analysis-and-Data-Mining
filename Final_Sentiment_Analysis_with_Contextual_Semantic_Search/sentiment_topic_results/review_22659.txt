{"text": "Disappointment. Thought they were what I was looking for as the large label said they are 100% cotton, have a printed label, are nice colors and seem to be cut properly. But a size 6 should be just a little too big for me according to exactly what Hanes has printed on the package. When I unrolled them, I thought they looked a bit small, then I put them on and sure enough they were. I measured these new Hanes size 6 against a new Fruit of the Loom brief size 6. Turns out there's about a half inch difference at the top elastic but fully 1 1/2\" in the fabric down to the leg holes; the Hanes being smaller. Luckily I bought them locally and they can go right back so I can trade them for Fruit of the Loom as that brand has been fine before and always fit with just the right looseness.After discovering this problem, I carefully read the packaging and found they are manufactured in Thailand. Often offshore garments come from factories where corners are cut to squeeze out a little extra profit, and that includes cutting garments smaller. Then I read the fine print and they aren't 100% cotton at all, which is to say that there is a discrepancy in information as the small print says they are 75% cotton and 25% polyester. Don't know who to believe but not impressed with current Hanes and these are going back despite the inconvenience.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1344548", "1": "0.24149626", "2": "0.11212278", "3": "0.35383368", "4": "0.09042684", "5": "0.06531995"}}
