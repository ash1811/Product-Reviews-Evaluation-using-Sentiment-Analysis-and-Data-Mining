{"text": "I ordered these because of the quality of the Rockport shoe.  I have a wide foot with a sliding arch.  This means that in a nike I can be anywhere from a 15-16 shoe.  The Rockports provide a perfect fit for my foot which is a wide 14.  This is a very comfortable shoe and really gives the support that I have come to expect from a Rockport.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.36306828", "2": "0.1492781", "3": "0.100314915", "4": "0.25694925", "5": "0.039792124", "6": "0.085623495"}}
