{"text": "I ordered these socks for my grandson for christmas.  Not knowing they were  shipped from Hong Kong and as a dummy I didnt check how much priority shipping was I paid 20 dollars for shipping.  when I checked amazon I was so surprised.  they arrived and they would fit me.  Shipping them back would be very costly.  So I paid 33 bucks for a pair of socks, that no way is a mens large.  What a rip off.  And what a dummy I'am for not checking everything out.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.048244663", "1": "0.15894853", "2": "0.22008237", "3": "0.12163217", "4": "0.25743282", "5": "0.17330506", "6": "0.02035443"}}
