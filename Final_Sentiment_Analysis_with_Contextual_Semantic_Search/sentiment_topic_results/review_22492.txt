{"text": "Purchased these pants for my retired farmer father. He always wore dickies for his daily attire and of course being from old school habits he doesn't like change. The original/traditional dickies are hard to find. But of course if you look long enough, you can find almost anything on Amazon. He is totally satisfied & loves the pants. They are great, good quality and all.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15359114", "1": "0.22367962", "2": "0.21802825", "3": "0.07572694", "4": "0.1414144", "5": "0.11001709", "6": "0.07754258"}}
