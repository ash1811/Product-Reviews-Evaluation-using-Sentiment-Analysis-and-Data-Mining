{"text": "Product as described: well made, tough, masculine rather than elegant. A man's bag.  Very fast delivery. I only wish the side pockets are bigger so they can hold a water bottle more securely. I ended up getting a smaller bottle to put in the pocket. (I will insert a photo of a standard-size water bottle in the side pocket if I can figure out how to insert a photo.) Another thing be beware of: the side pocket is not big enough to hold the newer, larger smart phones.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.036126345", "1": "0.24196574", "2": "0.24398379", "3": "0.14737546", "4": "0.03595446", "5": "0.102595836", "6": "0.19199836"}}
