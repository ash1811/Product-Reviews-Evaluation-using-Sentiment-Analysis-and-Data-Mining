{"text": "Bought these thinking they would be extremely comfortable for running and wanted to try a change from normal running socks. The fit as far as length is fine but the area between each toe tends to ride up like a bad wedgy. Had to send them to the garbage after my third attempt to experience a comfortable run in them. May be more suitable for people who have sticks for toes. Would not purchase again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12228292", "1": "0.40003434", "2": "0.21212025", "3": "0.1186343", "5": "0.13976988"}}
