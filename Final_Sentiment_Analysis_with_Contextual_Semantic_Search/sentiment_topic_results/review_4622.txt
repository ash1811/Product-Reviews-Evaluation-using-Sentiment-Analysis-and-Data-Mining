{"text": "My husband has about 6 pairs of these jeans that he daily wears to work.  After years of wear one started to tear at the belt loop (then finally caught on a nail and ripped).  However, I've been impressed how how these jeans hold their color and continue to look good even after years of regular use.A nice extra is the side pocket on the legs fits my husband's cell phone (an HTC Evo - not a tiny phone).Good product and excellent value for the price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.072216764", "1": "0.19562344", "2": "0.11868726", "3": "0.11148479", "4": "0.15888675", "5": "0.17700535", "6": "0.16609569"}}
