{"text": "We used this product with rubber neck bolts for a Frankenstein costume. The adhesive did hold quite well, despite my daughter hopping and dancing around like a little maniac all evening. Even in a very warm environment, they held well. Be sure that after spreading the spirit gum on the product you're trying to adhere that you allow it to sit and become quite tacky before you stick it on. It took us a few tries to figure out that when the directions say &#34;allow to become tacky&#34; they mean REALLY tacky and gummy. We got the best result by allowing it to sit for about 5 minutes before sticking it to skin. My only complaint was that it's very difficult to remove. It does come with a remover, but we did not get great results using it. We used the entire bottle and my daughter still had residue on her neck that her hair would get stuck in. Showering and scrubbing with soap didn't help much, either. Rubbing alcohol after using the entire bottle and 2 showers helped.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12061794", "1": "0.15226597", "2": "0.07447284", "3": "0.17099024", "4": "0.042823322", "5": "0.3299208", "6": "0.10890892"}}
