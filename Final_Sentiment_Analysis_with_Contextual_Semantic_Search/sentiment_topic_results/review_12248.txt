{"text": "I lost my beloved Danskin Women's Mosai-Ix Crop Pants somewhere, and since they've been discontinued I decided to try another Danskin style.I bought these leggings in my usual size medium, and found them to be way too tight.  The material was thin and shiny, and they gave me an unflattering look in the crotch.  I expected them to be fitted, but not like pantyhose.  Maybe a large would fit better, but I wasn't all that happy with the material either.  I'm going to return them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03871412", "1": "0.435199", "2": "0.041822236", "3": "0.107318826", "4": "0.19499226", "6": "0.17897154"}}
