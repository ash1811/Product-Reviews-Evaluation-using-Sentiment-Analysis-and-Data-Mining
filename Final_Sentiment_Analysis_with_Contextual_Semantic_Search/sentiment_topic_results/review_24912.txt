{"text": "I love these insoles a lot, they felt a little uncomfortable at first, but once my feet got used to them they felt great. I spend a lot of time on my feet since I'm learning to the a radiologic technologist. I also have flat feet, and plantar fascitis, this insole helps my feet feel good even after a long day on them. It also helps with my foot turning inward when I walk. This insole is great for those with problems, but if you have a wide foot I would recommend the wide size. I have narrow feet so they fit fine.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.26094496", "2": "0.22093678", "3": "0.049647763", "4": "0.34039494", "6": "0.12286344"}}
