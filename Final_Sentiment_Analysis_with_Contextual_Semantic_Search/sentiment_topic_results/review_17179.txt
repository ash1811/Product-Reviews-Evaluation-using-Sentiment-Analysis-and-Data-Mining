{"text": "I have been buying Timberland boots for my son for years; but this means, these are only his third pair. Previously, I purchased the standard golden boots; this is the first time I bought the ultra-suede, at his request. He really wanted black boots but, did not want to look like a storm trooper. We fixed on these because the grommets (those metal pieces around the shoelace holes) were smooth and subtle-looking, and the sole did not protrude past the upper. I was unaware the ankle padding would be brown but, this was a pleasant surprise to both of us! As he commented, 'Now they look less like Nazi boots.' They provide good support but, we needed to add a padded insole. He wanted to wear these right away, before they were treated. So, I will be cleaning them with Jason Markks product, and spraying with Scotchguard. I will publish the results. (I purchased the Jason Markks product directly from them, as Amazon doesn't sell the boar bristle brush recommended by them for use on suede.)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11042525", "1": "0.13476153", "2": "0.16369483", "3": "0.12929688", "4": "0.20440523", "5": "0.11383972", "6": "0.14357652"}}
