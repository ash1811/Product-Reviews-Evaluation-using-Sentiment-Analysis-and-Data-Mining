{"text": "My previous pair is worn out after 2 years and just ordered a new set.  I keep these shoes by the back door and use them for gardening, construction, landscaping work on our large hillside.  The sole has aggressive tread so I don't slip going up and down the hill.  Before this I used to buy football cleats, but found that these shoes are aggressive enough.  The ventilation is excellent so my feet don't overheat while working under the hot summer sun.  These loosen up considerably over time, so if it's stiff when you first buy it, don't worry they will break in soon and mold to the shape of your feet.  Very comfortable for the garden.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15486278", "1": "0.24375363", "2": "0.09689963", "3": "0.2693328", "4": "0.14030425", "5": "0.03692362", "6": "0.057923324"}}
