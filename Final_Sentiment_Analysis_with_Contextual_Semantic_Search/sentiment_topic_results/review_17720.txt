I mean, seriously. This watch has been around for 24 years (15 years in it's current configuration). In many ways, it IS the perfect watch. It has everything you need and nothing superfluous. In fact, CASIO calls it the \"quintessential G-SHOCK\". I couldn't agree more. For almost a quarter-century, this watch has been worn by people engaging in just about any task imaginable, in just about any condition imaginable. Even NASA has qualified this particular watch for space-flight missions. If you need the ultimate piece of all-condition gear, the incredibly simple, functional and TOUGH CASIO DW5600E-1V will more than fill that need. It's a true masterpiece.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.32332915", "1": "0.06257145", "2": "0.15486133", "3": "0.05847798", "4": "0.13738652", "5": "0.10613216", "6": "0.15724139"}}
