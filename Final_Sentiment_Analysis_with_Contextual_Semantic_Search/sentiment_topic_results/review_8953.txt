{"text": "My daughter will only wear skechers and I bought her some of these for her birthday last month. Since she's so hard to please, I decided to also get her another pair for Xmas. I usually only buy propet because they are always so comfortable, but when this pair came I decided to try them on out of curiosity. Luckily we wear the same size. They were great. I couldn't believe how comfortable they were.Well, I still gave her these (although I had to make myself do it), but I have now ordered me a pair too! I figure I now how 2 great brands to choose from.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14976771", "1": "0.377276", "2": "0.05318011", "3": "0.20961663", "4": "0.15633559", "6": "0.05083619"}}
