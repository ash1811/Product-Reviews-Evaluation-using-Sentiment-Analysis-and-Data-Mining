{"text": "This is not a \"sexy\" bra. The lace is actually very matronly looking in person. The shoulders (yes, I  know it's supposed to be supportive and it is) are NOT attractive being that wide. The bra also comes up high on the chest (meaning I can't wear anything even remotely low/moderately cut because it will peek out the top of shirts). High-cut shirts only. Does have a slight torpedo shape to the bust. The good - it is supportive. And it does keep my 38H's looking perky. Keeping it because it is the best nursing bra I have found so far, but it is not the \"sexy\" one I was looking for. Thinking I will have to get a regular bra (like Curvy Kate) to ensure a sexy, supportive bra in 38H.Update: It's been several months and I have to say the bra grew on me in some ways and not so much in others. I love the support and I love that I can wear it and no one knows I'm wearing a nursing bra. I hate that my arms rub against the wires (this could be that the store I bought it from fit me incorrectly in a 42F instead of a 38H (they are sister sizes though). And I hate that the wires poked through already - i wear this in rotation with 4 other bras and can't believe the wires already poked through. I would give the bra another chance because there were things about it I liked...I wish it came in prettier colors.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.036185186", "1": "0.1537128", "2": "0.12724306", "3": "0.4499569", "4": "0.04632135", "5": "0.08772197", "6": "0.09885878"}}
