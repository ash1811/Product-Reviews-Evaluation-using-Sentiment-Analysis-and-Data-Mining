{"text": "I had a bulova watch that looked very similar for years.  Somehow I broke it while in Jamica (I was very hard on it) and took it to my local repair shop and was told it would cost $100 to fix and there was no gurantee that it would work as well as before.  So of course I took this as a sign to buy a new watch.I went to every store in the mall looking for a replacement.  Each time I left empty handed.  My wife asked what I was looking for and I said my old watch, which appears to be discontinued.  My wife went on Amazon and found the Marine Star Watch that looks similar to my old Bulova Watch.First of all I love the Bulova and have bought 5 watches for myself or gifts in the last 5 years and they all work perfectly.The Pros:1. I know that Bulova is quality and will be maintance free.2. I have a very large wrist and the Bulova fits great (I could even take out a link if need be.3. The price is great and I will not leave Bulova until I am ready to buy a Rolex or other ultra high end brand.4. Keeps great time.The Cons1.My Marine Star appeared to look a little more dull than the picture would suggest.2. It was very hard for me to set the time, I was afraid I was going to break the watch as the knob seemed to stick.  I have never had this problem before so I am chalking it up to specific to my watch only.THe Marine Star is a great watch and a really nice price.  It looks great on a big guy like myself.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.23626415", "1": "0.15837017", "2": "0.1968455", "3": "0.10049473", "4": "0.15788235", "5": "0.052098487", "6": "0.09804462"}}
