{"text": "I had no idea there was a product like this out there - and thanks to Amazon and the awesome reviews, I'm finally able to cover my nipples and satisfy my boyfriend on his fixation with the \"potential\" of my nipples showing with my clothing. I have had to resort to throw away nursing pads (that can become expensive) to wear with my sports bra and I was told with some of my shirts, you could still see my nipples at times. I checked, and this was the case. I bought two different (well, my boyfriend did :-)) products on line for nipple coverage and these are the best. I can now wear other bras without so much padding, if I choose. These are awesome. They clean easily and are mostly comfortable. At times I feel a little sting on my skin but it's so minor and infrequent I probably shouldn't even mention it. These are so awesome, I will always have these available...as long as they keep making them. They do the trick better than anything I've tried and finally my boyfriend can quit fixating on my nipples and find something else to obsess over - ha ha", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.24950625", "2": "0.03127576", "3": "0.22484666", "4": "0.07901146", "5": "0.25331238", "6": "0.1594428"}}
