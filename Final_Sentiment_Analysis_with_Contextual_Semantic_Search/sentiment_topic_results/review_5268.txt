{"text": "I LOVE these slippers and would wear them everywhere if I thought I could get away with it. They are very comfortable and fit perfectly. The slippers are well made and do not seem to be that they will fall apart easily.The bottoms of the slippers have some cushioning that provides comfort while walking around the house.
