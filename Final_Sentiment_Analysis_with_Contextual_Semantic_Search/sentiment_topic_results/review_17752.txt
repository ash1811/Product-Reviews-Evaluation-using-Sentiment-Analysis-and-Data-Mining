{"text": "When it has came down to Casio, they've continued to know how to make great watches not just in price, but also in style and simple convience. That has shown constantly with their line of G-Shock Watches for nearly 30 years. That has came the case with this classic G-Shock Watch. It is definitely a great buy for nostalgia fans of the original Casio watches, but also brings out a nice contemporary look for all shapes and sizes. It is a delightful gift for anyone who wants a simple and fun watch, but also handles very well. I like how simple it is not just to setup, but the sleekness it brings out in its bold, black design. It is also a great buy for teenagers, because they love G-shocks. I absolutely recommend this as a great buy from Casio, not just in price but in the proof of the watch.Price: BConvience & setup: BOverall: B", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12943651", "1": "0.19133852", "2": "0.19071142", "3": "0.075006865", "4": "0.20630138", "5": "0.06046701", "6": "0.1467383"}}
