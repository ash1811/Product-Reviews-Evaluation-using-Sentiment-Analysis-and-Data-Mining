{"text": "I purchased this shoe based on my experience with the Moab hiking shoes that I already own.  Wearing waterproof shoes in the Caribbean would make for rather sticky feet and the ventilators should be perfect to allow the humidity to not be an issue.  These were purchased based on the Merrell reputation and my experience with a similar model.  Although they require no break-in, I do wear these shoes a few days each week.The shoes fit well and will be tested on a cruise to the humid Caribbean in December.I recommend this shoe model.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13959014", "1": "0.11567754", "2": "0.2649635", "3": "0.22622737", "4": "0.1579777", "6": "0.09262822"}}
