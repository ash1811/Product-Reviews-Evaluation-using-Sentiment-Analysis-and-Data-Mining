{"text": "I bought these boots loving the fact that they are faux suede and had a wedge heel, and hoped they would be as great as others I have in my closet.  Instead, they did not fit right anywhere.  The instep was wayyyy off kilter for my feet and actually hurt, the size was obviously wrong, and the wedge was just plain weird.  I prefer boots that fit me right instead of boots that surely do not fit at all.  Sadly, I am returning these boots and can just hope the next ones fit properly.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03412255", "1": "0.22789875", "2": "0.099143386", "3": "0.27033564", "4": "0.26720068", "5": "0.028116915", "6": "0.07318207"}}
