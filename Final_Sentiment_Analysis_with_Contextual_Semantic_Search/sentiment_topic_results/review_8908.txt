{"text": "I'm an avid Asics fan. I needed a leather sneaker for Winter. I tried the Asic leather version vs. the Skechers Premium and Energy. The Energy has as much support and comfort as the Asics. The Premium was not comfy, lacking support and cushion. The cons of Skechers, however, are they look cheaper than Asics, and do not have a removable insole. But, for half the price, and only needing a Winter shoe, the Premium suits my needs for comfort and warmth. They also have a bit more height than the Asics. I have an average size 8.5, but ordered the size 9 in a wide width to wear with thick socks. They are perfect.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.024818195", "1": "0.1478896", "2": "0.20913449", "3": "0.23840044", "4": "0.18466917", "5": "0.08572945", "6": "0.109358646"}}
