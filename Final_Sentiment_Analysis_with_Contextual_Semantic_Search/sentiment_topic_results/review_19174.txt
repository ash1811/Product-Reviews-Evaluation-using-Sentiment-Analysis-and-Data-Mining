{"text": "I own several of these chains.  They are very nice, lightweight chains, and you can't beat the price.  They look much more expensive than they are. They are good alone, one, two, or several, or with pendants attached.With all snake chains, sterling silver or white/yellow gold, be very careful on how you store and travel with them.  They are very easy to get crimps, kinks, and bends in them that you can't even out, so they don't fall around the neck appropriately.  Don't wrap or fold, they should be hung freely on a jewelry hook or when packing for travel, carefully wrap in tissue or soft cloth, flat and fully extended and tuck securely between soft clothes in your luggage.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16300605", "1": "0.28404176", "2": "0.18439874", "3": "0.096027106", "4": "0.109923966", "5": "0.123356804", "6": "0.03924558"}}
