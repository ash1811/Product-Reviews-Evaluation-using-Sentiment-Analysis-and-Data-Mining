{"text": "I have been wearing Reef's since 2004, specifically the Ginger style.  I ordered a new pair of black ones and they are too small.  I don't know why Reef changed the sizing, but I am unhappy.  I have several Ginger Reef flip flops all in size 5 and they fit perfectly... I think a size 6 would be too big, so I am not risking ordering them online.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.040039584", "1": "0.43472555", "2": "0.08435177", "3": "0.21708897", "4": "0.18251142", "5": "0.037304997"}}
