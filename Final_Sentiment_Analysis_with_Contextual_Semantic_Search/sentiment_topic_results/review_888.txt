{"text": "Reef makes a great sandal that is fashionable, comfortable and durable.  The only down side is they are not easily cleaned so take care with them.  They are a heavier sole than your typical shower sandal or slipper but not too heavy for comfortable use.  These are a great value and I will purchase them again should I need an additional pair.  They do have a bottle opener on the bottom that works in an emergency.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04288851", "1": "0.31856608", "2": "0.19482458", "3": "0.13812873", "5": "0.11932265", "6": "0.18205912"}}
