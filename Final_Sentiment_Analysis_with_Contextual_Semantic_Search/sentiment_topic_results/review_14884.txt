{"text": "I picked this up for my grand son to use on our recent back packing trip..it is a perfect compromise between a day pack and a backpack. It also worked great for the trip in and even held his tent. However on the trip out the main clip in the front of the pack would not un-clip. He wad to thread him self out of it to free himself. For the price of this pack however I will pick up a replacement clip set of higher quality and have the pack repaired..If I need to buy another pack, I would buy this one again but also buy a better clip set and have the clip installed before we leave", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16515471", "1": "0.34866598", "2": "0.2692726", "3": "0.081142694", "4": "0.055353664", "6": "0.07802476"}}
