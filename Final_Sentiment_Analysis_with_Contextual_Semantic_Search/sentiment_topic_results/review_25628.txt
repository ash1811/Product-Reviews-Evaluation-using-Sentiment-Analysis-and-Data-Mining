{"text": "I bought 6 packs of these socks over a year ago. These Hanes classic crews socks are:- ComfortableSoft and generously padded, these socks provide comfort and protection for active feet. The elastic band around the feet and ankles are also firm (but not overly so) to keep the socks from slipping and the top from sagging.- AbsorbentApart from the Spandex, these socks are made with 100% cotton, which makes them very absorbent. I take an extra pair or two with me sometimes on a trip and change as often as is neccessary throughout the day to keep my feet dry.- DurableThe toes and heel sections are reinforced. I've had mine for over a year now - I use these socks on my runs and hikes - no holes yet! These socks are very durable.- Quality SocksTheir reinforced heel and toe look coupled with their generous padding make these socks look like they are the kind that are ridiculously expensive (such as theseTholos)! You're actually getting top-notch quality without having to spend an arm and leg for it.Note: You will initially get some lint/fuzz accumulating on the socks (especially on the heels and toes) from the initial wear of the socks but these will stop after a few washings.I'm very happy with my Hanes Classics Crew socks. Once my 6 pack / basket-full (6 packs x 6 = 36 pairs) of socks need to be replaced (which I trust will be a very long time from now), I'll buy these again to replace them. Get your \"Hanes\" on these socks! I think you'll be pretty happy with them!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.082025886", "1": "0.14195135", "2": "0.0817066", "3": "0.1975827", "4": "0.27913883", "5": "0.16902804", "6": "0.04856655"}}
