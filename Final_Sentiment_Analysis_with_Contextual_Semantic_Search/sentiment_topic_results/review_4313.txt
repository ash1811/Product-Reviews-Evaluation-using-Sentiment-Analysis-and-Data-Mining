{"text": "This was purchased for my 4 year old to wear when we took him to see the new Superman movie. The quality is what you would expect from a packaged halloween costume that is meant to be worn for one day. The S on the chest started peeling on one corner after a few days of wear. My son is obsessed with super heros so he wears this costume around the house almost daily. The stitching for the velcro on the belt came loose and had to be repaired. For the price I paid for this, we have got our money's worth out if it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11029455", "1": "0.16112575", "2": "0.15749536", "3": "0.108643316", "4": "0.06559316", "5": "0.12884876", "6": "0.26799908"}}
