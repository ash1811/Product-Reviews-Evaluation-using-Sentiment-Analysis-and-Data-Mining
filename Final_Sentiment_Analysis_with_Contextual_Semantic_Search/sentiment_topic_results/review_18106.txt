{"text": "This is a complete no nonsense kind of watch...simple, cheap and rugged.  I have had mine for about two years now and it has kept excellent time.As other reviews have pointed out, the plastic type band is okay as far as it goes but I hated the feel.  I simply paid about eight dollars for a nice leather band at a local shop and that is working out fine.I use this watch when I am about and about stomping the brush, running, biking and such things.I love the casual look of the thing.  I do not mine nice girly type watches and jewelry, but there is a time and place for everything and there are times and places this watch fits in quite well and it did not cost me an arm and a leg.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13006213", "1": "0.19763227", "2": "0.215588", "3": "0.18152548", "4": "0.114353515", "5": "0.15836737"}}
