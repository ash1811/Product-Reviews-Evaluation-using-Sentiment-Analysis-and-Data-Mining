{"text": "I own more than a dozen watches, some costing hundreds of dollars, but I wear this one several times a week. Why? This is my favorite running watch, that's why. You can buy all kinds of fancy watches for running, with multi-lap memory, GPS, heart-rate monitors, and other features.This watch doesn't have any of that.
