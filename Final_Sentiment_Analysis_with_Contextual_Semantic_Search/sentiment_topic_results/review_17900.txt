{"text": "I'm a nurse with old eyes, my only complaint about this watch is that the second hand is hard to see if you don't hold the watch just right, even with my glasses on.  I bought it for work use and have been using it, but it's been frustrating so I'm replacing it.  It was inexpensive and otherwise is a good value.  I'll use it for non-work purposes.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.22793977", "1": "0.10565356", "2": "0.15248324", "3": "0.23421508", "4": "0.09630389", "5": "0.17918247"}}
