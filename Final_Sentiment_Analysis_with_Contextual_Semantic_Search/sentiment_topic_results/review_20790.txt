{"text": "A big gust of wind came by and sucked the heat right off my hands & legs. Torso was cozy warm the whole time. Never had that except with heavy parkas. This thing offers the protection of a much larger, heavier, and more expensive jacket. Outside shell is nice and soft.  Cuffs are long and tight, they keep the cold out.Poly lining is durable and wicks away sweat. Hoodie breathes just enough to keep you dry but not so much as to let valuable heat slip away.Spacious inside zippered pocket, which is a nice little add on and again makes this feel more like a soft jacket than a sweatshirt. Hood is strong and heavy, keeps out the wind. Strong stitching all around is solid, much better than I'm used to in a hoodie, even better than Under Armour. Even the hood drawstrings were of above average quality.In fact this whole thing is not only all around much better than an Under Armour but also a good deal for the money by comparison.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14159809", "1": "0.26248685", "2": "0.12289315", "3": "0.22248732", "4": "0.11544544", "5": "0.09140237", "6": "0.04368678"}}
