{"text": "I like the simple retro look of these Vans shoes. Since I couldn't find an 11.5 EW, I bought a 12 D. They're fine for the width of my foot but not for the depth. My feet are thick from top to sole. I wear these shoes to a restaurant or as a guest at somebody's house. I do not wear them for much walking. They'd look great on younger people, whose feet haven't swollen with their years.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.14237422", "2": "0.18316838", "3": "0.20268652", "4": "0.1291283", "5": "0.20960204", "6": "0.12954776"}}
