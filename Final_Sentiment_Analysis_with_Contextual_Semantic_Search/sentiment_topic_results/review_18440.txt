{"text": "Petite half slips, particularly in smaller sizes, are almost impossible to find. In the past, Vanity Fair has always been my brand of choice.  The \"Vanity Fair Women's Half Slip with Slip, Damask Neutral\" lives up to my expectations.  The fabric is soft and fluid; it is well suited to wearing under knit or jersey dresses.  The 16\" length is perfect for more petite women or those who like to wear very short skirts or dresses.Construction of the \"Vanity Fair Women's Half Slip with Slip, Damask Neutral\" is excellent.  The elastic is encased in the tricot fabric and two rows of stitching secure in within the casing.  This type construction insures that the slip will not become useless if a stitch breaks as there is another row of stitching securing the elastic.If you are in need of a half slip, you may want to consider the \"Vanity Fair Women's Half Slip with Slip, Damask Neutral\".UPDATE, July 15, 2013:  I liked the \"Vanity Fair Women's Half Slip with Slit, Damask Neutral\" so well, that I returned the \"Vanity Fair Women's Tricot Double Slit Half Slip\" and replaced it with an 18\" \"Damask Neutral\".
