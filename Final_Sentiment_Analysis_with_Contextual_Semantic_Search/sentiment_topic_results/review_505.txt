{"text": "Good pair of basic jeans. I bought them a little large to allow for shrinkage and glad I did since they fit fairly well and I haven't washed them yet. I think they will be ok since all jeans shrink when washed and stretch back out with wear.  Color is as expected and construction is as most jeans. Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is size variance and I would like a little heavier feel even though these feel pretty good. Price was great.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.47045732", "4": "0.14774475", "5": "0.2940201", "6": "0.07899477"}}
