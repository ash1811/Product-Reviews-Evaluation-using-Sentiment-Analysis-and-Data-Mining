{"text": "My Sundowner Vasque hiking boots have lasted many years since the early 1990s with everyday use till the last couple of years. I used shoe polish to keep them water proof and in good shape. Of course I have gone through many soles and heals; but the leather is still in good shape after all these years. At the time when I bought my Sundowner hiking boots I was not able to get the narrow size that I wear; so I have to wear a pair of thick wool socks and two pair of cotton socks to make them fit. If I buy another pair I will get the narrow size. As far as comfort goes I always liked them and received compliments about them often. I still use them sometimes. I don't know where my hiking boots were made. Previous to this I had Italian hiking boots which are no longer sold in the USA.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.067018345", "1": "0.18011598", "2": "0.07240424", "3": "0.2679203", "4": "0.13569756", "5": "0.24516375", "6": "0.03167982"}}
