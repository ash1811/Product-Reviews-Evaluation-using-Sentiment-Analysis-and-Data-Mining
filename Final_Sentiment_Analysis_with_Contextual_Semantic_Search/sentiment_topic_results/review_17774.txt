{"text": "I'm a watch nut. I have about 60 and this one is probably my favorite. Very well made, nice materials. A bigger watch for my smaller wrists - but not too big. Really just about the perfect size. It's also a wide watch and sits higher on the wrist but imo not too high - just about right.  Bright and easy to read display - lots of functions. Big button for the light (the gray G button under the face) right on the face which works great and is very bright.  Easy to set - didn't even need to look at the instructions. Good looking - rugged g-shock that does it all at a fantastic price. Highly recommended.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11850146", "1": "0.3216771", "2": "0.19325225", "3": "0.08314384", "4": "0.1283338", "5": "0.05561382", "6": "0.09947772"}}
