{"text": "Hanes Adult Beefy Tee shirts with a pocket come from heaven! These shirts really wear well on me--at least for now while I try to lose some weight and go back to the other shirts I was wearing! They are comfortable in warm weather; and the double needle sleeves and hem prove they are made to last. I also like the shoulder to shoulder fit--it makes the shirt look like one of the better made T-shirts out there. What's more, the 100% cotton feel is great.Hanes makes these shirts in all types of sizes--all the way from small to XXX-Large! In a world where big and tall people have fewer choices, unfortunately, Hanes provides them with a very handsome T shirt. That's excellent!The pricing and availability table is very easy to read; and of course women can wear these fine tee shirts just as well as the men can. Great!Two cautionary notes exist, however. First, as of the time I am writing this, you do need to check the \"pricing and availability chart.\" It's not hard--just click on the link above. Unfortunately, not all colors are available in all the sizes as I write this. I hope stock increases soon! Second, although these shirts are machine washable, I would wash these shirts with garments that have similar colors. That way if any color dye accidentally leaks from the shirt it won't bleed onto your white garments.Overall, these T shirts with a pocket are very reasonably priced for the high amount of quality control that goes into each shirt and the very broad range of shirt sizes. I highly recommend them for men and women during warm weather; they will be comfortable to lounge in or sleep in, too.Wear them in good health!
