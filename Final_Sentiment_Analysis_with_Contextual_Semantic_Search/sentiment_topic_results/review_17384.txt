{"text": "Gave these to my very skeptical man (he was sure they would be uncomfortably warm indoors) and he LOVES them! We live in Vermont and it's 5 below as I write this.  He has admitted he doesn't know what he used to do without them! They make a huge difference outdoors - keeping him so much more comfortable and warm - and indoors he doesn't even notice he has them on under his jeans.  Very successful gift!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22925234", "1": "0.1608794", "2": "0.22586904", "3": "0.16793561", "4": "0.11458843", "5": "0.047822155", "6": "0.053653073"}}
