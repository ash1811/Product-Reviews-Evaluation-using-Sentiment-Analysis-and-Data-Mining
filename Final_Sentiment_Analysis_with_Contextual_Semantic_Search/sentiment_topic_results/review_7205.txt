{"text": "I've had several pairs of Bates boots over the years, and this pair is by far the most comfortable, and seems to have the best grip of any shoe I've ever worn. The downside to that is that the soles do wear thin faster than many other brands would. My only personal complaint about this pair of boots is that the laces shred right through the Nylon tongues in almost no time, and then the laces put a bit of pressure across the Extensor tendons. An iron on patch has helped reduce this pressure, but not by much.Given what I know now, i would definitely purchase this boot again, although I would take the time to modify the tongue straight away.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2900066", "2": "0.13505915", "3": "0.21999198", "4": "0.19388357", "5": "0.0780016", "6": "0.080776066"}}
