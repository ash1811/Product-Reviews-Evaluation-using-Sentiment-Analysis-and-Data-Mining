{"text": "This front pocket wallet / card holder is ok.  It's not high-quality leather, but there's no problem with the leather.  The stitching is straight and hits the marks, but it's not a heavy gauge.  There's no problem with the build / construction of the wallet, it's just an \"ok\" product, nothing smashing.  Considering what I paid for it, that's not a problem.It will certainly hold many business cards in the expandable pouch and there's a slim, non-expandable sleeve adjacent to it.There's also a slim, non-expandable sleeve on the outside, opposite the clear id slot.Is it 5-star quality?  No.  But it's moderate quality that will do what I want it to do for at least a while at a good price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.052768424", "1": "0.3001244", "2": "0.253229", "3": "0.1376314", "4": "0.18322085", "5": "0.031789284", "6": "0.041236673"}}
