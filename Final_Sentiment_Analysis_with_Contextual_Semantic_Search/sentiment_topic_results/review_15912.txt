{"text": "This is a super cute costume that my son wore to school for his famous American project. He was Neil Armstrong and this worked out well for that part. It's well made and it fit him perfect but BEWARE my son normally wears a size 10 in pants (we bought a 12/14) so in my opinion this does run a little small. My son is about 4'9 and 60lbs.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1440973", "1": "0.35884118", "2": "0.17597136", "3": "0.08063511", "4": "0.064605474", "5": "0.17186488"}}
