{"text": "I have ZERO complaint about the watch.  I replaced my 30 lap timex with this one since Marathons in Japan are in KM, so I needed something with over 30 lap max.My deployment in Iraq ended up cracking the band and I couldn't find an exact duplicate of the rubber wristband...i had to settle for a nylon/velcro band...and I still had to alter it a bit for it fit in there right.Even with my Polar heartrate monitor watch, I still like this one for its simplicity for Timing and alarms.  Not sure what someone would need more than this if you aren't monitor your heart rate or speed...the watch is perfect for the basic needs.5 Stars if exact replacement bands were available in stores.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10000377", "1": "0.11068219", "2": "0.16963196", "3": "0.068507776", "4": "0.19678879", "5": "0.17796291", "6": "0.17642264"}}
