{"text": "I love this backpack!  There is tons of room and great pockets of every size.  My favorite feature is that this pack has a special padded sleeve for my laptop!!!  And a smaller lined pocket to hold my power cord.  Pack is sturdy-and seams are strong.  I pack it full of my computer and books and I have never felt as though it will not hold up.  I like that there are side mesh slots for my water bottle, and also a mesh sleeve for your cell phone in the shoulder strap!!!  CANT SAY ENOUGH GREAT THINGS!  One of my best purchases from Amazon!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11451502", "1": "0.22228755", "2": "0.25294155", "3": "0.101985954", "4": "0.22738785", "6": "0.0783647"}}
