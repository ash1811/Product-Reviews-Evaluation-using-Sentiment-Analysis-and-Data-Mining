{"text": "Purchased these for comfort and easy on-off, but I keep getting compliments on them from co-workers!  You can walk all day in these shoes (they stay on--don't worry about \"walking out\" of them), and your feet and back won't get tired.  Wish they came in more colors in my size!  They fit true to size, and I recommend them for anyone who has foot problems, lower back problems, or wants a shoe that's easy to slide on and off.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.22381692", "2": "0.29378504", "4": "0.10634295", "5": "0.12665917", "6": "0.24272332"}}
