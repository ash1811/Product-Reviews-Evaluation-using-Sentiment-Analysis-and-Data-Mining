{"text": "Very nice shoes. Fit and finish are excellent for the size 9-Ds I bought.  The shoe is a good medium width and the toe box is high enough to be comfortable but not too loose. These are flat shoes, so you need a little room in the full width of the shoe.  Also good fit in the heel.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0462764", "1": "0.4953028", "2": "0.30079526", "4": "0.05067144", "6": "0.09768307"}}
