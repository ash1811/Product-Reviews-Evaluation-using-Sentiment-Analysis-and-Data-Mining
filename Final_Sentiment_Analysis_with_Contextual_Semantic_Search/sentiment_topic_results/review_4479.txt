{"text": "I was always a Lee Jeans guy, but hadn't purchased any lately....saw the price and the fact that they had my size 31/34.....ordered and remembered why I like Lee. These feel like they should. Fit without being  too constrictive or too baggy.. quality is good..love the black....have to order other colors now", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06875939", "1": "0.22409353", "2": "0.052510105", "3": "0.09958809", "4": "0.09803335", "5": "0.07599726", "6": "0.38101828"}}
