{"text": "Purchased the shoe in Gunsmoke.  No wide sizes so bought medium.  Shoe fit allright.  Did not enjoy the quality of the leather, it was really tough and hard and just very low quality.  Have had Merrell's before, wore them out, wanted the same thing again.  Quality has really gone down.  I feel like I should have stockpiled stuff from 10 years ago, it was way better quality for the same price.  I don't recommend this product.  At all.  Sorry, Merrell.  We have to part ways here, I guess.  It was good while it lasted.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.036452863", "1": "0.3207524", "2": "0.10826666", "3": "0.2001308", "4": "0.22478214", "5": "0.05258189", "6": "0.057033245"}}
