{"text": "I got these for my toddler to wear with his snow boots. I got the XS and they fit my 18 month old with just a little room to grow and he normally wears a size 6 toddler shoe. I am very pleased with the quality and fast shipping. I wish I had bought another pair, I'm sure we will misplace at least one of these socks before we even get any snow.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04710432", "1": "0.27050534", "2": "0.31226513", "3": "0.12773861", "4": "0.04436521", "5": "0.19424438"}}
