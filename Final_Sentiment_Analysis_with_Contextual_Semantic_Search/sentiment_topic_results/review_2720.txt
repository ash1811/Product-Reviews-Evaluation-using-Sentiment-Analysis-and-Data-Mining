{"text": "I cannot comment on the watch itself because I returned it after trying it on. The problem is with the band. Where the wrist strap is attached to the watch the band is not flexible. As a result the band sticks out on both sides of the watch making it difficult for a shirt cuff to pass over it and making it unsightly and easily knocked or caught. It would be fine on anyone with a broad wrist but not on an average or smaller wrist.Pity. I spent a long time looking for a watch I liked and this seemed to fit the bill because it has a pleasant blue face with white fingers etc which are clearly seen.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.12890929", "2": "0.17486827", "3": "0.11877956", "4": "0.18392386", "5": "0.2806979", "6": "0.11020249"}}
