{"text": "I love Tevas - I have several pairs of sturdy sandals. I like the idea of flip flops and would love to find comfortable ones. I figured if anybody could make flip flops comfortable, Teva could do it. They are comfortable - well, for the first 15 minutes or so. However, they are flip flops  - they're okay, but comfortable to walk in . . . not really.For flip flops they are quite okay. I was expecting to really like them - but my love of Teva doesn't overcome my dislike for flip flops. They are a lot dressier than regular flip flops (on the continuum of dressy they are really only dressy compared to other flip flops), and only marginally more comfortable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04615703", "1": "0.49635068", "2": "0.19664548", "4": "0.07290983", "5": "0.05030839", "6": "0.13545413"}}
