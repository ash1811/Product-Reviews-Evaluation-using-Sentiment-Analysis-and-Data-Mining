{"text": "I have had the Vulture 3-Day Assault Pack for a few years and I love this pack. It is strong, solid and has plenty of room for your gear. The YKK #10 zippers are strong, dependable and can handle the abuse from a stuffed pack. The 1000-Denier water and abrasion resistant light-weight ballistic nylon fabric is very durable and there are enough MOLLE attachments to add gear. The backpack has a waist belt and chest belt for a comfortable load.The Vulture-II holds 2810 cubic inches of gear which should be plenty for about a 3 day trip. The main compartment is very large and holds a lot of gear. The main compartment has dual zippers so it can be opened up almost all the way so that getting to your gear is no problem. I am able to fit a bivy, sleeping bag, sleeping bag liner, Thermarest small pad, back pack rain cover and other items in the main compartment. This pack also has a front pouch and slip pocket to hold other essential items as well. It has a compartment for a 100 oz. hydration bladder for water. At 3 lbs, 8 oz. it is a bit on the heavy side but there is always a cost/benefit ratio with gear. This is not a ultralight pack but it will handle any abuse you can dish out and it will last for many years. I have used and abused this pack and it still looks brand new.If you are looking for a pack that has plenty of room, is extremely durable, yet comfortable then this is your pack.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.2930198", "2": "0.18650892", "3": "0.077993475", "4": "0.18447126", "5": "0.12920825", "6": "0.12653843"}}
