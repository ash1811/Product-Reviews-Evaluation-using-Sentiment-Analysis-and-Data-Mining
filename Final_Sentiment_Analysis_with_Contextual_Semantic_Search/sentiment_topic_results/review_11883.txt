{"text": "I initially purchases this shoe in a 7M, my usual size. They felt like a half size small so I purchased the 7.5M which was better and actually feels like a size 7. Out of all my many shoes, I have never had to purchase a 7.5 (other than my Asics running shoes) so I do think this shoe runs small or maybe it runs narrow. Very smart looking shoe though and seems like it will be comfortable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05612151", "1": "0.18439764", "2": "0.28384334", "3": "0.23241602", "4": "0.05103158", "5": "0.097372666", "6": "0.09481723"}}
