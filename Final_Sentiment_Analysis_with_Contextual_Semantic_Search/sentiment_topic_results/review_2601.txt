{"text": "I HATE to spend big bucks on shoes. I know for some, this price point might not be a big deal, but I am \"cheap\" and love the deals. That being said, I had a similar pair of sandals ( Naot) and they wore and wore and wore. I was unable to find the same style, and the Mephisto Helen was almost the exact sandal. As someone else wrote, \"my foot was home.\" I have very, very high arches and my feet tend to roll in- this has given me issues with Achilles Tendonitis and more. These sandals hug my feet, support the arch and you do not need to have your toes \"hug\" the shoe to keep them in place. I have only had this sandal for two weeks and am looking for a second pair...and darn if they are not out of my size! lol Shoes are an investment in your health and comfort. Well worth the price you pay for these!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05108678", "1": "0.16772008", "2": "0.18650863", "3": "0.17145716", "4": "0.19936574", "5": "0.16636994", "6": "0.05749166"}}
