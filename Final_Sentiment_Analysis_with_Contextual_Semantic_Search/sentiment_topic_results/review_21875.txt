{"text": "I bought these in a plus cuz my legs are a touch on the heavy size, despite the fact that I'm a medium (5'8\", 150 lbs, size 8 or 10 jeans) - they look good and seem to be strong material.  THe plus size reached plenty high on my legs, and seem adjustable where they sit.However, the top pinches and isn't wide enough to stay in place.  THe wide tops with silicone seem best for staying in place and not pinching and this has neither of htose qualities.  THefore, I won't buy them again and am still looking for hte \"perfect\" thigh highs to wear.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07459845", "1": "0.29981807", "2": "0.055322275", "3": "0.19354928", "4": "0.15471238", "6": "0.21955836"}}
