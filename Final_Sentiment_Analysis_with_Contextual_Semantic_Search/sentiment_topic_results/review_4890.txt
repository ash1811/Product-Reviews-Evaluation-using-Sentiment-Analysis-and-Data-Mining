{"text": "I have had this watch for over a year. I use it for swimming and running. The lap function works great, when I remember to hit it. I often use it to record swimming lap splits, run splits, and/or total time. The only issue with the watch is me, I forget to hit the stop button on the chrono when I am done. The strap has held up fine and it is my everyday/casual watch as well. I have worn it in the ocean for general swimming and body boarding.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14611126", "1": "0.2231471", "2": "0.26453993", "3": "0.15215887", "5": "0.062625654", "6": "0.14823578"}}
