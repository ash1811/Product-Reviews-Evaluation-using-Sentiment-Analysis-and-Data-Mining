{"text": "I knew that for the price I wouldn't be getting anything fancy, but they probably could have tried a little harder. The one I got was pretty poorly made: the two adjusters on the left side were a pretty obvious cream color which didnt match the white of the actual belt itself and the other two adjusters. Those two were also sewn on lopsidedly, it kinda looks like:V||sooorrta like that. I dont know how to upload a picture or anything,  but that's the closest comparison I can do lol. Its really not that big of a deal: I'm going to try to buy bleach to take the color out of those straps and make them match, and I'm either going to try to detach and re-sew them on symmetrically orrrrr just cover that up by sewing on some bows on top. Maybe both.But the item is the one shown in the picture, but you never get to see the back. Its kinda just like a short bra strap adjuster and thats it. Nothing fancy, and nothing really pretty either... :/I'm on the smaller side, and this I think would fit a rangle of people with larger hips. However, I have maybe 33&#34;-ish hips and i found this to be a little big. I might just cut off the adjuster in the back altogether and it'll fit me right; the material itself is stretchy enough on its own.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.4554702", "2": "0.1917648", "3": "0.099519014", "4": "0.10282511", "5": "0.02522083", "6": "0.12298234"}}
