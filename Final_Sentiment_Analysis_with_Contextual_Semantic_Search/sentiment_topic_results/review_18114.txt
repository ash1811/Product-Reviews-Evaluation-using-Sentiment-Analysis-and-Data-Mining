{"text": "I love these shoes. I should have gotten a half size smaller but they are comfortable and look great. I tried to get these smaller in other colors but they were sold out. I am a vegetarian and only wear vegan and it is awesome how many great vegan options are available on amazon. It used to be so hard and way too expensive to find vegan shoes. I will buy more.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.089404315", "1": "0.34207433", "2": "0.078789875", "3": "0.19563323", "4": "0.17380421", "6": "0.11620147"}}
