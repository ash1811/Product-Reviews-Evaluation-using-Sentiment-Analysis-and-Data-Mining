{"text": "This longline bra is surprisingly comfortable.  I was afraid that in order to obtain the desired shape, I would have to sacrifice comfort, but that is not the case with this bra.It provides that beautiful shaping that is iconic to the styles of the 1950's, where women had a perfect hourglass figure due to this type of shapewear.  I love it, and highly recommend it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14349037", "1": "0.21588081", "2": "0.11760667", "3": "0.12675534", "4": "0.106447905", "5": "0.2020528", "6": "0.08776605"}}
