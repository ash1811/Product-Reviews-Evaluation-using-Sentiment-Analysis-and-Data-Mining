{"text": "These watches are just hard to set; moisture will make them even more so. To top it off you also misplace the instructions to resent when the time changes. As a result, I bought one for regular time and one for daylight savings time. It is easier to find a watch than the instructions; and I don't have to worry about the little buttons sticking due to moisture over the years.
