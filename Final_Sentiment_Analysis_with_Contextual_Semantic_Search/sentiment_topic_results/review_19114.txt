{"text": "Bought this watch approximately 5 years ago. Wear it daily to work in a toolshop where it gets soaked in nasty, oil and grease filled CNC Machine coolant. Destroyed the band a few years ago and got a replacement from timex. It just fell apart again. I'm going to switch to a watch with a resin band but this thing is a beast. It worked through: 3 12hour days in 0-10*F days with a foot of snow falling on each day snowmobiling in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. 5 years of daily machine shop work. I stuck a piece of velcro on the back of it and used it as a clock on my motorcycle for a summer. Swimming, showering, sleeping. No problem.The only issue, besides the bands, is the outer rotating bezel is kind of loose. It has been this way since I bought the watch. It is bad enough that I can feel and hears gears skipping while I adjust the time/date or set an alarm. It still works and has been doing this for 5 years, so perhaps it is designed to have some play. Either way, love this watch and will be buying another new band to keep it tickin.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14460586", "1": "0.056751028", "2": "0.10116713", "3": "0.10698314", "4": "0.14940096", "5": "0.25399527", "6": "0.18709664"}}
