{"text": "I bought this bag because I had to travel with my two year old and I didn't want to carry a suitcase, a diaper bag plus my stuff.The detachable front bag was good enough to carry my daughter's changing pad, extra diapers, wipes, toys for the plane, my wallet, my cannon camera, my flip camera and her sippy cup on the side, I read in other reviews that it is hard to get stuff on that side pocket but I was glad it was because I hate when stuff comes out! Besides, after a little bit of use it got easier to put stuff on that pocket.The bag is made of good quality material and although it looks small it holds tons of stuff, besides since it looks small I didn't have to \"tag it\" and leave it on the gate because I traveled in a tiny airplane!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.102504894", "1": "0.21844004", "2": "0.15856202", "3": "0.14585687", "4": "0.10621815", "5": "0.11769776", "6": "0.15072021"}}
