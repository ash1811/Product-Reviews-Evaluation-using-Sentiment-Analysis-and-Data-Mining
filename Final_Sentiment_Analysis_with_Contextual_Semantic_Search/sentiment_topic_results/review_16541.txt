{"text": "I ordered the apple green, and got the product as pictured. It's ok. The leather was scuffed up a little, had some dirty spots. I buffed it up with some leather cleaner/conditioner and it's fine now. Shouldn't have to do that with a brand new wallet though. It doesn't really have anywhere to put cash. You can tuck it where the checkbook holder goes (I tossed that first thing, who carries a checkbook anymore?) or in the change part on one half since it is divided. But it's really tight, no way to actually look through your cash while it's in the wallet. Hopefully it stretches out a little.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06095283", "1": "0.11059907", "2": "0.31639126", "3": "0.17956609", "4": "0.1547095", "5": "0.14523154", "6": "0.0325497"}}
