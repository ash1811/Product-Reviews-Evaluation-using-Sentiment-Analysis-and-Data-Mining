{"text": "I had to search several websites to make up my mind about which bag to order; that's my only complaint. It would be much easier to make a decision if all the information about the different sizes and varities of bags were posted on the Amazon website. I finally decided on the XS leather tote and am very happy with it. I'm fairly petite, only 5'2\", so the XS is the perfect size for me. The bag is very good quality; the leather is beautiful, and the craftmanship is excellent. For a small bag, it's very roomy inside with several different-sized pockets. It's also very lightweight and causes no stress or pulling on my neck and shoulder. I anticipate using this bag for many years and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality, beautiful, and easy on the neck, shoulder and back bag.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14588283", "1": "0.2216528", "2": "0.2007758", "3": "0.1541889", "4": "0.09915749", "5": "0.17598997"}}
