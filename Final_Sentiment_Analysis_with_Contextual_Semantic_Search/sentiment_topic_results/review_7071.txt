{"text": "bali is normally known for comfort but this bra was not comfortable it felt rough on my skin I couldn't wait to pelt it off after I reached home. this loses one star for hurting my tender skin, I star for carrying the bali name but not bali comfort, I star for being pricey and 1 star for wasting my time and money without with recompense.
