{"text": "These are a nice sturdy, comfortable pant.  They do fit a little big through the hips and legs, but the length is what you would expect from a petite.  The length was just right for me and I am 62 inches.  The one thing I would change is that only the back half is elastic.  The tie fronts usually end up breaking on me well before I would normally need to replace them so I prefer the all elastic waist.  Still, I am happy with these pants.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10517193", "1": "0.49960965", "2": "0.15973762", "3": "0.11335112", "5": "0.071128495", "6": "0.047497228"}}
