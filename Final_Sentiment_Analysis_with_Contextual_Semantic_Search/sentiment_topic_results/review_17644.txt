{"text": "This is a nice watch at an excellent price.  Looks good on my wrist, very few features and that is a good thing.  It tells time, what more do you want?  I also bought a Casio Sports watch at the same time that has way more features than I will ever use.  This watch is for dress up, the other for sports.  Can't beat the price for a simple watch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.21928124", "2": "0.33080298", "4": "0.36055046", "6": "0.07632269"}}
