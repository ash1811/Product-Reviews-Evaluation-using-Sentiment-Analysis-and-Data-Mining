{"text": "I have a couple other bags from the same maker, so I knew I would be pleased as I am now. I bought this particular bag as an alternative to a larger shoulder bag. The straps adjust easily and fits very well. Easy to open zippers with nice compartments. It has a lot of great compartments for keys, cell phone, i.d. cards, kleenex, make up, and pretty anything you may want or need for a trip or day trip.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06709054", "1": "0.4190675", "2": "0.25254765", "3": "0.08422398", "4": "0.11671671", "6": "0.057092857"}}
