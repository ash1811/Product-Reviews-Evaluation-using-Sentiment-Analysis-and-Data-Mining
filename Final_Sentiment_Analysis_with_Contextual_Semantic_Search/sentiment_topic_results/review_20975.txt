{"text": "When I first got these Bloch sneakers I was very excited. I usually wear a 9.5W in street shoes; based on the reviews I bought an 11M, and they actually fit pretty well out of the box. They were just the right length, the toe box was spacious, and they seemed to have good arch support. They were a little snug across the middle of my foot, but I figured they would stretch a little with some wear.However, I wore them for approximately 5 minutes of a Zumba workout before I had to take them off because my arches were screaming at me -- oh, wow, did my feet hurt. Granted, my arches are on the lower side as feet go, so for someone with a high arch and wide feet these would probably be ideal. Still, I was really disappointed because they fit well otherwise and the shoes are really well made, but they just weren't the right fit for my feet.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07270861", "1": "0.22724278", "2": "0.027630417", "3": "0.23944592", "4": "0.119815156", "5": "0.16879597", "6": "0.14436114"}}
