{"text": "I purchased four of these LS tee shirts for my grandson.  I could not believe the quality of the cotton fabric and the quality of the workmanship for the low, low price I paid for each of the shirts.  Hint : If you use a hot clothes dryer purchase at least one size up to obtain a proper fit with &#34;room to grow&#34;.  These are 100% cotton and the cotton material is very soft and comfortable.  I will definitely purchase more of these 100% cotton shirts for my grandson in the future.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.44620442", "3": "0.26209128", "4": "0.17460442", "5": "0.06405685", "6": "0.0468193"}}
