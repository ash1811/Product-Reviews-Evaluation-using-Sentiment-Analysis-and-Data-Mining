{"text": "You get what you pay for.  Timex make some great watches; this isn't one of them.  Very limited as far as features go.  It's good-looking, but not what I'm used to as far as watches go.  I purchased it for my girlfriend.  She likes it, but I'm disappointed in the features and quality.  I'm only giving it 4-stars because I knew it was cheap when I bought it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.25221598", "1": "0.2613113", "2": "0.1428413", "3": "0.12583406", "4": "0.11002207", "6": "0.1036821"}}
