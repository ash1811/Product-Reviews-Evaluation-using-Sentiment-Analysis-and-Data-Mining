{"text": "I have been trying to find a new style bra for a long time.  I bought 1 at Kohl's just to try it and found it super comfortable.  Great construction and support.  It does not roll which is what I was trying to get rid of, this one does the job.  My only complain is that the straps are not elastic and it is harder to get on than all my past styles but decided to put up with that for all day comfort since once it is on, it is great.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.05025392", "1": "0.3907351", "2": "0.12765741", "3": "0.279875", "5": "0.14411357"}}
