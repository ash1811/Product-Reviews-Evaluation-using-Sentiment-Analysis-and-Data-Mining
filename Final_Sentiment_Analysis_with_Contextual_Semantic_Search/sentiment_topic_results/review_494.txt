{"text": "Ordered up a pair, reviews look good, got them fairly quickly, tried them on, they fit good. The right hand from pocket felt like there was something in it, like an \"Inspected by #277\" note, but it was just the wrinkled and crispy pocket itself. I inspected it closer, and it was full of holes! The front left pocket had the same problem. Bummer. Sending back for refund.. not taking another chance, I'll just go to the store and get jeans.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.082771055", "1": "0.39784753", "2": "0.08686165", "3": "0.2982199", "4": "0.03637248", "6": "0.094941646"}}
