{"text": "I'm so glad I ordered this bra.  I had also ordered another Vanity Fair bra that closes in the front, which I also really like, but this one is very pretty.  It's very comfortable on and also along the sides.  I ordered it in 38DD, and the cup size is just right with no pooching of my boobs at the top.  The floral pattern is very pretty, but it still is smooth enough you can wear it under a t-shirt just fine.  Will be ordering another one!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09076648", "1": "0.29536787", "2": "0.058660213", "3": "0.24742559", "4": "0.22139831", "6": "0.08296696"}}
