{"text": "These are neat looking and look better in person. The toe box hits around the bottom of the nail, so it basically just covers your toenails. My feet got bigger after my pregnancy, I was a perfect 8 1/2 and now I can wear a 9 in some shoes. The 8 1/2 are too small, the 9 is a tad too big. The straps are a little loose but there was no way I could get a smaller size. Dansko seems to fit my feet the same way, so it might be my feet instead of the shoe.The shoes are comfortable, however I was hoping they had more arch support, they really have very little, but it is better than wearing a flat bottom shoe. The bottom is slippery - I wore them once, it was raining and I was slipping all over the place on a tile floor, so maybe that will be better if I wear down the soles more. Otherwise they neat and I will probably wear them all summer. The toe box is wide, and my toes don't go over the edge or are not crunched, which is good for morton's nueroma.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03005399", "1": "0.25661862", "2": "0.10810492", "3": "0.2926207", "4": "0.10315275", "5": "0.033748876", "6": "0.17570014"}}
