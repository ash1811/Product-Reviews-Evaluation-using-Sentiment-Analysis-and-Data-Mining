{"text": "Baby pants always seem to be a little too long for my son. These shorts are a little easier to get on and off for diaper changes than pants, plus when my son wears them with socks, his legs are entirely covered so he doesn't get cold either. The fabric was soft. The colors looked like they did in the photo online. Over all I was very happy with this purchase and I would recommend this item.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14911066", "1": "0.4024747", "2": "0.049995854", "4": "0.052100215", "5": "0.28240833", "6": "0.06003176"}}
