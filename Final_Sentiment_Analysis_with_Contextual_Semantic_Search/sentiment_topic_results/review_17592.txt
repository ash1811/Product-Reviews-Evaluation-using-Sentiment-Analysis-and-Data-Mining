{"text": "That may seem like a bit much over an inexpensive Casio watch but I really do like this watch a lot.I had broken my old watch a couple of years ago and a local national chain of discount department stores was having a watch sale. So I dropped by and of all the watches they had, this one jumped out at me. It's mineral crystal is beautiful and the deep blue watch face is extremely attractive.So for $25.00, I walked out with a new watch. It's very well made, heavy duty with a nice wide easy on bracelet style band. It is minimalist as far as features. There is no night light or night dial so you won't be able to see the time in the dark unless you have a key chain flashlight, which I just happen to have so that's not a problem. And it is water resistant down to 300' which I can attest to since it's gotten wet or completely submerged numerous times.One of the stylish features is a ring around the crystal which when under lights, throws refracted light in hundreds of different directions, giving a jeweled affect, which makes it look more like a jeweled Rolex than a Casio.So if you are looking for a nice but inexpensive gift for your husband, or just need a good watch for work, this is one to consider. In fact, now that I've found it here, I'll be ordering another one as a backup replacement for the one I have, which unfortunately, I just hit very hard and gouged the bezel deeply.I am so glad I found this watch again on Amazon.com!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.029263383", "1": "0.19536912", "2": "0.307144", "3": "0.106343456", "4": "0.15725711", "6": "0.2023843"}}
