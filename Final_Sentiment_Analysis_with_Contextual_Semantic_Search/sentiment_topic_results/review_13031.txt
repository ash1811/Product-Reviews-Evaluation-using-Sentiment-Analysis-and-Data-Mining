{"text": "It's a bandana. Nothing more, nothing less.Anyone hunting in the cold has had to wipe their eyes, nose, hands or wrapa cut. Wearing the right clothing and using the appropriate accessories is a must.I keep an extra one in my Icebreaker Handblanket Zippered Muff.The only white flag in the woods should be that of a deer.Sometimes it's the smallest things that matter.This is one of them. Use the right color at the right time. ~ The Boss", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.26954606", "1": "0.21779956", "2": "0.12671877", "3": "0.2560706", "5": "0.043031264", "6": "0.083503224"}}
