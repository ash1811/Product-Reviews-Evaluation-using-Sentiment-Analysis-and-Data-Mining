{"text": "EXCELLENT for those who hate socks but need half cover on their feet for those hard to wear shoes.  My sister wears them around the house because sock are too hot.  Great fit, good quality, wash well and holds color.  They cost more than some other socks of this type but I am very happy with this purchase.  I got what I paid for.  Not easy to find in stores so I order from Amazon.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08213205", "1": "0.2547916", "2": "0.064863995", "3": "0.11280085", "4": "0.077058844", "5": "0.28216374", "6": "0.12618896"}}
