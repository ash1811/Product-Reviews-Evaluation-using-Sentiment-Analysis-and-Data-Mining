{"text": "I really like this watch. It is an every day wear watch, and it is not cheap looking. I saw reviews about it before purchasing and decided to buy anyway. And it is a hit. I also own a Movado watch that is similar in dimensions. The watch is also waterproof..and comfortable. An added treat is that it is solar power..so you do not even have to reset it.  It is easy to forget that you even have it on.  I liked it so much I bought another one.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13789265", "1": "0.23553844", "2": "0.23029283", "3": "0.22526062", "4": "0.111002274", "5": "0.05659746"}}
