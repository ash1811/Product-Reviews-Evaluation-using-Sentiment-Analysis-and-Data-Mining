{"text": "My husband has always had a Casio calculator watch, but when he needed to replace it, he got some other kind - I was so used to seeing him with the Casio that I wanted to get him a new one for Father's Day. I was concerned because there isn't the data bank like there used to be, but he said he uses his phone for that now. So completely happy! Great price for a great watch.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08663495", "1": "0.2078589", "2": "0.3295106", "3": "0.049176037", "4": "0.13068724", "6": "0.19214828"}}
