{"text": "Some of the reviews made me worry that the texture would be off but these are perfect, silky with just the right amount of sheen. I was also needlessly afraid that the reversible color would show through (it does not). I got these for when I travel. My travel wardrobe is grey and black so these work perfect for me. The size seemed right, I am 5'4&#34; and 125lb and got the size A. The legs were a little short but they are stretchy enough to work. The charcoal color is a really nice shade of grey.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06285595", "1": "0.21529396", "2": "0.06061618", "3": "0.29198986", "4": "0.102934144", "5": "0.11881184", "6": "0.14749809"}}
