{"text": "This backpack essentially had everything I was looking for in it.- lightweight(I'm a little woman 4'11\")- it looks normal on me and doesn't look like a kid bag too, my husband who is 6'6\" can get away with wearing my pack- functional and no pocket seems like a wasted space - I've had other packs where there were too many compartments it was annoying and time consuming to find things.- It provides enough space to use this as a weekend getaway bag.- enough padding but not dramatically - other packs I've had way too much padding and everyone thought the backpack was bigger than me- love not having straps hang down from the bag, it's all tidy. If you don't want to use the hip belt, I love how you can easily tuck it in and not have things hanging and hitting your legs.I haven't yet taken this out on hiking trips so far, but when I use it for my everyday commute to work, it's wonderful. I don't feel like I'm swimming in a backpack and it's perfectly lightweight and no wasted spaces with exhaustive pockets. Well designed North Face, now I can see why so many people have purchased this bag over the years.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16201642", "1": "0.19898723", "2": "0.20228595", "3": "0.08193818", "4": "0.14221008", "5": "0.1122386", "6": "0.100323565"}}
