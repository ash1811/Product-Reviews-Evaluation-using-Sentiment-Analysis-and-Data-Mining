{"text": "I hate ordering clothes online because it is rare they fit like they say - but these pants fit true to size. Great fit in the hips and waist and perfect length. I really like the side elastic (which isn't binding). If I find pants that fit in the hips, they are gaping in the waist - well not with these! So glad to have found them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.46342072", "2": "0.13572766", "3": "0.11549739", "4": "0.120325245", "6": "0.15704736"}}
