{"text": "I'm on my second pair of ACORN slippers; after 5 years I finally wore the first pair out.  I didn't hesitate to order another pair of the TEX MOC slipper.  Por que, you may ask?Comfort.  Warmth.  Durability.  Dry.  If I have to run out to the mailbox, or get the paper, the rubber souls keep my feet snug and dry.  Plus, it's been a surprisingly lengthy, often brutal, winter in these parts; when the house is cold, these ACORNS keep your tootsies snug.  Finally, these slippers are so darn comfy.  I slip into them, plop down on the couch to read the paper or watch the tube, and you can practically hear my feet enthusiastically thanking me.I know one thing for sure.  When it comes time to get another pair of comfortable slippers, I'm buying the ACORN MEN'S TEX MOCs.  Highly recommended to all men's slipper consumers.  Your feet will be thanking you, too.--D.
