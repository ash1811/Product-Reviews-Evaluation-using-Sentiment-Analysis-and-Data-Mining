{"text": "After searching for a corset to wear under my wedding dress and on my honeymoon I found this one and for the price decided to give it a try.  It arrived well packaged and the item itself was great.  Sturdy construction that didn't look or feel like a costume and due to the double lining, it was really comfortable.  It really holds you in and was fairly easy to tighten myself.  The pink color is more of a dusky rose color with slightly shimmery detail and sexy black lace along the top, very nice and pretty.  The all black reverse side wasn't really a go as the hooks are on the wrong side to fasten and I never was able to get it fastened in the front but perhaps I'll keep trying since the black side looks so great too.  If you are small busted (A or B cup) you may have trouble filling this corset out even pulled at its tightest but I plan to use cup enhancers bought from the fabric store to add definition when worn under clothing.  Overall a great corset for the price and I look forward to wearing it for the wedding and honeymoon.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.086973645", "1": "0.26760623", "2": "0.08820625", "3": "0.15319426", "4": "0.06047274", "5": "0.23029871", "6": "0.11324817"}}
