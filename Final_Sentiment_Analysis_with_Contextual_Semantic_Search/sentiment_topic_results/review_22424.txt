{"text": "Okay, this is gonna sound weird but these boots are warm to the point where mine don't breathe well...my feet are often sweaty inside them...as compared to my Emu's which are great, breathe well and are comfy. These almost feel like an entirely different kind of fleece. Also, the lining loses its fluffy fullness leaving a flat feeling inside the boot. Again, the Emu's lost a bit of the fluffy newness but still make my feet feel more cushioned but not sweaty. Not a terrible boot, but not as good as some others.I normally wear a 7.5. The 8 fit well.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2299439", "1": "0.21041903", "2": "0.056738254", "3": "0.14273725", "4": "0.24484923", "5": "0.064118505", "6": "0.05119383"}}
