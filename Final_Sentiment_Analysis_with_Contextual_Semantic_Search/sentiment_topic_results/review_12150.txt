{"text": "These socks are sooooo soft and comforting.  I have four pairs and put them on when I get home from work.  They are wonderful just for relaxing but they are strong enough for the workout of a hike.  You will love these socks.  They are thick and cushiony so can only be worn with slippers, hiking boots or other shoes which will accomodate them - I wear them with Crocs.  The merino wool is soft but the silk really adds another dimension of softness and strength.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09364092", "1": "0.12820157", "2": "0.03583962", "3": "0.08521512", "4": "0.12164512", "5": "0.31983453", "6": "0.21562307"}}
