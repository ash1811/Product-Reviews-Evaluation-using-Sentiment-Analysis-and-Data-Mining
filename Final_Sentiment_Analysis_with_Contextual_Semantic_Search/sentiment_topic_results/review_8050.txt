{"text": "Bought these for my husband. He wears them just fine because he isn't picky, but they are a bit harder soled than other shoes of similar style. They also run REALLY big. I have ordered him a size 13 in every shoe I have bought over the last 17 years and never had to return a pair. Returned the size 13 in these and ordered 12 instead. He mentioned that they still felt a little loose, but they were ok.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0965083", "1": "0.19427946", "2": "0.17724946", "3": "0.26752776", "4": "0.12064751", "6": "0.14018878"}}
