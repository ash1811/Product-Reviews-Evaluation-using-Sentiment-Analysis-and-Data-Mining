{"text": "These stockings by Leg Avenue are indeed very nice.  For the purposes of full disclosure I will admit that I initially bought them to wear with a (I was a nineteenth century Parisian courtesan!) costume.  However, since then, I have found that they also work great for everyday use.  I have worn them to work and also for more formal events.  My beautiful stockings have not let me down yet!  Great price, perfect fit!  What more can a modern woman ask for?", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18683504", "1": "0.16129419", "2": "0.12771755", "3": "0.16263308", "4": "0.24225904", "6": "0.11607469"}}
