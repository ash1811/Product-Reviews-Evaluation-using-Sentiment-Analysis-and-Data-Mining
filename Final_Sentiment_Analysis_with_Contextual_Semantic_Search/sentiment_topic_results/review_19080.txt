{"text": "I was ordering a wrist watch for my nephew and somehow, this product popped up.  As it looked similar to the watch that I was about to place in my shopping cart, I placed this one in the shopping cart, and did not pay attention to what I was buying.  When I received it, I contacted Amazon and received an immediate return authorization label.  I sent it back on Monday December 16, 2013 and have received my refund credit already on Tuesday December 17, 2013.  Great product.....just clicked on the wrong one.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.060317248", "1": "0.17994551", "2": "0.2278608", "3": "0.131358", "4": "0.12785004", "5": "0.2697767"}}
