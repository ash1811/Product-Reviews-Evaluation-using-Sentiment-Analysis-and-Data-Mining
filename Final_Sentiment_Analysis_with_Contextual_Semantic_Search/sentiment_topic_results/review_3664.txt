{"text": "So much so that I bought one in each color. I only wish they were available in additional colors and/or prints. I am a heavy device user, whether of my smartphone, Kindles or other tablets, and thus the last thing I do at night, is put one of my devices away right before I go to sleep. This case is the perfect, quick solution to putting my glasses away when I'm that tired: it opens quickly for me to just drop in the glasses, and it shuts just as quickly and securely. Since I tend to keep my handbags pretty loaded up I wouldn't use this case to protect an extra pair of glasses in my bags since it wouldn't provide sufficient protection in a stuffed bag, but for my use--in my nightstand drawer, or on the coffee table if I'm reading on the couch--these are perfect, and the right price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.083923995", "1": "0.17129527", "2": "0.29144722", "3": "0.2664906", "4": "0.097220965", "5": "0.08717922"}}
