{"text": "I heard that Havaianas were great flip flops.  I just thought to myself, &#34;they're flip flops... how great can they be?&#34;  Well I decided to buy a pair of these instead of getting the old navy clearance flip flops that I usually get.  There is a noticeable difference in quality.  They're super comfortable and I wear them all of the time. For me, I can bust through a pair of flip flops in a couple of months with continual wear.  But these are still going strong and I've had them for a year already. I wear a size 10 in womens and I have a wide foot.  The 41/42 is a perfect fit for me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08024355", "1": "0.4665876", "2": "0.17778537", "3": "0.116320595", "4": "0.13135742", "6": "0.02527634"}}
