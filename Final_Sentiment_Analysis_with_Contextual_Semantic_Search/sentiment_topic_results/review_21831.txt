{"text": "These briefs fit nicely.  They are very comfortable around the waist and soft all over.  My son is very picky about sensory issues with underwear.

Great value.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.058751624", "1": "0.30630583", "2": "0.20480299", "3": "0.14174305", "4": "0.094557755", "5": "0.10120826", "6": "0.09263048"}}
