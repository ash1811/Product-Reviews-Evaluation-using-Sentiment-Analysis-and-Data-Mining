{"text": "I bought this shoe as a result of a recommendation from a lady in my physical therapy session.  This shoe  offers an extremely soft foot bed, which  wonderful for sore or injured feet, as mine are.However, it's frustrating that the \"crocs\" company doesn't offer this shoe in definitive women's sizes.  I had to purchase it in \"mens 6, women's 8\", and it's much too wide and makes my feet look as though they're from the jurassic era.I wear them though, because it's the only shoe I can wear until my feet and tendon heal.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06075511", "1": "0.18163753", "2": "0.15647513", "3": "0.18724051", "4": "0.21582496", "5": "0.17259093", "6": "0.02547583"}}
