{"text": "These were bought for my husband who spends a lot of time outdoors.  He really likes them and I think they help reduce his sweating.  They are breatheable, and that's important for him.  We have purchased Champion products in the past and for the most part have been satisfied with their construction and quality, not to mention the price.  The color is true to the listing, and they have done well after several washings.  No color fade or anything negative as a result of washing/drying.  Good product for the money.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3002075", "2": "0.18969853", "3": "0.073778376", "4": "0.08880787", "5": "0.21111928", "6": "0.13305925"}}
