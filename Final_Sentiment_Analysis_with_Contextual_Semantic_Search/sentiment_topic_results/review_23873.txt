{"text": "Whether you are a skier, snowboarder, or snowmobiler, this product is perfect for under your helmet with NO bulk.  It sits skin tight and does NOT let the wind in at all.  I have long hair that I braid and it worked perfectly.Personally I am a skier and live in New Hampshire where we have all sorts of different types of weather.  From nice 15 degree sunny days on the slope to -3 with 30 MPH wind, this did not disappoint me at all.In fact, I liked and used mine so much that my husband who was very hesitant had me order him one as well, he used it every day we went skiing and has the same feelings as I do.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2761572", "1": "0.2614433", "2": "0.14902568", "3": "0.13394941", "4": "0.060522523", "5": "0.11634005"}}
