{"text": "We wanted the costume that didn't have all the bulk in it.  This was perfect.  My son is 4 and it was a little big, but I just think- hey, he can wear it to play in for a good year or so.  He'll get lots of wear out of this.  It would be nice if the boot covers fit tighter, but they were good enough! Easy on and off...we actually had a whole outfit on under it to keep warm, so there's your muscle bulk, if that's what you want.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14327833", "1": "0.49960265", "2": "0.09104341", "3": "0.1111763", "4": "0.14807108"}}
