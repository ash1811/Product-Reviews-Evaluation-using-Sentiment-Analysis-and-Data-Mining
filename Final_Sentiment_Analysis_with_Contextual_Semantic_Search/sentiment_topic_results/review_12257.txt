{"text": "These slippers are not worth $12.00 (plus S/H) ridiculous.  Mine just arrived today - I take a 8 1/2 to 9 shoes so I purchased Size Large. These slipper aren't worth more than five dollars and ninety eight cents like they were selling for only 10 years ago in Filene's basement. The Size Large fits poorly - I have excessive room at the heel end, also at the toe end. Nothing seems to fit any more even slippers.  'MADE IN U.S.A.'  I guess is over, too bad cause clothes, shoes, slippers all fit poorly now, all we do is send items back.  Sick of this......", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06173971", "1": "0.30391935", "2": "0.17351659", "3": "0.059276707", "4": "0.08986416", "5": "0.050413698", "6": "0.26126984"}}
