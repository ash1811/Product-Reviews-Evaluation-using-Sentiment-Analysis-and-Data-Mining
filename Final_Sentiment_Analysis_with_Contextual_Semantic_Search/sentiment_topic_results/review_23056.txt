{"text": "These are the most expensive flip-flops I've ever bought. I got them for my husband because he goes through several pairs of flip-flops every year. Others tend to curl and leave black residue on his feet after he's worn them a while. Gross! These flip-flops however, have done neither. While a little heavier than other flip-flops, the sole has a rubberier feel as opposed to a foamy feel. The footbed is covered with leather which looks nice, is comfy and doesn't wear off! The sole is a tad on the narrow side, but only by comparison of other flip-flops. This shoe has not curled at all. My husband wears them all the time and LOVES them. Won't be replacing these any time soon!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.049889278", "1": "0.06640054", "2": "0.09733539", "3": "0.33820182", "4": "0.15230033", "5": "0.17102045", "6": "0.12485216"}}
