{"text": "Needed BDU pants for an MA class and these were the only ones I could find with a zipper fly. (I hate the button ones.) These are heavy for ground protection but are not ripstop. That wasn't specified in the description. I was told all BDUs are supposed to be ripstop. I find these hard to move in, bulky, heavy, and they run huge. Couldn't find these for women so I needed XL to be able to move hips freely but had to take them in and shorten them a lot.... and they still make me feel like an elephant. I wish they'd make BDUs in a flexible ripstop material with comfortable elastic waists and in women's sizes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.055536695", "1": "0.14663385", "2": "0.14198199", "3": "0.30392084", "4": "0.04764511", "5": "0.15015227", "6": "0.15412925"}}
