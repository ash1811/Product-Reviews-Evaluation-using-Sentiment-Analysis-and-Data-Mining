{"text": "If the face were as easy to read as the photo, maybe I would have given this a 4 or 5.  Just a tad hard to read even in bright light.  The face is not white, it's silver, like the hands themselves, making it difficult to glance and &#34;see&#34; the time.  But with LCD back up and display easy enough to use.  HOWEVER, the light(s) are absolutely worthless and you can not read anything in darkness.  Very disappointing, otherwise a very decent watch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.3118416", "2": "0.22091816", "3": "0.18445498", "4": "0.04148517", "5": "0.08230371", "6": "0.15574116"}}
