{"text": "I bought these for my elderly mom - assumed that they would fit like the Kendale slipper.  Not so - this one is on the narrow side (and I ordered Medium).  I have ordered the Kendale to replace it and will be sending this back.  Also, her foot is not wide but the velcro strap just about has enough length to fasten it closed.  It should be a good 1 inch longer.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1320051", "1": "0.45868483", "2": "0.09632959", "3": "0.064438015", "4": "0.08264676", "5": "0.021594258", "6": "0.1443014"}}
