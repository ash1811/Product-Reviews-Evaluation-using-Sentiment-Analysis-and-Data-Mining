{"text": "This watch is pretty cheap. A little smaller than expected. There is NO screw down crown. The bracelet feels well built and as heavy as it should, being stainless. I like the magnifier over the date since it would be hard for me to see it otherwise without glasses.  That being said, it looks and feels like a plastic stick on. In fact I may have read where somebody didn't like it and peeled it off.Taking all this into consideration, it is still a good looking watch that I'm not afraid of getting wet in the shower. We will have to wait Nd see how it holds up.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.123808615", "1": "0.13752837", "2": "0.14313199", "3": "0.27815524", "4": "0.15106772", "6": "0.16369502"}}
