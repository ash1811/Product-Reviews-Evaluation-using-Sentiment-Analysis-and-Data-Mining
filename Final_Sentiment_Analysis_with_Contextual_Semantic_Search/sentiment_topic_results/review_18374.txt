{"text": "My husband has been wanting an ECO drive watch for some time.  So, I decided Valetine's Day was a good time to do that.  He has quite a collection of watches already, and we have to spend too much money on batteries for them, so he wanted one that didn't require a battery, or movement, to keep it running.This watch is stylish and keeps great time.  A little while in the light (I think it's 45 minutes, but don't quote me on that) and it will keep a charge for up to 6 months, which is important for someone who might go that long in between watch wears because they have a few to choose from.Although, since it IS such a nice watch, he wears it most of the time, now.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13157983", "1": "0.14144033", "2": "0.2017237", "3": "0.21688", "4": "0.12922883", "5": "0.09388185", "6": "0.08526545"}}
