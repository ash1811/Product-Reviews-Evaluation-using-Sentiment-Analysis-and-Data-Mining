{"text": "Okay, I loved this bag.  It is a great size, looks very nice especially for those who want an alternative to a purse, it doesn't hurt your shoulders or back, I really like the color and you can fit tons of stuff inside without it being bulky.Now you ask why 3 stars if it is so great: YOU CAN NOT CLEAN IT.  I am someone who stains gravitate towards.  If someone is going home with a spot on their shirt, it is going to be me.  Within a  year of using this bag and trying numerous methods to clean it, I have given up and it hangs in my closet unused because it just doesn't look presentable anymore.This is so disappointing because I really, really liked this bag.  I guess if you are one of \"those\" people who returns home at the end of the day as neat and tidy as when you left, if you are someone who has not contemplated purchasing stock in a company that sells your favorite stain remover, this could be a great bag for you.  If you fall into the other category save up for the leather or be willing to replace the bag as necessary.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17137954", "1": "0.44499403", "2": "0.12625432", "3": "0.022657923", "4": "0.054966286", "5": "0.07678332", "6": "0.10296459"}}
