{"text": "I purchased this dress in several colors for my elderly mother who lives in a nursing home.  It is difficult for her to get dressed and these are easy to wash, easy to put on, and have proven to be very durable.  I recommend them.  Note:  They come out of the dryer crinkled and  don't need any touch-up if you get them out quickly - but they will wrinkle badly if left in the dryer.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17321219", "1": "0.4236999", "2": "0.10670736", "5": "0.063628525", "6": "0.2243165"}}
