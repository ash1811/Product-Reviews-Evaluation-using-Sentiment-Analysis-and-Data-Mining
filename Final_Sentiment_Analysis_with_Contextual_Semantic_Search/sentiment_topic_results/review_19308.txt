{"text": "This is the fourth Invicta watch I have purchased, this watch is very nice. Presented well in yellow invicta signature box. Only draw back was it has a smaller face. The watch was in the men's watch category and appears like a woman's watch. Quite a little too much gold. Would have rather picked the pro diver silver with gold accent. Over all nice watch if you are prepared for the smaller version. Think I was just use to the bigger signature face.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.040458027", "1": "0.32429743", "2": "0.25280836", "3": "0.18492512", "4": "0.114248104", "5": "0.08019092"}}
