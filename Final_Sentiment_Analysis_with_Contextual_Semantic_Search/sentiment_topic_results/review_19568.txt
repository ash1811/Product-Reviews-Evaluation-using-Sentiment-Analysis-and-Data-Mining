{"text": "I have a pair of Park Avenue Cap-Toes identical to these, and they are perfect. They are broken in after about three steps, and after three years of pretty hard use they still look fantastic and feel terrific. These shoes are made the old-fashioned way, with no cheap concessions to the bean-counters. These shoes are American craftsmanship through and through -- the way it used to be and should still be. I am a lawyer and when I am representing clients in court I owe it to them to look my professional best, and my Allen Edmonds shoes, including these Park Avenues, are all I will wear to court. You cannot find a more formal and professional shoe than these Allen Edmonds Park Avenues. Highly recommended without reservation.
