{"text": "It has become harder and harder to find bras that fit even in stores where I used to buy them. I tried these and was pleasantly surprised that I did not have to send them back. They are very pretty and stylish but most of all they fit and fit well.They also support well too which is a big plus for plus size women. I have had these bras now (I bought 3) and I am still wearing them after 2 years They hold up well in the machine and in the dryer. Lacy and comfort at its best.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17458132", "1": "0.41877052", "3": "0.2384225", "4": "0.0598367", "6": "0.10203158"}}
