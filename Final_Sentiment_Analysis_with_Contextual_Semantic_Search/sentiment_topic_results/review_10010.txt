{"text": "The moment I picked up this product, I could tell it is of extremely low quality.  The time is nearly impossible to change with its tiny nob for adjusting the time.  The winding pin is supposed to have two settings but it is so cheap that I couldn't find the second setting.  The winding pin actually comes out if you pull it out too far, cant believe Timex couldn't design it so that the pin won't come out.  Piece of garbage.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.42647368", "2": "0.22207662", "4": "0.082706265", "5": "0.056074504", "6": "0.2056381"}}
