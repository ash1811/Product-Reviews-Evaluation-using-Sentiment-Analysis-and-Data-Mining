{"text": "I wanted a \"diamond\" bracelet but just couldn't see spending thousands of dollars on the real thing when most people cannot tell between genuine and created diamonds.  This bracelet has CZ set in sterling and it is a stunning statement piece. The stones are large and catch the light to produce a brilliant sparkle.  Does it look fake? Honestly, I think even if these were real diamonds they would still look fake. I could afford diamonds this size - that doesn't mean others would think them real.  People expect diamonds on celebrities who can afford them. Choosing smaller stones so they \"look real\" doesn't mean others will think they look real. I chose this bracelet to satisfy myself. It's bold, of excellent quality and has a very secure safety clasp.Overall, I am extremely pleased with this bracelet especially for the price I paid ($65 as of this writing). I cannot get over how beautiful it is!  The product image is accurate but I uploaded pictures of the actual bracelet I received. Highly recommended!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.2510786", "1": "0.22343822", "2": "0.08918121", "3": "0.19072089", "4": "0.05709787", "5": "0.11258292", "6": "0.07590025"}}
