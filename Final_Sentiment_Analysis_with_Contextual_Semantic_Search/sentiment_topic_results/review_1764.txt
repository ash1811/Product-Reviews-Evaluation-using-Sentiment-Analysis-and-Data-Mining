{"text": "I bought two of these because I have a couple of suits that show every little imperfection and I wanted to smooth them out.This shapper most definitely holds things in and creates a smooth silhoette.  What more could you ask for?Do you like to breathe?  If so, maybe these aren't for you.  After wearing the shaper for 12 hours, I couldn't wait to get them off and breathe.  I could feel the wires and I wondered if I had suffered internal damage.The waist doesn't go up as far on my body as the picture shows.  When I sit, the elastic rolls over and I have to keep pulling the thing up.The pee trap (isn't that what people call it?) is useless unless you're a man.  I could get more graphic about the problems with the pee trap, but just take my advice and don't use it unless you're a man!  Really - it isn't worth it!!!If I had designed this shaper, I would have sewn in a zipper on the side or front, since the shaper is so hard to pull up.  A zipper would have made all the difference.Having said that, I will continue to sell my soul to the devil until I get off my rear and work out.  After all, it's better to look good than to breathe, right?", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12329427", "2": "0.1770134", "3": "0.49078766", "5": "0.070229515", "6": "0.13388471"}}
