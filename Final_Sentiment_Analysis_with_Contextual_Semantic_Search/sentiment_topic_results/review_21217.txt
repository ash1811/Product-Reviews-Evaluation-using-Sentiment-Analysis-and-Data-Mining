{"text": "I don't know why they call this a sneaker - it's more like a hiking shoe (?!?). Good enough to wear to work (if you don't have to wear a suit to work),  sturdy and comfortable. Not for playing basketball, tennis or jogging.  I've only had them a couple of days, but I like them a lot.  Lastly, I bought a size 10, which is my typical size, and they fit perfectly.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.05281762", "1": "0.23802722", "2": "0.11747553", "3": "0.3104177", "4": "0.12463247", "5": "0.15240984"}}
