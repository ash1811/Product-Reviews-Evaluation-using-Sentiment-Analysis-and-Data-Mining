{"text": "I am a  21 year old college student  and I always preferred white briefs as underwear  instead of  boxers and these men's briefs were meant to be comfortable and not seen with 3 exceptions. One- In the locker room at college and I am in my underwear briefs/swim trunks and change to/from my swim trunks/briefs as I am on the college swim team.  Two-  In my college dorm my roommate Kyle, 20,and I often go shirtless and barefoot in just  our underwear to study or sit in front  of our computers in just our underwear.Three- At my physical exam required for my being on the college swim team the nurse tells me to take off my T shirt, shorts,  socks  and  sneakers and strip to just my underwear like the young man modeling and she weighs me and measures my  height while I am shirtless and barefoot in just my underwear and tells me to sit on the  examination table and she shakes down a thermometer rapidly and tells me to open my mouth and I sit shirtless and barefoot in only my underwear  in front of the nurse  with a thermometer  under  my tongue and the  doctor sees me shirtless and barefoot in just my underwear and tells me to stick out my tongue and open my  mouth and say ahhhh and feels my neck for lumps and tells me to cross my bare legs as he hits them  with a hammer and  puts a stethoscope to my bare chest and tells me to breathe and cough,He Tells me to lie on my back in just  my underwear and presses down on my bare chest and also hits  my bare legs. with a hammer again and  so these  briefs  are not a fashion statement ordinarily for viewing.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11578296", "1": "0.24331379", "2": "0.10761443", "4": "0.32975858", "5": "0.11839434", "6": "0.08281444"}}
