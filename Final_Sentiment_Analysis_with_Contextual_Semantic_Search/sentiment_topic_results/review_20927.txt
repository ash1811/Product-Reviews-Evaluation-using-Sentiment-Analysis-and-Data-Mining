{"text": "These are the most comfortable shoe. I have wide feet and work on a hard surface all day. These shoes are fantastic. They feel great from the first wearing. Light weight and so cushy but supportive !I have the castelrock/lavender combo....The lavender is more of a light plum color. Lovely and feminine without being kiddish. Looks great with jeans.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.3201698", "1": "0.25018066", "2": "0.20294952", "4": "0.11317931", "6": "0.10482329"}}
