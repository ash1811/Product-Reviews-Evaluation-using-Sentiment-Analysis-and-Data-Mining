{"text": "I own these little puppies and I have to tell you , I was going through about 4 pair of slippers a year (2 pair at home & 2 pair at the office). I am a accountant working about 12 -16 hours a day during tax season and 8 or more hours during off season, plus school full-time and 2 kids with husband and always need slippers at work and home. (4 inch heels are killers on my schedule).These babies are the bomb, they are comfortable, sure fitting (not sliding off my feet with every turn) and most of all worth the cash.I wanted to try them before getting a extra pair for the office and let me assure you of one thing \" BEST LIITLE SLIPPERS IN TEXAS\", I have had them for about 6 months and they still look and feel as comffortable as they did when I took them out of the box. I have got to get a extra pair for the office and will never buy aything other than these slippers  these from this point on.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07090778", "1": "0.2393413", "2": "0.06920317", "3": "0.23104428", "4": "0.16713779", "5": "0.036500424", "6": "0.18586527"}}
