{"text": "First the pros: lots of pockets and little areas to place your things. Pretty color choices (I got violet, which wasn't as loud as I was expecting). Nice interior fabric.The cons: the leather didn't seem to be of really high quality. I mean, it wasn't bad or anything, but I've dealt with leather goods in all incarnations, and this just didn't come off as being high quality. And (purely subjective), I just couldn't get excited about the style. Maybe it was the color I chose. Maybe I should have gone with black or the stone, but this wallet came off as very old fashioned. I'm not really into vintage, and the videos of these wallet's that I'd seen online had seemed so fashionable, but that feeling didn't materialize when the package did. I think I'll stick with my patent zip-around.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.034140643", "1": "0.2980219", "2": "0.15700637", "3": "0.16929038", "4": "0.10433172", "5": "0.10195924", "6": "0.1352497"}}
