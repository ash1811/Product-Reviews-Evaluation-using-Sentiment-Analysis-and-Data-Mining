{"text": "great boot for the price. I wear a 10 or 10.5 4E shoe, and the 10.5 fit with plenty of width. one thing i didnt like was the lack of arch support. my flat feet got even flatter, and my ankle really got sore. but i put in some decent orthotics (there's plenty of room for them-the sock liner comes out), and they are fine. i wear them to ride, and they breathe very well; great for a summer cycle boot, and AMAZINGLY LIGHT!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.090791054", "1": "0.46929607", "2": "0.13512257", "3": "0.09084912", "4": "0.16816771", "6": "0.042956207"}}
