{"text": "My son is in 7th grade and brings home a lot of heavy books and binders. Plus he needs to carry a water bottle, snack, and in the winter, his shoes. His previous backpack was splitting, and so based on the good reviews of this back pack, I bought it. I'm sending it right back. The material is very flimsy and the bag holds only half of what he needs it to. If you're looking for a sturdy, well made backpack that can fit a lot of books, this is NOT the one for you.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10474966", "1": "0.42253757", "2": "0.21297641", "3": "0.0921338", "4": "0.08223816", "6": "0.08244274"}}
