{"text": "A military friend of mine (retired), whom I forced a gift idea from, told me his old watch was no longer functioning correctly. I had only two requirements when I started looking for a watch. No MASSIVE/ridiculous face that looks like a cartoon, and it must either have a canvas or leather wrist band.This watch fit my requirements perfectly.He seemed to be very happy with his gift and it made me happy to see him smile.Thanks", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13495056", "1": "0.12592947", "2": "0.17669217", "3": "0.12845214", "4": "0.2225184", "5": "0.10617196", "6": "0.10528528"}}
