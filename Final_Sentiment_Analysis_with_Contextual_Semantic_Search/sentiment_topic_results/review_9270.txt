{"text": "I have bought slippers and within a short period of time they fall apart.  It is very tempting to take thes outside and walk around, but I want to preserve its excellent look and feel.  I have ventured out with them to take out the garbage, etc.  I put these on immediately when I get home from work and other than going outside, I don't take them off until I go to bed.  Very well constructed and excellent quality.  This is by far the best slipper I have found.  I love them. You won't be disappointed.  They fit perfect, keep your feet warm; can't say enough good things aobut them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.20259172", "1": "0.3750673", "2": "0.11409859", "3": "0.07174936", "4": "0.100639544", "5": "0.036099494", "6": "0.099754035"}}
