{"text": "I bought these to wear as work out pants.  I ordered the large, I wear a 40x30 size pant.  These fit fine, they seem to run a bit large.  They have an elastic waist with a drawstring as well to tighten up.  The length was about right, only a little bit longer than I expected.  Overall no real complaints.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.067762576", "1": "0.49018908", "2": "0.10287232", "3": "0.21696614", "6": "0.11326278"}}
