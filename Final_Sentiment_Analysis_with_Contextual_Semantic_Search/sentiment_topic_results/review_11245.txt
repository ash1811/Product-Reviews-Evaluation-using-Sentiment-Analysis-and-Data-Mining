{"text": "Very nice boot.  The boots are heavy, but that's probably a good thing for the snow.  These boots are very warm and seem to be durable.  Sizing - I ordered a 1/2 size larger than I normally wear in shoes, and they fit well.  Overall, I am satisfied with these boots and would recommend them to others!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.4259676", "2": "0.05887198", "3": "0.11818953", "4": "0.18298319", "5": "0.06615915", "6": "0.14305595"}}
