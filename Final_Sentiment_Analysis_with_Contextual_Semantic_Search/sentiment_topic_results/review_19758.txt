{"text": "I just received my sweat pants today and am somewhat pleased with them.  In the past I have not had any problems purchasing a men's large in pants, I am 6'0 tall and weigh around 180 lbs and have a slender athletic build.  However, these pants were a little tight in the seat and crotch area but the inseam was perfect.  Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase since they were only about $16 so my expectations were not extremely high to begin with.  They will work fine for just lounging around.  They are very comfortable and not too heavy or too light.  I would recommend that if your around my build and want a little extra room in the seat that you look at going a size up as these will shrink some over time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.34931096", "2": "0.0851756", "3": "0.20809998", "4": "0.06436964", "5": "0.10385048", "6": "0.18676291"}}
