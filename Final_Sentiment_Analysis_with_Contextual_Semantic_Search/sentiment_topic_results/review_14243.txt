{"text": "I am a huge Teva fan and have about 4 pairs in the original thong style. I wanted something a little more strappy and decided to give these a try since I already really enjoy Teva sandals. These did not disappoint. I have a wide foot so the straps need to be stretched out a bit so it took a few wears until they fit my feet better. After that they were perfect. I live in the city so I do a lot of walking and wanted something that wouldn't give me a ton of blisters. These worked well and have such a thick sole that there is no way these can't be comfortable for a days walk. Would recommend to anyone who does a lot of walking and wants I slightly nicer, very comfortable flip flop.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07037464", "1": "0.29549235", "2": "0.14272726", "3": "0.23194271", "5": "0.19557346", "6": "0.061278377"}}
