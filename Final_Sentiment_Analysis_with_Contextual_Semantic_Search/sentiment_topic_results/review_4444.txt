{"text": "Due to shedding some excess weight I've moved down from 33/32 to 32/32.  Switching from Levi's to Lee's due to heavy cost differential, there seems to be a close mapping between the two brands' sizes.  Very happy with the jeans' comfort and appearance, knocking a star due to the photo misrepresentation (two fewer loops than illustrated) and a tiny stitching imperfection (barely noticeable and certainly not worth returning over) on the lower right leg of the jeans.  Will happily be ordering another pair soon.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15160596", "1": "0.10765933", "2": "0.0653108", "3": "0.20501108", "4": "0.095067374", "5": "0.1409983", "6": "0.23434716"}}
