{"text": "I ordered a wide and it was just ever so more narrow than I expected.  But NOT uncomfortable to me, perfectly wearable out of the box.  I figured they would stay on better and stretch out a bit with wear.  This is my 2nd pair, they wore out the first and repurchased the exact same size.  I don't remember the first being snug so it can't be that big of a deal.  These are by far my favorite pair of shoes I have ever worn.  I bought the all black with the quilt and patent black for a little more detail.  I think they look a little more dressed up then a sneaker.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10037177", "1": "0.4049332", "2": "0.073020756", "3": "0.20320325", "4": "0.080935076", "5": "0.07013253", "6": "0.06740337"}}
