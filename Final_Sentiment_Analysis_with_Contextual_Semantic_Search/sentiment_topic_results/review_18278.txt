{"text": "I've been wearing this watch since 1987!!! It's not what I would call cute, but it's great - very functional. Has a unique timer setting -  the easiest/fastest timer setting on any watch that I've ever seen. And it's not too big, unlike most of the sports watches out there that have similar functions.  I'm on at least my fourth, maybe fifth one of these watches. I change out the batteries when they wear out (usually about 2-3 years), and only buy a new watch when the band breaks ( which happened twice - but it lasted at least five years) or when I've lost it.  I hope they never stop making it!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07379036", "1": "0.21653666", "2": "0.28252795", "3": "0.23346268", "4": "0.060823373", "5": "0.08560321", "6": "0.047255773"}}
