{"text": "I bought this as a cheap throw-away bag for short-term travel since I had back problems and a full backpack was out of the question. I just needed something to hold my netbook and few other items. This was a pleasant surprise. It held my netbook case and kindle case, as well as a 16oz thermos and some other travel goodies. I didn't expect it to be very durable for the price, but it has held up well after three months of Mon-Fri lunch & work items carry use. I'm not kind to it; often toss it in the back of the truck. And I don't wear it with the waist strap as intended; just throw it over my shoulder, but it works. Kudos to whoever made this thing. Probably wouldn't hold up well for a kid with a ton of books, but it works great for me. I'd recommend it to anyone who's looking for a very inexpensive, non-fussy alternative to shoulder bags and/or backpacks.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.20138718", "1": "0.21458349", "2": "0.2383484", "3": "0.070401855", "4": "0.040268574", "5": "0.17106472", "6": "0.0639458"}}
