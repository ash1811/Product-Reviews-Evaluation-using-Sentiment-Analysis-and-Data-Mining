{"text": "I have noticed that my posture is better with this bra.  And now, when I am not wearing it my back seems to know when I'm slouching and I feel myself starting to correct my position.  The shoulder straps stay put all day and my breasts stay in place.  At my age they tend to waggle without good support, so I really like that aspect.  It is a little difficult to line up and attach all of the hooks though, otherwise I would rate this bra &#34;perfect&#34;.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.085206196", "1": "0.27505156", "2": "0.06746818", "3": "0.22317234", "4": "0.1695845", "5": "0.039682552", "6": "0.1398347"}}
