{"text": "My wife tried on these boots in a different color in a mall store.  She said they were warm, comfortable, like walking on air, but she wanted the chestnut color, which they didn't have.  I ordered these boots for the color, but had to return them because they seemed to be about a half-size small compared to what she tried on in the store.  That could be due to thicker socks or some other factor totally unrelated to the boot.  I don't know.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.42205372", "4": "0.22260186", "5": "0.16657335", "6": "0.17715496"}}
