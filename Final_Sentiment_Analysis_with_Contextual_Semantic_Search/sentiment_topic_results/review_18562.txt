{"text": "I bought these pants as I wanted some sturdy, khaki work pants without the big bellows pockets that you get with cargo pants.  I think we all agree  by now that those are not very practical.  These pants have a couple of small, well thought out pockets.  They hold my phone perfectly, and my sunglasses case.  The pants are strong, but light and roomy, like painters pants.  I wouldn't try to do masonry or firewood with these pants, but they are great for \"lighter\" labor.I gave them four stars and not five, because unlike every other Carhartt product, these pants are sized about right.  I love Carhartts, and buy a lot of their stuff.  Usually Carhartt runs large, sometimes very large.  So with that in mind I bought 36s, and I am like a 35.  But they are a bit snugger than I like my work pants to be.  All of my other work pants (Columbia, Tru-Spec, 5.11) are 36, and fit fine.  Perhaps they will stretch a bit, but I found this to be an unusual exception to the Carhartt size \"rule-of-thumb\".But very happy with them in ever other aspect.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.5454596", "2": "0.22161466", "3": "0.10073067", "5": "0.1254705"}}
