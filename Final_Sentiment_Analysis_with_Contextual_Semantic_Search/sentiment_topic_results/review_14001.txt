{"text": "I purchased this watch 2 years ago and it has kept time perfectly.  I keep it set with the Kronos time clock at work and it keeps time with it pretty good.  It needs no battery change and is as water tight as I need it to be.  I can swim and shower with it on and it just shrugs off the water. It is water resistant to 330'(75% of us will never go that deep). It's luminosity could be better in my opinion, but nothing I can't live with and accept given the level of quality in the rest of the watch. The mineral crystal is still smooth and unblemished even after two years. I work with mental patients and have this watch torn off of my wrist on 3 different occasions.  It just keeps ticking.  The 37mm diameter is perfect for my small wrist.  I did change the band to rubber for increased durability. Then the rubber broke. Currently am using a $10.00 nylon/velcro band. I wore a Seiko 5 for 10 years. It was a good watch but not as accurate as this one. In some of the watch forums, I have seen the question come up of a EMP proof watch. Some recommend an automatic. For the price though you can buy an extra one of these and store it in a Faraday Box. These are accurate, lightweight,durable, reliable,good looking and inexpensive. A couple of watchbands of different styles and you could wear it anywhere but an executive meeting or very formal. I currently have the hankering for another watch.  Not because there is anything wrong with this one.  I just like watches.  I have been considering a G-Shock Solar Atomic, but I may just have become a severe Citizen addict. If you need a good everyday watch, you don't have to spend a lot of money.  This one fits the bill nicely.  Buy this watch.  You won't be sorry.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14629021", "1": "0.25618535", "2": "0.20445059", "3": "0.14281432", "4": "0.09332813", "5": "0.040741414", "6": "0.116189964"}}
