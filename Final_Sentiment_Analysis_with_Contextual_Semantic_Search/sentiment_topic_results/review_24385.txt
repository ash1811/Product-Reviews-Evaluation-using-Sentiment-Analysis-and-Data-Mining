{"text": "Very happy to see Made in USA on the product tag. We moved a couple months ago and I was so busy I ran out of time to knit/crochet the hat I had planned to match a blue basket knit scarf for my husband. He loves Carhartt so I came on here and looked for a blue Carhartt hat. The blue hat here is a grayish blue, which will look very nice with the scarf. There are two layers to the hat fabric (so four layers where it folds over). Very nice look and quality.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09145824", "1": "0.3215009", "2": "0.05741274", "3": "0.1314198", "4": "0.16083778", "5": "0.15740241", "6": "0.079968154"}}
