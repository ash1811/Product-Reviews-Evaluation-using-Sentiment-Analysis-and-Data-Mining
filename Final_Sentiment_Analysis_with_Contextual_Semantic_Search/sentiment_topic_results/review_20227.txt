{"text": "I was very happy to give this jacket to a very valuable member of my tribe, someone I have a very deep respect for, and that was in need of a newer Jacket. This one arrived promptly, chose the medium size suggested by some respected reviewers in amazon, and it fit very well. Looks good too, seems sturdy and able to last many seasons, came with a hood which can be disassembled by choice, and has enough pockets like a good every day Jacket should. I purchased the black color and it does look very good when he wears it. I am happy with the purchase, winter is approaching, so the timing is good, but I am sure it can be used in different types of weather. Is light enough, and heavy enough to do the job, plus Carhartt is a very respectable name. I own several T-Shirts and they still remain year after year, good brand to own. Carhartt Men's Waterproof Breathable Jacket, Black, Medium Regular is a good purchase and would recommend to anyone that needs or desires a good Jacket. 4.5 Stars.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.066435516", "1": "0.38096726", "2": "0.20775782", "4": "0.06794969", "5": "0.10168157", "6": "0.1728524"}}
