{"text": "Definitely follow the lbs chart and not the sizing.  I bought a large because that is the size pants I wear, but this cradle is slightly large on me.  It is not uncomfortable, but I definitely wouldn't call it comfortable either.  It seems to alleviate some back pain since I am on my feet walking all day at work.  I don't wear it everyday, but I do wear it on days that my back pain feels really bad and I need some extra support.  I am now 31 weeks pregnant and may find that I will need it even more later.  Good price though for the item.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.30947405", "2": "0.1018397", "3": "0.28556508", "4": "0.040349323", "5": "0.17297618", "6": "0.08708502"}}
