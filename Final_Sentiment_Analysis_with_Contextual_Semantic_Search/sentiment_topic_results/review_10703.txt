{"text": "These are truly waterproof! I hiked through mud, snow, and water and my feet stayed completely dry! When I first put them on, I thought they were comfortable but needed breaking in. But I went on a five mile hike and I had no blisters so they weren't too stiff! They offer great traction, even on muddy, wet, and leaf-covered hills!my feet stayed warm in mid-30s day but never got hot. I believe I will be able to wear these on the summer too-I don't think they will be too hot. I have a weak ankle and these offer terrific support through all kinds of terrain. They are extremely well made and I believe that I will be hiking for years and miles to come!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21973759", "1": "0.13756421", "2": "0.145871", "3": "0.15872008", "4": "0.14923492", "5": "0.109051935", "6": "0.07982025"}}
