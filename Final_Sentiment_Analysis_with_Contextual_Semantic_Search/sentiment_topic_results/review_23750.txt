{"text": "Like many of the other people that left a review, I was not expecting quality. I am pleasantly surprised by how great the quality is and how nice they are. Mine came in perfect condition, I will probably order more. I google searched &#34;sunglasses for a narrow face&#34; and this brand came up, I ordered them because even if they weren't great I would've lost less than $20. These are a little big on my face, I have a tiny face and I have to find youth sized glasses and hats. These glasses kinda gave me that Mary Kate Olsen look, if you've ever seen her sunglasses on her tiny face. Oh well! The mirrored lens is very nice.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17948946", "1": "0.25032514", "2": "0.13821793", "3": "0.11022768", "4": "0.13109787", "5": "0.03570706", "6": "0.15493487"}}
