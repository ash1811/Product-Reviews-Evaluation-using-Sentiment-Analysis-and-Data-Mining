{"text": "Ordered two pairs, same size. First pair fits with plenty of room, second pair I can't even button and they're too short. Both say the waist is a 33... Looks like more people are having this problem, likely has something to do with the quality control of their new outsourced plant. Won't be buying these off Amazon anymore, seeing as the size is basically a complete guess. Would recommend buying them in store where you can try on the pants first to make sure they fit. Waited too long and now I can't return them. Great pants, just wish they'd fit. This is the second time I've been disappointed with Carhartt in the last two months.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.068235636", "1": "0.42136067", "2": "0.054626398", "3": "0.21811", "4": "0.113882676", "5": "0.039676018", "6": "0.0841086"}}
