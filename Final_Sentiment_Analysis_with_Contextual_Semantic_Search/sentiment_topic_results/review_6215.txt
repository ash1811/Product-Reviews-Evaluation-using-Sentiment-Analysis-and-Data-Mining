{"text": "Nice sweatshirt.  Thick warm material.  I can't say I agree with the reviewer who claimed the shirts tend to run big because I found the one I got to be just the opposite.  I always wear a large but I could hardly get the \"Large\" shirt on because it was so small.  I returned it and got an Extra Large, which fit just right.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.6246396", "3": "0.21150145", "5": "0.026081467", "6": "0.1264578"}}
