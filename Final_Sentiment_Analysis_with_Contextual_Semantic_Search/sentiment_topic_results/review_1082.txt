{"text": "Tried and true &#34;ye olde cotton house coat&#34; design. No surprises at a good value for money price. That said, the picture has a greyish tinge but the house coat has in fact a lily-white quilted shoulder area and the stripes are a pretty pestel rainbow stripe. The stiching and top stitching are flawlessly neat. Any unexpected  features are therefore all pleasant.I had difficulty with my coat in transit and the customer service was excellent even though the fault my not have been National's. My complaint came too late for tracking yet I still got a replacement. I am now a loyal National customer.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.088684194", "1": "0.21333522", "2": "0.123410985", "3": "0.17926781", "4": "0.08173332", "5": "0.28341547", "6": "0.030153014"}}
