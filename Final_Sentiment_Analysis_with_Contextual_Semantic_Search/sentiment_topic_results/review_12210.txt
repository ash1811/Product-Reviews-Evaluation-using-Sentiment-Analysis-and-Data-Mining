{"text": "I tried this bra at a store in the Bahamas and was pleased with the way it looked and how comfortable it was, but the price was too steep. So I decided to buy it on Amazon and although it is the same bra name and number, the fit is totally different. This bra is so uncomfortable, the band of the bra digs into your entire chest after wearing for an hour. I would not recommend it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15227515", "1": "0.41856566", "2": "0.13159423", "3": "0.22592488", "4": "0.06321435"}}
