{"text": "You really cannot beat the price for this. It is a sturdy bag that was about the size I expected it to be. I've been using it to hold my dig kit for archaeology tools, and it was great for this. Lasted in the field, and I was able to put smaller items that I was afraid to lose in the front two pockets. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't need an overly large bag, and wants something sturdy for the outdoors.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.18549256", "1": "0.27094874", "2": "0.15659525", "3": "0.21030824", "4": "0.08527285", "6": "0.087971"}}
