{"text": "These boots are warm, sturdy, cover the feet well, tight on ankles so snow/water stays out, look great, etc. My problem with them is that the metal eyelets are really bad. I can definitely see them breaking or bending. These also run about half a size small, maybe more. Normally I am an 11.5 and there is some room in front of my toes. I had to exchange for a 12 and my toes still slightly touch the front. If I went a half size larger there would be too much room though.They are comfortable, but the inserts could be better. I will likely replace the inserts.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11831425", "1": "0.3306436", "2": "0.05272706", "3": "0.2103788", "4": "0.17114899", "5": "0.081157945", "6": "0.03562937"}}
