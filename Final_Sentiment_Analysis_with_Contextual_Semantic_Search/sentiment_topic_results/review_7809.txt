{"text": "I went through the watch band pin removal process twice before: one time it was manual process involving all regular (non-watch) tools I could find, the other time it was trip to the mall to use the service of jewelry/watch repair shop. The first method required way too much time, the second - way too much money.This little tool costs less than a mall shop service fee and lets you do the job much faster (and much easier) than with household tools.But beware: be gentle and turn the screw that pushes the pin slowly to avoid breakage. Have small pliers handy to remove the band pin (the tool will not push it all the way out in case of medium to wide bands). Small hammer would also be helpful once you remove link(s) and want to push band pin in place (being gentle helps again).The only thing I would improve in this tool is the spring-loaded pad on which band rests: it would be nice if you could lock it one position for the time of the entire removal process. Watchmakers should have their hands steady enough, but regular folks may have problems with holding the band completely motionless.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08181661", "1": "0.30081174", "2": "0.13068238", "3": "0.09459763", "4": "0.23434016", "6": "0.15584236"}}
