{"text": "I wanted to love this bag- it seems perfect....until you use it.  Everything is just not quite what it needs to be.  1st- the fabric is wonderfully lightweight, but then the zippers fobs are all (there are a LOT of them) so heavy that it makes the bag about twice as heavy as it needed to be.  Then, the inside is so odd: it looks like you have great sections and separated areas- but they aren't really separate or fully enclosed.  The two sections with zippers are not sewn to the bottom of the bag, meaning that anything small you think you have placed in one of the open sections is free to slide under the zippered pouch to another section.  Even weirder- the sides are also not secured to the bottom of the purse, so if you unzip the sides all the way down stuff can slide out the edges too.  You aren't going to lose anything large- but don't expect pens, change, or anything smaller than a marble to stay inside if you aren't diligent.  The final issue is the strap- it is slippery, so I found I had to wear it cross-body all the time or it would slide off of my shoulder.  It is such a shame, because I love the size of this purse and had high hopes for it- but in actual use it is too high maintenance.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.18481492", "1": "0.2512174", "2": "0.18032", "3": "0.08235149", "4": "0.058296606", "5": "0.14612953", "6": "0.09687009"}}
