{"text": "Great tie for $7.95. I may buy more. I hope K. Alexander makes ties just like this in other colors and with patterns.Pros:1. Great knot, perfect for a Half Windsor knot. It will not be too big.2. Great dimple under the knot.3. Great fabric. It has a shiny satin sheen, which is nice. The fabric is 100% polyester with a very fine weave.4. Perfect, medium thickness.Cons:5. This is definitely not a high quality $50 silk tie. I would not wear this to a wedding or job interview. This is an everyday tie where you don't start crying if you spill food on it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.050608683", "1": "0.5076781", "2": "0.049732488", "3": "0.0695913", "5": "0.16998541", "6": "0.14988185"}}
