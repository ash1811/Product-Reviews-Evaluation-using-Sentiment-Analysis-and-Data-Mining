{"text": "I agree that these are super comfortable and I wish they did fit, but unfortunately they were just way too narrow for my feet and I had to send them back.  I felt like my feet kept sliding over the inside of the flip flop every time I walked.  I wear a size 10 and measured that my foot is 4\" at the widest part (across from below big toe to below small toe). Hope that helps someone else!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.112292625", "1": "0.43432587", "2": "0.16572909", "4": "0.1430184", "5": "0.06880222", "6": "0.07224579"}}
