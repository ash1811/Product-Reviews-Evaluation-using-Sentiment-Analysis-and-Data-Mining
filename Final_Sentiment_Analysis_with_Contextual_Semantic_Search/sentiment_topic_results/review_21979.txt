{"text": "I got this for my husband who is a flatbed truck driver. He was complaining about being cold and not having a coat because most are just too bulky for what he has to do. I thought that this would be a happy medium between a lightweight jacket and a heavy coat. He says that it keeps him relatively warm on chilly days and on the really cold days he just layers it with his fleece jacket and stays relatively comfortable. He believes it should be durable to hold up to the rigors of his job as well which is nice, considering how much clothing he has torn up working.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06077821", "1": "0.3718819", "2": "0.11148721", "3": "0.18848066", "4": "0.119698286", "6": "0.14454623"}}
