{"text": "I wear the size small with socks.  I have it in a few colors now.  It feels like a cloud.  I actually choose it to wear at home intead of my slippers because they are more comfortable and comforting.  Corrdinate them with clothes and wear matching socks and they are less conspicious. They are really great because they feel like a cloud.  The soles are non skid so they feel really safe.  I am not a vegan, but know that vegans struggle with non leather choices and think now the finally have something that works for them that feels good.I hear men choose black or brown to wear with Kackis.  I think these are a great breakthru.  If your feet hurt like mine you will love these.  If you are lucky and you can wear high fashion shoes you are lucky.  If you hurt this could open a world of comfort to you.  Try the differnt models and styles because they fit differently.  This size did not fit my mom and like I said the cayman looks similar but does not fit me.I looked on the crocs official web site and the have higher fashion ones in additon a RX line that is a medical line.  I am going to try some of the dress crocs and see.Oh I reviewed some microfiber chenille socks and that is what I like to wear with my crocs.  Crocs makes their own socks but they say cros all over them and I do not like logos.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07815416", "1": "0.32876787", "2": "0.13253705", "3": "0.05672314", "5": "0.15071124", "6": "0.25071302"}}
