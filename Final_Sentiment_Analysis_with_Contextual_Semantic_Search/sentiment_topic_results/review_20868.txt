{"text": "These sandals are super-comfortable and I wear them for everything, including bike riding, walking, and vigorous stair-climbing at the gym. They give some support and stability like running shoes shoes but are as comfortable as sandals. I even used them for running a couple of miles once and I got blisters, but no worse than the wearing-in period of some shoes that I've had and I think my feet could get used to running in them regularly; certainly hiking would be OK. They are comfortable when wet with some texture on the upper soles so they don't feel slimy or slippery when it rains. The quick lace-up feature lets me adjust the fit easily from a bit loose to an overall tighter fit without uncomfortable binding areas like I get when I lace up running shoes too fast. I got them in black and after wearing them regularly for over a month they are still in good enough shape that I could probably return them (which I obviously don't plan to do) even though I'm usually very hard on my shoes.Sizing: I usually wear a size 6 extra wide or a 6 1/2 medium and my running shoes usually split at the sides of the toe box if I wait to long to replace them. Based on the reviews I got a 7. It felt fine in the toe box, actually a little tight around the arch but that went away (I guess there is some give, which I would not expect from the synthetic materials) and maybe a little roomier than I would like in the heel. If you have normal feet you should probably get this half a size up and wide feet get it a full size up.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09788009", "1": "0.33130848", "2": "0.23343472", "3": "0.12546524", "4": "0.09556119", "5": "0.08909465", "6": "0.027255658"}}
