{"text": "I ordered these after getting two pairs of 559s to replace some 4 year old 559s and finding that the new 559s are way tighter than the originals, especially in the thighs.So I ordered the 569s and they are a perfect fit, thank god!  The fabric is slightly thinner/lighter than the old 559s though, so I took off one star.  Though I suppose the thinness means that in the summer they should be more comfortable.I have beefy thighs from decades of weight-lifting, and muscular but small/narrow hips and waist.  With the new 559s, I could barely raise my knee to pelvis height; with these 569s I can do a front kick to chin level without a problem!  And they don't have the goofy saggy-baggy \"rapper\" look, either.  That's assuming you're not some bony hipster type.UPDATE 1/30: I have noticed that these jeans are strangely elastic around the waist, such that I actually need to wear a belt...kind of strange, but not really a dealbreaker or anything.  Overall am still quite happy with them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.24937566", "1": "0.10106141", "2": "0.16865233", "3": "0.18744107", "4": "0.10441135", "5": "0.043881807", "6": "0.14517637"}}
