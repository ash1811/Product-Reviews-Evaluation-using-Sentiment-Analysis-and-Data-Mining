{"text": "The dress itself is decent, especially for the price. If it had fit I definitely would have been very pleased. Unfortunately the sizing is ridiculously off. I normally wear a 4-6 and ordered the Medium (8-10) since most reviews warned that it runs small. I figured even if it were loose that'd be fine bc that kind of goes with the flapper style anyway. I could barely get it past my chest and the hips were not gonna happen. Honestly, I'm not that curvy so this was a shock. Sadly, I had to return. I wish they had more accurate sizing bc now I'm too hesitant to buy any of the California Costumes items.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17912608", "1": "0.24381638", "2": "0.06943614", "3": "0.13315023", "4": "0.12886097", "5": "0.15994066", "6": "0.08566955"}}
