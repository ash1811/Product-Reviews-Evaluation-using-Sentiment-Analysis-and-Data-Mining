{"text": "This watch is a long time best purchase.  Worn for everyday and also out in the field- durable and very comfortable.  Matter a fact this time I ordered two just to have a spare!  Used for an alarm clock and easy to read numbers.  Now a days, the data bank feature isn't used as much as it was in the day but always a good feature to have at your finger tips!  wow- enjoy.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12675352", "1": "0.2597817", "2": "0.06337482", "3": "0.1075835", "4": "0.37161368", "6": "0.06712081"}}
