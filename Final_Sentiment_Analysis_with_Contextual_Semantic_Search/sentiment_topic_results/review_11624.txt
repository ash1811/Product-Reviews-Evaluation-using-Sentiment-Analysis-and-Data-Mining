{"text": "The fit wasn't great. I mean the waist section was spot on, but everything from there down was horrible.It was super tight around the thighs, but then as it got to the knees it loosened up and it looked like a pouch around the knees, and then tightens up again at the end of the calf muscle becoming choking-like tight around the ankle.If that's how a skinny pants should fit, then this was definitely my first and last. I've seen it on friends, and it fits well, and i'm not large, in-fact my legs are muscular and toned, but this just made me look like a clown.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09113946", "1": "0.29810616", "2": "0.07231168", "3": "0.13373682", "4": "0.056635547", "5": "0.15566106", "6": "0.1924093"}}
