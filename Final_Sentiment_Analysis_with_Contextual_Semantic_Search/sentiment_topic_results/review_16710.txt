{"text": "I bought a pair of these a couple of years ago and loved them. They don't last like real leather does, but that's the price you pay for vegan shoes, and they were such a reasonable price that I feel I got more than my money's worth in compliments when I wore them!I was delighted to find these in my size, on sale on Amazon and snapped them up. I'll still wear the old ones for slogging around the park with the dogs, and wear these when I go out.They are very comfortable. I bought them in 10M - my size is 9.5M but that's a hard size to find in any shoe, and size 10 works perfectly with this boot. I could jog in them if I was so inclined! And they're sexy - badass without being too \"butch\"!I definitely recommend these boots. If they're still around in a couple years, I'll probably buy yet another pair!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.090322584", "1": "0.12978941", "2": "0.08052676", "3": "0.241177", "4": "0.15376231", "5": "0.19370237", "6": "0.110719554"}}
