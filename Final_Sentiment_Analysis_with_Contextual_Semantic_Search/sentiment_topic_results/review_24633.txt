{"text": "My daughter has the short sleeved cotton version of this, which she loves.  This long sleeve leotard is not nearly as nice as that one.  The material is polyester, thinner, and it puckers along the lower back hem.  Sine there were no other long sleeve options I could find in light blue, I kept it.  My daughter is a slim 5, and it fit well, other than the puckering around the leg.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1861091", "1": "0.3869024", "2": "0.049425714", "3": "0.14666115", "4": "0.11625709", "5": "0.070271716", "6": "0.04437288"}}
