{"text": "Watch is just like it looks on the screen. However, I don't know where the measurement thing came from. It actually measures 37mm from the winding dial edge to the opposite edge. Smaller than I wanted. I bought this as a gift for my daughter so the band is too big. I knew this upon purchase. The flex band was not very difficult to adjust. However, I did have a jewelry needle nose plyer in the house. I didn't like that as careful as I tried, it still left an indentation on the edges. The '3-position crown' is not easy to adjust. I was scared it might damage it if I pulled too hard. I've had timexs before and yeah it takes a licking but keeps on ticking. It's much easier if the right instructions are in the package. Only takes half an hour to adjust the time. Where is the middle position???", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13259885", "1": "0.12910435", "2": "0.16022173", "3": "0.1437489", "4": "0.04039832", "5": "0.1267928", "6": "0.26713502"}}
