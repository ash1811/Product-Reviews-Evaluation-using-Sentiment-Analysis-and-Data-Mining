{"text": "These may not be for the fashion set but if you want leg Warner's that are soft, comfy, won't fall down & really keep your calves & ankles warm these are the ticket. They are stretchy enough to wear over jeans , tights, or activewear but also on bare legs. If your heels get cold you can slide them down to cover them or if wearing socks you can pull them higher to cover your knees. These are comfy enough to wear to sleep in.I get \"hot flashes\" & then get cold afterwards. I can quickly put them on or strip them off ;)I just ordered several more pair for gifts for my 90 year old mother (these will be very easy for her arthritic hands to put on) and my super skinny, always freezing sister.My only complaints are that they will snag, so be careful!  & they are not long enough to pill up above my knees & ankles at the same time; I'm 5 ft.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10627004", "1": "0.15576729", "2": "0.1069175", "3": "0.31673193", "4": "0.14741635", "5": "0.16450748"}}
