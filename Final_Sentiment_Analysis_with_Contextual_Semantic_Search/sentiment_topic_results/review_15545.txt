{"text": "Ok, maybe I'm the only one surprised at this...in trousers & jeans I am a solid size 10 so there was NO WAY I would ever consider ordering a small unless the pants were unisex. These guys are long & loose, and I feel quite slovenly wearing them. In fact I feel so sloppy wearing them that I've begun to over-accessorize (just what the hospital needs, one more over-accessorized Italian girl) & am considering upgrading my gymshoes to a clog with a heel to just look more professional. If they were anything but scrub pants I would have probably taken them to the tailor to get sorted out....but they have a drawstring, for goodness sake....maybe Dickies are just not for me as my experience with the scrub tops was just as meh.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20641069", "1": "0.16539152", "2": "0.13381962", "3": "0.14203852", "4": "0.09876174", "5": "0.022844221", "6": "0.23073363"}}
