{"text": "I'm not sure if I got the same hat everyone else did.  I have a couple of Carhartt heavy cotton unlined jackets which I love, but this Carhartt hat in Navy is fairly thin stretchy fabric, and is not warm in temps below 35, and does not keep the cold wind out.  Even though it is acrylic, it's a bit scratchy, not very soft. It is sized well enough to cover the ears with the bottom folded double, but even that is not enough to keep the wind out or keep my ears warm in colder weather.  I bought a better hat, made of soft wool, for about the same money here on Amazon which I rated 4 stars: \"All Wool Genuine Government Issue Watch Cap\" ... maybe this hat is better suited for warmer temps, but I don't think it's even as good as the acrylic watch caps I have bought at K-Mart.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.22563493", "2": "0.16279477", "3": "0.2431372", "4": "0.051297124", "5": "0.13394006", "6": "0.18095769"}}
