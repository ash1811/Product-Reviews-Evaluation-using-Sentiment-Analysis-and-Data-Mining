{"text": "I'm glad I checked the other reviews for how this fits. I was able to find someone close to my size and order the same as they did. Worked perfectly! So, for anyone else: I am 5'7&#34; and 118lbs and the Medium is perfect. The sleeves are nice and long. The neckline has a beautifully curved cut which conceals bra straps and feels secure on the shoulders, no slipping. But it's not super modest either, just right. The torso length is perfect and there is a lot of stretch in the fabric. Nice dense black fabric with some hold to it. You feel pulled in a bit, but comfortable. The leg openings are flattering and secure, no moving or working it's way into where it shouldn't! Just perfect!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15870604", "1": "0.23245195", "2": "0.118895", "3": "0.3078468", "4": "0.10933358", "5": "0.07045395"}}
