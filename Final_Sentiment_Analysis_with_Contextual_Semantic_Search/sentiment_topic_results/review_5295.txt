{"text": "My husband hates when I wear shoes in the house, but I need padding when walking on our hard wood and tile floors or else my feet hurt. I've been through dozens of slippers and they all flatten out pretty quickly. I was shocked at how comfortable these Isotoner slippers were. They don't look or feel like they have much padding, but my feet haven't been hurting! I ordered black ones and they wear well over time (5 months so far). The best part is that they wash well and are low maintenance. I highly recommend these for comfy home living =)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.035578035", "1": "0.2225905", "2": "0.10781547", "3": "0.09210738", "4": "0.20226924", "5": "0.2035218", "6": "0.13611758"}}
