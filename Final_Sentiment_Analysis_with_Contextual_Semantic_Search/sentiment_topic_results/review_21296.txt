{"text": "I had a new pair of heels that my heel kept slipping out of the back when I walked in them, simply because they were high the slightest bit too big but not big enough to size down.  I purchased these with the hope that they would fill in the space and help my heel from slipping out.  They did fill in some space but unfortunately my heel kept slipping out of my shoe for some reason. I even used two of them per shoe, to fill in the full back of my heel top and bottom. What these are great at is preventing chaffing and rubbing.  They protect your heel well from rubbing up against the back of the shoe and creating uncomfortableness from the rubbing.  If that is what you are looking for them to do, they will work to prevent the rubbing. If you are looking for a little help at keeping your foot in your heel, these didnt work as well as I would have hoped.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17547457", "1": "0.2383138", "2": "0.10692417", "3": "0.21366373", "4": "0.031406246", "5": "0.14528571", "6": "0.0889318"}}
