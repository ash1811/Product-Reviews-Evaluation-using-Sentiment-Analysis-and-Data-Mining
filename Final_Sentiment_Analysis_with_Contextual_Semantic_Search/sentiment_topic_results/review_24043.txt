{"text": "I have a hard to fit foot and have tried several brands of low cut hiking shoes/sneaker. I returned 2 pairs of Keenlow cut hikers because nothing fit right. I finally tried the Merrell's women's low cut Moab Ventilator (in Smoke/blue). The shoes ran true to size with a nice wide and deep toe box while still comfortable in the heel. My orthotics fit in the shoe without any loss of comfort. These shoes are supportive, comfortable and good looking.They grip well whether walking in the city or on trails. I couldn't ask for more and I highly recommend them!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20384921", "1": "0.4019034", "2": "0.13627522", "3": "0.090049416", "4": "0.06882802", "5": "0.032734085", "6": "0.06636066"}}
