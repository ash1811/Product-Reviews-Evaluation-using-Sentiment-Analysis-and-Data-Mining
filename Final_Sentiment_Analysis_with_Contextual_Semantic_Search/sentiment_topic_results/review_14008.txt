{"text": "I am extremely upset with my new BM8180-03E because the second hand does not align with the marks around the dial, instead it lands in between the marks at .5 of every second.I bought this watch for the purpose of taking the pulse of my patients. I can't be bothered with trying to figure out if it was 59.5 seconds or 60.5 seconds when I started counting and then figure out if it's 14.5 or 15.5 seconds later. I am truly upset it doesn't live up to the Citizen reputation. The issues with the second hand are indicative of low quality control involved with mass-production. (see below)Other than the faulty second hand, the dial is clearly visible, and glow quite effectively in dark.(Updated review to remove comment about day/date changing at 3pm due to setting it 12hrs off.)This watch is smaller in diameter than I am accustomed to wearing and is suitable for a female.I will be returning this watch and will not purchase another Citizen watch due to the fact I need a watch that correctly aligns with the marks on the dial. I would not recommend this watch to anyone who cares about precision. Please reply if you know of a good watch for me to buy for around $100. Thanks.Citizen replied to my inquiry within moments! Here is their response/excuse:\"What you are seeing may be considered within factory specifications.  This is due to gear play, dial imprinting and position of the watch. The actual specification is for the hands to hit dead on at 12:00, but other alignment may be to one side or the other of the indice.There are a variety of factors that come into consideration when comparing hand to dial marker accuracy. While position of the watch has some affect on this, manufacturing tolerances in the various components play a greater role. There are acceptable tolerances within the gear mesh, dial imprinting/application, dial ring imprinting (and mounting position) as well as tolerances within the dial fitting to the movement itself.When all of these come into play, these tolerances can sometimes compliment each other and other times work against each other.  It is for these reasons that there are some pieces within a series that are dead on, some that hit most marks, some that hit half the marks, some that hit some of the marks, etc.It is only when you get to the very high end of the product line (aka Campanola and Exceed) that the acceptable tolerances become \"tighter\" so to speak.\"", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1913123", "1": "0.28480357", "2": "0.11300722", "3": "0.117189854", "4": "0.140121", "5": "0.06114621", "6": "0.09241986"}}
