{"text": "Full disclosure:  even though I'm a woman, men's boots almost always fit me better.  This is mostly because I have a high arch, and men's boots that are the right size have room for an arch support, but most women's boots don't.  Men's boots also have a little more room in the toe box, which I like.I was looking for a work boot for the yard, some light construction and those chores you need to do in knockaround boots.  I ordered these, the Corax and the women's Lander.These boots are a traditional, substantial, heavy work boot.  They do not have a steel toe or shank, but the thickness and stiffness of the leather will offer plenty of protection under most conditions.  The shaft laces over the ankle and will give a lot of support at times when footing is uncertain.  The boot fits true to size, for me anyway. The sole, stitching, finish and overall quality were terrific.In many ways, these were the boots I thought I was looking for, and if I was going to be wearing them every day they would probably have been the ones I kept.  The reason I didn't keep them is because I'm *not* going to wear them every day.  These boots are stiff enough to need breaking in--the kind you can only do if you're wearing them every day.  I need a pair that are comfy out of the box, since I will only wear them on the weekends.  But if you wear your boots every day, these will probably take a week or so to break in comfortably across the ball of your foot and around the ankle--the bendy places.  I wore them about an hour and they were already a bit more flexible.In case you are wondering, I surprised my self by opting for the women's boot (the Lander) as a work boot.  But even more surprising was the Corax--one of the most comfortable boots I've ever worn.  I literally did not want to take them off.  I'm keeping them as well.  (I'll review both of the other pairs.)Thanks, Caterpillar!  A few days ago I didn't even know you MADE boots.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.0901767", "1": "0.26852694", "2": "0.15526447", "3": "0.09474429", "4": "0.30140764", "5": "0.022311779", "6": "0.06756816"}}
