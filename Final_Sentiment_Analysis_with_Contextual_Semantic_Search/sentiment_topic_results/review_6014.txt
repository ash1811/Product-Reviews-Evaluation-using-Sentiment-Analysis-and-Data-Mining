{"text": "The quality of the shirt is good and what I expected.  I am 5' 9&#34; tall and 160 pounds with a 34&#34; sleeve length.  I like a bit of extra room in my shirts for freedom of movement, especially long sleeve shirts.  In a cotton shirt I usually buy a large knowing it will shrink down a bit with washing and drying.  A lot of the other reviews indicated the sizes ran a little large so I ordered a medium.A medium ran true to size and certainly was not larger than normal.  So I returned for a large and it was the perfect size for me- before washing/drying.  I removed from the dryer while still slightly damp on the heavier material sections and it still shrunk some, about 1/2 of a size.For reference, my heather gray colored shirt was made in the Domican Republic and is 90% cotton and 10% polyester.  Maybe I need to order a long and/or maybe a relaxed fit version.  But these are too expensive to experiment with sizing and I have not found any locally I could try on.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06512278", "1": "0.34273866", "2": "0.063777335", "3": "0.22700295", "4": "0.12466407", "5": "0.1743826"}}
