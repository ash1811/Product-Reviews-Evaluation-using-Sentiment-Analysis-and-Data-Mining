{"text": "I love this so much! This is really a 4.5 star becasue the shirt is not that great, but everything else makes it worth it, the coat alone is the best part. I had so much fun dressing up the first time with the kids I just cant go 4 stars on this. Again, the shirt is really flimsy, but I would get it for the coat alone at this cost! I was going to get real boots, but these shoe covers are the best shoe cover type I ever saw and I have 7 kids and have seen a lot so i just ended up using them with black shoes and they look great. Next year I probably will get real boot for the costume, but  these shoe covers are very nice.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.135488", "1": "0.10870105", "2": "0.24808517", "3": "0.040338576", "4": "0.15500578", "5": "0.31010634"}}
