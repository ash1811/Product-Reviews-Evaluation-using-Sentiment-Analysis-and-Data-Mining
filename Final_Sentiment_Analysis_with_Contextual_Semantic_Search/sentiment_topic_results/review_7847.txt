{"text": "My husband is 3x type guy that works in cold areas on ocassion.  He's purchased carhartts for more than 30 years and knows they always run small so he opted for 2 sizes bigger than normal in the insulated bibs and,as it turns out, the largest size carhartt offers.  Sadly they were still at least 2 sizes too small!  He was soooo disappointed to have to return these and purchase an brand other than carhartt.  Wish Carhartt would review their sizing and offer a bit more of the larger sizes AND more accurate sizing information.As I said... sadly, these were returned.  :(", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15906523", "1": "0.155519", "3": "0.3430406", "4": "0.14611827", "5": "0.105355896", "6": "0.08846682"}}
