{"text": "These are moderately priced and comfortable flips.  The yoga mat material is a little questionable in terms of comfort, in that it's rubbery feeling and conducive to sweating.  It's squishy, so squishy that it doesn't offer much resistance when I put my weight down to take a step.  It feels as though there should be a stronger layer under the top layer of squishy fun.Also, these run a little narrow.  I typically wear a 7 1/2 or an 8, depending on the brand, I got these in an 8 and they fit snugly.Overall, 3 stars because they aren't super expensive, seem well made and fairly durable, but the yoga mat material isn't at all absorbent and a bit too squishy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.26922435", "1": "0.38861707", "2": "0.026405422", "3": "0.13757859", "4": "0.03473635", "5": "0.056160897", "6": "0.08727731"}}
