{"text": "Took me about 3-5 days to break in good because show was tight, but after that heaven! (12M) Very comfortable, with all day wear-ability. Nice insole cushion and good sole. Can feel some rocks or gravel through soft sole but insole makes up for this and it's not a problem. Great looks too for professional or casual environment. Looks better than pictured. When I wear these out I will order another pair! Used as office she where 80% in office and 20% in field where different pavement surfaces are encountered from paved to dirt, to rocks. \"My name is Eric and I endorse this product!\" LOL", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11331384", "1": "0.23427376", "2": "0.13438207", "3": "0.17334989", "4": "0.15251884", "5": "0.06494394", "6": "0.12721767"}}
