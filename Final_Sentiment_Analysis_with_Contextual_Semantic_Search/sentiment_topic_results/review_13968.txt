{"text": "I purchased this from Amazon for about $84 recently. I was looking for a basic, grab-and-go watch that didn't need a lot of maintenance. If you have had &#34;value&#34; priced chrono-watches, you know that it can be pain to keep each hand-set synched. This is a very basic watch thus much less messing around.Pros:** Eco-Drive, it's going to run for a long while.** Fit and finish of the case is very nice.** My hands are right on each mark. No offset for me.Cons:** The green strap is complete junk. I replaced it will a black leather band.** Small... reminds me of a Timex metal field watch in size and weight.** 18mm lugs are tiny.Probably the best non-automatic basic watch out there. For men, I recommend buying a 22mm band and slicing the lug interface down to 18mm to give the watch a more substantial look and feel. Honestly, it would be nice for women as well. This isn't a thick / large watch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.065773375", "1": "0.09545451", "2": "0.19545464", "3": "0.18063667", "4": "0.21706426", "5": "0.124555595", "6": "0.12106092"}}
