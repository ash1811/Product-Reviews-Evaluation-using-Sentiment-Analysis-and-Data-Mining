{"text": "This is my 3rd pair of these shoes.  They have always lasted about 1 and 1/2 a year.  Note they are a snug fit at first.  I always place my new shoes into a shoe tree so that they stretch.  If they made half sizes i would have bought a 12 and 1/2.  I should also add that i bought the brown smooth grain leather.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.29223338", "2": "0.22220884", "3": "0.34718782", "4": "0.05543618", "6": "0.07449531"}}
