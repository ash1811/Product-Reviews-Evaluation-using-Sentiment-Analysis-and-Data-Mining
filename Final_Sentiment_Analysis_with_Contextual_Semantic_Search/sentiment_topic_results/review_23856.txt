{"text": "This is a nice shoe, I especially like the oh so comfy padded insole.  However, it runs very very small and narrow.  I usually wear 8N, but a friend suggested I order a longer size, so I order 8 1/2 N.  But the shoe was too short and too narrow in the toe.  The toe box was so tiny I could barely work my foot into it, once crammed into there, my toes were rammed up against the shoe, very tight in length and width, even with stockings instead of socks - and remember, this is a larger size for me.  Also, my heel slid up and down.  I didn't have a clue what other size would fit me, so I just sent them back , no exchange.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.112896785", "1": "0.32642543", "2": "0.10823675", "3": "0.17072123", "4": "0.19606213", "5": "0.05451873", "6": "0.031138932"}}
