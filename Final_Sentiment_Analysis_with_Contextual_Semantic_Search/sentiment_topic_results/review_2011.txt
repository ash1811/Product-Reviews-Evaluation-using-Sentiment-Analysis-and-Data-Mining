{"text": "I also have the Minnetonka sheepskin moccasins and the toe area is wider.  I prefer the fit of the moccasins. However, because of the style these slipper boots keep my ankles warm in this unusually cold winter.  And, because they are sheepskin they stretch.  So I will definitely buy these again when they wear out.  It is just really hard to find perfectly fitting slippers.  First, they only come in whole sizes.  Second, slipper clogs seem to be the hot slipper item these days and if you have steep steps good luck with those.  So all in all, while these are not perfect, they are about as good as it gets.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06296633", "1": "0.41923836", "2": "0.08351963", "3": "0.10409421", "4": "0.119605705", "6": "0.20797019"}}
