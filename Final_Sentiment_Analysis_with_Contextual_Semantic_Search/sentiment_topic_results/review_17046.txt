{"text": "I am keeping these reluctantly as the legs and thighs fit OK but won't buy any plus size pants online again given this new \"make these ladies have an hour glass figure with a thick tight elastic waist\" trend. The pants hurt around the waist if I button them up also given I have GI issues like surgical adhesions pressing on my organs. I don't need a girdle tight elastic waist pressing on them as well. I have another pair of Lees relaxed fit jeans from a year ago I will wear when I need to button up my pants in company. These are just for shopping with a coat over them or the like.But then I got creative and made two slight nicks in the waist band where the elastic is and Removed part of it. Ah no pain, I've more to do all without ruining the waistband--just a little nick that will help me cut and remove the elastic is what I needed to do. But never again will I buy plus size pants online again--I found the same girdle pain waistband on a pair of capris.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.28616348", "2": "0.10781159", "3": "0.12436769", "4": "0.054182976", "5": "0.1998832", "6": "0.22530997"}}
