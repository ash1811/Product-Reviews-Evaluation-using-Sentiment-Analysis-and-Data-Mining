{"text": "I bought these pants to replace the pants I shrunk out of so I was not sure what to expect in the fit. I had heard so many bad reviews about the Levis now that I decided to get another brand. Wrangler has aleways been a good brand so I chose them. I was very pleased when I received them that they were a great weight...not light weight denim...good strong seams and a nice zipper. The pockets are deep and like others have said the watch pocket is larger than any other pant, especially jeans, I have ever seen....the leather pocket patch is cool too. They have a nice relaxed fit and are, FYI, a long rise....so as a work pant they are top notch. All in all I am very pleased.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.101658605", "1": "0.3760703", "2": "0.28377193", "3": "0.11611157", "4": "0.04240812", "5": "0.034699064", "6": "0.04528043"}}
