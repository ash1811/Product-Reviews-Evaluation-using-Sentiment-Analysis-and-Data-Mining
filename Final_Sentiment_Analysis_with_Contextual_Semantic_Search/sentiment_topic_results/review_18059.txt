{"text": "I got this watch for school and my internships. I end up using the convenient quick-timer feature (1, 3, 5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes) often as well as the stopwatch. It's water-resistant and held up well whenever I've needed to wash my hands (which can be several times at my internship, as I work in the medical field) throughout the day. The face is easy to read and the strap IS adjustable; you just need a paperclip or small screwdriver to unlock the clasp and slide it along the strap to adjust it to your wrist size.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12335526", "1": "0.05832365", "2": "0.2590324", "3": "0.09513518", "4": "0.25317258", "5": "0.0551918", "6": "0.15578915"}}
