{"text": "I purchased these hiking shoes for our vacation to Banff & Jasper National Parks.  They were perfect for our family excursions into the \"wild\".  The hikes we took were not on very rough trails, so I can't vouch for their quality on long, strenuous hikes.  They were, however, very comfortable and surprisingly light.  The tread is strong enough to climb and hike over rocky terrain.  Now that we have been back from our vacation for a few weeks, I choose to wear them around town because I like the way they look and because they are comfortable.  For those who may be concerned about how they fit with custom orthotics, I can tell you that they are roomy enough for my orthotic inserts.  The insole that comes with the shoe is removable, which makes using inserts even easier.  Even without my inserts, they are comfortable and offer decent arch support.  I find I can wear them for a long time without the need for my inserts.  I ordered the shoe a half size larger than my normal size, which works well for me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21640496", "1": "0.2528914", "2": "0.21607485", "3": "0.10458141", "5": "0.09978518", "6": "0.10760941"}}
