{"text": "I like the fact that they're both drawstring and elastic. The material is not particularly soft, but it's comfortable. Especially if you have to run around in them all day. In terms of different scrub brands, this is my second favorite (Grey's being the first, mostly due to how soft the fabric is). I'm 5'7 and the regular length is perfect for me. Size wise, I think if you're an average woman, a medium is good, if you're slim, definitely go for a small (as there's a lot of room for expansion) and if you're a size 14 and above go for large.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05813335", "1": "0.30339327", "3": "0.3255258", "4": "0.0939503", "5": "0.13348821", "6": "0.08281063"}}
