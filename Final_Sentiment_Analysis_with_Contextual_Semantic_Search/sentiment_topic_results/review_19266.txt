{"text": "I know very little about watches, but I received this one by Fed Ex today through Amazon.  It's a VERY sexy piece!  The two tone band coupled with the rich blue face also make it very versatile with different attire as your \"metals\" will always have a match.  The rich blue face seems to change shades depending on lighting at times taking on a deep purple-ish look.  The somewhat sleekish design sits well on smaller wrists.  As far as I can tell so far It's keeping perfect time.  I'm not crazy about the sight bubble over the date window.  It's a raised bubble on the glass that rounds out the number(s) like a fisheye effect making somewhat difficult to read, at least for me.  This is why I only gave it a 4.  I see the Grand Diver has a much better date window.I took it to get a couple links taken out of the band.  The jeweler couldn't believe this watch was only a hundred bucks.  He thought it was at least 200 to 300.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13626476", "1": "0.088022895", "2": "0.18596256", "3": "0.26378518", "4": "0.13151425", "5": "0.06348065", "6": "0.13096969"}}
