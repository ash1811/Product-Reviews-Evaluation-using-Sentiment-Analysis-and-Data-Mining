{"text": "I've used this sandals for like 5 days now, the reef logos in the back end of the sandal are already fading and looking really bad, like the sandal had like months of use.Also i ordered the black ones and they are getting to look like white dirt or something on the foam bed. I thought they would be more comfortable but not what i expected. This added to the fading logos make the sandal look like at least 1 year old.I should return these, im thinking. For the price, i definately got ripped off. I bought Adidas sandals in the past for the same price i got these, i still have them since Dec 2007 and wore them until i got these and they still look VERY good but i just thought it would be a good time to buy new sandals, either i was wrong or chose the wrong brand. =(  Buyer beware.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.36859718", "2": "0.16438827", "3": "0.16393615", "5": "0.21287607", "6": "0.08609895"}}
