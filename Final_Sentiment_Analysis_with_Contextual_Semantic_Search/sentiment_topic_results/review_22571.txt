{"text": "I have ordered this product several times through Amazon, but am not sure if they all came from the same vendor.  I use these earrings to deconstruct and make original unique jewelry.  All I need is the logo.  This order came well packaged and in good shape.  It came within the time frame that was stated.  The color is excellent and they are very durable.  I would not hesitate to recommend this vendor to a friend.  I am sure that I will reorder this product in the future.  You can always count on Amazon.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11971388", "1": "0.249362", "2": "0.12928328", "4": "0.23641981", "5": "0.18485054", "6": "0.07709802"}}
