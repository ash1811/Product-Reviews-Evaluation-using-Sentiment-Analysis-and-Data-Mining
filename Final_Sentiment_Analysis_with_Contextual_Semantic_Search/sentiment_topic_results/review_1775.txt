{"text": "I have a lot of pairs of running shoes, and these are a nice addition to my collection. To me, they feel like a more casual shoe, than a pure running shoe, so I wear them to the gym when I'm going to loft. I use my Ascics or Pumas to run in.Shoe is well constructed and looks great. Size may run a fraction small. I wear a ten and a half,but probably should have got an eleven.A really nice shoe that is well worth the money.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.29720113", "2": "0.1840721", "3": "0.25977135", "5": "0.15532072", "6": "0.09752276"}}
