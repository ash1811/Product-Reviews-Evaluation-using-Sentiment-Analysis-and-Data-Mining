{"text": "My son is enjoying this pistol quite a bit.  It's fairly heavy and seems well made.  My only negative comment at this point is that the ring caps are difficult to remove once they've been shot.  They seem to get stuck and we need to use a sharp, pointed object every time we remove the ring of caps.  The cap rings sure were overpriced!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07748763", "1": "0.23806152", "2": "0.15180561", "3": "0.11206587", "4": "0.1899684", "5": "0.12089759", "6": "0.109713346"}}
