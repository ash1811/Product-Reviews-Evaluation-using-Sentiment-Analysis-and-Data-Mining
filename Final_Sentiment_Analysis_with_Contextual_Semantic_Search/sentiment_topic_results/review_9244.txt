{"text": "I purchased my first pair of these slippers about two weeks ago. When I tried them on I discovered they were too small for me. I believe these slippers tend to run smaller than normal. I returned my first pair and ordered a second pair one size larger and wider than I normally wear. The second pair fit me great. I received a prompt refund on the pair I returned including the cost of shipping. I definitely recommend these slippers if you want something comfy. They have a crepe like soul so one can walk outside in them with no worries.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.032705247", "1": "0.39780033", "3": "0.233566", "4": "0.14752208", "5": "0.060870834", "6": "0.12492637"}}
