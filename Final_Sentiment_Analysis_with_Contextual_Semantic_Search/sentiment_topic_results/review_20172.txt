{"text": "This was great.  Although it wasn't as good as the Eagle Creek wheeled backpack I really wanted, the price was so much more affordable that I chose to purchase it.  It worked great.  I really liked the detachable backpack feature, because when each section is packed to full capacity, it becomes too large to fit in crowded overhead compartments of planes.  At that point, we just unzipped the backpack and were able to easily fit the separated pieces in.  Also, in the backpack section, I packed items that I wanted access to, like my laptop cord and basic toiletries, so I could keep the small section with me and store the large section overhead containing my clothes.In comparing it to the Eagle Creek backpack for $300, here is what was lacking:1.  This one was a tiny bit smaller and a tiny bit heavier2.  This one lacked a sternum and waist strap for when you wanted to use it as a backpack, making you carry the whole weight on just your shoulders.3.  This one didn't have a laptop sleeve.4.  This one had all the backpack pockets facing outward when on your back, so if anyone wanted to pickpocket you, they could simply stand behind you and unzip the pockets right in front of them, and I think you'd have a hard time feeling that.  The Eagle Creek backpack pockets lie against your back with nothing facing outward.  Smart.But to save $200 I opted for this one, and it was good enough...not excellent but good enough.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2255392", "1": "0.20200936", "2": "0.21393251", "4": "0.16800845", "5": "0.07562614", "6": "0.11274157"}}
