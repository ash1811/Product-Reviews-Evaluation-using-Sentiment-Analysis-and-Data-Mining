{"text": "If you need a simple,elegant looking watch for about $10 ,this is it...It is a CASIO and would last a long time.[I have used several Casio watches before and I know about their quality and reliability...should serve for two years with the battery inside;No frills and additional features like alarm or timer or stop watch;no backlighting or LED lamps as in other Casios; no date and day either...simple watch with a center second---note that this is analog...so looks well on your wrist ,like a classic design watch; perfect for students and out door guys for tough work...cant lose much;I agree with several reviewers that the band is flimsy---if you like replace with better ones---Have always one or two of these watches for every day tough use...it is water resistant which means hand washing and splashes on the watch will not affect the performance....use it wisely at this price point and you will have a good opinion of Casio watches and would buy more of such watches at low cost...this watch even boasts of &#34;Japan movement'---only 'cased' or assembled in China , I presume with automated tools.Highly recommended!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.10984557", "2": "0.34950978", "4": "0.1584395", "5": "0.20346059", "6": "0.17470111"}}
