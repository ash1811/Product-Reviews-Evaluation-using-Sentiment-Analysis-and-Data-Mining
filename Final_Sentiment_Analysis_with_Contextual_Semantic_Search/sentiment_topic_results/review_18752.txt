{"text": "You get what you paid for.  I wanted a couple of light sabers to duel with so I ordered two.  I was disappointed with their cheapness but for $10 I can't expect it to be too sturdy.  My husband ended up getting me a couple of new sabers that were 3 times as expensive but are so much better.  Now I'm not too worried about dueling with these and having them break but don't order this if you're wanting a durable product.  You might as well shell out the money for a better product.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15610683", "1": "0.31353003", "3": "0.16026945", "4": "0.121747926", "5": "0.16866851", "6": "0.076268524"}}
