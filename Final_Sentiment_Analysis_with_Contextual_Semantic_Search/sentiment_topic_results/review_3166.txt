{"text": "I only wear Levi's 550 jeans (38x34). I must have about 20 pairs so when I saw them advertised on Amazon for a great price I decided to buy 4 pairs. Well when they arrived I was just going to put them away until I planned to wear them. My wife told me to try them on and it's a good thing I did because the fit was so totally different from all my other pairs. I was really disappointed and had to return them all. I believe Levi's has either changed the cut or it's where they are being made. Nothing negative against Amazon. I order many things from Amazon and will continue to do so. Like I said, I think it's a Levi issue.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14351283", "1": "0.27766547", "2": "0.084008805", "3": "0.2221098", "4": "0.15030615", "6": "0.11982984"}}
