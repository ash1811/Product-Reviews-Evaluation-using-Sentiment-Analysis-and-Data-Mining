{"text": "I bought these to use as motorcycle pants. They are comfortable and offer some protection. I recently went on a bike trip through New Mexico. The temps reached the high 90's in spots and these pants were pretty warm. I also notice they are pretty heavy, but I am a big guy at 6'4&#34; & 260lbs, so my nts coain a lot of material. But comfort is important on long rides and I love the way Carhartt fits and they have that extra gusset of material in the crotch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09753844", "1": "0.2850782", "2": "0.090481654", "3": "0.09869894", "4": "0.23931308", "6": "0.1857659"}}
