{"text": "After searching around and doing a little research, I found out when Camp Dry changed the packaging they made the new fabric protector with a Blue top.  This is the same formula as my favorite of all time the RED Top...It is the best (I have tried them all) waterproofer for anything that is fabric, it is also to my knowledge the only one approved for re waterproofing your Gore Tex jackets.Almost all waterproof fabrics will lose the coating through washing and getting wet, so you can do two things with this product:Waterproof something that is not very waterproof  (Flannel shirt, cotton, fleece hat, cotton gloves,)OR add more Waterproof to something (Jacket, Tent, Unbrella, Shoes,)The OLD BLACK top cans are now Green they are best for Boots and heavier stuff like canvasKiwi Camp Dry, Heavy Duty Water Repellent, 12ozI hope you find this helpful, comment with any questions...", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12040211", "1": "0.14207624", "2": "0.19326147", "3": "0.2166549", "4": "0.19828762", "5": "0.08436347", "6": "0.044954203"}}
