{"text": "I'm a college professor, and am on my feet for hours at a time.  I've found that Jambu shoes, along with their related J-41 brand, are the best for me.  They're cute, and so very comfortable.  I can lecture for hours, run all over campus, and then still go out in these.  Most of my Jambu's have more of the platform design, and I really love that these have more of a heel.  I usually wear an 8.5 in Jambu, and these fit exactly right.  I can't recommend this brand enough!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.4148817", "2": "0.10345152", "3": "0.21508598", "4": "0.15262745", "5": "0.07837084", "6": "0.03230335"}}
