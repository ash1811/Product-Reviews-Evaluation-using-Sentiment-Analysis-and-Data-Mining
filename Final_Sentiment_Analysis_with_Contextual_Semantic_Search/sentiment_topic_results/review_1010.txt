{"text": "Clarks are known for comfort.  The one Clarks shoe I have is the best shoe I have ever owned.  I figured this one would be up there as well, and I needed a boot for winter.  Well, when tucked under my pant legs, the upper edge of the boot really digs at my skin when walking.  The leather is not what you would call soft.  It hurts!  If I walked a lot I am sure my leg would have chaffing!  Not sure what I'm going to do about this--hopefully I can break them in.  Aside from this aspect, it is a comfortable shoe.  I wish it used softer, more supple leather though.  Especially at this price point.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09143076", "1": "0.26631522", "2": "0.3226903", "3": "0.060002852", "4": "0.10433335", "5": "0.0869377", "6": "0.06828977"}}
