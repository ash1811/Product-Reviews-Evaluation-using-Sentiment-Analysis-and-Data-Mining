{"text": "I work 3rd shift outside year round so I need a watch that can and will stand up to abuse. For starters the velcro band is very comfortable and sturdy. The watch is so light that you will forget you're wearing it. The display is fairly large and easy to read. Not to mention that the greenish background makes it easy to read even in sunlight.  The only  thing I'm not enjoying anout the watch is the plastic case, but hey if anything happens I won't be upset like I would if it were my Citizen...Anyway buy this watch, you won't regret it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09002353", "1": "0.25630233", "2": "0.21733867", "3": "0.2670653", "4": "0.08210759", "6": "0.0844107"}}
