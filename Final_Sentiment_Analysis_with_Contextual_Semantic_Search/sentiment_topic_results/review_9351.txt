{"text": "So we buried this chest, and a few smaller gold sacks, in the back yard for our son's third birthday and gave treasure maps to all the kids.  Of course our boy had the map that led to the main treasure chest.  After a severely dug up yard (but great for bulb planting), he hit the motherload chest.  It's not huge, but definitely feels that it's made of wood and heavy enough for a three year old to seem real.  Add a few bags of fake dubloons and it was a memorable event.  Even after six months, he still talks about the day he found treasure in the backyarrrd.Great pirate chest.  Add some extra dubloons which you can get on Amazon for cheap.  Your kids will love it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.032275848", "1": "0.16682167", "2": "0.024075732", "3": "0.3212483", "4": "0.26569098", "5": "0.12412356", "6": "0.06576389"}}
