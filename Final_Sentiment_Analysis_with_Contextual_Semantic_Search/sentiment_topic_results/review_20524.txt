{"text": "I looked for a long time for a 'starter' watch for my daughter.  I thought this was the best of what I could find.  First the pros:  the numbers are large, the second hand is a butterfly, and it lights up.  Cons:  the wrist band is adjustable which really means that it is never tight enough and slides around a lot.  I was hoping she would want to wear it every day, but she really doesn't like that it's not secure on her wrist.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.16247955", "2": "0.12523393", "3": "0.24130292", "4": "0.06738015", "5": "0.2954", "6": "0.10478598"}}
