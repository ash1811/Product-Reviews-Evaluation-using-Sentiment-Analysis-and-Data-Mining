{"text": "Is it made of leather and exotic wood?  No.Is it programmable?  No.Does it cost $450?  No.I've only owned mine for a week or so now, but this thing is great.  Of course it won't compare the high end models that sell for more than 10x what this costs, but what it will do is keep your automatic watches wound.  It has a clockwise/counterclockwise switch and an on-off switch.  It runs 1 hour, then shuts down for 3.  The watch holders have spring loaded backs to adjust to different size bands, even fits my deployant clasp watch perfectly fine.  And it's quiet, really quiet.  Overall, an amazing buy for $30.  I'll likely buy a 2nd one as soon as I need it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07589805", "1": "0.15844654", "2": "0.24151678", "3": "0.12817658", "4": "0.15355714", "5": "0.14054483", "6": "0.101860076"}}
