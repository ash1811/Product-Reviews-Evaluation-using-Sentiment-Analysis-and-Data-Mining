{"text": "I really like these shoes. I'm taking them on vacation and plan to wear them alot. I do agree that they run just a bit large without sox, but I don't know if a half size smaller would have been too small so I'm keeping them. I've been wearing them a lot and they are pretty comfy. Would like to try on a half size smaller only to check the fit. I looked at some other well known brands styled like this one, but they were twice the price. Would definitely buy again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.103369236", "1": "0.25461963", "2": "0.092049316", "3": "0.4439582", "5": "0.10038178"}}
