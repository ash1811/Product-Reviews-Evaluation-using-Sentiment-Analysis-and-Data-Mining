{"text": "I have two of these and would definitely buy more.  This is the most comfortable bra I have worn in a while.  I am full busted and find this bra to provide great support yet be lightweight.  And it is pretty which is always a plus.  It fits true to size, the back doesn't ride up, it launders well and I have it in both white and black.  Would buy Ivory and other colors too.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06686659", "1": "0.38432637", "2": "0.03542548", "3": "0.30231622", "4": "0.0528902", "5": "0.055059228", "6": "0.103115916"}}
