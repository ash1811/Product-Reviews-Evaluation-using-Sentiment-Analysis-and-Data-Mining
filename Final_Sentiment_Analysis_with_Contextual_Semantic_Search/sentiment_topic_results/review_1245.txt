{"text": "I purchased these shoes because I have neuropathy in my feet. I imagined that the innersole having the rubbber spikes would be good for blood circulation. I was wrong, they were terribly painful. I was going to give them to my daughter who loves sandals and she gave them back to me saying they were too painful. I then asked my granddaughter who is 11 to try them and she had the same problem. All along I thought it was me. Others in the reviews raved about them. Sorry I couldn't join your praise.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16476266", "1": "0.09007409", "2": "0.1319452", "3": "0.096247494", "4": "0.14131418", "5": "0.243202", "6": "0.13245438"}}
