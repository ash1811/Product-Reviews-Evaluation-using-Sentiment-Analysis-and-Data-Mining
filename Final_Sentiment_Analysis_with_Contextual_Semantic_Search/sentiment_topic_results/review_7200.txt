{"text": "These are my 2nd pair of Bates side-zip Ultra-Lites. My 1st pair are the black ones. Both are the same shoe except for color. However, the laces on these are thinner & barely long enough compared to the black ones. That's why 4 instead of 5 stars. These boots are comfortable, right out of the box. A lot of boots I get,I have to get Wide to fit but 10.5 M fits me fine. My black ones & these Sage ones both fit exactly the same.I wasn't sure exactly what color \"Sage\" was.I wanted these to wear camping. The black shows the dust so bad. I would describe these as sort of Gray with just a slight hint of tan. They look a lot closer to gray than the picture. I guess \"Sage\" IS pretty close. I live in the Mojave desert & they're close to the color of a lot of the brush around here.You probably won't be able to put them on & off using just the zipper. I have to loosen the laces. but, rather than tie them, I just use a couple of those spring\"Clippy\" things like on jacket cords, Etc. Works great.I'm not too sure on durability on these things. So far, so good on this pair. After about a year & a half, the left sole separated on my black pair. I glued it back with \"Shoe-Goo\" & it's doing fine. I was surprised that it was the LEFT one because I'm somewhat crippled & my right leg does most of the work.I wear one or the other pair all the time because, with regular shoes, I need a brace. These give me enough support that I don't need it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.089176886", "1": "0.30908233", "2": "0.33280748", "3": "0.092502646", "4": "0.09910915", "5": "0.0569603", "6": "0.02036122"}}
