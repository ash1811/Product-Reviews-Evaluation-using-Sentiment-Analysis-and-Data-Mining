{"text": "I ordered these boots after reading multiple positive reviews. First to mention is that I have been an avid Red Wings wearer for many years and for me to stray from my comfort zone was a risk. That being said my choices really were limited as I am a firm believer in buying made in USA products. So many of our products today made overseas readily available. I work in the American automotive industry, and on my feet all day. Safety work boots that I can count on for protection along with long last durability is what I look for. I found them with these. Everything about these boots are great. I put them on and instantly felt the comfort. I fell in love immediatly with them. Anyone that would be in the market for a nice pair of leather safety boots I would stop shopping and lay your money down here with these. You will not regret it. Spend your money where you make it, in the USA.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04236665", "1": "0.19577937", "2": "0.19844936", "4": "0.2257932", "5": "0.14954874", "6": "0.18574354"}}
