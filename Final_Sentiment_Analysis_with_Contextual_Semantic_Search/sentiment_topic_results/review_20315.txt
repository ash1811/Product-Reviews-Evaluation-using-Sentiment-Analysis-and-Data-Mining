{"text": "So far, I love these boots. They are very comfortable, I have worn them on two hikes to break them in, but didn't really need to. So far no rubbing or blisters. They offer good ankle support and offer good overall stability while still being flexible. I can lace them up tight so I get adequate ankle support but there is still room in the toe box for my toes to move around. I have one foot that is wider than the other, these are perfect because I can control how tightly to lace them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13318335", "1": "0.33903107", "2": "0.037058845", "3": "0.18336342", "4": "0.08305847", "5": "0.08961425", "6": "0.1346906"}}
