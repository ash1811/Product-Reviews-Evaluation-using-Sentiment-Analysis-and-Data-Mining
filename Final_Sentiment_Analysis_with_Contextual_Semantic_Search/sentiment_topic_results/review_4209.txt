{"text": "I always wear an extra large, but after reading the reviews, purchased a 2xl. After a couple of washes, it fits well but a bit baggy. If you line dry these or shake them well before you dry on low heat, they are fine and close to true size.  The 2-2xl's I bought are hanging in the closet as maybe a backup. The black fades nicely after several washes. If you are a borderline XL..on he lower side..they will work great.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.33902898", "2": "0.17637908", "3": "0.15971135", "4": "0.08270176", "5": "0.16425614", "6": "0.07459258"}}
