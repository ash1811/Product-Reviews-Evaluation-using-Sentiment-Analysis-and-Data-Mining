{"text": "I've used these in the past, just a  different brand. I purchased these based on the price & they work well. When you need to put these away, don't throw away the thin papers that cover these. The only complaint which isn't a big deal, is the other brand that I purchased in the past which was more expensive had a hard plastic container to keep them in. These are still a good product, well priced & would highly recommend to anyone!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.111291096", "1": "0.360077", "2": "0.06963181", "3": "0.19940722", "4": "0.095157884", "5": "0.12478982", "6": "0.03964521"}}
