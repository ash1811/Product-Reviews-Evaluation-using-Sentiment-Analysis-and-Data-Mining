{"text": "This is my first pair of UGGs.  I've always wondered what the big deal is about UGG shoes.  Well, now I know.  These slippers are perfectly comfortable.  Not too hot and not too cold.  Usually I just wear socks because most slippers are simply too hot for me.  They arrived quickly and well packaged.  Yes, they are expensive.  You get what you pay for.  They felt quite snug when they arrived, but having read the previous reviews, I expected that.  Within a week or two, the fleece matts down and they fit perfectly.  I expect these slippers to last a long, long time.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09671419", "1": "0.3025713", "2": "0.08732983", "3": "0.1669256", "4": "0.049758263", "5": "0.16156921", "6": "0.13513163"}}
