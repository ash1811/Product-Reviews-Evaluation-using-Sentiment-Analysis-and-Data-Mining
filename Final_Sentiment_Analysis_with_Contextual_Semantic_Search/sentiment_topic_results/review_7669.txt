{"text": "I was originally looking at the Sandstone Sierra Jacket but after trying on the Sandstone Active Jacket at a local store, I realized that the active jacket is more suited to getting in and out of a car... less \"jacket\" in the arms and waist. Both are very comfortable and warm. The hood serves as a scarf and as a hat when I get caught in the rain, sleet or snow. I am 6'1\" and approx 200lbs, the large fits me well, comfortable with some room for layering when needed. Frontier brown is a good shade - not brassy but not flat. I really like this jacket.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11583554", "1": "0.26999402", "2": "0.26041636", "3": "0.07448022", "4": "0.103313394", "5": "0.114332356", "6": "0.061628107"}}
