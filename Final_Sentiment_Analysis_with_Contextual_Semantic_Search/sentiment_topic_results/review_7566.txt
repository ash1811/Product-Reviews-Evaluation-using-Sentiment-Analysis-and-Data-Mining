{"text": "I like the quality of the material and the weight. Overall the tailoring is first rate but the cuffs are much too small. Even on the outer button there is not enough room for me to check the time on my wrist watch without unbuttoning the cuff. Somewhat like the Italian bicycling jerseys with tiny arm holes and cut for narrow shoulders. Anyone with large wrists will not even be able to button the cuffs at all.  Too bad someone screwed up on this important detail as otherwise the shirt is great.
