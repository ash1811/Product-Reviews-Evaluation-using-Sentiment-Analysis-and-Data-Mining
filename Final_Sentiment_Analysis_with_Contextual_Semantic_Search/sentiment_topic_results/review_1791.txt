{"text": "these training pants are perfect for boys or girls. They have the little front pocket for boys and still fit snug for a girl. They are made of thick layers of cotton so if an accident occurs it is soaked up well, but they still do leak because they are made of cotton. However, if they do leak, they feel it quicker rather than they would in a diaper, so in addition to everything else, that makes them great potty training pants.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03090692", "1": "0.32701594", "2": "0.20466109", "3": "0.24985644", "4": "0.08056997", "5": "0.06934679", "6": "0.03764288"}}
