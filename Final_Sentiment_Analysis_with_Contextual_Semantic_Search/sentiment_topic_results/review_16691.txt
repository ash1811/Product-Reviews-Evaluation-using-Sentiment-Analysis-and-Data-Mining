{"text": "Reviewer By Jen, William's Wife:Okay, I didn't have the highest expectations for these shoes. I would never workout in anything besides the best athletic shoes no matter how tall or cute these might make me look. I simply wanted a tennis shoe with some height that I could wear walking about the mall or the supermarket that wouldn't look ridiculous and would be comfortable. These disappointed me immensely. They are only about an inch higher than normal athletic shoes, and while they are cute and look very nice, are made of a very stiff material that does not bend with the natural toe action. The problem is not in the sole padding but in the upper toe area, and this cannot be alleviated by adding foot pads. I used these to simply walk about Circuit City for a few hours and my feet were purple afterwards. I hate to leave the house in anything lower than four inch heels, and most of them are much more comfortable than these shoes. I plan to give mine to Goodwill; they are that painful.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09046782", "1": "0.18259911", "2": "0.19332935", "3": "0.14277191", "4": "0.1632604", "5": "0.1740939", "6": "0.0534775"}}
