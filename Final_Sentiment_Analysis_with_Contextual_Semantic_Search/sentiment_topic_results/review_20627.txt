{"text": "I used kiwi leather dye for years, thinking &#34;oh, it's the industry standard, so this is what I should use.&#34; Then I decided to try something new, and WOW does it make a difference!  The fiebings leather dye comes with a real applicator, which takes the mystery out of how much you're applying. Kiwi comes in a weird bottle-tube thing, and you never know how much is going to come out of the tip.  Fiebings, on the other hand, has a little brush applicator, like you would use if you were a real grownup! (Seriously, this is not for kids, though.)  It relies a bit more on the user being careful and cautious, using it with a little common sense. That being said, the dye itself seems deeper and more lustrous than Kiwi.One thing to keep in mind, though, is that before apply the dye, you want to deglaze the leather with -- yep, you guessed it:  Fiebeings leather deglazer.  The deglazer takes off the old polish so that the dye can actually soak into the leather -- otherwise, it can tend to just bead up on the polish and not soak in properly. So deglaze your leather, then apply the dye, then let that dry.  To finish up, if you want a shine on it, you can put some polish on there, too.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16890776", "1": "0.20801789", "2": "0.17158535", "3": "0.2870941", "4": "0.050234642", "5": "0.073157854", "6": "0.04100242"}}
