{"text": "Champion's High MCR bras really are the best. I've used this brand for the last 15 years, particularly their Sportshape non-wire style and their bras have always delivered. I love this style as it not only offers great support, and for an underwire bra, is very comfy as well. It feels a bit tight at first, they do use compression to support your breasts, but once it's on you'll forget you're even wearing it. Wicks sweat away and you won't even feel how drenched your are, like I get at the gym, until you take it off. Highly recommended!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09005569", "1": "0.10718087", "2": "0.12282105", "3": "0.34487054", "4": "0.117820226", "5": "0.113447234", "6": "0.10380437"}}
