{"text": "I was excited to try out these cute moccasins, as I was happy with the other styles of Minnetoka's I have owned in the past.  However, within 3 days of wearing them the lining of the soles started coming apart!! I tried to put the lining of the sole back in place, but the glue they used has became gummy and lost its adhesiveness.  I am very disappointed in this product and will think twice before purchasing another pair of Minnetonka's.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16829775", "1": "0.33503184", "3": "0.23200428", "5": "0.16601807", "6": "0.09144606"}}
