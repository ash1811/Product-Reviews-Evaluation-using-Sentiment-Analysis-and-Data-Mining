{"text": "Got this to use as a warm night shirt during the colder months.  There have already been a couple days since I got this that I found myself looking forward to changing into when I got home from work.  It's very comfortable, fits great and is warm without being hot.  The sleeves end in elastic which helps to keep the warmth in - a key point with shirts for me.For under $10 and free prime shipping I have only great things to say about this shirt, and I'm thinking about getting another 1 or 2 in different colors.  Can't really go wrong here.-D", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08008649", "1": "0.5631732", "2": "0.0734555", "3": "0.09325811", "4": "0.044929367", "6": "0.1425833"}}
