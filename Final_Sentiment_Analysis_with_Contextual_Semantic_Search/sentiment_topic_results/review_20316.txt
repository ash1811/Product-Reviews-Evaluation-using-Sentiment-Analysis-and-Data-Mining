{"text": "I initially ordered this hiking shoe in a 9  and found that I needed one half-size up. I have since received the proper size  and it fits perfectly and feels great to walk in. The toebox allows for comfortable fit for wider feet and I chose the Targhee II mid because it offers stability on uneven ground. Overall a great quality hiking shoe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18677971", "1": "0.3051954", "2": "0.1248943", "3": "0.11594154", "5": "0.09780319", "6": "0.16579297"}}
