{"text": "These are my &#34;GO-TO&#34; bras and the only ones that I've found that fit me just right.  The quality of the fabric and the construction has remained a constant in the many years that I have been buying and wearing out this particular style since I first found them at a Kohl's store.  Buying them through Amazon has saved me tons of money and headaches as I'm rarely in places where I can just go shopping.  The only problem I ever have with these bras is that the plastic underwires eventually just break.  This can take 6 months or 2 years and it doesn't seem to matter how I treat them.  I don't find this a huge problem as this just gives me a chance to try out some new colors every now and then.  I love the wide shoulders straps and the four hook back on the DDD size.  So comfortable!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.031801905", "1": "0.23685904", "2": "0.06966602", "3": "0.25670677", "4": "0.17538744", "5": "0.19235837", "6": "0.037220497"}}
