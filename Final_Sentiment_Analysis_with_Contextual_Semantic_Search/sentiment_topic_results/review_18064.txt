{"text": "I think this is my third Casio watche.  For me they last about two and a half years and are very reliable. I believe you have to send them back to the dealer to get a new battery - since they are so cheap I don't bother and get a new one.  They don't stop - the display just gets lighter and lighter until you can't read it.I usually get the black strap but this time when I saw the picture I thought this band might be the kind that stretches on and you don't have to buckle.  Wrong, but it will do.  The band is a bit clumsy to close but I am used to it now and it is fine.I only have one complaint about Casio - their documentation.  It is tiny and awkward to understand.  I am forever accidentally setting an alarm and it takes time to figure out how to stop the daily alarm!  I have gotten used to my watch just periodically beeping at me!  But if you want an inexpensive and very reliable watch, Casio is the way to go.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20218211", "1": "0.24590237", "2": "0.11960126", "3": "0.21926095", "4": "0.102486916", "6": "0.107750736"}}
