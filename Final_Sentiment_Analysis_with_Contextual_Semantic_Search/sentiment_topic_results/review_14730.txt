{"text": "I got this watch as a gift right before I entered Basic Training and I was really impressed with it. It's feather light, doesn't snag on your clothes or your gear, and the dial is super easy to read in the dark, but without being to invasive. The watch marched through basic training, through tech school, and water survival training without so much as a scratch.However, going through combat survival training in the snowy mountains of East Washington, the pin that connects the case to the band broke without me noticing, and the watch fell off my wrist, never to be seen again. Needless to say, I was pretty pissed that such a insignificant part of the watch would result in the loss of the whole thing. That's why I gave the product four stars and not five and also why I advise that if you buy one of these watches, you purchase one with the polyurethane band, that way if one pin snaps, the rest of the watch stays connected to your wrist.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22040321", "1": "0.2085274", "2": "0.20489492", "3": "0.07479877", "4": "0.1088359", "5": "0.07013325", "6": "0.11240651"}}
