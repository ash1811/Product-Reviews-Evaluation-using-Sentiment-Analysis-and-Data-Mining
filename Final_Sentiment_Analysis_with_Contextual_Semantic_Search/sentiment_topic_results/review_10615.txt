{"text": "This polyester pullover windbreaker seems to be well-made, and handy as can be when folded into its own pouch.  I love the roomy &#34;kangaroo pouch&#34; pockets.  Very similar (I had hoped) to the &#34;Turfer&#34; brand nylon pullover windbreaker I had purchased a couple of years ago from Amazon, and now isn't listed.  I keep the Turfer in my kayak, in case I need more warmth or protection from a quick rainshower - I really, REALLY love that jacket!  So much so, that I wanted another one to keep around the house.The problem with the Pack-n-Go is that the waterproofing material they use on the inside of the jacket fabric is &#34;grabby&#34;.  Instead of sliding smoothly over my clothes like the nylon Turfer - this one seems sticky (only way I can describe it).  I'll keep it for low-motion activities like hiking or running errands - but I feel like I could rip the sleeves out doing an active sport like kayaking or XC skiing?  It kind of restricts my motions.  And it's not that I ordered a size that fits snugly - the jacket is plenty roomy.It's still a darn handy jacket to have around.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14865462", "1": "0.21444955", "2": "0.19706233", "3": "0.08858942", "4": "0.2180055", "6": "0.13095656"}}
