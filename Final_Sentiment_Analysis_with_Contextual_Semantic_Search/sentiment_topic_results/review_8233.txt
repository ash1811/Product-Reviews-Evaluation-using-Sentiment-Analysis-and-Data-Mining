{"text": "I am changing my opinion on these jeans.  I actually made a comment agreeing with a bad review on the jeans.  I bought these as a gift for my husband based on a pair of jeans he already has.  When we got these the material was very thin and the waist was much lower than the original 569 and I agreed that the quaility wasn't the same and Levi's should change the # on the style if they are going to change the jeans.  HOWEVER, as an update I can tell you, now that my husband has worn these for a while they are now his FAVORITE jeans.  I still agree that Levi's should change the number on the style so you don't expect the same jeans but the product is just fine.  My husband is an oilfield electrician so he moves quite a bit and he said these pants are very comfortable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.095787115", "1": "0.053882804", "2": "0.206597", "3": "0.07401837", "4": "0.2247907", "5": "0.18878007", "6": "0.15614393"}}
