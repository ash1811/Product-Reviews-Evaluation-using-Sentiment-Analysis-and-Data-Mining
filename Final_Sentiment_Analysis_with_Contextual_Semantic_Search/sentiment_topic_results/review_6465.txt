{"text": "I have quite a few pairs of hiking socks, but this was the first time I bought a pair from Thorlo.  The heel and toe padding gives the sock a little extra cushion, and they felt great on a 5 mile walk in a pair of hiking boots.  They definitely wicked away the sweat, but are a little warmer overall then a pair of Wigwam's cool-lite hiker pros.  The fit and feel of the socks is good, and I'm going to order another pair.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1625407", "1": "0.22291207", "2": "0.071129836", "3": "0.18684916", "4": "0.06406184", "5": "0.17531167", "6": "0.11719468"}}
