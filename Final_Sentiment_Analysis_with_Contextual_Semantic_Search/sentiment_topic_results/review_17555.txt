{"text": "I grew up in the 80s with Casio watches. I had this watch as a kid. I bought it again for nostalgia and it's a good watch, but it isn't as comfortable as it should be. The band is too thick and the buttons stab the back of your hand. Other than that, it does what it needs to do, it's waterproof and......that's it. Oh, the night light isn't nearly as effective as modern indiglo watches so if nighttime viewing is important to you I would pass on this watch.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.26828605", "1": "0.118347585", "2": "0.2436921", "3": "0.07510532", "4": "0.06806808", "5": "0.113331124", "6": "0.113169745"}}
