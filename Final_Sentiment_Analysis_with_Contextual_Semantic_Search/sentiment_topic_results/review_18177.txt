{"text": "I have had the 1st generation of this watch since 1994, on it's fifth battery now.  Could not find many watch repair places with the larger tools to open it until recently.  Watches this big were not popular in the early 90's.  The crystal is indestructable.  Still getting complements.  It is weathering very well, on the third band now.  The face is extremely easy to see in most reasonable lighting conditions.  If I need a watch with a light I just don't wear it at that time.  It's not high tech.  It just works and looks good.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16045421", "1": "0.19183248", "2": "0.12483667", "3": "0.15285513", "4": "0.13895197", "5": "0.14447907", "6": "0.08659048"}}
