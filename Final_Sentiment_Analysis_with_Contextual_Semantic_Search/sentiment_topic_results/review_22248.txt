{"text": "I bought the Carhartt Biberall in the midst of the 2014 Arctic Vortex that sent temperatures here plummeting into the negatives (with windchill). After shoveling ice and snow in just denim jeans, I thought it was time to invest in a little comfort. It's always a bit dodgy ordering clothes over the internet, but I decided to take the plunge in case we get dumped on again, sooner than later. Other Carhartt items that I have are of good quality, so I felt comfortable that the Biberall would be good quality also. I was not disappointed. My first impression was that the pants were enormous. My weight fluctuates a bit so I chose a waist size equal to my belt size (i.e., a size larger) and that probably wasn't necessary. Once you're able to climb into these things and zip up the sides, there's still a good deal of room to move around in them. Also, don't be afraid (though it's by no means necessary) to get a shorter length than you would for jeans, since you'll probably be wearing these with boots anyway. Not sure what a shorter length would mean to your crotch... but I guess that depends on how long your legs are, etc. Anyway. The Biberall works great, it's very warm, looks well-constructed, and I expect to get a lot of use of it in the years (decades?) to come.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.049112387", "1": "0.3860418", "2": "0.0936278", "3": "0.082352705", "4": "0.07326167", "5": "0.19509985", "6": "0.12050381"}}
