{"text": "My son loves it-- he immediately was drawn to the skull lock and was able to turn it to open it (he is 2). The chest is very sturdy (he was standing on it) and pretty. The coins are very good quality / the embossing on them is very nicely done, as is the pouch that holds them.  The eyepatch is also good, as we'll as the flag... Would recommend to anyone looking for a treasure chest.  The coins that come with it are few, good for the pouch but if you want to fill with coins, probably will need 5 bags of the 144 count coins, or put something in the bottom to fill it before putting coins in.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08867565", "1": "0.20923696", "2": "0.09960175", "3": "0.17788742", "4": "0.07817587", "5": "0.1446002", "6": "0.20182215"}}
