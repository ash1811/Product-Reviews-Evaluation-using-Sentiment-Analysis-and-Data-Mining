{"text": "I have wide feet (E width) and they've been sensitive ever since I had plantar fasciitis a few years ago. I don't have time or energy to search a dozen shoe stores for good quality shoes in my size, so it's really wonderful to be able to order them online. The Romy shoes I received a couple of weeks ago fit perfectly and are very comfortable - no squeezing my toes, no pressure points. My feet actually don't hurt after wearing them all day, even after quite a bit of walking. I've already ordered another pair, and am going to try another Easy Spirit style.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.120740555", "1": "0.23376426", "2": "0.12293157", "3": "0.205393", "4": "0.2070386", "6": "0.10777951"}}
