{"text": "We bought this for airline travel and it was great.  Too much room for an infant seat and base, but too much room is always better than not enough.  I just stuffed the bag with extras like clothing and such.  We had a graco infant carrier.  I think this is going to fit her large convertible seat pretty well too (maxi cosi convertible seat).It's durable, sturdy fabric, well padded and zipper.  I'm very happy with the purchase.  I had no hesitations about checking my car seat into baggage claim.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08361608", "1": "0.3379165", "2": "0.1413952", "4": "0.12114785", "5": "0.20198563", "6": "0.11113065"}}
