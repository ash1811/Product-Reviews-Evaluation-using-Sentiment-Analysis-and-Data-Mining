{"text": "I bought these to wear to a rodeo event at my son's school. I am a woman, not a kid.  I usually wear a size 6 1/2 in womens dress shoes and a 7 in womens boots (I go a little larger with boots to allow for wearing socks). I bought these pink durango boots in a a youth size 6 and they fit just a tad large on me. The measurement of the boot from the tip of the toe to the end of the heel is 10 inches if that helps you with sizing at all...... I would imagine for a young girl the they would fit exponentially larger.  The boot itself is very cute. It is made well and looks nice even though it is faux leather. Mine had a few black rubs on them, but nothing that would make me want to give them up or return them. I love the color...it is just hte perfect shade of cotton candy pink. The rhinesone strap is also cute. I thought it might look a little gaudy in person but I actually like it. However, it is removable as well so if you did not like the look of the strap or just felt like not wearing it for whatever reason you can take it off.....pretty neat!! The heel is low and comfortable (I measured it and it is a 1 1/2 inches).  There is enough room in the shaft to fit my \"not quite youth sized\" calves.  Overall these are a great pair of boots that any little cowpoke (or cowpokes mama) would be thrilled to have.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06518411", "1": "0.27385467", "2": "0.050074637", "3": "0.14243923", "4": "0.14695014", "5": "0.23781031", "6": "0.08368686"}}
