{"text": "I have bought several pairs recently as Amazon knows but it seems everyone is skimping on the material! Might be fashionable--tighter fit! I prefer my woman in tighter clothing, but for me no. I remember Levi's still made in San Francisco costing @ retailer ~$4.25 @But, that said, dealing w/today--don't mind today's prices but I need to be comfortable for the money. Relaxed fit works for me--maybe not for you. I just wish they made a button-fly in relaxed fit--Awesome!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06947729", "1": "0.33165327", "3": "0.28790894", "4": "0.1405901", "5": "0.08411695", "6": "0.08326972"}}
