{"text": "I generally wear a 8 1/2 or 9 narrow shoe.  I have absolutely not been able to find sandals to fit my foot this year in any department store.  The stores that carry Bass, Clark, Naturalizer never have the narrow widths.  I ordered these sandals  in an 8 1/2 narrow.  The width is perfect.  They are just long enough.  They are very comfortable, look nice and the price is wonderful.  Think I need another pair!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.6243568", "2": "0.11319946", "3": "0.09311638", "4": "0.06720016", "6": "0.095464595"}}
