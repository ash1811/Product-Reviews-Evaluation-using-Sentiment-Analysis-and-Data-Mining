{"text": "I have had this watch for 2 years now, and although I wear it every day, all day, it still looks great! There is a little bit of wear starting to show on the back of the bracelet, although there are no black spots. The rose gold tone is beginning to wear off a bit. However, this is just around the edges of the band. This watch still looks amazing after my 2 years of abuse! The picture does it no justice. The mother of pearl in lay on the face is gorgeous, and the crystals shine brilliantly. The '12' and '6' markers are underplayed, yet beautiful. Every time I look down at it, I am pleased.It is extremely comfortable; the band is comprised of interlocking links of stainless steel, and it just sits on my wrist. I frequently forget that I'm even wearing it. It is very light weight as well.This is a great price for a watch that is retailed at about $120. I would buy it all over again in a heartbeat. Very worth the price, and I very much recommend it!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11532995", "1": "0.2833456", "2": "0.15224169", "3": "0.18132369", "4": "0.042398177", "5": "0.22309032"}}
