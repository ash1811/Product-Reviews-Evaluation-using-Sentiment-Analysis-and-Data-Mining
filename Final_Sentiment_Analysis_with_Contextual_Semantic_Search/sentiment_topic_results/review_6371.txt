{"text": "I was curious about the performance of a more expensive sock and purchased these along with some Champion and Gold Toe 6 packs. To be honest, the much less expensive Champions were more comfortable. The Thorlo were nice (by that I mean they seemed well constructed, had a reinforced heel, and were soft), but nothing to really set off any bells and whistles. Plus, they have a downside. I've worn them now on three occasions and the material is just fuzzing like crazy. They almost resemble bedroom slippers with the amount of fuzz and haloing that they display. I'm not sorry I purchased, as I bought more from curiosity than a need for a high performance sock, but I wouldn't purchase again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.036809444", "1": "0.4081492", "2": "0.062071387", "3": "0.11310215", "4": "0.044473346", "5": "0.090757415", "6": "0.24463706"}}
