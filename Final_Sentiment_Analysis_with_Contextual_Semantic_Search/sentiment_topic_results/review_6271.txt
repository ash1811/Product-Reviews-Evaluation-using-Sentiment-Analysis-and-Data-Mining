{"text": "This is a nice lightweight jacket for spring and holds up in wind and light rain.  It seems to run a bit small in length, so I bought in size large for my husband and it fits fine. Very attractive and I think it is a good value for the price when you compare it to similar jackets.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.22963402", "2": "0.22556624", "3": "0.3004775", "4": "0.055800848", "5": "0.08024915", "6": "0.103152715"}}
