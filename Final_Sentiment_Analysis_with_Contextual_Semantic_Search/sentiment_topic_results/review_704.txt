{"text": "My elderly Mom has lost much of her finger dexterity and could no longer use a watch with a buckle or clasp.  She also didn't like the look of most watches that came with a \"stretch\" band.  This was the perfect gift for her. The watch and the band are attractive and with the removal of three links, fit her perfectly.This watch would not be great for a person with poor eyesight since the dial and hands have little visual contrast.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.40782472", "1": "0.1156266", "2": "0.124074556", "3": "0.10404387", "4": "0.14141575", "6": "0.10367648"}}
