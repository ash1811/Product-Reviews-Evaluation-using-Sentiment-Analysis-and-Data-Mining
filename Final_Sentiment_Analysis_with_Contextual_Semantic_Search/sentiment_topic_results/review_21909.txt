{"text": "I wrote a rave review of these the day I got them.  They were absolutely terrific and gave me purchase doing yoga on a slippery rug.  However, the next time I wore them for a longer session, they got stretched out. My toes kept falling out of them and they became twisted around my feet and just generally got in the way.I put on a new pair for another session and when doing any lunges or poses with my legs in a wide stance, they were very uncomfortable.Oh well.  The \"concept\" is great, but they don't really work unless you're doing very little movement.  I wish someone would come up with something like this that does the job!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.25236937", "1": "0.34979266", "2": "0.08666123", "3": "0.11903129", "5": "0.0444123", "6": "0.14530338"}}
