{"text": "I bought this watch for my Mom for Christmas and she loved it! She has a very expensive watch she was having trouble with and I knew she bought a cheap watch just to have one that works. She does have a small wrist so after reading a few reviews I chose this one. It was nicely packaged and it truly is very nice looking as well as it fit my Mom's wrist..This was one of those gifts that if she didn't like it I would have kept it for myself.. Also, The price was reasonable and the shipping was prompt! Thank you...", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15601291", "1": "0.41614583", "2": "0.18776016", "4": "0.09983442", "5": "0.09491684", "6": "0.04207076"}}
