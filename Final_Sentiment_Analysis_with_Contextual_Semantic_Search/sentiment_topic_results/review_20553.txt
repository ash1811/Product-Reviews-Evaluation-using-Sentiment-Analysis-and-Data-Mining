{"text": "Birkenstock's Florida is one of my favorite sandal styles. I like the fact that it has 3 straps which securely holds my feet in place when I wear them. I ordered this pair in  nubuk which is a fairly sturdy  leather. What I didn't notice was that this pair features a soft footbed which is a departure from Birkenstock's hard yet moldable footbed.As it turned out, I actually like the soft footbed. It seems a little springier and less rigid, but it still molds to the foot as a result of  force and body weight. The sandals are very comfortable and are as supportive as their hard soled sibling.Regardless of what sole type is purchased, these Birks are durable and comfortable and they are a nice spin on the basic styles that Birkenstock is known for.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.111007035", "1": "0.2585238", "2": "0.12025793", "3": "0.1264938", "4": "0.051275253", "5": "0.19449085", "6": "0.13795131"}}
