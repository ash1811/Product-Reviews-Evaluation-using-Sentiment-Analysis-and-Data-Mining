{"text": "These have the best combination of fashion, function, fit and comfort of all of the Levi's brand jeans.  They are true to size.  They have a moderate rise. . .not too high or low.  They are relaxed but not saggy.  They have generous leg length for a tad of a slouch at the ankle, but they don't drag the ground.  Keep the 514 style GOING, Levi's!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13252397", "1": "0.13855757", "2": "0.044683572", "3": "0.22270907", "4": "0.14393824", "5": "0.047486875", "6": "0.27010074"}}
