{"text": "Arrived on schedule. Well packaged.The fabric is very stiff. I thought I could soften them up by washing several times with softener but not the case. The fabric is so stiff, that after washing I tossed it on my ironing board and it was partially standing. The peak was higher than my iron.The texture and feel of the fabric is scratchy and somewhat harsh.The sizes are way off. A medium engulfs me. They do not shrink after hot water washings.The tops have a slit up the side and appear very feminine.I have never worn Dickies before and I really regret ordering these. Since I washed them I cannot return them, so I am going to give them away.As a guy, there is nothing I like about this product.============================I gave these away. The lady that took them agreed the fabric was \"stiff and scratchy\". However, her biggest complaint was that after removing from the dryer, the amount of lint on the scrubs. She had to use 2-3 sticky roller sheets per side of the tops and bottoms to remove the lint. The scrubs are dark blue.I ordered Landau. Their products are much better suited for my needs. I can wash and dry without doing anything else. They do not look feminine and the fabric does not feel like a toe sack.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15399554", "1": "0.09422308", "2": "0.14140594", "3": "0.123757556", "4": "0.102891766", "5": "0.28170776", "6": "0.10201838"}}
