{"text": "I paid good money for these slippers and have only worn them for 6 months and the heel inside is so worn out that the fur is gone. I will never buy these slippers. When I purchased these, I thought wow, I never spend this much on slippers and now I know why, they are not worth the money. I will go back to buying cheaper slippers that last a whole lot longer, years even than these Old Friend's slippers. I feel really bad because I also purchased a pair for my sister, how embarrassing. Never again!!!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07639161", "1": "0.34078312", "4": "0.12962943", "5": "0.20198013", "6": "0.2457001"}}
