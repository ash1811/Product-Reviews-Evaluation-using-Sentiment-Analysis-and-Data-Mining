{"text": "I've always preferred analog watches but after beating up a few decent ones at work I decided to go with the Casio. Not the greatest looking timepiece but tough as nails. I find that when taking a quick glance while working I need to be more deliberate and angle the watch towards me more than when I had a high contrast analog face, especially in dim light. (it does have a light but requires a press of a button) The rubber band though durable and comfortable does trap perspiration under it. I like the \"Classic\" style compared to some of the other style G-Shock watches, though relatively large, it's not overly so.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.22383192", "2": "0.29619226", "3": "0.114588834", "4": "0.18354106", "5": "0.07709932", "6": "0.102358975"}}
