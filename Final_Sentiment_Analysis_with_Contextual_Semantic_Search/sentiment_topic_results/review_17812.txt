{"text": "I like this G Shock. I have owned several different G Shock watches over the years and they have withstood a fair amount of abuse ala working on the house and some sports. This particular model is a moderate size, looks rugged, and has a good backlight. It tracks the seconds via a LCD bar and circle that makes the face a bit mor entertaining than a regular second count.  My only complaint would be the cramped appearance of the face layout, but it is still easily readable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.29237214", "2": "0.16299061", "3": "0.2008515", "4": "0.21231359", "6": "0.12572448"}}
