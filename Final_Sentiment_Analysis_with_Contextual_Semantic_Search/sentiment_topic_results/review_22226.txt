{"text": "I hate the hood.  It rides up on my head and is uncomfortable in the car.  That said, I'm sure it will soften after a wash.  This jacket is so warm!Just an additional comment, I bought this in black and the material attracts lint and pet hair like a magnet.  I have other black jackets that don't show a speck but like I said, this material is a magnet.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09935518", "1": "0.28200597", "2": "0.36093426", "3": "0.13944295", "5": "0.10958819"}}
