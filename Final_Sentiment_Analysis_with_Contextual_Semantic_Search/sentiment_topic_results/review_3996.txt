{"text": "I bought these because of the positive reviews I read. The slippers are nice, comfortable and they seem to run true to size. My left foot is 1/2 size larger than my right foot, which often causes fit problems in footwear. No problems  with these. Shipping was fast.Amended review---The inside cushion for these slipper wore out amazingly quickly. I had to toss them several weeks ago because they were very uncomfortable. The outside still looked great.I would NOT buy these slippers again, and I would not recommend them to a friend.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.061948206", "1": "0.26417667", "2": "0.16264847", "3": "0.23715699", "4": "0.08815548", "5": "0.0479695", "6": "0.13794468"}}
