{"text": "I love these glasses! I always buy lower priced sunglasses because they seem to get broken easily but not on purpose. All the other ones I have had haven't fit as good as these do and didn't have UVA/UVB protection. I have a smaller face so I don't like to go too oversized because it makes me look really funny. These were the perfect size for me and my older brother says they look &#34;very expensive and like I'm hiding from paparazzi.&#34; Definitely recommend and I really like the color!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.39163688", "2": "0.17328115", "3": "0.2059189", "4": "0.086094074", "6": "0.13654663"}}
