The watch to die with.What more can you ask? Clearly visible black numbers on a high contrast white face. The only other things to ask are:Will shipping add fifty per cent to the cost?(could be, or more!)Will they ship to a POB or AP or overseas?(the proceed to order box will let you know and force you to provide an acceptable address)How easily may the sweaty plastic band be replaced with a more comfortable cloth woven band?(fairly easily if you can remove the original band without removing the band bars)But this is most definitely THE watch that is cheapest and most useful, far more than more refined models.
