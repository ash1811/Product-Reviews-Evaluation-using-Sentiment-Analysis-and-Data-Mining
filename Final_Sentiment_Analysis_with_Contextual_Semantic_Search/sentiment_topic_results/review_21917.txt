{"text": "I use these for Pure Barre.  I have tried gaiam sticky socks as well as the ones with the Pure Barre logo on them (not sure what brand they are?).  These toe socks are by far my favorite.  They remain sticky even after many washes and the sticky stuff hasn't worn off like it had with my Gaiam socks.  They are a little more expensive, but worth the price in my opinion.  I am a size 7, I ordered a small, and they fit fine.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03842676", "1": "0.2189474", "2": "0.13631141", "3": "0.0755428", "5": "0.1852235", "6": "0.34219694"}}
