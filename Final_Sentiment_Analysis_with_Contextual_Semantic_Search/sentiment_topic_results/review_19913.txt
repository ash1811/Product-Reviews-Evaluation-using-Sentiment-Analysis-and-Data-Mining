{"text": "I am not a plus size woman, but decided to order these since I figured they'd fit more comfortably than regular size. These fit terribly and get runs so easy! I'm only 5'1&#34; and wear size 12 in clothing, & they barely go above my knee and fit tight so they roll down. Terrible buy! So disappointed:-(", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.101235315", "1": "0.45526046", "3": "0.34445602", "5": "0.086412"}}
