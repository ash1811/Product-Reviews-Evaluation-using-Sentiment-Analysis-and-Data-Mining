{"text": "This is a fantastic bra for the price.  It is comfortable, supportive, provides lift, and the cups are nicely lined. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the cups seemed to run a bit large.  I am 5'2\" and 140lbs and am pretty consistently a 34DD.  The DD cups were too big and wrinkled when I tried the bra on, so I exchanged the bra for a 34D and I am extremely happy.  You may just want to order 1 cup size smaller than usual", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10047954", "1": "0.3683493", "2": "0.035812445", "3": "0.26311272", "4": "0.09095343", "5": "0.07608221", "6": "0.06521033"}}
