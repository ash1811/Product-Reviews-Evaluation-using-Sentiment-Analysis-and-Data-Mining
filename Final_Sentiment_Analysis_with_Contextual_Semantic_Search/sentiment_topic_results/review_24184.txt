{"text": "I ordered this sports bra online with trepidation because I have such a hard time finding sports bras in my size in brick and mortar stores. The reviews convinced me that it would be a good purchase, but it turned out to be terrible! The fabric on the band is incredibly rough and itchy, and the cups made my breasts look like they were in a 1950's cone-shaped bra. Some reviewers mentioned that they wore it as a regular bra, but it comes up so high in the front (which I wasn't expecting from the advertised picture) that I think it would show with a lot of my shirts, and I don't even wear low-cut shirts.Now I'm afraid to ever buy a sports bra online again. This time was a depressing failure.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22314471", "1": "0.19944023", "2": "0.12928855", "3": "0.25507015", "5": "0.15301424", "6": "0.03759493"}}
