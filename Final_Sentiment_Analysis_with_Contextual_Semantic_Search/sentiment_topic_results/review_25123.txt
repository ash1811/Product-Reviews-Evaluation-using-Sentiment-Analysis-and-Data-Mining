{"text": "I bought these as replacement insoles for my Ugg (Roseberry) boots.  I had worn them so much that the original insoles had worn down to nothing.  I was concerned of the fit as other reviewers had posted they didn't work with their boots, I was willing to take a chance as I missed the cozy feeling inside... I am glad I did!  They fit absolutely perfectly over my original insoles (I was unable to remove the original insoles).FYI:  I have also used Suede Renew Spray Color Moneysworth & Best to bring my boots back to life.  This product, along with my Ugg insoles have made my Ugg boots once again look and feel brand new!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07962922", "1": "0.3451685", "2": "0.1328763", "3": "0.07639327", "4": "0.19004643", "5": "0.051307023", "6": "0.12457923"}}
