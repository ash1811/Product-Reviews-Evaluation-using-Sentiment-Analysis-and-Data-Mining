{"text": "After a week, the glue has returned an old pair of workboots to serviceable condition. You'll need a pin to puncture the metal cap. The glue flows well but I would not recommend using the glue more than once. This material only stores about 3 months before going bad. This could be where everthing went south for the customer who squeezed and the tube blew out. I only used the glue to seal a loose flap on the heal. For substantial repairs, I would take it to a repairman.If this review was helpful, please add your vote.After 2 weeks of service I am giving up. The glue held at the corners but did not seal the tear in the heal completely. Next stop, shoe repairman. The heal tear was about 1/4-inch deep but filled about 2/3rds of the arc of the heal, and the glue is holding for all but the center part of the tear. Perhaps this was too much for the goo. I don't think so; I am changing my rating.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.27910277", "1": "0.23498109", "2": "0.04175045", "3": "0.21712227", "4": "0.040542815", "5": "0.12376201", "6": "0.06273857"}}
