{"text": "There must be a great variance in the colors of the chips from solid royal blue to indigo, with & without gray veining and striations. For this price the chips can't be \"hand matched\" for color, so they must be made randomly. Each batch of chips--like dye lots-- must be different from the last. The pair of earrings I received were from a royal blue batch---much bluer than the picture an almost no gray at all. And yet there is plenty of color variation to make it apparent they are natural stones and not man-made chunks of plastic. I think they are much more attractive than the picture as a result.I think my wife will be very pleased with these.(Regrettably the bracelet came from a gray batch and looks more like the picture of the earrings,  and as a result is not as good a match to the earrings as it could be. But I saw no reason to downgrade the rating on the earrings because of the bracelet; but those looking for a true \"matched\" set may want to order several, choose the best matches, and return the rest. This was not an issue on the amethyst or turquoise earrings and bracelets, all of which were great matches.)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.25829735", "1": "0.28357315", "2": "0.0622412", "3": "0.14659794", "4": "0.105791815", "5": "0.12265768", "6": "0.020840885"}}
