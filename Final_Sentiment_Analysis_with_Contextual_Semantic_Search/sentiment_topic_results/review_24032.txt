{"text": "i am 5'6\" and 135 lbs. i ordered the one size in white. they arrived in 6 days and are undamaged. i wouldnt recommend buying them in white, unless you know you have an outfit they will go great with. they dont look super hot alone, the woman in the photo must be a size 0 cuz they look great alone on her lol anyway, they fit alright, actually theyre a little big. they go well with my naughty school girl outfit, but i dont think ill be wearing them with anything else. theres a very noticeable seam running on the entire inside of the legs, its kinda unattractive...ultimately, if i could go back in time, i would order something different. im sure these look good on some women, but im just not thrilled about them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12787081", "1": "0.32713205", "2": "0.14811102", "3": "0.12970223", "5": "0.2097248", "6": "0.055471472"}}
