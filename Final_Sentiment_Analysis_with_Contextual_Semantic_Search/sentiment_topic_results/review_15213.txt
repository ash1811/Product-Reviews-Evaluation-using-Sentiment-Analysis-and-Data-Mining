{"text": "I was delighted with this watch when it came.  The black dial is very good looking  and easy to read. Adjusting the wrist band was more complicated than I had hoped for but I was able to do so with some help.  I would have given this watch a 5-star review but it stopped working after two days. I hope it only needs a battery because I love the watch and don't want to return it. 2/15 A  new battery worked for a few days than stopped. I reluctantly returned for a refund.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15060864", "1": "0.047882125", "2": "0.17186938", "3": "0.26269993", "4": "0.050554603", "5": "0.111440666", "6": "0.20494466"}}
