{"text": "This is for the most part a decent looking watch box. Its made of a wrapped composite or cardboard like material but seems strong. It's smaller than you'd think holding 20 watches which is nice. I am not crazy about the watch pillows as they have solid sides rather than like a traditional pillow has but they work and can certainly be changed out if necessary. Decent hasp and locking system. I'd suggest this to those needing to properly store upwards of 20 watches.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11231434", "1": "0.16683689", "2": "0.28953922", "3": "0.2766643", "4": "0.1482496"}}
