{"text": "My daughter learned how to tell time very quickly and easily with this watch.  She likes the slip on strap - the material is comfy to wear and the adjustable strap makes it easy to size her wrist (she's 9 but has a tiny wrist).  The butterfly that moves around as it counts seconds is a big hit!  I was concerned the butterfly would make it difficult to read the watch but that isn't the case at all.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.050725512", "1": "0.15341333", "2": "0.27367455", "3": "0.13047434", "4": "0.10164195", "5": "0.11298255", "6": "0.17708777"}}
