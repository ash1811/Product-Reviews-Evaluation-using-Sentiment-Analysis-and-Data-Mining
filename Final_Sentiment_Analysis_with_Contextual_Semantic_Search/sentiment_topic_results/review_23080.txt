{"text": "I've own several 874's and they've all lasted me years. When I was younger I worked a bunch of construction jobs, and these were my go to pants. Now I build and manage servers and work in an office where it's business casual. These are still my go to pants. They're extremely high quality, but they tend to take forever to become worn in. The waist band can really stiff, and take a couple months to loosen up. These will always be my go to pants for work and I suggest them for anyone looking for a pair of high quality pants.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09047046", "1": "0.3169737", "3": "0.20769012", "4": "0.14938013", "5": "0.08737851", "6": "0.1454488"}}
