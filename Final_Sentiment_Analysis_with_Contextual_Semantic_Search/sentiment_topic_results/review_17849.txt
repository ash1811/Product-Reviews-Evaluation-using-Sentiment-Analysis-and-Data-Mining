{"text": "As stated, this is an awesome watch; its got the looks, is lightweight, and for the most part -- tells time correctly. I'm not gonna get into all the mumble jumbo but I'll briefly state my likes and dislikes. To start off, I needed a watch for outdoor activities, particularly for hiking and this style and model nailed it. Loved the overall color-combination from being beige, light brown to dark brown. The letters are bold and the hands are extremely easy to read. It matches very well with my outdoor apparel (khaki, belt, and hiking boot)! But the best part? I can use it as an everyday casual watch.As much as I like the Casio Forester, a few flaws has caused my displeasure of owning it. The number one thing that bothers me most is the band. Though very versatile but it can also get uncomfortable for several reasons. First of all, it is scratchy on the wrist! This is mostly caused by the harsh band material and sharp-cut corners of the leather and threading. Also, the four little screws underneath the bottom base are the biggest discomfort of all due to their rough edges. Perhaps the aforementioned needed to be broken-in? As for the mechanical part; the calendar likes to start its day a bit early at 10 to midnight (00:50PM), which means if I look at my watch between 11:50-55pm, it is already tomorrow! Another thing; the date setting doesn't go in reverse, but only forward. The other small nuisance would be the illuminator light, which only stays on for a split second, or even less until you 'hold on' to the button, even then it is very dimmed. But hey, for $14 (Ships from and sold by Amazon.com) I shouldn't be throwing a hissy-fit. But all in all, I like the watch. We'll see how the plastic housing hold up through time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19704461", "1": "0.15683398", "2": "0.05068429", "3": "0.15865052", "4": "0.14321858", "5": "0.08206265", "6": "0.21150535"}}
