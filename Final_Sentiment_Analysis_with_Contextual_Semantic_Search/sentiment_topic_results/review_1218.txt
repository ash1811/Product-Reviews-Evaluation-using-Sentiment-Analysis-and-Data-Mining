{"text": "34 A: These bras are the best. I will not wear an under wire, and I like to not have una-boob, while still being supported and covered. I also prefer to only wear cotton as acrylic makes my breasts sweaty and gross. I have tried other bras, other brands with prettier styles.  Nothing compares, in comfort, practicality, look, coverage, support. These are the bras for me.
