{"text": "I had a pair of these a few years ago and lost them, so came back to purchase another pair.  They are bulky in appearance compared to a lot of flip flops, but man are they cushioned and comfortable (especially after molding them in the oven).  They could use a bit more arch support, in my opinion - but I need a lot of arch.  I most often wear a 9.5 and these were way too big in a 10.  My mom (who wear a 10.5-11) kept them for herself.  Size down if you are a half size.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.081082344", "1": "0.27610067", "2": "0.0806523", "3": "0.2971451", "4": "0.13294385", "5": "0.032849982", "6": "0.09922577"}}
