{"text": "The jeans were a great value and they fit very well - the colors represented on the website are a bit off however - I suppose the word \"Sky\" is pretty ambiguous after all - they aren't blue, or grey or any other color I have seen in retail outlets.  I would still recommend them but only if you aren't expecting a specific color in mind.  Also, the material on these jeans are substantially thinner than the same model (514) you will find in retail outlets - hence the lower price i suppose", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14482266", "1": "0.22777171", "2": "0.15739004", "3": "0.072591074", "4": "0.11627796", "5": "0.08925963", "6": "0.19188696"}}
