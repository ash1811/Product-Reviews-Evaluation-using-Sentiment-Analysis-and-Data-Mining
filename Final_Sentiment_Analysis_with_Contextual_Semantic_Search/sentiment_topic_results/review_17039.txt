{"text": "I purchased these after researching closed toe hiking sandals for one that would provide the strong arch support that I need (for pronation issues with one foot.) Although I loved the look and design of the shoe, it simply did not have much arch support. So I returned the shoe and, instead, ordered a pair of open-toed Orthaheel hiking sandals - which did provide the excellent arch support that Orthaheel does so well.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12114643", "1": "0.16800916", "2": "0.18374796", "3": "0.24966006", "4": "0.2204284", "6": "0.053745087"}}
