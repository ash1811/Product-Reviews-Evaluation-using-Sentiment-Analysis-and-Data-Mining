{"text": "I have a 9 year old in third grade, who up to this point always had some \"character themed\" kids backpack  But they never last.  The zippers are incredibly weak, the seams are poorly done, and so this winter, again, he had a seam bust when he tried to get his boots and snow pants into it with the rest of the stuff.So I sat him down and explained that the next one wouldn't have a cartoon character or game or something on it, that we'd buy a \"real\" backpack, not some kid one.  He loves red, so this was the one he picked as we browsed Amazon.Shipped quickly with Amazon Prime, and arrived in perfect condition.  The construction is well beyond the normal youth backpack, but average for \"normal\" backpacks.  There's plenty of room in here for him now compared to the ones he had been getting, with two of the spaces being the large, deep ones so we can keep books separate from clothes and such.  He won't need all the options in the small front pouch since he's only 9, but it'll be useful for notes and such for the teacher to keep things from getting lost in the clothes section.My only real complaint about it is the cross straps on each side, that you can use to compress it front to back and limit how much it can expand.  There's no option to remove them, and they do get in the way with the zipper function, since you have to reach your hand \"under\" them when you zipper.  Fortunately it wasn't enough to frustrate him with the annoyance, so he's happy with the backpack and I'm expecting it to last quite a bit longer than the previous ones have.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06985227", "1": "0.24256709", "2": "0.27621084", "3": "0.15549341", "4": "0.13005239", "5": "0.10021786", "6": "0.02560617"}}
