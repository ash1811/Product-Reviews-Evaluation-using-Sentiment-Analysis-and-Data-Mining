{"text": "This model has been out for a long time. I like the look of the black more then the white or gold. The reason the watch loses one star is because the band. It looks great, but the rubber will wear out and break in about a year. The replacement band that Casio offers looks close the orginal, but not exactly the same. I lost one of these, and another was stolen. So the fact that I am on my third is a statement to how much I love this watch. I have been wearing it since about 1993.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.20619391", "1": "0.23676132", "2": "0.1876905", "3": "0.1632416", "5": "0.0857432", "6": "0.11711221"}}
