{"text": "I was able to fit my 120lb ex in this bag (Just so we are clear it was when we were dating, I didn't kill her or anything). I use it to store a memroy foam mattress for transport to my college apt. This is a big and durable bag I have loaded lots into before and dragged to my car (Again...it was not a body). The zipper and bag seem pretty stout and have held up for me so far. A strap would be a nice addition if I had anything to gripe about it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.05714048", "1": "0.25621438", "2": "0.21344574", "3": "0.12036497", "4": "0.098666705", "5": "0.12885618", "6": "0.12531158"}}
