{"text": "My husband is very particular about his underwear and definitely favors certain brands. These are his favorite T-shirts. The V neck comes down far enough to remain hidden when he wears an open oxford or polo shirt. He HATES when his undershirt shows. Frankly, so do I. We have tried other, less expensive brands. He is rarely happy with them, so I \"suck it up\" and just keep paying the price for these. They are TOO EXPENSIVE, but they have me over a barrel.
