{"text": "I was skeptical of Shoe Goo to begin with, largely because the claims and reviews just seemed to good to be true. Fortunately I bought some and tried it for myself, because it really does work. I've used it to reattach the soles of several pairs of shoes, and in most cases, they actually feel sturdier than they ever did prior to the Shoe Goo. The only thing that you have to be careful with is the actual application, because it can be a bit messy and it just doesn't come off, but if you want something that's going to give your shoes life you didn't know they had, this is the product to use.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07527883", "1": "0.2826017", "2": "0.24209027", "3": "0.16563873", "5": "0.19838783", "6": "0.033249106"}}
