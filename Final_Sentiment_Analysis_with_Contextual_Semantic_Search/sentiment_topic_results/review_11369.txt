{"text": "I'm a fan! I was looking for a pair of red cowboy boots and these are perfect!Probably wouldn't have bought them if the red weren't majorly discounted though. Red color is really nice, but it is most definitely a true red. Quality is good and they are very comfortable. A little large, I'd say size down if you're between sizes. Even then I can still wear them with super heavy socks. They seem to be a good fit for narrow feet.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.041759193", "1": "0.4514029", "3": "0.22492246", "4": "0.09777413", "5": "0.0732754", "6": "0.10737726"}}
