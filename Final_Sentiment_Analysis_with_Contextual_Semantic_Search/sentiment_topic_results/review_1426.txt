{"text": "This bag has three main compartments and several smaller zippered pockets. A key holder, water bottle holder and pen holders. You can put more books in here than you could carry. It is not a computer bag with padding. And it is well made. The zippers are a bit stiff, but that will hopefully change as I use the backpack.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.050838098", "2": "0.41989622", "3": "0.15476795", "4": "0.11798785", "5": "0.24754474"}}
