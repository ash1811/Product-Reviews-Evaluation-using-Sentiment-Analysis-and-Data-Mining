{"text": "I especially like that the size comes in EFG size so cup size fit. Just a suggestion if you really plan to use as a sleep bra you may want to order a size up if don't like to wear bras to bed. So if purchasing a size 34 EFG then go for 36 EFG for sleeping comfort. I really like this bra but the hooks are difficult to line up since both material and hooks are black so difficult to see.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19386004", "1": "0.06054434", "3": "0.34114605", "4": "0.055587515", "5": "0.11942323", "6": "0.22625707"}}
