{"text": "I bought these shoes along with a pair of Ryka Studio D's.  I decided to give them a try based on the recommendations that I read here.  I have very high arches and was very interested in the comments made here about the way they feel for those people. These are very comfortable and the support is awesome - of which I was skeptical since it's not 1 entire sole.  But they feel awesome.  They run small - so I followed the suggestions posted in the other reviews, and mine fit really well.  They are tight, but I believe they are suposed to be. I use these shoes in conjunction with my Ryka's (switch back and forth) to teach Zumba.  I love them!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08123378", "1": "0.21019422", "2": "0.17388694", "3": "0.27872285", "4": "0.11725897", "5": "0.108848155", "6": "0.029855067"}}
