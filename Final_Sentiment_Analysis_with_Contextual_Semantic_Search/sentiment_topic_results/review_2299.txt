{"text": "Tried two pairs of Docker Gordon in Cordovan and was very excited to get them at a great price, but unfortunately both pairs were extremely uncomfortable. The top cap was digging into my foot and the shoe felt cheap and I could tell it would not last very long under daily use. They were very narrow for D Medium labeled shoes. They look great and are available at a great price, but they very uncomfortable and cheaply made.
