{"text": "I wear Wacoal all the time and the band size on this definitely runs small (I'd say by one size; I'm normally 34D, but could have used a 36 in this; I think the sizing issue is because the band isn't adjustable and they decided to err on the side of too snug). The lift is nice, and the straps sit in the middle of the shoulder as pictured instead of riding to the center like so many t-backs. The fabric is quite thin so don't expect any, er, cold-weather protection. I do recommend it, just know what you're getting.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2757222", "2": "0.121539585", "3": "0.2045603", "4": "0.11507827", "5": "0.15358889", "6": "0.12685402"}}
