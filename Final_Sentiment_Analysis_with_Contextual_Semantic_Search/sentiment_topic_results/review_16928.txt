{"text": "Great quality overalls. The only suggestion is to order 2 sizes larger. I had to return the first pair, as they were way too small. Especially, if you want to fit a heavier shirt underneath. I got these for my husband to wear when he welds. The fabric is stiff, as most carhartt clothing is. Very durable though. Cant beat the price on amazon. I saw these in local stores for $85 and over.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22817051", "1": "0.25211608", "4": "0.24851362", "5": "0.079301015", "6": "0.18473363"}}
