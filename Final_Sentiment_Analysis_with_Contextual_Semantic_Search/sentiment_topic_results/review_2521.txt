{"text": "I decided I wanted to buy a pair of sperry's for the comfort and classic look. Plus they are an easy shoe to just slide on and go. They look professional at work, I'm a preschool teacher, and are great for casual too! I looked online and in stores for several months debating over which style and color I wanted... Which was a super hard decision cause I want all of them! I finally decided to try the classic Authentic Original in brown for my first pair... Cause they would go with the most outfits. I love how I can wear them in any season, and since I have a very high arch, and need lots of support, i hoped all the hype of awesome foot bed would be true! I normally wear a woman's size 10, but due to a turf toe issue - and in trying on a couple pairs of Bluefish style in stores - I decided to first try it in a woman's size 11 - and it is a slight bit too long, but it doesn't hurt my toe! They have been super comfortable since day 1, zero break in time - which is my goal in shoes as I've gotten older. I get frequent compliments, and my feet aren't tired at the end of the day! Can't wait to buy another pair!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.088181175", "1": "0.3408356", "2": "0.18385828", "3": "0.14627852", "4": "0.16136362", "6": "0.077132806"}}
