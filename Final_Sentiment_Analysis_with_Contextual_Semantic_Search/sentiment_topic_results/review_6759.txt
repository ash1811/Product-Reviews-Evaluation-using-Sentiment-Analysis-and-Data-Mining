{"text": "The Invicta 9094 pro diver watch looks like $5,000 of watch hanging on my wrist. It's nothing short of stunning in saphire blue.It's a tough watch and good for people who have outdoor jobs or peform dynamic tasks like engineering test work.The stainless steel bracelet gleams and the watch keeps good time. The bezel also turns easily enough. It is not a \"coin edge\" like Rolex uses, but \"scalloped\" like an Omega. That means the wearer cannot turn it from the side like a radio knob. You have to use your thumbs and press down slightly to move it like a wheel, which, of course, it is. There have been some complaints by other reviewers about the Invicta bezels not turning well, but the three Invicta dive watches I've purchased turn with ease after a little use and practice.To recap: Absolutely stunning looking watch at an affordable price. People will notice it and it works well as a tough watch to stand up in extreme environments.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.019290708", "1": "0.19240972", "2": "0.20085372", "3": "0.19117215", "4": "0.07537431", "5": "0.1474644", "6": "0.17343497"}}
