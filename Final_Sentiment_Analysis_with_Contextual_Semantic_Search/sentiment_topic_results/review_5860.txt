{"text": "I was searching for a silver pendant I could wear with various silver earrings. This is IT! I love it...just the right scale and is light. The pendant is slightly concave though, which means the sharp points of the flower edges poke a bit, but I'll get used to that. It's quite shiny, in a good way. Highly recommended!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22108863", "1": "0.100134104", "2": "0.1610095", "3": "0.084659405", "4": "0.14817542", "5": "0.20397753", "6": "0.08095537"}}
