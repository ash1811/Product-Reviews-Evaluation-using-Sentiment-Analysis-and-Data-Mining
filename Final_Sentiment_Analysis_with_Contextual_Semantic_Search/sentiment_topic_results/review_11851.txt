{"text": "These Hanes crew neck T shirts are very comfortable; the smooth, super soft and preshrunk 100% cotton will be comfortable the very first time you wear them. Moreover, the back inside of the shirt has no tag that could feel scratchy on the lower part of your neck. The information that used to be on the tag is now imprinted onto the rear inside of the shirt.In addition, the double ply neckband makes the garment stronger than ever so it lasts longer then ever! The shirt stays tucked into your pants, pajamas or underwear shorts very well since its length comes slightly longer than the typical length. The shirts even come three to a pack for added value--great!Just a few extra words of advice based on my experience: I would wash these before wearing them. Sometimes the shirts come out of the plastic bag package with a very, very slight funky smell that must occur because they were packed the way they were. In addition, check both the sizing chart above on the webpage and the \"pricing and availability\" chart to make sure that you choose the right size for you. I would also wash these T shirts with similar colors to minimize the chances of any colors bleeding onto these T shirts during the wash cycle.Overall, these long lasting T shirts by Hanes make for great underwear; they could be worn outside but their real purpose is underwear for gentlemen. These shirts last forever, especially with the proper care. Get some and wear them in good health!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06007375", "1": "0.3849488", "2": "0.08716051", "3": "0.17194313", "5": "0.21812104", "6": "0.0756673"}}
