{"text": "There is a little extra room in the cup area, which caused the dreaded 'cone shaped breast' (not modern).  So I sized down in the cup (from a C to a B).  The cone shape still existed, and the bra felt a little too snug all over-  I think that is due to the spanette fabric of this bra.I do like that it is seamless, but the spanette cups need to be updated, so they don't cause a cone shape.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"2": "0.17791459", "3": "0.24849184", "4": "0.18869337", "5": "0.15329248", "6": "0.22460403"}}
