{"text": "Its a good bra that actually lifts and make them stay where they are even if you are active..Has full coverage which I liked. The first two days I didn't even know that I had a bra on until the end of the day. But after the third and fourth day, I noticed that itchiness that other people have mentioned. I think its the nylon...but I will never be certain. I agree with the person who wrote a review that lace should be gone. It's nice enough bra without the lace.  Also the downside is that it left light red strap marks on my shoulders...that was unpleasant to see. So overall, It's a good bra, just that I wouldn't bother buying this exact one again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22394858", "1": "0.19254096", "2": "0.08178928", "3": "0.21672373", "4": "0.14857452", "5": "0.06331549", "6": "0.073107466"}}
