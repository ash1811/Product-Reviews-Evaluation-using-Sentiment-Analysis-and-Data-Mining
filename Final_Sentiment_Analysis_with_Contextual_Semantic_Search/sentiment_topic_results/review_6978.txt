{"text": "I used this on a trip and it was comfortable under jeans or pants.  I used it to hold my passport, extra credit cards and cash to keep them \"out of sight\".  It did have a way too long waist strap which I easily cut and then melted the ends (used a match and it melts like plastic and then you squish - similar to what you might do with nylon rope) to make sure it didn't fray.  I recommend this for what it is.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.33372185", "2": "0.22001664", "3": "0.21101269", "4": "0.08576558", "5": "0.10851746", "6": "0.037294276"}}
