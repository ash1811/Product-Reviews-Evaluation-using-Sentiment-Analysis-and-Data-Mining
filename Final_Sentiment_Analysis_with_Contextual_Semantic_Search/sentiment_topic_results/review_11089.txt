{"text": "This is my second pair of Acorn's and not likely to be my last. Extremely comfy! This is a different style than I had before and these are too wide so they slip off occasionally, but they are still very comfortable. These are \"Tex Moc, Brown Bear\" and are little less warm on top than my previous pair (which were sheepskin on top--these are just fuzzy fabric...but these are less than half the price of my first pair, so still excellent value).A word of warning about the sizing. Amazon lists the sizes in Men's sizes so I ordered 8-9 Men's accordingly for my women's size 10-10.5 feet. They arrived in Women's 8-9. Easily returned and I then ordered the size 9.5-10.5. The length is right. And these are not hideous (unlike my first pair). Each pair ordered arrived within 1.5 days of ordering--astonishing speed!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04601963", "1": "0.271293", "2": "0.06261821", "3": "0.26291826", "4": "0.15720159", "5": "0.02757794", "6": "0.17237134"}}
