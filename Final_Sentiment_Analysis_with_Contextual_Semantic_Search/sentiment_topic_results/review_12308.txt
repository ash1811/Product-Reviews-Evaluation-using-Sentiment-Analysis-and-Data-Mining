{"text": "I swim laps about 3 times a week and am admittedly still overweight (working on it!). I ordered this suit based on the fact that I have always loved Tyr suits and on reviews about this suit's stretch and sturdiness. Both are still true. I then wanted a red suit, so I ordered another Tyr (a maxback, but not a durafast). No comparison. The non-durafast suit was still well made, but it was small on me and I felt that I needed a shoe horn to get the suit on. I tried ordering in a larger size, but still no joy. This suit has been holding up beautifully and I gave up on the non-durafast and ordered a black suit with red trim. A fair compromise for the perfect swimsuit.UPDATE. This not a perfect suit. I rotate my suits, so this suit is used in a sodium-base chlorinated pool 2-3 times a week. The fabric is holding up, but it starting to show signs of stretching out. The most irritating thing, though, is that the thread used for the top stitching has turned an unfortunate shade of fuschia. I don't know if that happens with the other colors, but I would not buy this suit again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.026051197", "1": "0.2803724", "2": "0.3599338", "3": "0.15080099", "4": "0.06768524", "6": "0.1128396"}}
