{"text": "I got tired of my old Fossil watch with the big band. i was looking for something more sleek and modern. When I saw this watch I absolutely fell in love and couldn't have bought it faster. The face of the watch is very minimalist with silver accents. The Skagen brand and logo lie right at the top of the dial which makes it look much more elite than it really is. I just love the contrast in the dial.It is also amazingly thin compared to other watches. The band itself is a titanium mesh which has great flexibility. The downside is that it is quite rigid where the band connects to the dial. If your wrist is thin, like mine, the connection will not lay flush against your skin. This will cause a small gap to appear making it seem as if you had a flat item being held tightly against your wrist.Also I noticed that the color of the band where it wraps over the bottom of my wrist is slowly losing color. I believe it's just because I've been rubbing it against my desk too often. It is not noticeable from the top.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14858097", "1": "0.21775596", "2": "0.24975781", "3": "0.1703466", "4": "0.049062893", "5": "0.043667667", "6": "0.12082809"}}
