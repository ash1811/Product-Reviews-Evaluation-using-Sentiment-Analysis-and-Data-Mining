{"text": "It took me a while to realize what an incredible deal this watch is.  Casio makes good products that always work well and this is no exception.  And it is a really nice looking man's watch.  There are a few things that are not ideal.  Yes, the crystal is the soft plastic kind that scratches very easily -- but I believe a good plastic polish with VERY fine abrasive could probably restore it to looking just like new and I hope to try that fix someday!  It's irritating when you try to set something on the digital display whenever either or both of the hands are down in the 5, 6, or 7 area.  Sometimes you have to just wait until they move by themselves -- because resetting the analog hands only works in the &#34;forward&#34; direction and, if you move them, it takes a LONG time to get them back to where they were.  Finally, I had to keep the tiny manual handy for a few months as the alarm and other settings don't seem very intuitive to me.  But, once I got them down, I really appreciate what I have for such a low, low price.  And, on my watch at least, the lighted dial works superbly whenever I push the light button.  It looks great, it works great -- at this price it's a real gem!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11396756", "1": "0.24672717", "2": "0.1086787", "3": "0.16037063", "4": "0.110836625", "5": "0.09531762", "6": "0.16410166"}}
