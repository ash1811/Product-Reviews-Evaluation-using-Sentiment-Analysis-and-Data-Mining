{"text": "Wanted to buy a new baseball cap before doing archaeology in the summer. I have a small head and I wanted something more fitted. This cap is indeed low profile/unstructured (the part on your forehead is soft and doesn't project upwards several inches), which was exactly what I was looking for. I measured my head and saw it was about the same as the circumference measurement provided in the images, and the actual cap fit perfectly. I tighten or loosed it as needed, and the buckle is sturdy and classy. Will be wearing this on the beach as well. Port & Company is good quality and will purchase from them again.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12908904", "1": "0.3693026", "2": "0.16300528", "3": "0.10101657", "4": "0.081483655", "6": "0.15343931"}}
