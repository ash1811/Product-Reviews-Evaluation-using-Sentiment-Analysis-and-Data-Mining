{"text": "I saw that Dockers Shoes were on sale on Amazon.  These are the shoes that my husband wears everyday to work or with dark pants.  He says they are very comfortable from day one, hold up as far as construction of shoe, and are quiet when walking.Don't need to let everyone know who is walking down the hall with the sound of your shoes!  They have a nice non skid sole, so no slipping on wet, ice or snow but still have that dressy/business look to them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0692544", "1": "0.1381813", "2": "0.1503867", "3": "0.12557085", "4": "0.18260524", "5": "0.21333987", "6": "0.12066167"}}
