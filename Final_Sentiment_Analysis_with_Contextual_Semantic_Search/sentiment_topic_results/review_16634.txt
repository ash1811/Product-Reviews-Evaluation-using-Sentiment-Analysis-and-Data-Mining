{"text": "I have this watch I absolutely love it. It is quite large but very very comfortable to wear. I can wear it all day and not feel it on. The features are awesome for such an inexpensive timepiece. For $130+ you get more watch than you can ask for. I would consider this over other watches in this price range.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.30954418", "2": "0.23630816", "4": "0.1966824", "5": "0.17465188", "6": "0.072179325"}}
