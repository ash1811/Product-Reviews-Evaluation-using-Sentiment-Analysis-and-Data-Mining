{"text": "These are without question, the best panties for wearing with slacks.  No line at the leg, no line accross the middle of your behind, and no riding up.  They are also cut low enough to not show in a moderately low rise pant.  Sizing runs true to any other Maidenform pantie you've ever bought. Can be had cheaper at a Maidenform outlet store, but still well worth the price on Amazon.  Buy lots of them!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.4839067", "2": "0.10703222", "3": "0.10262912", "4": "0.16884838", "6": "0.13091336"}}
