{"text": "I was wearing a carhartt jacket as I ordered this one. Size of my jacket is large and fits perfectly. The large I ordered here was ridiculously huge. I ended up returning the jacket to get a medium, which is still larger than I thought. I washed and dried to to try and shrink it a little pit and get rid of the stiffness. Now it fits well enough that I will keep it.The jacket itself is very warm, and the outer shell is extremely durable. My only complaint is about the seam around the bottom. It is very loose and lets air in through the bottom of the jacket (I read another complaint about this). It is as if there is not enough elastic, so I will probably end up getting it taken in.Quality is great, sizing is crazy large. Even if you have other carhartt jackets, go a size lower.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.025749596", "1": "0.39038897", "2": "0.17195176", "3": "0.26341993", "5": "0.14344122"}}
