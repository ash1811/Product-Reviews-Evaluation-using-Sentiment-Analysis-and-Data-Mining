{"text": "I ordered a 40x32. I should've ordered a 40x30, but that was my error. Subzero temps are comfortable with these on. I wear a pair of jeans under them. I'm 5'10\" and weigh 170 lbs. I washed them twice and the length did shrink about an inch but I have to wear boots with them or they will drag onto the ground at the bottom/back of the legs. These are well worth the price. Being my first Bibs, I expect to buy a new one yearly, but in a size 40x30.Update:Now that spring is here, these bibs are great and worked perfectly! They are must have in Colorado. When washing them, follow the instructions!I recommend going to your local Carhartt store (Sears?) and trying a pair on to get your sizing perfect. Even if they don't have the lined bibs, they will have the unlined and it's so important you get the length of your bibs right or you will ruin them as they rub on the ground.Next Fall I will buy the unlined version in a different color and may get a size of 38x28. The reasoning for the 38 instead of the 40 is that the lined pair are thick and at times with jeans on underneath, it did get toasty.I've been to my local Sears and have tried on the unlined version which are $30 cheaper, but I could see that as long as I had jeans on underneath and maybe thermals under the jeans, the unlined will be just as comfortable. Obviously you want to buy them on Amazon!The length in the next pair will definitely be a 30\" length (instead of the 32 I bought)or maybe even a 28\" length, because they adjust in length at the suspenders.So UNDERSTAND this fact: When they say they are a 30\" in length, keep in mind that's the shortest length they adjust to. So my 32\" in length bibs I bought are 32\" at the shortest length possible and they will actually adjust (at the suspenders) 3-4\" longer than the length stated!!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16640867", "1": "0.3338476", "2": "0.17132461", "3": "0.22003709", "4": "0.047066633", "5": "0.058886897"}}
