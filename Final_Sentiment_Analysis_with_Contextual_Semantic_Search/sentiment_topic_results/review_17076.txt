{"text": "Kids love Crocs, what more is there to say?They come in a ton of colors, are washable and lightweight, great for hot weather, and hold up well. My daughter somehow fit into the same size for two years. No scratches, stains, holes, tears.I know that the footbed supposedly molds to your foot. For this reason, I didnt think my younger daughter should wear these as hand-me-downs, but honestly, I dont see or feel it in the shoe at all. So whether you buy into that part of the Crocs design, that's up to you.But for us, two kids are getting use out of an inexpensive shoe that basically looks new. Can't beat that.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14176273", "1": "0.31132513", "2": "0.1503364", "3": "0.10164148", "4": "0.08560015", "5": "0.17078792", "6": "0.038546216"}}
