{"text": "I am so happy with my purchase, they fit perfect, I ordered the same size that I usually wear with all shoes and these are very comfortable...even the part that goes in between the toes is so light and comfortable you can barely tell it's there. These sandals are made well and that being said, they seem to be a great price. Also, very cute, I love the way they look and there's many color choices. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good/cute summer sandal.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08161941", "1": "0.54732317", "2": "0.039619174", "3": "0.1969763", "4": "0.12779841"}}
