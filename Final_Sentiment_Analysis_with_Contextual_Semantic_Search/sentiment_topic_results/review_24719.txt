{"text": "I use these for biking in the rain and they held out great everytime.  My last pair of rain pants would eventually wick water in the knee area over time, and these pants don't do that.  They also have classy buttons on the bottom so that you can secure them.Cons:  They have a back pocket and no side pockets.  I would rather have no pockets, or if any a front/side pocket.  Not a big deal either way.  Also, I don't understand black rain gear.  I like wearing black, but in rainy weather it is important to stand out and black doesn't do it!  I'm not a fan of yellow/orange but at this point I'd rather be on the safe side.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10891907", "1": "0.26164606", "2": "0.10194502", "3": "0.1758197", "4": "0.22428183", "5": "0.04438371", "6": "0.08300459"}}
