{"text": "I don't know what I was expecting...but this wasn't it.  As it is summer, and I hate bras and sweating, I decided to order a size larger than I normally wear.

I have pointy breasts like Madonna.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06219467", "1": "0.19254191", "2": "0.05725232", "3": "0.4650926", "4": "0.044834428", "5": "0.056202356", "6": "0.12188174"}}
