{"text": "I got this to use in place of a purse at dog trials.  Most excellent.  I was worried that this would be a cheesy fanny pack, but it's not. Seams are sturdy (this was a concern of mine bcs of the low price) and bound with cotton webbing.  Outside seams are top-stitched.  Zippers are fine; have had no problems.  Pockets are surprisingly large for the size of this fanny pack.  Waistband is generous length.  I was expecting it to be a flimsy, poorly-sewn, \"kid-sized\" fanny pack.  It's not.I am putting up pix to show the inside.There are 3 pockets.  The largest 2 are easily accessible.  The back one is less so; maybe this was the plan?The boxy pocket on the front has a key fob sewn in.  Obviously, it's easy to get at bcs it's in front.The large compartment is the middle of the three. The workhorse. Easily accessible.  Here's where you put your sunglasses, etc.On the back (against your clothes) is a thin pocket with a zipper that does not (alas) go all the way across.  This would be the place to carry your driver's license/cash bcs the short zipper makes access a little more difficult.  It's also not visible to others.This is not what you'd take mountain climbing or jungle exploring, but it's perfectly fine for a day hike, a dog trial, kids' soccer game, etc. I recommend it. mbmb", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.060007233", "1": "0.2255897", "2": "0.15486439", "3": "0.14496605", "4": "0.03562178", "5": "0.11472298", "6": "0.2642279"}}
