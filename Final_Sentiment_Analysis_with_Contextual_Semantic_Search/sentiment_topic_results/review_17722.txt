{"text": "I use this watch and almost every function 10-20 times a day.  It's the perfect functional watch.  No frills, just features that work.  Real buttons.  Immediate access and stop/start/reset of timer and stopwatch.  I tried other watches with touch screens, heart rate monitoring, altimiters, etc, and as it turns out those are just worthless marketing gimmicks that didn't work (at least for me).  Their menu's were long and complicated and basic features like a timer or stopwatch were buried and hard to get to or unresponsive due to the interface.  If all you want is multiple ways to time workouts, runs, rests, or anything else that requires accurate and easy timing, this is your watch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19646357", "1": "0.0802366", "2": "0.19660917", "3": "0.070968874", "4": "0.1584202", "5": "0.06650881", "6": "0.23079275"}}
