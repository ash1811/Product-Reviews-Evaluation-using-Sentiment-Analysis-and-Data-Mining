{"text": "When my husband I got married, he bought me a fancy, expensive wedding band that I told him I didn't want because 1) I don't like wearing a bunch of money on my hand, I'd rather spend it on other things like a house; and 2) I work with my hands a lot and am pretty tough on jewelry. After scratching it all to hell from using tools every day, and freaking out when I misplaced it constantly because I was always taking it off, I decided to look for a cheap ring that I could wear daily and not worry about losing or abusing.This ring is awesome. It doesn't scratch, and buffs to a nice shine in seconds. What I really love about it is the width; many women's rings are so petite and wispy. This is a nice, obvious signal that says BACK OFF DUDE I'M MARRIED, and for that I am grateful.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21117222", "1": "0.39335892", "4": "0.16256897", "5": "0.11841348", "6": "0.10961177"}}
