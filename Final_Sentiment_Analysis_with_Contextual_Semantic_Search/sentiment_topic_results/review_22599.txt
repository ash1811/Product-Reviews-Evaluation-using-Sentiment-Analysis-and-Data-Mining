{"text": "These pants were too tight and extremely long (well maybe not for most..Im only 5'4) but the were very tight and my other pair of Black Dickies as well as my other pair of Khakis are both size 6. Granted im getting my winter &#34;cush&#34; so I thought I had better get a bigger size so I can be comfortable, but didnt expect them to be even tighter. They have a sheen to them ands are a bit too stiff as well...I liked the sheen though, just wasnt expecting it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.4150641", "2": "0.14823292", "3": "0.24056377", "4": "0.034388892", "5": "0.08982356", "6": "0.06867189"}}
