{"text": "These are very warm and comfortable. The fit is true to size. I have Minnetonka sherpa lined mocs in another style, but these are the most comfortable.  They are well made and very nice. With the rubber sole they are great to wear around the house or even out on errands. Great buy!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.058281146", "1": "0.59077746", "5": "0.19006024", "6": "0.14435443"}}
