{"text": "This bra seems like it would be comfortable, but due to the fact it wasn't constructed correctly I can't confirm that.

I am trying my luck one more time with this product, and will update my review once I recieve the new one.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.13479963", "2": "0.16886409", "3": "0.2569578", "4": "0.13330641", "5": "0.16261894", "6": "0.13867937"}}
