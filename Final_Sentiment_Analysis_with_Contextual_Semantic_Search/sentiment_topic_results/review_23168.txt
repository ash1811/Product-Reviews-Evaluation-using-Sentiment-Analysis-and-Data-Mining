{"text": "I am finding that Platex bras no longer are comfortable or are their sizes exact.  I had been so happy with them in the past and did not mind paying a higher price for comfort and style, but no more.  This bra was the most uncomfortable I have ever worn and gave it away soon after it arrived.  Like so many products made today I find Playtex disappointing.  Wearing another brand and love them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15456076", "1": "0.20989788", "2": "0.054682862", "3": "0.2622385", "4": "0.1307811", "5": "0.088100195", "6": "0.09973865"}}
