{"text": "These are my go-to shoes for hiking or walking long distances.  I've purchased 3 pairs so far & they've worked out really well for me.  The toe box is roomy, they're fairly supportive, well-made and rugged.  I've been very thankful for the toe protection and have alot of miles on these.  They're worn for walking, on moderate hikes of 10-14 miles, and on rafting trips.  Other than being slightly faded they look as they did when purchased.As far as cons go - they're a little heavy for sandals,and if worn in sandy environments the sand gets caught in the toe area & you'll have to take them off to dump it out.I got my regular shoe size & the fit was perfect.  The toe box is roomy, which I like since I have somewhat wide feet.  Those these have served me very well, I'm on the hunt for a sandals with all the good qualities of this pair along with less weight.  On my last trip we (and our luggage) had to get weighed in for the tiny plane we were on, and I realized it would be great to have all these pluses along with something that weighs a bit less - both for the weight of my luggage and the comfort of my feet!oh - I should mention that my 3rd pair is definitely smaller than the 1st two.  They must have changed their sizing, and now 1/2 size up might be a good idea.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11907954", "1": "0.24194165", "2": "0.089556895", "3": "0.17167199", "4": "0.066889234", "5": "0.19206469", "6": "0.11879597"}}
