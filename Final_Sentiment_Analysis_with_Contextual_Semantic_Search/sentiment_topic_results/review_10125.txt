{"text": "Of all the earrings I received for Christmas these were my favorite. Maybe because I bought them for myself. Nice, simple and smallish gold hoops. They are not as big as you would expect judging by the picture shown. After doing a little research on duragold (because really, what is it?) it appears to have a slightly lower percentage of gold in it and reportedly the strongest gold alloy ever. Whatever that is. Still, I love these except the post is a little long and gets caught on my clothes. I'd buy them again and I would buy them as a gift.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10915548", "1": "0.23512341", "2": "0.12581167", "3": "0.2523005", "4": "0.13849321", "5": "0.075875156", "6": "0.06324061"}}
