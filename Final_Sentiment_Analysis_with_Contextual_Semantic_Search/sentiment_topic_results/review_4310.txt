{"text": "I was concerned the very low cost of these pants I would end up with a cheap pair of pants which I would not like but while these are without a doubt Khaki style pants they already fit like a great pair of jeans, very comfortable, expected amount of room and comfort.  An all around a great article of clothing, not sure why I seem to doubt the way lee fits, but I do even though I've never been disappointed in a Lee product.  Great pair of Khaki's I'm going to order additional pairs.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3897544", "2": "0.1244449", "3": "0.19414483", "5": "0.18684499", "6": "0.09938777"}}
