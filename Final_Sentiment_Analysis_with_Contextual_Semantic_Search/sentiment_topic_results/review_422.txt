{"text": "I have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of these jewelry wipes to see if they are the solution to cleaning up my Pandora bracelets so that they are clean of a days grease and grime when they return to the box which is their home. Indeed these are wonderul. They arrived after 5 days. I immediately opened them and was amazed to see that they were dry and filled with a powdered coating. It does say \"Dry\" on the bottle but that is too small to see in the picture. I tried them first on a pair of large blue topaz earrings I was wearing. They had been worn too many times without cleaning and had lost their sparkle. It returned in just a few seconds of wiping. Then for a harder challenge: the dreaded pandora bracelet with sterling silver charms, silver clad charms, and glass beads plus a long bracelet with a blackened clasp. It took me 7 minutes to wipe my various charms and beads down, but in the end, all were sparking including the bracelet. The bracelet will now go to its drawer with an anti-tarnish strip in it and all will be cleaned up until next where when it will require just a swipe with the wipe to return the bracelet to its beauty. The wipe still had some powder left, so I tentatively wiped off my computer keys and around the screen just for good measure and they too cleaned all up. Well, it was a good day at the cleaning factory. Hope you have great success with these like I did!2\"x7\" Non-Abrasive Anti-Tarnish Strips", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.43113324", "1": "0.19099985", "3": "0.05721152", "4": "0.1400592", "6": "0.17506453"}}
