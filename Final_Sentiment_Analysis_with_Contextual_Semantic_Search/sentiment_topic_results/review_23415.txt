{"text": "I appreciate light thin tough material. I can wear this in summer. Its not too extreme in design. I got alot of backhanded compliments. The pockets are perfect. Sizing is pretty spot on. I could almost wear an xsmall but I prefer the small so  I have that extra room. I'm 5'5'' 120 pounds.The small is not too baggy for me.What a great price! I expect  these to last at 3 times longer than a similar priced carpenter jean, not as thick and reinforced stitching.I don't have a problem with the buttons.I really like these and may get at least one more pair.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11726937", "1": "0.38507098", "2": "0.22125001", "4": "0.13376023", "5": "0.13770612"}}
