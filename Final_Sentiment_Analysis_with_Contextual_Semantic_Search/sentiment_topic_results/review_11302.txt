{"text": "This is my second pair of sorels in this category. The last time I bought a pair was ten years ago and that pair (in black) is still going strong. The black pair is looking a little faded but I still wear them all the time. I bought this new pair because I wanted to change up my wardrobe. The new pair is very comfortable, stylish and well made. I know this boot will last as long as my other pair! Love these boots!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.1942075", "2": "0.045740694", "3": "0.3823112", "4": "0.22683838", "5": "0.06582582", "6": "0.08189509"}}
