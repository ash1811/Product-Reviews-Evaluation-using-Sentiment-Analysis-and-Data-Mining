{"text": "I bought these to go with my son's costume.  He's a sz 4.  They were absolutely huge!!!  Went all the way up past his elbows.  I think they would fit a 8-10 year old ok, but not a little one.  Otherwise, ok - went with the rest of the costume.  I'd wish for a little better quality, but as it's only going to be worn once, they would work.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18208905", "1": "0.31951514", "2": "0.12975062", "3": "0.23832966", "5": "0.03421552", "6": "0.0923305"}}
