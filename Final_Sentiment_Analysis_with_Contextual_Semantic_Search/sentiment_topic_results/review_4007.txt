{"text": "I wear black sweats around the house so wanted a black slipper but nothing that would enclose my foot totally. These are OK but a little on the clunky side and because they are 7/8 and I wear a 71/2 are slightly large and I have to be careful especially going down steps. On a flat surface they are better but I only wear with black pants otherwise they make me look like I have big feet. Cushioning is good and toe box is roomy. I think many would be very satisfied with this slipper. It is one of the best I have found except for the size.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.050351467", "1": "0.34423485", "2": "0.03765087", "3": "0.22049786", "4": "0.12735175", "5": "0.058278877", "6": "0.16163434"}}
