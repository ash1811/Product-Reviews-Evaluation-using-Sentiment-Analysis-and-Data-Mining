{"text": "If they continue to feel as great as they do now and hold up, then eventually my husband  would change this to 5 stars, but it less than one week of wear.  Amazing difference in feel and comfort and he has used other inner soles before these.  My husband is a walker; often walks down to coffee with the guys in the morning (2 mile round trip) and then taking the dog for a long walk (1 1/2 hr) in the afternoon.  In between he is often on the concrete floor working on some project in the basement -- so these will be put to the test.  BTW, came highly recommended by a couple of his friends as well as the award winning sneaker store in  neighboring city.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11816501", "1": "0.25383684", "2": "0.09571163", "3": "0.15304795", "4": "0.15674028", "5": "0.12267414", "6": "0.099824175"}}
