{"text": "I overlooked this watch 2-3 times because the Amazon stock photo just doesn't do it justice. If you haven't you should look on google for more pictures as it looks much better and especially in person, it's not near as dull as it looks and you don't notice the solar panels. To me the rubber strap also takes away from it and I already had a canvas NATO strap lined up for it along with a black leather one. 20mm is the correct size for watch straps just FYI. But enough about how it looks, let's talk about function.For setting the time this one is as easy as any other. It is a screw down crown so keep that in mind and don't get discouraged when you can't just pull it out, it does work. It did unscrew itself once, but I've been wearing it on a fairly tight strap and haven't had that problem since. I may not have had it down all the way.The 60 click bezel clicks strong and flawlessly, but is a bit loud. The bold indention's make it easy to grip in any conditions.The pins it came with are thick and strong and are easy to change while keeping the strap on the watch in tough conditions.The lume is amazing. It only got about 45 mins of day light and even after dark I was only in artificial light for two hours. When I went to bed it was still so bright I could see some of the second tick marks. After sleeping six hours in a dark room with only a small bit of street light coming in and my hand under the covers I could still tell exactly what time it was.You do want to fully charge it before wearing it as I tried to wear mine right out of the box thinking if I wore it about a week it would charge itself, but I was wrong. After about two weeks it stopped, which really isn't bad considering it was probably in it's box and had almost zero battery although it did scare the (YNW) out of me as even after charging under a lamp overnight it wasn't going. However I just had to pull out the crown and push it back in to &#34;reset&#34; it after it stopped. I left it under a fluorescent light at work over the weekend after having it under a lamp at my house and setting it in the sun for a day or so and so far so good, but will update if that changes.Overall the only complaint I have is that the second hand is slightly off between the 15 and 45 second marks, which is something you expect from a Timex, but not a Citizen. I realize it's not high end, but am still pretty disappointed in this and it's the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10174956", "1": "0.06599213", "2": "0.32270357", "3": "0.16461001", "4": "0.13102607", "5": "0.09437974", "6": "0.11953889"}}
