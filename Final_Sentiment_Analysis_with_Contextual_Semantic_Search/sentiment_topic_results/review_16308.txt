{"text": "At first a tad suspicious of what the quality the product would be even after reading the reviews. I was very surprised by the packaging, delivery speed, considering the Christmas holidays and quality of this product. I fully inspected the cap upon delivery and was surprised at the quality of the construction, sewing and the comfortable fit due to the ease of the Velcro type adjustment strap in the back. I will be using this cap to attach a military patch and a couple of insignia pins which I believe will look outstanding. I Highly Recommend this company and look forward to doing additional business with them in the future.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15773374", "1": "0.26267222", "2": "0.072520085", "3": "0.029869132", "4": "0.07410219", "5": "0.22307287", "6": "0.18002973"}}
