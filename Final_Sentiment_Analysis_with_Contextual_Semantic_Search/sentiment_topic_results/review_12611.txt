{"text": "If you're a fan of these easy spirit shoes, you might like this model. I like the color -- it's an earthy olive green, which, unlike some of my past color choices in this shoe, does not show dirt -- a huge plus for shoes you wear for almost any activity. And though at first I wasn't crazy about the camouflage look of the soles, it grew on me. It doesn't look military at all; it's barely noticeable, and it blends well with the color of the upper. I've bought these in the past, with dark uppers and light or white soles, and they just don't look right to me. The white stands out against the dark cloth, and I find that annoying. So these are my favorites, for the time being. If you can't find a color combination you like in the millions of combinations available in easy spirits, you are just too picky. Sort of like the &#34;Princess and the Pea&#34; of footwear.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16830854", "1": "0.27292213", "2": "0.2683016", "3": "0.16105661", "5": "0.091192655", "6": "0.0357893"}}
