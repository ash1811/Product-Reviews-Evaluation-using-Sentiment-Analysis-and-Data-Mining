{"text": "These socks involve a little bit of effort and dedication to put on but the result is a well-cushioned foot that is warm, especially in cold winter months.When running with these socks, I didn't feel as if sweat was pooling around my feet. Over the last several weeks since receiving them, I've found that incidences of blisters have been diminished.When I wear socks for long periods, I find that may feet swell a little.  As these socks are somewhat stretchy, the swelling was not an issue.  I was able to wear these socks comfortably for 12 hours without an issue.These socks also wash well.  I do throw them in a nylon safety washer bag, however, because they are a bit pricey to replace with frequency.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.027012961", "1": "0.27212304", "2": "0.053217586", "3": "0.1695909", "4": "0.09699244", "5": "0.35617456", "6": "0.024888538"}}
