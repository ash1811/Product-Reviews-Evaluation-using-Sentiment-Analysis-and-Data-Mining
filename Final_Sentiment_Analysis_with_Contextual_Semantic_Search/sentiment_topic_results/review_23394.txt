{"text": "I finally found walking shoes that don't  fit in the ugly category. My girlfriend had a pair and I thought they were so cute. She raved about the comfort. I bought. I concur with the comfort. Makes walking like walking on clouds. The only complaint I have is the length of the straps. They are too long for me, but may not be for someone else. Highly recommended.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12969278", "1": "0.24624975", "2": "0.15097722", "3": "0.108638264", "5": "0.35547602"}}
