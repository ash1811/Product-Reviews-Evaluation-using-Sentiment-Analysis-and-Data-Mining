{"text": "I bought these for a trek with the Vibram Five Fingers - and they worked out very well. In fact I've worn them frequently without the Five Finger shoes. They wick moisture very well, and after a long day (or week) of hiking they do not smell nearly as bad as they should. Also I never got any blisters, rashes, or any real discomfort when wearing them. It really was a unique experience (never wore toe socks before). I highly recommend them for outdoor activities especially! Give each of your toes more room for movement and less restrictions then a regular sock.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13513722", "1": "0.27284428", "2": "0.032842856", "3": "0.23428404", "4": "0.17984472", "5": "0.025463551", "6": "0.11958328"}}
