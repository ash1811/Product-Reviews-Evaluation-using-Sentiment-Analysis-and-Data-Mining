{"text": "even if you are not, buy this watch.  I am a nurse, much like many of the other reviewers.  In fact, I bought it due to their reviews.  It is a fantastic watch.  Easy to read, has an illumination option and a handy date feature.  The only trouble I have is the size of the band (too long).  I will take it to a jeweler to take a few links out, however, the directions for doing this yourself make it looks easy (it's not).  Don't even bother looking for another watch, this one is a steal.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10648943", "1": "0.11574611", "2": "0.19414677", "3": "0.11850759", "4": "0.06630516", "5": "0.17931837", "6": "0.21948658"}}
