{"text": "These are great for 'everyday' or just lounging around in... they don't 'go anywhere' don't ride up/ down around etc...Pack of 6, can't go wrong - its a cheap price compared to paying high retail prices for fancy panties that fall apart quickly. These have some staying power!  These are cute little patterns / bright colours.  These are 'full coverage' I meant to get a bikini brief... but got these instead... sometimes you just want more. So these will fit those 'sometimes'.What I don't like.... you get 2 pair of white in almost EVERY package.  Why... why can't I just get six 'fun' pair.  If I want / need white I'll make a seperate 'neutral' colour purchase. For now... maybe I want to be 'fun' colored 6 days / wk", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11217185", "1": "0.2540319", "2": "0.16571723", "3": "0.11675495", "4": "0.070993766", "5": "0.18110564", "6": "0.099224694"}}
