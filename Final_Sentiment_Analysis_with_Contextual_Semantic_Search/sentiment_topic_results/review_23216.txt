{"text": "It's time men to use a little common sense.  A man today can not do everything out of his wallet and a professional briefcase isn't for every man.  This is a masculine, incredibly functional mini duffle that has pockets up the wazoo and is made of heavy canvas, will take a beating and keep marching' on!  Will carry books, laptop/notebook, notebooks, personal stuff, and mini-pockets for a lot of stuff.  A strap that lets you wear it across your chest or short enough to hang on one shoulder.I have a lot of Doctor appointments, lawyer appointments, other medical stuff, shopping, personal business and relying on cargo pockets and trying to use a cane and carry things in my one free hand is just a pain in the butt!  This 'man bag' solves all my problems and makes my life sooo much easier.  And once you start wearing one you'll notice how many other men have been wearing them.  Now I can carry my medicine and other necessities everywhere I go.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13276872", "1": "0.10570504", "2": "0.25408968", "3": "0.22816484", "4": "0.15762864", "5": "0.08522227", "6": "0.03642084"}}
