{"text": "Many people have reviewed this watch, I wanted to have an ana-digi watch with the negative display and this Casio does it's job well.  There are a lot of complaints about the negative digital numbers/display being too dark and on other Casio's the numbers are brighter.  If that's what you want then get the other watch, it's not that big of a problem.  Sure the hands are going to block the digital display as well at certain times of the day but it is expected.  It does take awhile for the hands to rotate when setting the piece when holding the button down but honestly, how many times do you do it?  All in all I like it, it's accurate and is a G-shock, have bumped it several times on metal file cabinets and shelves at work, the high bezel keeps the crystal from getting scratched or broken from a direct hit.  If you need a classic analog and like digital as well, buy this one.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20010626", "1": "0.16085549", "2": "0.30266574", "4": "0.13407694", "6": "0.19697253"}}
