{"text": "This is a very classy, gorgeous watch. I adjusted the band on my own, and that's all I needed to do before wearing it. To get the watch started, I just placed the watch under a mini lamp. I get a lot of compliments on the watch. It's not too big and not too small. Just right. It's a beauty! Plus, I know the battery will never die because I always wear it in sunlight. Best watch ever made and owned!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1513246", "1": "0.17982394", "2": "0.42654854", "4": "0.0850113", "5": "0.14992908"}}
