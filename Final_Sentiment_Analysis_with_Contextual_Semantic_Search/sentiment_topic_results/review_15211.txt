{"text": "My experiences with this product have been for the most part unexceptional. While the cloth covering of the elastic waistband is a nice addition to the comfort level the cloth itself is somewhat disappointing. If you were looking for Boxer Briefs with properties of compression shorts look elsewhere, as the material stretches out quickly and has a tendency to bunch up at inopportune moments. The longevity of these shorts are also in question as the material is very thin. At the moment I think I will get 6 months of heavy wear out of these briefs. Which for the price, is not an unreasonable lifetime for a low-tier bargain product. In sum, I am satisfied enough with my purchase to keep them but not satisfied enough to purchase again.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12166942", "1": "0.12485201", "2": "0.10702658", "3": "0.14061037", "4": "0.20279056", "5": "0.18136682", "6": "0.121684276"}}
