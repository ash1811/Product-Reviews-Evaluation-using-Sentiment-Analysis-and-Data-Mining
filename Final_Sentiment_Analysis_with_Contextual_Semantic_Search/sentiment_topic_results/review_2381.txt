{"text": "I used to wear Jockey Elance Bikini Briefs exclusively, but in the past year they have changed their design. I am a larger framed man with a 48 inch waist and I have always worn the XL size. They have always fit very comfortably and still have some give to them. But the last few times I bought this product, they have a smaller, tighter fit. Very tight in the pouch and between the legs. They also have a lower cut, both in the front and back. I'm constantly pulling them up in the back. My junk is popping out of the top and the sides! These might fit a woman comfortably, but not a man. There's no stretchiness or room in the front for \"the boys.\" This bikini would be better if Jockey offered it in other facrics such as Modal, Tactel or Nylon. I don't know why Jockey changed their design, but I don't like it and I will not buy this product again until they change it back. Sometimes change is a bad thing... and this is a bad thing!May sound odd, but Jockey makes women's panties that are FAR more comfortable compared to Elance bikinis for men!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.069562696", "1": "0.26266408", "2": "0.056630336", "3": "0.20586868", "4": "0.08497414", "5": "0.1967948", "6": "0.12350527"}}
