{"text": "I read a review and decided to go with the recommendation of going with a size larger......i should not have. I should have ordered my usual size of an 8. I didn't want to return them cause I didn't want to deal with exchange policy. I figured I would just give them to my friend. And then I remembered that on one of the reviews I read, it had said that u put them in the oven to mold them to your feet. So I thought I would give it a try, and I did. I placed my feet to the center of the sandals and molded them where they should of fit if they had been the right size....and it worked. They are really soft on my feet( little big), glad I didn't give then away. I would order them again, but I would order my size next time. I get them wet all the time and they dry really fast. They seem to be good qualify.....so far. I do like the color, just not the size.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2317612", "2": "0.19841072", "3": "0.2656425", "4": "0.16041458", "5": "0.11747918", "6": "0.023309257"}}
