{"text": "A favoured style of mine,very comfortable and with the wide fitting provides plenty of side support too,can wear for long periods of time.Having had a good many pairs of these I can say they look nice are comfortable and are reasonably priced,(especially if you shop around............or shopping on line with Amazon,bide your time.4 weeks ago these were $54 now $39 and some change)..............(noticed this after another reviewer mentioned she waited on a different product)................anyhoo,like a white sneaker goes well with blue or black jeans for a casual look.Will buy again.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.030519929", "1": "0.23768827", "3": "0.2240364", "4": "0.22689594", "5": "0.15845896", "6": "0.11970164"}}
