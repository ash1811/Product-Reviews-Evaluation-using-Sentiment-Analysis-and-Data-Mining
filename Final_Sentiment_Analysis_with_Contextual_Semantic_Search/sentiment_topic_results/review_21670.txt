{"text": "I just received this jewerly box today. It is for my daughter's b-day. It did have a visible scratch, not happy about this but I do not have the time to return it as the b-day is around the corner. The ballerina is cute and simple with black dots for eyes and a little smile. The music is very clear and at a nice volume. The mirror inside is not a plastic immitation and looks nice. Overall, I like this box better than another bought at a higher price. It plays the Swan lake melody as described. The other one I ordered promised the same but plays something else, So I thought it is worth mentioning. It is a pretty box, and worth it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18067014", "1": "0.31149283", "2": "0.15732166", "4": "0.14903855", "5": "0.10286748", "6": "0.0960427"}}
