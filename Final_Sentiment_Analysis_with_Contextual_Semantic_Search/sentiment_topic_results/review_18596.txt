{"text": "Wish I had ordered more the first time around.  Like other reviewers have mentioned, this shirt runs large.  The best size and cut for me is normally an XL trim/athletic fit shirt.  Due to the comments about sizing I ordered a large and it fits perfectly.  The shirt is a bit on the long side too so if you don't normally tuck in your shirt, this might be overly long for most guys (I'm 6'3\") The overall quality of this shirt is excellent - I'm ordering another after I finish this review.  The shirt has a nice cut and texture and the color (mine's red) is perfect and but not overly bright.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.030717492", "1": "0.48818335", "2": "0.06883566", "3": "0.13378698", "4": "0.047080535", "5": "0.13072589", "6": "0.10067013"}}
