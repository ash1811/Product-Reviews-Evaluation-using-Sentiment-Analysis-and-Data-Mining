{"text": "Easily my favorite sandals I've ever owned. I've had them for almost three years now, and I still wear them and they haven't worn out yet. I would definitely buy them again. The only thing you need to know is that those run a little smaller than usual. My shoes size usually is a 10.5-11 depending on the brand and the 9.5-10.5 fits perfectly. It was a little hard to get used to it in the beginning since it molds to one's feet, but as soon as that happened, it was the most comfortable pair of sandals I've ever owned!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.032831356", "1": "0.36758724", "2": "0.10585", "3": "0.34073535", "4": "0.09560737", "6": "0.054683186"}}
