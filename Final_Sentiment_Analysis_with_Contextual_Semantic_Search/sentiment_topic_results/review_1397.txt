{"text": "I go through about a bag per quarter because I'm so hard on them and carry so much. This bag has lasted longer than any other (so far.) It holds a TON! The water holder is nice and deep. Perfect for my travel mug. I love all the compartments. It's very comfortable to wear all day, though my back does get a little hot. I've also gotten many compliments on it. I adore the unique design. No issues with the zippers and it was tough enough to stand up to my dog rooting for my cough drops (I can't say the same for my previous bag).I would highly recommend this bag. When mine finally does die, I'll be purchasing another JanSport Big Student Backpack!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04357409", "1": "0.25265887", "2": "0.10159278", "3": "0.1911745", "4": "0.23027742", "5": "0.17853406"}}
