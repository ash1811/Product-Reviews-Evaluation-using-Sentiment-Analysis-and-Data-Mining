{"text": "These are great--very comfortable and easy to kick off when I want to curl up on the couch.  I own several pair in different colors and wear them more than any of my other shoes.  I do have flat feet though, so can't say how they fit on anyone with higher arches.  The bottoms are cushy and have plenty of support to prevent my plantar fasciitis flareups.
