{"text": "At 5'0&#34; I love finding good pants I don't have to shorten! These were a great fit. Not the sexiest, most stylish jeans in the world but for the price the fit was awesome. So 3 stars for comfort and fit, took 2 away because I can't say these were amazing. They are mom jeans! ;)2013 was the year I finally said enough and have been working to lose weight. at almost 60 pounds, I am trying to not buy a ton of clothes because I intend to keep losing. So I have been trying to find 2 or 3 things I can wear for a while and move on. Things I can wear through a size or 2 with a good belt :)As I was making my way towards 16 I got these because they had the elastic as I wasn't totally there yet. Now I am at a 14 and these are actually too big now and are working with a belt. They are comfortable, they are warm (I live in Chicago) they are fitting the bill. Great fit. If they had these in 14 I would buy them to keep me going down.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11710062", "1": "0.37418893", "2": "0.12193284", "4": "0.13334496", "5": "0.10635946", "6": "0.1445971"}}
