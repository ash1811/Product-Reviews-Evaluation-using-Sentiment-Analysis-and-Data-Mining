{"text": "Let me first say that I like the looks of this shoe and it was very comfortable to wear but I didn't like the way it \"flip flopped\" when I walked in it. I've never worn mules before but I take it they're not supposed to do that? I ordered in my usual size and it didn't feel too large but it just wouldn't stay on the back of my foot. I thought about exchanging it for a smaller size or maybe not a wide width but maybe my issues with this mule make it best for me to actually try it on in stores first.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.087211914", "1": "0.22772166", "2": "0.13721739", "3": "0.21350856", "4": "0.13294618", "5": "0.04616442", "6": "0.15522991"}}
