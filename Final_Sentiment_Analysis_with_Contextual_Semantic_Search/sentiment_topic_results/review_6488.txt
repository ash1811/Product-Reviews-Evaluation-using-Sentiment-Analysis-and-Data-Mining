{"text": "I have been wearing Thorlo Light Hikers for several years now. They last a long time. If it wasn't for a new puppy in the house I would not have had to order. You know puppies! These socks fit well, never bunch up in the shoe. Did I mention they last a long time? I spend a good part of each day walking and on my feet.
