{"text": "From the winters of Wisconsin, to the seasons of San Diego and the breezy Arizona mountains, I've always gone back to the only slipper that keeps my feet warm and is comfortable enough to wear year round.  My \"Old Friend\" moccasin.  A really Great Buy if you have big or wide feet, too! I'm on my 6th pair, as I wear them more than shoes.  They're just that comfortable!  You'll love them, too!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03376148", "1": "0.3138136", "2": "0.10500453", "3": "0.1901743", "4": "0.12687063", "5": "0.121239915", "6": "0.10913559"}}
