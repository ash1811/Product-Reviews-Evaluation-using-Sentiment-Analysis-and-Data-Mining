{"text": "It came exactly when expected, definetly not an xlarge, wish it would have been a little bigger, but still fits. Color isn't great, I ordered black and grey thinking it would be a decent looking grey, but its a crappy faded grey and even the black sleeves are faded, its just and all around cheap looking cotton shirt you'd get from somewhere like Walmart. Won't be ordering again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06761293", "1": "0.24150725", "2": "0.32878035", "3": "0.15763941", "5": "0.19729063"}}
