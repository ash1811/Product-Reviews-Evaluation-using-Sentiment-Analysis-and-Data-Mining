{"text": "I'd give 3.5 stars if I could.  They look great and seem well made. they are super lightweight which makes them comfy but if you have sensitive feet like I do, there is one thing that you may not like. The inside footbed has a pattern on it and since the footbed is a molded raised material, this bothers me some.  I prefer a smooth surface but again, it is because I am sensitive and it makes the bottom of my foot sore just like if you had tiny debris under your foot would.  The super light weight though really is fabulous. I also like that it has good toe room so your big toe does not rub on top.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08442478", "1": "0.34503382", "2": "0.10814507", "3": "0.07517927", "4": "0.15008503", "5": "0.18974403", "6": "0.047388006"}}
