{"text": "I purchase alll my husband's clothing and I have a keen eye for quality.  I purchased the stone washed jeans and the black ones, just for a change, and promptly returned them for the reliable black version.  The other color did not compare in texture to the black 550's. I don't understand the reason, but they are thicker by far.  i wash them inside out and the color stays true much longer than it takes to see visible wear and tear on the jeans. I purchased these not too long ago at a high end department store and they were exactly alike.  I also got them for far less than the department store jeans.  Buy them!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.071215324", "1": "0.32713497", "2": "0.1488309", "3": "0.1177809", "4": "0.17777005", "5": "0.056373395", "6": "0.10089448"}}
