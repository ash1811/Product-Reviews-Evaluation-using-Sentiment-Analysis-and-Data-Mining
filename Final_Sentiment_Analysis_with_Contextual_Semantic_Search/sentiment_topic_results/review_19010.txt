{"text": "I have owned three of these bras; just bought one in black again recently.  My advice on this one is if you are full in the cup, as in a full B, order a C cup.  The band size is fine.  Just beware of the small-ish cups.  Otherwise, nice bra:  5 stars for comfort.  The shaping is OK, but not as flattering as other bras in this category (underwired, stretch foam, molded/contour cup).  It kind of spreads them out rather than lifts them, but great for an everyday bra and if you want a natural look.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10383222", "1": "0.14194117", "2": "0.22213693", "3": "0.26389828", "4": "0.2326947", "6": "0.032628573"}}
