{"text": "Onsies are great.  They are a must have for any newborns wardrobe.  Great shower gifts.  I suggest buying in several sizes if giving as a gift.  People always buy the 0-3 or 0-6 month sizes for gifts, so people have a lot of things for their kid to wear until they are 6 months and then they have no clothes.  It is nice to give gifts of a staple item like this that will carry them through the 1st year.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20807257", "1": "0.19049738", "3": "0.21016017", "4": "0.042589996", "5": "0.17373347", "6": "0.17136696"}}
