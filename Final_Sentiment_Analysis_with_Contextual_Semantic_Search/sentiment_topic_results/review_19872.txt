{"text": "This will be a gift.  Chose because had the better ratings of all these \"cardboard\" jewelry boxes.  What happened to the decent ones from years gone by?  The iridescent finish is OK for a paper covering.  This is silver foil-type paper with pink & purple print. There are no flaws, cuts or tears in the finishing.  Unfortunately the base box is thin enough that this foil tends to bend and flex and may deteriorate with handling.  Perhaps it's the loose paper more than the thickness underneath but not a \"solid\" feel. The inside is finished cleanly.  The ballerina fairy is incredibly cheap, not a cute face and probably won't last long.  The music box is a horid tinny sound and like other reviews have stated, only plays one small segment of Swan Lake over and over.  Music boxes are inexpensive all by themselves and have much better sound than this.  Why can't they use one of those to put in here?  Overall it had potential.  It's cute, will be liked for the moment and end up being another discarded item for the land fill in the not too distant future.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2960822", "1": "0.2211429", "2": "0.1795935", "3": "0.07372916", "4": "0.09129432", "5": "0.054702513", "6": "0.083455406"}}
