{"text": "I bought these to put in a pair of Ugg Cargo Boots that look pretty good on the outside but are all matted and gross on the inside. I couldn't get the old insole out, so I just popped this one in on top and the boots fit like new. Kinda snug, but once I wear these insoles down they will be perfect. (I wear mine barefoot.)I also ended up re-ordering these to put in some other pairs of boots (Minnetonka Pug and Emu Stinger Mini) and the insoles worked for those pairs as well. Overall I was very impressed with the quality of these insoles. I usually get a new pair of sheepskin boots every year, but I think I can skip this year since I am increasing the lifetime of all my current pairs of boots. Yayy Insoles!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08498663", "1": "0.25159967", "2": "0.085744314", "3": "0.1492101", "4": "0.29951385", "6": "0.12663287"}}
