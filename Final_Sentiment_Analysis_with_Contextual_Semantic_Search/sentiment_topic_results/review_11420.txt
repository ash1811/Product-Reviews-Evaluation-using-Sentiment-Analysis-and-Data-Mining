{"text": "This apron is beautifully made, has great coverage, and the pocket is very handy. I like the fact that the ties are made of the same material as the body of the apron. The color is lovely.For me, there is one problem, though. I live in a warm, humid, climate. I tend to be warm myself. I find that even with the a/c on, the apron seems to add a lot more warmth than the &#34;cheapie&#34; aprons that I usually pick up at the flea market.As a result, I find that I can only use this apron comfortably in the cooler weather.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03393603", "1": "0.29923642", "2": "0.13013573", "3": "0.3219991", "5": "0.12003215", "6": "0.09179179"}}
