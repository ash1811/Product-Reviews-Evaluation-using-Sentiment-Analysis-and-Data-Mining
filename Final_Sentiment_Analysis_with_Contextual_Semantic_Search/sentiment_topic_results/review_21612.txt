{"text": "My husband had a similar jacket (different brand) that he had had for 15 years. It had always been his favorite but was wearing out. He liked the gathered cuffs and gathered waistband which I found was hard to find in many jackets nowadays. I searched online through every brand name and site--and found just what I was looking for in this jacket. (And best price on Amazon.)  Ordered it for Christmas--had his company's logo embroidered on the back--and he was a happy camper. A few weeks later a friend asked where we got it, and he too went online and ordered the same jacket in his size. It's warm enough to be either a light coat or warm jacket. Very versatile and looks sharp.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.199093", "1": "0.20063873", "2": "0.1878956", "3": "0.15778987", "4": "0.14073415", "5": "0.060200166", "6": "0.053648464"}}
