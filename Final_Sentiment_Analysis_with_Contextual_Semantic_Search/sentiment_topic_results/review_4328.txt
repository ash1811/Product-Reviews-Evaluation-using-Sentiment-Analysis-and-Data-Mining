{"text": "Picky husband accepted these. He is very tall, and particular about clothing. Lots of specifications to the way they have to fit him besides just a simple waist and leg measurement (38w 34inseam). He talks about \"rise\" and whether or not the thigh area is generous enough. I just keep trying, and return them if they are rejected. He was pleased with the fit of these, and I was happy because they are wrinkle resistant.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.0717102", "1": "0.20765868", "2": "0.27511674", "3": "0.17889035", "4": "0.16096991", "6": "0.10167688"}}
