{"text": "I collect house dresses. I usually find them at thrift stores and have a variety of patterns and styles. My mom makes fun of me for this but recently had surgery and i bought this for her and she loves it. The fabric is not thin. Its medium weight and wrinkle free. The pattern is very pretty, but the style is even prettier. With mid sleeves and a collar, it can be dressed up with a string of pearls and flats and just looks and feels great. The snaps are strong and pockets are deep. The colors are deep but not tacky or too bright.  The price is good so i will be ordering a few more for myself. As someone who owns over 30 house dresses, i can honestly say this is my favorite. I am 5'5&#34; and wear a size 18. The xl fits with room to spare. Love this item!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14598683", "1": "0.3758345", "2": "0.08791861", "3": "0.12818299", "4": "0.052830484", "5": "0.17663755", "6": "0.03260902"}}
