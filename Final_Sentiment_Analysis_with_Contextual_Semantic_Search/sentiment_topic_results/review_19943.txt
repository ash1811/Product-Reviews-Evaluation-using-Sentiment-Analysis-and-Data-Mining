{"text": "I took this backpack on a two-week African safari as my only piece of luggage. I had it stuffed with all my clothes, camera gear, etc. so it was extremely heavy and stuffed to bulging. The backpack supported the weight without feeling uncomfortable and without slipping of the straps or ripping. The breathable mesh on the back is terrific for hiking in heat. I like how this pack has several compartment so it's easy to keep everything in its own place. The back compartment has a cushioned space for an iPad or laptop -- perfect. Even though it's inexpensive, this backpack withstood the worst abuse I dish out. My gear did not get wet in the rain, the zippers never caught, and the nylon never snagged. I'd buy this again in a heartbeat for travel, camping, or as a book bag. It expands to a huge size, but if you are carrying a lighter load there are clips to make the bag more compact. It fit under my seat on all airlines, which is really saying something considering the volume it holds.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16897899", "1": "0.21586917", "2": "0.2838484", "3": "0.06125951", "4": "0.07058041", "5": "0.041147985", "6": "0.1583155"}}
