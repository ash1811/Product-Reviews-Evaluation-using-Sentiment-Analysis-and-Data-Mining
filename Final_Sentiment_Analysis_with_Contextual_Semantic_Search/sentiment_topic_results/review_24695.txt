{"text": "These are some of the most comfortable sandles I've ever had.  The first pair I bought was on a whim while vacationing in Hawaii.  I needed a pair of sandals and these did the trick.  I ended up wearing them ALL the time and they wore out, so I bought another pair on Amazon to replace the first pair.  I'll be buying another pair soon.  There is a bottle opener on the bottom of the sandals, which is funny.  I've actually used it a couple times in a pinch.  I've seen other Reef sandals with a comb in the bottom, or a tiny flask.  Great conversation piece as well!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.22003286", "2": "0.10780998", "3": "0.14247842", "4": "0.21874295", "5": "0.20382659", "6": "0.101965666"}}
