{"text": "I bought this bra because the first person who reviewed it was a bra specialist and she said it was great. It did not look like the greatest thing in the world when I looked at it, but I took her word and ordered it. She was absolutely correct! I wear an Unfindable size: 42C: that is it is unfindable at Dillards, Maceys etc. It is frequently difficult to find on the web. Finding one that is half way feminine is almost a \"forget it\" issue. But this bra does pretty well. It fits like a dream. It looks pretty feminine. AND, I can get it in the elusisive WHITE without paying full price. I am back to buy another in a different color and thought it was My Turn to step up and say how it went. It went great. So go ahead and try it. I bought 3 different sizes when I first ordered because I was not convinced that it was true to size. But I had to send the two extra back. It does fit. It does work. And, it looks A LOT sexier than that thing I gave up and purchased at the discount store. So, go ahead, try it. You will like it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12809071", "1": "0.36992463", "2": "0.1532658", "3": "0.14614557", "4": "0.03238326", "5": "0.04238098", "6": "0.12780906"}}
