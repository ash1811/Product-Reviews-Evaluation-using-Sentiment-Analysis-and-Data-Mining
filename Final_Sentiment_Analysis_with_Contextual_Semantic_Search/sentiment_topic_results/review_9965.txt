{"text": "I've been using this watch often for around a year now and I really like it. Its very light and feels better on my wrist than other sports watches I own. I don't seem to have much use for any of the functions other than the stopwatch feature. I really like timex's intuitive programing. This is probably the easiest digital watch to program I've ever had due to the built in prompting on the buttons. Its very well thought out. I've also gotten it wet without any problems.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.2718175", "2": "0.18982418", "3": "0.14221409", "4": "0.12588356", "5": "0.16157573", "6": "0.105684035"}}
