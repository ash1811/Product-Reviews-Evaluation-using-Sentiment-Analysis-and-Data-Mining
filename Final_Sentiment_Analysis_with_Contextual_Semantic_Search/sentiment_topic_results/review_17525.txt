{"text": "I am a fan of CASIO watches. I was fascinated  by this watch with lot of technical features,including world time setting , stop watch and nice analogue display apart from digital display..Above all, it has 10 year battery...It is water resistant too and has alarm setting . How did Casio engineers do all this?! Well, it is a Japanese design.It was easy to set the time with the instruction booklet, though the booklet letter size is very small, tiring my eyes.A nice buy and I strongly recommend for all tech-savvy users, though non-technical persons may be put off by too many features and buttons.The price is just right, for a watch with Japan quartz movement ,cased in China as the writing at the back  tells.I hope this watch serves me for several years as the old CASIO one I used did for nearly 10 years.!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18018924", "1": "0.104877695", "2": "0.19229119", "3": "0.06286926", "4": "0.24328706", "5": "0.15545306", "6": "0.061032504"}}
