{"text": "This was a watch I dearly wanted to like. It looked like it had it all. A FULL analog display, with the digital display BELOW it, instead of hidden underneath the analog hands for 4 hours every day. Design was nice, simple, neutral colors, and the watch itself is not too large to fit on smaller wrists.Perfection? well... not quite! I don't know how Casio's engineers did it, but it is almost as if they purposefully designed the plastic cover of the digital display to catch nearly all angles of light. Then they recessed the display DEEPLY back into the watch face, so if your angle gets too sharp, you can't read it.... But you also can't read it head-on due to glare! You end up having to play hide-and-go-seek anytime you want to read the digital display, carefully angling your wrist until you find the sweet spot. You end up doing that instead of the simple action of just looking at your wrist, noting the time, and moving on with your day. I returned it after less than two days.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.2074741", "1": "0.059350476", "2": "0.18244605", "3": "0.15638803", "4": "0.09681493", "5": "0.15101677", "6": "0.14650965"}}
