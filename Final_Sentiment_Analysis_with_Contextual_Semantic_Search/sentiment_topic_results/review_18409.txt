{"text": "This garment bag works well for my needs. I have used it on several trips holding my formal clothes as a carry on. I love the pocket space for extra shoes, wallet, and other loose items. I have carried as many as three dresses and two pairs of slacks at a time with room to spare. My only concern would be that like the others stated it could really use a shoulder strap to carry it with. It does start to get a bit heavy after a while.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.22324394", "2": "0.0993529", "3": "0.2306141", "4": "0.23547415", "6": "0.20546263"}}
