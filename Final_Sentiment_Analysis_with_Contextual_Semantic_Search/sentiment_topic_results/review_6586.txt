{"text": "I had purchased Thorlo hiking socks before and loved them.  These are very nice too.  I was looking for something that would be more versatile than the white/khaki colored socks and found these.  I wear a size 8.5 ladies shoe (US) and these fit my foot very well.  I plan to order more in the near future.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21507698", "1": "0.25278926", "2": "0.12977967", "4": "0.16437674", "5": "0.10678171", "6": "0.12656222"}}
