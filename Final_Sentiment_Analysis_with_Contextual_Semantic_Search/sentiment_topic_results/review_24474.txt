{"text": "I bought the smallest (size C) Superfeet Orange to replace a  (too hard) Green pair for my hiking shoes.The arch area does seem slightly different.  These ARE wider in the toebox -- but can be trimmed down.I am wearing them in my hiking shoes for walking my dog at wet parks.What I did NOT forsee is that the nice cushioned forefoot area has a bit of a GAP after the plastic arch itself.  I needed the higher arch of the Green combined with the cushioning of the Berry.  Seems to work adequately -- but not wonderfully well for MY purpose.Should be a great insole for a high-arched male.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17611636", "1": "0.24027997", "2": "0.27299067", "3": "0.13974494", "4": "0.054761026", "5": "0.066905", "6": "0.049202017"}}
