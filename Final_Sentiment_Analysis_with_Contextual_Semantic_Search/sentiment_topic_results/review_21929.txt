{"text": "I am 5'6&#34;, weight 110, and a 32C. I ordered the 32C and it was quite tight under the bust, but then there was all this extra material in the actual bust itself.  Which was weird since it was also tight in the bust and had me all smushed down looking like a boy.  The straps were also too long, so when the bra was on, the straps were loose.  I'm not really that picky usually, especially when no one will see it under my clothes when I run, but this fit was just bad and it looked really bad.  The material felt nice though!  This is going to be returned.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1266636", "1": "0.3854225", "2": "0.154413", "3": "0.16648334", "4": "0.16139664"}}
