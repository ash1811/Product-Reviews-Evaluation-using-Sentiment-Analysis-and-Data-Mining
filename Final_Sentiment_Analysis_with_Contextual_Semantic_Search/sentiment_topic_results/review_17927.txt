{"text": "I'm returning this watch after only two weeks, but it's a watch that's worth considering if you want a straightforward, good-looking watch.The reason I'm returning it is that the main reason I ordered it was that I expected it to be easier to read in low light without glasses than my current black-face analog watch, but to my surprise it isn't, mostly because the hands on this watch are thinner.  Overall, however, this is an easy watch to read.There is one thing I disliked about it is the band.  It looks really cheap and doesn't do the watch justice.  I bought a Speidel leather band that would have looked great on this watch.  It's the &#34;20mm Speidel Genuine Calfskin Leather Padded Stitched TAN Brown Mens Tone on Tone Stitching Watch Band Strap&#34;.One big concern I have about this watch is the crystal possibly becoming badly scratched.  There aren't many mentions in reviews about it happening, but I know it's been a big problem on many other Casio watches in recent years, including my two most recent Casio watches. They never used to scratch like this.  My current Casio, an AQ150W-1EV Ana-Digi Chronograph Sport Watch, has 1&#34; long raised ridges around the crystal at the 12 and 6 o'clock positions, yet it still has scratches.  The MQ24-7B has no protection and looks like it's guaranteed to get scratched, but perhaps it's being made with better quality crystal that resists scratching.One thing that took getting used to for me was the small diameter of the watch body.  The watch face itself is about the same size as my other watches, but the body is so much narrower and thinner that at first it doesn't seem like a men's watch.  If you like a large watch, don't buy this one, but if you want a straightforward, good looking watch (except for the band!) that gets good reviews, this is an ideal choice, especially at the current price of $8.27.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14108604", "1": "0.16021399", "2": "0.31293917", "3": "0.22314638", "4": "0.051680777", "6": "0.108688526"}}
