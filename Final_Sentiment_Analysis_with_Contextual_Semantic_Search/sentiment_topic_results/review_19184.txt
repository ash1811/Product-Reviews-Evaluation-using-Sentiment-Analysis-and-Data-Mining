{"text": "I have worn Rx sunglasses for years. I've always worn RayBans and didn't think I'd wear anything else. The only down side to Rx.lenses, is that you don't get the factory lens and the quality seems to vary. Recently it was time for new sunglasses. Instead of my usual choice I picked up the Maui Jim StingRays, liked the look and decided they were the ones. I expected the usual aftermarket Rx lens, but not Maui Jim. They do their lenses in-house, so you get the full quality. And these are hands down the finest quality lenses I've ever used, the difference is amazing. It's akin to old TV vs HD TV. I can't imagine ever owning another brand of sunglasses. Yes Maui Jims are really expensive, it's hard to justify the expense until you wear them. So if you want to save money, never wear a pair of Maui Jim sunglasses, once you do, you will never wear anything else.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.26873285", "1": "0.21788475", "2": "0.10280511", "3": "0.12554975", "4": "0.100558534", "5": "0.07564032", "6": "0.10882873"}}
