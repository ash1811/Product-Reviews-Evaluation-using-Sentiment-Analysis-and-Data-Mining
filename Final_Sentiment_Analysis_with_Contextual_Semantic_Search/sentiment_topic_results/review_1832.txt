{"text": "My daughter has worn these moccasins almost every day since the order arrived, and she just loves them.  They fit perfectly, the color is as shown in the picture, they are extremely comfortable and she's received a lot of compliments about them, so she really couldn't be happier.She wears them mostly indoors, in the house, in and out of various stores, school, etc, and noted that they *are* softsole moccasins, which means that they might wear down more quickly if constantly worn on cement or other rough surfaces.  Don't get me wrong; the quality is really good, and this is only a reminder that the soles are soft.Recommended!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06545629", "1": "0.4447264", "2": "0.23483068", "5": "0.11036842", "6": "0.13929264"}}
