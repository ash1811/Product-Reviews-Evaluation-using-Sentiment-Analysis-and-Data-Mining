{"text": "Very, Very Nice! I am very happy with this jewelry box that I got to protect my &#34;real&#34; jewelry.It is medium sized but not too large, so it fits on my dressing table without taking over.The leather is an elegant understated color rather than the vivid purple shown in the photo. It looks much more expensive than it was and has plenty of room.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07215647", "1": "0.4584848", "2": "0.115587644", "3": "0.06490128", "4": "0.15005237", "5": "0.03964668", "6": "0.099170804"}}
