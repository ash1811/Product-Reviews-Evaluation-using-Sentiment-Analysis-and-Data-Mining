{"text": "All the basic watch \"tune-up\" tools are here in one place and will probably work for their intended purpose.  However, as some other reviewers have noted, the overall quality of the tools is poor, so some of them may only work a few times! I am particularly annoyed with the screwdrivers, whose tips break too easily. That being said, watch tools seem to come at only 2 price points: quite cheap (like this set) and quite expensive (for example, Amazon sells a 9-piece Bergeon screwdriver set for about $140!).  So if you will only seldom use the tools, it might be ok to settle for this set; it will be cheaper than having a watch shop change your batteries or bracelets a few times. But be aware that there are no instructions on how to use the tools so you will need to go to Youtube for that info. If you do not want to do that, skip this item and see your jeweler. If you are a more serious hobbyist or collector, I'd piece together better quality tools.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11077221", "1": "0.22547047", "2": "0.18890774", "3": "0.14016722", "4": "0.15618756", "5": "0.058577128", "6": "0.119917706"}}
