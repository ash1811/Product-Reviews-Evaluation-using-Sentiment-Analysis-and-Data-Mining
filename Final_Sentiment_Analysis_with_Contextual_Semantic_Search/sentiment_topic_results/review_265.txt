{"text": "I love this bag, it is so roomy and yet so lightweight.  Easy on/off unlike some others with too long straps trying to figure out what goes where.  There was also a good selection of colors but me being conservative went for navy.  You absolutely can not go wrong with this bag.  It is well made and should last several years.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06565505", "1": "0.4546074", "2": "0.2023357", "4": "0.18497923", "6": "0.083457835"}}
