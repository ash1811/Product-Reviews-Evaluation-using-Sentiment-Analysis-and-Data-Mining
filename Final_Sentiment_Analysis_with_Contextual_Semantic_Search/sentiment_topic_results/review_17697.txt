{"text": "Good basic watch with some interesting features.  Don't know how many things like the phone book, stop watch, world time are important.  Overall, exactly as I expected.

May have to get new glasses!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13028239", "1": "0.24874167", "2": "0.15425049", "3": "0.0683969", "4": "0.16855268", "5": "0.111600295", "6": "0.11817556"}}
