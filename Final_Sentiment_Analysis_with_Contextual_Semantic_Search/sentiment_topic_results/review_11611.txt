{"text": "I always order Levi's slim fit corduroys and so thought it would be fine to get these in the same style.  The trousers are good quality and look sharp, but are a little tight in the thigh.  I'm an avid cyclist, though, and consequently have big quads; my guess is that slim guys with normal-sized thighs would find the fit to be better.  I'm still happy with them overall - the fit in the waist is standard and the length is perfect.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09792272", "1": "0.2936699", "2": "0.07072723", "3": "0.0552265", "4": "0.18690662", "5": "0.076419525", "6": "0.2191275"}}
