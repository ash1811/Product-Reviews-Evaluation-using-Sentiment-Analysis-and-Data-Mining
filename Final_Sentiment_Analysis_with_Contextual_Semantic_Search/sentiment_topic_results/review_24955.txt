{"text": "I just got a new pair of Superfeet after a couple of years using a similar product and the difference is amazing.  Superfeet has great support in the heel as well as the arch - something I was missing in the other product I was using.  You do need to know what kind of arch your foot has (high, low, average) to determine what color of Superfeet to get.  If you aren't used to the arch support that Superfeet offers, it takes a little time to get accustomed to it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1435101", "1": "0.19740644", "3": "0.31768838", "4": "0.039503034", "5": "0.24753499", "6": "0.05117495"}}
