{"text": "I got these 5 days ago and I have been wearing them non-stop. I guess I didn't read the sizing correctly, as I got a medium and I wear a size 8.5 shoe.  Medium = 6.5-7.5 in these slippers, but they still fit me.  SO comfortable and not bulky like most slippers are. Definately buy these! :)  They are a great price!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06524334", "1": "0.305978", "2": "0.15421973", "3": "0.16314809", "4": "0.101826765", "6": "0.20523709"}}
