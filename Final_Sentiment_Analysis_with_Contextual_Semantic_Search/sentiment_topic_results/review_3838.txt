{"text": "These are nice pants, which is a shame that the description doesn't identify the sizing dilemma.  Several other reviews claim the sizing is gender neutral, but neither Amazon (nor this manufacturer) provide such a sizing chart (you can only go by men's, women's, or kids'), so you don't even know what size you should order.  Even when you return the first pair, you still don't really know what size you should get instead -- it's just a best guess.  You end up playing the return/re-order game, and who has time for that?After the third pair of pants in the wrong size, I returned everything, went to a local department store, bought standard sized men's cargo pants, cut/hemmed them at the capris length.  Done.Overall, again, these are great pants, but when ordering over the internet they really need to provide an accurate size chart.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.073683925", "1": "0.29115176", "2": "0.120441794", "3": "0.14793634", "4": "0.09821131", "5": "0.06278967", "6": "0.20578521"}}
