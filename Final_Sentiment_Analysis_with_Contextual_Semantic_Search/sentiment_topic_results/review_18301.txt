{"text": "3 and a half stars.First, the Amazon Partner who is selling this, J & R Music & Computer World, gets a 5 star rating from me, the watch arrived very fast and in excellent condition.The watch itself gets the 3 and a half because, while the actual purchase price is \"$9.99\", the crossed-out list price is \"$24.95\". I expected a little more from a $25.00 Casio. My complaints: The illumination is a small side light, not an entire screen brightness like with other Casios or Indiglow style. The stop-watch goes only to 59 Minutes, 59 Seconds.Good things:1-button press to go from 12 to 24 hour time, alarm function, hourly beep, light weight, slim profile, 50 meter water resistant, 7-year battery, and easy to use.Maybe I'm overly critical, this is a good $10.00 watch, but an average $25.00 watch.[EDIT]:Having had this watch for several months now, I find that it keeps better time than a much more expensive digital watch that I had bought at Disney World. The Disney watch looks great and is all metal, but runs faster than the Casio. I compare and set the time of all my watches to my Casio Atomic/Solar MTG920DA, which receives a time calibration every day from the Atomic clock in Fort Collins, CO.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09875051", "1": "0.11215998", "2": "0.2550173", "3": "0.1794699", "4": "0.17202038", "5": "0.05111535", "6": "0.13146655"}}
