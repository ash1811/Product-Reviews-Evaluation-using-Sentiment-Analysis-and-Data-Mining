{"text": "I would agree these are the softest socks, next to slipper socks. Feels like you feet are wrapped up in cashmere. I do experience a little bit of a bind at the top- not too bad though compared to what most socks do to my legs. I will probably buy another pair or two. They are best for wear with casual pants/jeans, but can also be worn with black work slacks and a comfy shoe.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.039514013", "1": "0.25887182", "2": "0.09654442", "3": "0.18171312", "4": "0.0802041", "5": "0.12278416", "6": "0.22036831"}}
