{"text": "I love long-sleeved onesies for babies and this brand has become a new favorite. They are soft and fit pretty well, but I highly recommend buying a size up than what you think you need. They seem to provide plenty of room in the tummy area but aren't as long in the arms or from the neck to the bottom as the Gerber brand onesies we also have. I agree with the other reviewers who have mentioned that the leg openings are high and tend to ride up, but they still seem comfortable for my son. When I bought them, I was indifferent about the blue stitching, but it turns out the stitching adds a nice cuteness factor. I will very likely be buying the next size up in these once my son outgrows the set we just got.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.42094928", "3": "0.30590382", "4": "0.057349395", "5": "0.124984875", "6": "0.085869595"}}
