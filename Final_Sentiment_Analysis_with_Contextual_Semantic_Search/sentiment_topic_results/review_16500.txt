{"text": "This bag has great style and a ton of room (I got the large).  The extra bag that it came packed in was a nice touch and can be used to stash the big bag in your suitcase as an extra piece of luggage for the return trip.  My disappointment is in the durability factor. The material is rather thin and on its own has no structure.  I am sure that it will be fine for carrying a lot of stuff but I'm not sure how long it will stand up to the rigors of travel.  I bought this for a motorcycle trip out west and I believe it will be fine for that purpose but if you are buying it for many trips in fairly rough conditions you may be disappointed. It looked like it was double material (lined) in the picture but it is single ply.  For the price........pretty good.  It got a 4 start only because I like the look and they added the extra storage bag as a bonus otherwise a 3.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.24890731", "2": "0.3094441", "3": "0.16963543", "4": "0.03704035", "5": "0.09058814", "6": "0.14156845"}}
