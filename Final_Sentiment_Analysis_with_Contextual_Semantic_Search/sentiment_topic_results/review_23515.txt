{"text": "Watch is beautiful !!!  Rating is 4.5 for overall. Reason for the half star off is the time keeping runs 18/20 seconds fast per day. This is not awful but still pretty fast. Thankful this is a hackable watch !!! And a hand wind so it only takes a few seconds in the morning to sync. To have get a hackable hand wind in this price range is awesome !!! My watch came with 24 jewels not the 21 listed in the description and is Japanese movement nh35a movement. The watch is a deep rich blue with gold like plated accents. The watch face is an even 40mm and fits perfect !! Backing of the watch is clear and very nicely done. This watch looks very similar to the submariner. All solid links except for the end links and to be expected for under $100 dollars. This is my 3rd invicta and quality is there for the most part. My first watch received from amazon had a small red marking on the inside of the watch face ... Amazon quickly processed a replacement for me !! The bezel is very nice with great ratcheting action. The crown is screw down and therefore should help with water resistance though I do not plan on swimming or diving with this watch. &#34;Cyclops &#34; viewer is nice and really magnifies date. Easy watch to read and as mentioned good value overall. I suggest you buy from amazon directly as there costumer service is the best in the business !!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1740214", "1": "0.20763427", "2": "0.3129982", "3": "0.119776644", "5": "0.09729695", "6": "0.08606992"}}
