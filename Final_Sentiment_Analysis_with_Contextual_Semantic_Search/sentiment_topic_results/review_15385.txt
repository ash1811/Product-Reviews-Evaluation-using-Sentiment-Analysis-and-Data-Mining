{"text": "I have a small frame so the classic wayfarers are a little too big for me. This is just perfect. I can wear with anything and it looks good. I bought the black frame with black lenses. It is definitely worth buying an original since the quality of the lens is infinite times better.I bought this a while back and they have not scratched or broken, I think this is a record for me. The case on the other hand... the tip of the flap below the button has snapped off. A little disappointed. I wish I could buy just the case since I prefer a hard case to a soft one since the glasses live in my overstuffed purse and protects it better.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20187837", "1": "0.34119377", "2": "0.25770995", "3": "0.09198579", "4": "0.027425813", "6": "0.07737738"}}
