{"text": "I generally wear a 101/2 or 11 shoe so I went with 11s for this pair of Sanuks but they run a bit snug.  I am not sure if they will flex or stretch. They look great and the grey color is almost a silvery grey but not shiny.  I got them on sale from Amazon for a lot less then you can generally find Sanuk's so I am happy overall, just hoping they will stretch a bit.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12637402", "2": "0.11856314", "3": "0.20134646", "4": "0.19228463", "5": "0.14791358", "6": "0.209636"}}
