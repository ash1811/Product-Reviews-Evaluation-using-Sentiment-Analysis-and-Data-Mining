{"text": "I ordered my best beloved another pair just yesterday. He'd said, &#34;I'd really like another pair but they're too expensive.&#34; No, sez I, $14 for a good pair of comfortable socks you need is NOT too much. He's a very big guy, 6'4&#34;, and a bit overweight, but also truly big-boned AND big-footed (feeted?) (I married a Sasquatch!?!), so regular knit socks A) are NEVER big enough (he wears size 13 shoes) and B) leave painful marks on his calves. These are also warm (he's recently worked outdoors a lot in Ohio). Will update if something awful suddenly happens with the socks - like if they fall apart in the wash, or hubby is now able to more speedily run off with a super model.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.052675307", "1": "0.1882869", "2": "0.21547274", "3": "0.14800473", "4": "0.16413681", "5": "0.12096591", "6": "0.11045765"}}
