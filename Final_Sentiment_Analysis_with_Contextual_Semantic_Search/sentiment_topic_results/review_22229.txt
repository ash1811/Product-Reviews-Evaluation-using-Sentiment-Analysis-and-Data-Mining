{"text": "The description says these socks are seamless - they absolutely are not.  I had a big seam going down every toe which caused constant rubbing.  These socks are so uncomfortable and rubbed my toes/toe webbing so much that I had to take them off after 20 minutes of use (my toes are now sore).  I *highly* recommend you pass on these socks - I will be returning mine.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.044142023", "1": "0.240067", "2": "0.18691926", "3": "0.06269893", "5": "0.2501189", "6": "0.21183527"}}
