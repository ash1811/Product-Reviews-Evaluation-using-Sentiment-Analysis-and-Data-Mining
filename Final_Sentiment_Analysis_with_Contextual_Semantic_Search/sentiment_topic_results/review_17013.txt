{"text": "The quality of the shirt is rather good but the sizing is way off. I read this comment from other reviews but decided to take a chance as there were sufficient positive reviews to substantiate making the purchase. This is something which I believe the seller can easily correct. It was a bit frustrating to have to go through the process of doing the return and having to go out and look for another shirt at the mall.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.46736428", "2": "0.12948969", "3": "0.109372176", "4": "0.13977726", "6": "0.1458099"}}
