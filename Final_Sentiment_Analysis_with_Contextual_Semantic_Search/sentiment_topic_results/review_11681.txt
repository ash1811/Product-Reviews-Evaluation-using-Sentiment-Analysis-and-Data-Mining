{"text": "These earrings are really pretty.  They look exactly like the picture on Amazon.  I got these on a Lightning Deal for $40, which I thought was a good price for gold earrings.  Unlike some reviewers, I like the 8mm size.  It is big enough to be seen clearly, without being too big to overpower the look.  I bought these earrings to match/coordinate with the Duragold 14k yellow gold beaded ball necklace.  They match perfectly.  So glad I got these.  If you are looking for a simple and classic look, then I would definitely recommend these earrings.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12276462", "1": "0.33744913", "2": "0.20537803", "3": "0.16417114", "4": "0.07473955", "5": "0.030385312", "6": "0.0651122"}}
