{"text": "Great looking watch.  Looks good, runs fine, tells time and comes at a bargain price of under twenty dollars! What's not to like? It was a birthday gift for our son. We had bought him black pants, red shirt, and a red/black tie so when we saw this watch we thought it would look sharp and, as my wife says, complete the look of the outfit. He was pleased with everything and agreed the watch was a perfect choice. ~ The Boss", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14057389", "1": "0.32669246", "2": "0.27196482", "3": "0.11783483", "4": "0.048320927", "5": "0.040483486", "6": "0.05412956"}}
