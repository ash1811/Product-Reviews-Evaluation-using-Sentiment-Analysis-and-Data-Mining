{"text": "I'm picky about my boxers, and for many years I only purchased fashion boxers (Calvin Klein, Banana Republic, Express, etc).  Last year during a work trip I had to purchase some extra boxers, and I ended up purchasing a pack of Hanes ComfortSoft knit boxers.I have to say I'm very impressed by these boxers.  These are very soft- Hanes advertises them as being \"T-shirt soft\", and I have to say they are softer than t-shirts.  The key is the combination of 75% cotton/25% polyester.  I opened up a pack of 100% cotton Hanes Premium boxers at a store, and found they are not nearly as soft as the poly blend.  So I'd advise against the 100% cotton version.The boxers I purchased last year are holding up quite well.  So I decided to purchase another pack from Amazon.  The only negative is that the latest version of these boxers have a longer length.  Unfortunately, I've noticed longer length is a trend with all underwear companies right now (I don't like it when boxers are basically the same length as a pair of shorts).Despite the longer length, I still highly recommend these due to the super soft material and low price per unit.EDIT: I read in GQ Magazine that polyester blend underwear can reduce your sperm count.  So you may want to stay away from these if you are trying to father children.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.35010985", "2": "0.044986553", "3": "0.12067391", "4": "0.14524645", "5": "0.07526496", "6": "0.26150614"}}
