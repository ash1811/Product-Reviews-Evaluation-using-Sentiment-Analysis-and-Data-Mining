{"text": "This earring screen is a life saver! I use it to hold all of my stud earrings and earrings that are less than a 1 inch dangle. I used to use it for my longer earrings but it gets crowed really easy and can be hard to take earrings off (especially studs) if you have too many earrings on it. I like using it for studs because you can pick it up and move it around easily without having to worry about earrings falling off. Great product and I would recommend this to a friend.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15126735", "1": "0.40630105", "2": "0.11058434", "3": "0.045669805", "5": "0.1499713", "6": "0.1331429"}}
