{"text": "These are not great glasses. The frames feel flimsy, all three of the pairs had small imperfections in the mirroring and there's no flex to the frame at all.That being said, I got three pairs. And the imperfections are small enough that you have to be looking for them. The big plus is that these are dark, dark, dark lenses. Wear them indoors and you'll barely be able to see anything.So, it's a mixed bag. I don't regret the purchase, but I don't think they're awesome.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17232238", "1": "0.16754422", "2": "0.09220705", "3": "0.40347564", "4": "0.15777978"}}
