{"text": "Well, I have to agree with all the other reviews.  This is a lovely watch and just the right size for a slim wrist such as mine.  Received today and wore immediately.  Will look great with jeans as well as dressier clothes.  Some found it hard to read the time, but I don't even without my readers. The band is soft, slim and comfortable, and the black face is striking, especially with the little crystal accent. Understated elegance.  I agree with another reviewer...it could pass for a Movado!  It arrived quickly and was nicely and securely packaged.  So glad I bought this watch!!  My husband who is a VERY tough critic thought it was very pretty, as well.  Two thumbs up!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11702253", "1": "0.2932369", "2": "0.12905017", "3": "0.12877373", "4": "0.16090094", "5": "0.13835143", "6": "0.032664318"}}
