{"text": "Once I got the size nailed down,  this shoe is just great. Great fit, build, support, and superior comfort. If you want to order this shoe and have not had the opportunity to try on start with your normal size. I normally wear an 8.5-9, wide if available. In Keen sandals I wear a 9. Most reviewers did well with their normal size. Due to the duck shaped feet I walk around on I had to go down to a size 8 in this shoe to get the proper length. This is more likely due to my odd feet and maybe my true size if I could get true wide widths. Wide forefoot with toes that do not have a great difference in length, thinner heel, high instep, medium arch. Amazon's superb return policy allows me to shop shoes on line and some of the most comfortable shoes are only available to me here. I wear these everyday. The more I wear them the better they feel. Have worn them in the rain and to my surprise the light gray did not stain or discolor, nor did I get wet feet. I love, love, love, them and have ordered another color in this style.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.105154", "1": "0.27476522", "2": "0.13597283", "3": "0.18389402", "4": "0.05055018", "5": "0.076051764", "6": "0.173612"}}
