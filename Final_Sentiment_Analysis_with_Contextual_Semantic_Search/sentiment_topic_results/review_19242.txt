{"text": "GF had big old Micheal Kors clunker with a massive faux lock on it which eventually fell off, so replaced it with this.  Basic nice color, incredibly convenient and practical.  Nyon inside and leather out, makes for a solid functional peice of kit and the color makes for it being very eye catching and pleasant at the same time.  For the price it is amazing.  Wouldn't get anything other than this unless you wanted the words Prada or Kate Spade on it somewhere.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14947481", "1": "0.119676255", "2": "0.22830391", "3": "0.22020529", "4": "0.1167649", "5": "0.039510712", "6": "0.12606414"}}
