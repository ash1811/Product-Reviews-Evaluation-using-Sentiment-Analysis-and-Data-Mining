{"text": "While this underwear is initially great, they do ride immensely after a bit of walking around.  I say \"initially\" because, when you put them on for the first time, they really do feel magical.  I ordered a pair, and because they felt so wonderful when I put 'em on, I rushed to see if they had different colors on sale as well.  Indeed there were, so I got another pair.Now, for $24 (as of this writing), they should feel like you never want to take them off.  When you put 'em on, they conform to your body immediately.  I had a pair of CKs years ago, but they gave me wedgies, so I stopped wearing them.  I figured now, what with all the rave reviews on Amazon, I'd try the Micro Modals.Maybe it's just the way my body's made, as I do have larger-than-normal hips for a guy, but I find that I adjust myself after a short walk with these on, and I shouldn't have to do that with $24 undies.  I look forward to switching to my Hanes, when it should be the other way around.I won't give them less than 3 stars because the fact is they feel great when not walking, and look great too (around the house in private, that is).  But they get no more stars than that because I should feel comfortable in them ALL the time.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13620912", "1": "0.25212243", "2": "0.044030942", "3": "0.11560586", "4": "0.16114122", "6": "0.28857267"}}
