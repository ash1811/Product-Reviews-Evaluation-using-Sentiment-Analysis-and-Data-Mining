{"text": "I have another bra by Glamorise, sports bra type, that fits amazing and relieved all my shoulder pressure. Unfortunately this one was a shoulder killer! I'm a 40F, so there's lots to hold up. But my neck and back and shoulders have had it...tired of going to the chiropractor!If you are looking for shoulder relief....then order this Glamorise sports bra~ ASIN : B0035WTMF4", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12500504", "1": "0.13942906", "2": "0.17270543", "3": "0.35884434", "4": "0.09152292", "5": "0.10862357"}}
