{"text": "Call 'em throwbacks to an earlier era and it would be accurate.  I've been wearing these shoes for tennis since about the early 80s and have yet to find anything as good in the interim.  The 'Boks' are also good for wearing to the gym for weight training, cardio work on the various machines, or just knocking around on a weekend at the Mall or hangin' with your buds.  In short, the shoes do it all and do it well for most any occasion, plus they still look retro cool.I jazz mine up with some gel and foam inserts to help a little on the pounding of pavement.  The leather provides more support than canvas, at least to me although that may be psychological in my case but I prefer the leather tops anyway.  I'm guessing you do as well?  They look better, last longer and simply 'feel' right.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.05569217", "1": "0.16339788", "2": "0.16985166", "3": "0.17681235", "4": "0.10690879", "5": "0.14475447", "6": "0.18258269"}}
