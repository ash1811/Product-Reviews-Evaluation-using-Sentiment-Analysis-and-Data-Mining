{"text": "Very good databank watch.  not expensive.  the singular drawback that i found is that the crystal is kinda cheap plastic.  definitely not mineral glass like the G-Shock series.  also, because the face is not recessed like many of the G-Shock series, i can see the face of this watch getting marred up over time.  still an okay buy, based on its inexpensive pricetag", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09671205", "1": "0.16117027", "2": "0.14325096", "3": "0.13070141", "4": "0.38930687", "5": "0.07498173"}}
