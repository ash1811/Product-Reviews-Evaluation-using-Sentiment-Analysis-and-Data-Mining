{"text": "I needed an insulated lunch carrier for work... I didn't want the typical square box.  This is very well insulated...has a lot of nice compartments.  It really holds the cold in all day.  The bottle carrier is nice for things other than bottles too!  It does not come with a water bottle...so I am confused why there are any complaints on that topic.  Plus, I use if for my own bottles... I don't fill my own bottles with any drinks or water.  The back pack part actually works and is comfortable.  It is basically the perfect size backpack that is also insulated.  Not as big as a regular back pack which really makes it perfect for your lunch and/or a couple days of clothes.  The perfect bug out bag too.  Oh, and the water bottle holder comes off if you want it to.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.35482657", "2": "0.23431751", "3": "0.14846559", "4": "0.05404948", "5": "0.17776647", "6": "0.028148945"}}
