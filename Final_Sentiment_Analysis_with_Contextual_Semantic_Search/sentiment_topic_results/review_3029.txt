{"text": "Came perfectly packaged.  I have bought this same bra before, love the color and the style.  My only problem that it is very tight across my back and hurts after awhile. Since this is my size and I have ordered same bra before , I had to check the tab to make sure it was indeed my size.  it was. I am keeping it anyway, Knowing that it will stretch out some after awhile. Otherwise, I love the hold, love the comfort straps, never digs into shoulders, and I am more pleased than not since the price was reasonable for this style and name bra.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11780286", "1": "0.28072956", "2": "0.13348657", "3": "0.28731784", "5": "0.075564034", "6": "0.10210528"}}
