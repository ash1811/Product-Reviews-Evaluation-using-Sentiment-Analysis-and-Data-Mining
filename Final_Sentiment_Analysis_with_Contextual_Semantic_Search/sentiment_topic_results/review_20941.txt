{"text": "I ordered this ring because I thought that I lost my wedding band (it was misplaced). However, when I received it I was pleased with quality and a great look. Unfortunately using ring conversion chart from the internet to convert my size from European to US, I end up ordered wrong size, asked local jewelers and  googled possibility of resizing it, it is impossible. Next step, I will order two one for me, one for my wife for marriage anniversary. Hope to get right sizes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.27294785", "1": "0.15251812", "2": "0.22093059", "3": "0.12119813", "4": "0.031186052", "5": "0.039510705", "6": "0.16170856"}}
