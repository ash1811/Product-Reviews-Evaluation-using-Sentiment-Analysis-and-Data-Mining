{"text": "There simply is no beating Havaianas flip flops for comfort.  The rubber is the softest you can find.  I also especially like the &#34;bumpy&#34; surface which keeps the flip flop from sliding out from under your foot.  The only down I can mention is that sometimes you might receive a pair with the straps twisted (due to poor packaging) which is definitely NOT comfortable, but if you exchange it, odds are you'll get a replacement that is fine.  That part is a matter of luck, it seems.  But when you get the untwisted ones, you'll never want another pair.  These are heaven.  For fit, I wear an 8 or 8 1/2 shoe; the 39/40 is exactly right for me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.040321264", "1": "0.26324266", "2": "0.29708883", "3": "0.09777401", "4": "0.122577645", "5": "0.12549983", "6": "0.05349574"}}
