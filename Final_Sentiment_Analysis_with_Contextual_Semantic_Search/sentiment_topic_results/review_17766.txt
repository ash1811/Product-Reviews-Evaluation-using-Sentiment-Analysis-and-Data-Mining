{"text": "(updated 8/2013)  AMAZING WATCH!  I was thinking about how tough, light, and perfect this watch was the other day after I was finished with an appointment in my dress clothes...and thinking back to the weekend when I abused this watch repeatedly with action sports, bug sprays, paint thinner (after getting some overspray paint on it, had to clean it up) and just all manner of dust, mud, swimming, etc....just a 'normal weekend' for me...and this great watch.It still looks brand new.  It's classy and refined in a boardroom and tough as nails in the outdoors, I just love it.  I will probably buy myself a backup...but it hasn't come off my wrist in 8 months...and i doubt it will in 8 years!  I just LOVE the fact that everying I need is on ONE screen and a simple light for the dark.  I don't use anyting but the main screen I've found out...but the time, date, and day is essential to me filling out various financial forms...and this unit has it all - right there one the main screen.  I'm VERY happy with this watch.I can't say enough good things about the watch and the great reviews here on Amazon about it.  It's all I need and nothing I don't.I came off slightly over 5 years of constantly wearing an \"outdoor computer\" watch on my wrist...really big - had alti, compass, baro, temp, gobs of alarms, timers, and settings....I barely used any of them...and now with iphones, I can easily get most of those features as apps.... if I ever really needed them.What this watch is...is a nice change I didn't know I really needed.  I like that it fits under my shirt sleeve and suit jacket sleeve better.  It's as tough as they come, and I've been able to use it shooting all day, banging around woods and campsites, using the chainsaw and maul for firewood...you name it...it's been perfect.  I like the night-light feature, mine is a green shade, very easy to see...and I LOVE that the day, date, and time are what is displayed on the home screen (all I've ever used - all I need.)This watch is perfect from the backyard swimming pool to a boardroom presentation.  Which is perfect since I never, ever take off my watch anyway.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.27165592", "1": "0.22424202", "2": "0.16312186", "3": "0.14000598", "4": "0.08452563", "5": "0.03620426", "6": "0.08024433"}}
