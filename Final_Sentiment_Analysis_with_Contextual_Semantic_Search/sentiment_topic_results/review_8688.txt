{"text": "The two biggest problems I have with this watch are the lack of a second hand, you do get a second readout in the digital display but I find this almost useless. Also if you shine a flashlight on the each face it is readable in dark but after a short time it is no longer readable which is very bad for me so I very rarely ware this watch at night.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10385252", "1": "0.30612805", "2": "0.19429076", "3": "0.049944527", "4": "0.049238887", "5": "0.06960878", "6": "0.22693644"}}
