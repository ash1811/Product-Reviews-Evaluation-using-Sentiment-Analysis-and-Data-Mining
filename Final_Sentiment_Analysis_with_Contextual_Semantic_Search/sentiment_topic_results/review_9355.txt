{"text": "I got this to hand out halloween candy in as im doing a Pirate theme for halloween now. gold coin candies in a treasure chest. This chest is made of real wood, has a &#34;hidden compartment&#34; looks and feels the part nicely. The eye patch leaves a little to be desired but i dont wear a patch so no biggie. the coin purse is a nice touch. and the &#34;bandana&#34; or mini flag is decent. all in all its worth the money just for the chest.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.033530325", "1": "0.25060868", "2": "0.03628184", "3": "0.3451646", "4": "0.0827452", "6": "0.24846911"}}
