{"text": "I bought the smallest size they have hoping they would fit like other brands that I have. Unfortunately that was not the case here. When you put them on and stretch out to have no loose ends they ride up to where they can be considered pantyhose and not stockings. The design is nice so if you like this design I would suggest you pay a little more money and go with Maidenform lace stockings. Like I said they are more expensive but they definitely fit the way they are supposed to and are very comfortable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15647146", "1": "0.35559782", "3": "0.30216557", "6": "0.17552614"}}
