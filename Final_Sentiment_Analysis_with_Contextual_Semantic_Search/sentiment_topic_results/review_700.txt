{"text": "First of all, I like the watch.  It's attractive in 2-tone which I prefer, comfortable on my wrist and easy to read.  However, when I opened the package the watch was already ticking.  I have purchased several Timex watches from Amazon and my primary criticism is that the battery wears out quickly.  Since this one was already at work I'm concerned that I'll soon need another or have to get a new battery.  It's often more cost-effective to purchase a new watch than pay for a new battery which in my experience dies within a few months anyway.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2762989", "1": "0.08241466", "2": "0.27513632", "3": "0.2284686", "4": "0.044275768", "6": "0.090744905"}}
