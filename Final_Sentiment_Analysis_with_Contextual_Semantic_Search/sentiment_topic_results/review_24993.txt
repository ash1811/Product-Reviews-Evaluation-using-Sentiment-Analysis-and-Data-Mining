{"text": "I wear a womens' size 6 shoe and have large arches. This size 6 insole fits my shoes perfectly but the arch support is too short to cover the large arches in my feet. I should have followed the manufacturer's directions and ordered the larger size insole and cut it to fit the shoes. Despite that, these are the best insoles I have owned. I have plantar fascitis and heel spurs and these help with both of those problems.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05860075", "1": "0.222429", "2": "0.1357845", "3": "0.26879478", "4": "0.20576593", "6": "0.1052178"}}
