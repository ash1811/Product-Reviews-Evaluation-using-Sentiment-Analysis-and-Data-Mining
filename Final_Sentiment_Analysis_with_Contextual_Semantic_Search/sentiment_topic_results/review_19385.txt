{"text": "I ordered these and got them for a steal from Amazon Prime. I love having Prime because a lot of shoes, sandals, boots on Prime come with free shipping AND free returns, so you really can't go wrong with trying them. I have so many shoes I am going to save these and give them as a gift to my daughter. Green is a favorite color too!  I ordered a black pair of Slogger rain boots in a seven and they fit her perfectly and she loves them so I know she'll like these! Even if she doesn't like them they fit me too, worst case scenario is I'll have to keep them for myself! lol. She's a maternity nurse so I think she'll be able to wear them for work and because they are rubber and have replaceable insoles it won't matter if they get slopped up in the delivery room as they are totally washable and so comfortable! Now I can't wait for Christmas next year!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.050345983", "1": "0.26283482", "2": "0.23166144", "3": "0.24104756", "4": "0.15509464", "5": "0.056686744"}}
