{"text": "This is one of the best straplesses I've ever put on. It has phenomenal support and even a little extra padding. I had two minor problems with it, first was it is quite tight, which bras do tend to vary, and straplesses are notorious for being tighter than conventional bras so not really that surprised. I plan to order another and will go up to my larger sister size (I'm a 40D, I'll try a 42C and edit how that goes). Second was that one of the plastic supports was stitched very low into the bottom band and it cuts into my sides, I only have this problem on one side so I believe it was just a error in stitching.EDIT: the 42C was MUCH better, far more comfortable and didn't squish me like a sausage. Unfortunately two wears in and the wire popped out of the side.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11551107", "1": "0.14300257", "2": "0.09450738", "3": "0.26565868", "4": "0.07825219", "5": "0.17053202", "6": "0.13253611"}}
