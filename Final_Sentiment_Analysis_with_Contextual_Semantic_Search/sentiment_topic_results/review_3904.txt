{"text": "I've been looking for a belt that had a little stretch to it so it didn't bind, yet still held up my pants.  I'm slim/slender and do buy my pants to fit me, but after wearing them for a few hours, they seem to get bigger and it's annoying to have to keep pulling them up.  This belt looks great with jeans or pants and is very generous in size, I wear size 6/8 in womens pants and ordered a medium belt, it's just perfect.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.049195934", "1": "0.5156183", "2": "0.13656244", "3": "0.2883772"}}
