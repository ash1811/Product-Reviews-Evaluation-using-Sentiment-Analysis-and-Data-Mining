{"text": "I wear this under my winter coat and sometimes around the house when I don't want to crank the heat.  Note that it WILL leave fuzz balls on some of your clothes (but not all), like any other hoodie I've ever had.The quality is undeniable - it's nice and thick and very well made.  The zipper is easy to use and zips perfectly every time.  The hood is a little on the large side but you can pull the draw strings of course to make it fit better like any other hoodie, but the size is a little larger.Like another reviewer I noticed that if it's zipped and I sit down the pockets bulge forward along with the mid section as well, but to me this isn't a big deal - it's not a dress shirt, it's a hoodie.  I would say it runs a little bit large but again it's a hoodie and I'd rather it be large than snug.I purchased this as a lightning deal for significant savings under the normal price (I paid $19.50).  If I see the price go down again like that I may consider purchasing another one sometime but not for $40-$50 as seems to be the standard.-D", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11831676", "1": "0.23955612", "2": "0.17292705", "3": "0.2751106", "4": "0.09791304", "6": "0.09386134"}}
