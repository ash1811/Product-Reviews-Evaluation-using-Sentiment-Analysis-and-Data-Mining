{"text": "I purchased this watch to replace another that i had for several years but it stopped working. This watch looks nice but it is made cheap (that's why we pay about 18 dollars in Amazon). Well it was fine but quickly got scratches on the glass and the worse thing was moisture on the glass. I sent it to Casio and they returned very quickly but i haven't had the chance to test it. If this happens again probably i will throw away and purchase a Timex.I updated my review to one since zero star is not allowed. I went to the pool and the watch got moisture in the glass again. So I do not know what they repaired because it is worse than before.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16281609", "1": "0.2138627", "2": "0.28789258", "3": "0.07996984", "4": "0.12395233", "5": "0.024218487", "6": "0.10728797"}}
