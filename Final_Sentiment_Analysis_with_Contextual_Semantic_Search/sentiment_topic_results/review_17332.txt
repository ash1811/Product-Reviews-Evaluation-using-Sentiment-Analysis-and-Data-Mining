{"text": "This set of boots was purchased for my wife and she absolutely loves it.They are extremely comfortable, noticeably lighter then the other pair of boots that she has, and she really appreciates that.  She also likes the side zipper which facilitates taking off the boot.  She also loves the style of them a lot which is a plus.All in all a great boot.  We began breaking it in with a few walks and runs over the weekend.  If my gut is correct, this pair of boots will last its fair amount of time.  We will update as needed.  Hope this helps.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.19064967", "2": "0.13247532", "3": "0.051858548", "4": "0.40918952", "5": "0.043600556", "6": "0.16930568"}}
