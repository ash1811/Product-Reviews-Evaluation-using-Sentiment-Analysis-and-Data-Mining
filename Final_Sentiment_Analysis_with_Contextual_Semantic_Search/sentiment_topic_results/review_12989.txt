{"text": "Nice, Large, Bright Silver and Thin sums it up.This is a nice filigree pendant and large enough to stand out which is what I was looking for. It is a very white silver. It's not as chunky as I would have liked but I can't seem to find one here on Amazon. In the stores, all I find are hearts, hearts and more hearts. This pendant is really, really pretty thin, I was surprised at how thin it was. Turn it sideways and it disappears. The small diameter snake chain is not quite as nice or feminine as I've seen, but it works.I have long hair and didn't find that my hair gets caught in it like some other reviewers mentioned, maybe I'm just more careful keeping my hair to the side when putting it on so that it doesn't get caught in the first place, don't know if this is it or not.All in all, a good value for the price if you want a large sterling silver pendant you can actually see on your neck.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.30129758", "2": "0.028205508", "3": "0.14252453", "4": "0.17024143", "5": "0.15914081", "6": "0.19619553"}}
