{"text": "In the past, I owned the 8926a with the miyota movement and oyster bezel, and since gifted to my family. I missed the Invicta 8926 so much as a casual/dress watch, that I went ahead and ordered the OB version with the coin-edge bezel. I love the pro diver series, and this version came with a Seiko NH35A automatic movement. It works really well, and keeps very good time in comparison with a Swiss movement I have, which is the CL888. I recommend this timepiece for someone looking for a great watch without breaking the bank.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24365585", "1": "0.20560496", "2": "0.11442771", "3": "0.12289022", "4": "0.12417162", "5": "0.07318842", "6": "0.1160612"}}
