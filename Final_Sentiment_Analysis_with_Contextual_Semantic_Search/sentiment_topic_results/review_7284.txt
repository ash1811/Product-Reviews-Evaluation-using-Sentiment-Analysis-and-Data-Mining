{"text": "I wear these fall to spring in Seattle. this is my second pair. I thought I was buying the cargo pants again, but these are just as good. They look a little &#34;dressier&#34;, except for the carpenter's hammer loop, than the cargo pants.  They are a little thick, sort of, so I don't wear them in the summer. Good true fit.  Where I would rather have 35&#34; hem in other pants, the 34&#34; in these are just fine.  I don't recommend them in the summer because they are a little stiff and don't breathe too much.  Nice detailing on pockets and a nice little knife guard on the front pocket.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.083693765", "1": "0.49822378", "2": "0.21906383", "4": "0.08124718", "5": "0.08670408", "6": "0.028362116"}}
