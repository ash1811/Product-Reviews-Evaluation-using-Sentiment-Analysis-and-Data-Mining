{"text": "These pants fit perfectly. The are tight enough to wear under boots (in fact that is how I am wearing them right now) but also wide enough to wear with flats or heels. They don't have a lot of stretch, so be aware of that. They have held up really well to my constant abuse.  I love them and would buy them again! They are my favorite pants right now!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.60415506", "2": "0.03931457", "3": "0.046331603", "4": "0.17647682", "5": "0.12577625"}}
