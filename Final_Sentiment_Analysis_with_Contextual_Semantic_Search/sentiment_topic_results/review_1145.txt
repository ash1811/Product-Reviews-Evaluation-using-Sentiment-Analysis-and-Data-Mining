{"text": "For the price, I certainly expected more when it arrived.  There was no \"WOW\" factor when I opened it up.  They will be okay for everyday wear but they do not meet my expectations for the amount of money I spent.  Had I seen them in the store, they would have stayed in the store.  The grey is almost completely clear and the black is not that dark either so it is if you have a slightly charcoal grey with clear beads.  Not sure what pair they took the picture of but they are not what arrived at my house.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13379616", "1": "0.21418233", "2": "0.1669282", "3": "0.14717165", "4": "0.1263054", "5": "0.15255336", "6": "0.05906289"}}
