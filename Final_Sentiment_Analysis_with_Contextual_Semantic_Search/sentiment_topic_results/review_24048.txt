{"text": "I wear this shoe nearly every day to walk in the desert, and it gives me good footing and good support.  I did get a half size larger, as people recommend, and it fits fine.  The taupe color is great, as it doesn't show dust, which is plentiful in the desert.  The mesh upper is also good, as it allows ventilation.  I like vibram soles for their sure footing on rock, and an added benefit is that thorns can't penetrate, unless they are really big, wicked thorns.  With my old walking shoes, I had to get the needle-nosed pliers and pull out the thorns in the sole after every walk. I am adding this comment after wearing these for over a year.  My only complaint is the design of the sole.  There are small ovals in which stones get embedded and won't come out very easily.  I sound like a tap dancer when I get on cement, and have to take a nail to pry the stones out.  I wish they would get rid of the little oval pockets in the sole, then it would be perfect. I tried another shoe for awhile, and was getting sore knees after a long walk.  These Merrells are the best!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20006056", "1": "0.24021856", "2": "0.2243259", "3": "0.19062132", "4": "0.06485422", "5": "0.07768332"}}
