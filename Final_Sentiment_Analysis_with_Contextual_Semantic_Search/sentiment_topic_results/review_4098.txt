{"text": "4 stars for being a very sexy, fun bra for us larger-bosomed types, without the obnoxious padding you get from a lot of designers (seriously...if you're a 34DD, you're probably cool without the push-up pads...). Jezebel seems to set their straps wide, which I happen to like because it allows for more open necklines, but if you have very narrow shoulders this could be an issue. It's not the most comfortable bra I've ever owned (the minus 1 star), but it's not bad even after a full day, and for the price and cuteness level I think it's a great buy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08326475", "1": "0.24192038", "2": "0.1532521", "3": "0.09106434", "4": "0.17179649", "5": "0.17960244", "6": "0.07909951"}}
