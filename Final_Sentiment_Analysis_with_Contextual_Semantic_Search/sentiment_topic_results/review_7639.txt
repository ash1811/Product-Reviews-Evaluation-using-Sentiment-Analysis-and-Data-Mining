{"text": "I figured I'd give this a chance.  It came in a D cup, it had pretty good reviews, so I could at least TRY the thing for a new t-back summer dress I'd purchased.Package came, first thought was 'thats not nude, thats a dark taupe color'.  So much for lighter or see thru dresses masking this thing.Followed instructions, tried the thing out.  Looked in the mirror and laughed.  What have I done to myself?  My poor breast tissue pulled away from their natural position to give a laughable amount of cleavage, while at the same time - COMPLETELY UN-SUPPORTED.Which brings me to my conclusion.  If you have anything bigger than an A cup, don't even bother.  There is just no way this thing will give you any decent amount of support.  I tried changing the position of the clasps and nothing helped.It's just a all around terrible product for anyone with boobs.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.086751506", "1": "0.36304712", "2": "0.09585334", "3": "0.18354301", "4": "0.14418061", "5": "0.050757073", "6": "0.075867265"}}
