{"text": "At the time of this writing, I work at a production/warehouser which entails many, many hours of standing each shift. Brutal on my feet, and these massaging gel inserts I got at the grocery store pharmacy section just weren't cutting it at all.After several months of this torture, I gave in and searched for something better. I came upon this, and after some consideration. Got them, immediately put them in. I have to caution you guys - it will hurt in new ways until your feet adjust. However, now my feet don't hurt at all, even at the end of a longer shift!So, I can confidently say that I would recommend this product for someone that stands and walks for many hours.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09565857", "1": "0.13629931", "2": "0.1367039", "3": "0.11534095", "4": "0.11984623", "5": "0.16683716", "6": "0.22931388"}}
