{"text": "This bag has a pocket for everything.  The thing I hate most about purses is that pretty much everything gets jumbled in the one or two inside pockets and you have to search through everything to find the one thing you want.  This bag lets me &#34;designate&#34; a spot for everything and nothing is &#34;jumbled around.&#34;  The only con is that it is somewhat heavy, but I can handle that!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.29539126", "2": "0.4682178", "3": "0.04186724", "4": "0.10015808", "6": "0.086172745"}}
