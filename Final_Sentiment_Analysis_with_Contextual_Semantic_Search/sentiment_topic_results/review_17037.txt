{"text": "I love keen, I own 6 pairs of keens in different styles.  This seasons keens are tight on the toes.  I am trying a larger size but I am worried they will not fit either.  There is a new toe bar that is entirely too far forward.  If I try to put my foot far enough forward to be in the correct place for the toe bar, my toes are curled into a cramped position and the arch support is in the wrong place. I love the old fit, wide tall toe box and high correctly placed arch, no toe bar, no pinching. I just hope the 11 fits better than the 10.5.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.024647446", "1": "0.3791195", "2": "0.14160831", "3": "0.13784455", "4": "0.1921948", "5": "0.024747021", "6": "0.09983833"}}
