{"text": "I have worn this size for at least three decades in both sneakers and shoes. I purchased these because most reviews indicated they were comfortable. That has not been my experience. The corner where the part with the laces meets the lower part of the upper is more stiff than the rest of the shoe and this part causes rubbing on the upper part of my feet, just above my little toe. It caused my feet to bleed the first day I wore them to work and it took a few days for them to be comfortable enough to wear without hurting. Now they are OK; if my feet weren't injured, I think they'd be fine, but they are still a little raw from the first few days.They look great and the laces tie well. They are an excellent price and, in the long run, I think they'll be OK, but consider these with caution.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.19650328", "2": "0.2372693", "3": "0.19525762", "5": "0.290545", "6": "0.07490423"}}
