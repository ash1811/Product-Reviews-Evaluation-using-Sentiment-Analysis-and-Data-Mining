{"text": "I love tank tops with built-in shelf bras and prefer them to regular bras most of the time.  I'm always looking for that \"perfect\" tank top - good price, good support, fairly easy to get on, decent \"coverage\" in the front, etc.This one isn't bad, but isn't my ideal.  I bought a small and found that it is a decent fit once it is on, but can be difficult to get into - kind of like shrugging my way into a rubber band.  The support level in the chest area is a little more \"bouncy\" than I'd prefer, and overall the fabric isn't quite thick enough to prevent show-through if it is worn on its own.  The style of the straps lends itself more to \"undergarment\" status anyway, and it isn't bad as that - something to wear under a sweater in the wintertime.Another reviewer mentioned that the big pink logo was a problem, and I agree.  If I buy a black tank top I want it to be all black - I don't really care to have a logo, especially not a pink one.The biggest downer is the price - $22 seems a bit too much to pay for this top, when I have found other tops I like better for less on Amazon.  I'm definitely keeping the one I bought, but I don't think I'll buy any more.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2272337", "1": "0.17528652", "2": "0.057575602", "3": "0.3200286", "4": "0.055575967", "6": "0.16205351"}}
