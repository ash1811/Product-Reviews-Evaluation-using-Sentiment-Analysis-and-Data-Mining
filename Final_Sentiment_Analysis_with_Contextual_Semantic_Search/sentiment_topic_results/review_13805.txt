{"text": "Had read about the Orange Monster on watch forums for months and finally had to have one.The links are a bear to remove due to their design (double headed push pin). Bezel moves freely but is just a tad too easy to move (not that I use it for anything but it gets moved around by normal bumping in daily use).Great lume, especially for a Seiko.Will have to agree with the majority of the horological community...this watch is a steal for what it offers!Will be pulling the trigger on a Black Monster and wish I had the cash to buy the limited edition blue currently on sale!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10793672", "1": "0.09874169", "2": "0.27687773", "3": "0.110840335", "4": "0.10551761", "5": "0.13304439", "6": "0.16704153"}}
