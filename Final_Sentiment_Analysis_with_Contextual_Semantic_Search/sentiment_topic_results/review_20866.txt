{"text": "I'm a women's US 10. I ordered a 41/42 as well as a 39/40 because I didn't know what size to get...like a lot of people on here. When they arrived,  the 41/42 flip flops had some strange yellow markings on them (clearly a defect) and I didn't even consider keeping them for that reason. As for size, the 41/42 were also too large for my liking. The 39/40 fit but with very little room to spare and I just didn't think they were worth keeping. I didn't notice anything special about them to warrant the cost. The comfort was no different than any other flip flop. They're a basic flip flop in a pretty color. I've seen better quality in a flip flop for less money. I returned both pairs for a refund.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10431332", "1": "0.32327783", "2": "0.23224209", "3": "0.040425118", "4": "0.1348058", "5": "0.03205111", "6": "0.13288471"}}
