{"text": "I have been a fan of Minnetonka since my youth. I just purchased a pair for my college-age daughter, who swears by them. She says they are so comfy to walk around campus. I ended up buying a second pair for my middle-schooler, and she also loves them. I tried them on myself and one thing to note is that these are very snug and don't come in half-sizes. From my own experience with Minnetonkas, they will stretch, as they are made of genuine leather suede. They seem narrow so if you have a wider foot, you may want to go up a size. Otherwise, both my daughters love their boots. I'm itching to get a pair for myself!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06267978", "1": "0.32155502", "2": "0.14081493", "3": "0.13757972", "4": "0.17785932", "5": "0.08151275", "6": "0.07799846"}}
