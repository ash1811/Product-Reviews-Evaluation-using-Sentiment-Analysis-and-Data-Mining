{"text": "These slippers meet my needs very well. A previous pair of slippers I owned had a very gummy sole that didn't slip but picked up dirt like a magnet. When they got damp they would leave foot prints every where. These L.B. Evans have a flexible rubber sole that doesn't pick up everythig it touches. I'm very happy with them. They are well built.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04411206", "1": "0.19202256", "2": "0.0929319", "3": "0.32107037", "4": "0.046571728", "5": "0.18207067", "6": "0.12122073"}}
