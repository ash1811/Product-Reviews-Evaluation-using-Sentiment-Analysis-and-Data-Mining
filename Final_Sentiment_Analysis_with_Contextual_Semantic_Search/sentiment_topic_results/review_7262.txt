{"text": "I have bought 3 pairs of these jeans now. My prerequisite for jeans is wear, comfort , all the right pockets and a hammer loop. I am still wearing the first pair and love them. My wife says they look good, and wash well (her prerequisites). I don't have any holes in the pockets yet despite putting screwdrivers, my knife, nails, screws and stuff in them. The belt loops are still attached even with all my junk rubbing in them. The price is OK and amazon ships quickly. Very Happy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09490335", "1": "0.23117553", "2": "0.22473274", "3": "0.07823727", "4": "0.15609059", "5": "0.03948192", "6": "0.17537862"}}
