{"text": "I needed a new backpack bad, and this looked like a good one for me. I ordered it to carry around a few notebooks and 1 or 2 texbooks at a time, and occasionally my monster laptop (17&#34;). It fits it all great. The max I could fit is probably a couple notebooks with 2 textbooks, or my laptop, 1 textbook, and a couple notebooks. There are 2 bottle holders which fit a good sized water bottle. It is water resistant as far as I can tell - I've walked around in the snow all over campus and when it melts and gets wet on the inside, I open it to discover that my books and laptop are perfectly dry. I'm not sure about the bottom yet, but the side that is exposed to the elements on your back seems to do well. NOTE: I haven't had it in the pouring rain quite yet.I've ready many of these and they say that the seams are bad and it rips apart easily. It's been a month, and I haven't yet seen any evidence of breaking or tearing, and the seams and zippers seem to be put together well to me, considering I make pretty heavy use of this (my O-Chem textbook is pretty big...).Overall, it works quite well. ONLY complaint is that if you fill up the biggest compartment, you can't fit anything in the second compartment, as there is no &#34;floor space&#34; in the second compartment. In other words, anything you put in the biggest compartment just pushes into the second compartment and takes up all the space there.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10006961", "1": "0.22513022", "2": "0.34984398", "3": "0.08463308", "4": "0.14462641", "5": "0.07254241", "6": "0.023154346"}}
