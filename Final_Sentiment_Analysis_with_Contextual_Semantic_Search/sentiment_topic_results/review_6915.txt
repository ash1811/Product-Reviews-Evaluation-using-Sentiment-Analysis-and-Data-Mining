{"text": "I love these jeans.  The blue is VERY blue... keep that in mind.  But it's true to size, fits great.  The pockets are wonderful.  I might fade them a bit because the shockingly indigo color is pretty bright and I'm not likely to wear them down to a muted color anytime soon (very robustly made).Great jeans.  Thanks, Dickies--you magnificent bastards.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10654788", "1": "0.40147412", "2": "0.03708384", "4": "0.054576553", "5": "0.16223004", "6": "0.23410217"}}
