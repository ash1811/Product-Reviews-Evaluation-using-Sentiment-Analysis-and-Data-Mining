{"text": "TheEssential Apparel Basic Thermal TopandEssential Apparel Basic Thermal Bottomare perfect for cycling in fall weather when the temperature gets down into the 60s.  I put the tops and bottoms on under my cycling jersey and shorts.  The loose weave of the fabric, sixty-five percent cotton, breaths very well.  The black color of the pair that I have can also pick up extra warmth from sunshine.  When the temperature gets even cooler, down to 60 degrees, I switch to heavier one hundred percent cotton under garments.  Certainly, you cannot beat the price of the Essential Apparel.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03480783", "1": "0.17757499", "2": "0.12152986", "3": "0.28142622", "4": "0.14686331", "5": "0.1544245", "6": "0.0833733"}}
