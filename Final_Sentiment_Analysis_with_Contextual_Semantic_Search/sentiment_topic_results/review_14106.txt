{"text": "This is a beautiful anklet! I was pleased with the design and the ease of being able to wear it every day! I've not taken it off since it arrived and it's held up under socks, in the shower, and in bed. And though I haven't worn it with hose yet, It doesn't seem to snag. It's a simple clean and subtle design and if you do leave it on, you will hardly know it's there. You will not regret a purchase of this item.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15338749", "1": "0.13411361", "3": "0.2812501", "4": "0.13516189", "5": "0.046931963", "6": "0.24514641"}}
