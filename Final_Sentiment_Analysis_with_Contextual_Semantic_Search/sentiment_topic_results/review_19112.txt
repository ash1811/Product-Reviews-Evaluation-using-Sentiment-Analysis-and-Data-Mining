{"text": "I ordered these shoes from Amazon. They came packaged well but kind of slow on the shipping. I normally can order an item from Amazon and have it within a week. I ordered the New Balance 574 and it took close to three weeks for me to receive my shoes. The good thing is, I was able to track the shoes via the Amazon tracking system which gave me at least peace of mind. The shoes looked exactly like the photo and were brand new, never worn. The New Balance 574 is an amazing shoe. I needed to get a new shoe and a friend recommended I try a New Balance shoe. I must say, this is one of the most comfortable shoes around. Went to a store where they measure your foot to make sure I get the right shoe. It truly does make a difference. If you are considering purchasing this shoe, I suggest this as an option. I hope this review helps. YMMV...
