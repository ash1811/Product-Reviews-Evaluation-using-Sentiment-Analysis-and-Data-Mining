{"text": "I've been searching for an old-fashioned wind-up watch because I'm tired of buying watch batteries and having the old ones end up in a land fill. This is exactly what I wanted. Plus the band isn't leather, which I won't buy, and it's not plastic which I also don't like.  And olive happens to be one of my favorite colors. The trick is getting used to winding a watch every morning again. But it's worth it to not have to buy batteries anymore.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10157813", "1": "0.24007334", "2": "0.17570242", "3": "0.06309593", "4": "0.15660626", "5": "0.15954569", "6": "0.103398256"}}
