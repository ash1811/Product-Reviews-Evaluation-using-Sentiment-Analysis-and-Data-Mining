{"text": "I don't like to wear Bikini underwear and I don't like to wear so called Granny Panties. These are the perfect fit for me.  Not too tiny and not too baggy.

These are more comfortable than Fruit of the Loom in my opinion.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.054863248", "1": "0.22475518", "2": "0.30810893", "4": "0.16361207", "5": "0.17717701", "6": "0.06670914"}}
