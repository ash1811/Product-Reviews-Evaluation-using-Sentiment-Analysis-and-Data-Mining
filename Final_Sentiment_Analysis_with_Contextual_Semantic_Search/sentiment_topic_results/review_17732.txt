{"text": "At first I wasn't to sure. I was used to your average thick g-shock, I even ponderd returning it. After wearing it for a day I realized how much I didn't like my other two g-shocks. All day of physical work and I did not catch or bump anything (if you wear a g-shock & dont sit on your bum all day in a office you know what I mean). All g-shocks are very tough there is no sence in getting into that. This one is a very cool, simple, retro watch that won't get in your way, and has a great price tag!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11261555", "1": "0.18026507", "2": "0.13633369", "3": "0.061806343", "4": "0.16360962", "5": "0.20516846", "6": "0.1402013"}}
