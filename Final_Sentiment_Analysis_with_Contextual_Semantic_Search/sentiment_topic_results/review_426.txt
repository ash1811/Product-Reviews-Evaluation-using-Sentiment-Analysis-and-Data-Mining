{"text": "A born lover of Silver, I've been collecting it for over thirty years. For a few years I sold Silver and Gold Jewelry on eBay as a past time which quickly grew into a business to large for me to handle. The selling stopped but my love of fine jewelry has always remained and I suppose always will.Having tried virtually every cleaning and polishing cloth, solution, paste and Ultra sonic cleaners - I can tell you that nothing and I mean nothing does such a remarkable job as the Connoisseurs cleaning clothes.The results are jaw dropping, fast and remarkable. Regardless of how tarnished a piece is, it's left gleaming in your hands in a matter of minutes. Unlike other and harsher products a thin outer layer of precious metal isn't buffed off. Only the grime and tarnish are removed so there are no worries of compromising the integrity and value of your jewelry over time.What is more it's equally effective on stones and gems - the soft clothes leave absolutely no threads or fuzz behind and they get into all the nooks of even the most intricate and complex designs. The protective costing it leaves behind means you'll have to clean your pieces less often. Although once you see the results, you'll find yourself polishing things more often then you ever thought you would want too.More than a cleaning cloth - this is an investment in your jewelry. Simply a wonderful product that does an outstanding job.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17994784", "1": "0.14365402", "2": "0.19036487", "3": "0.08737942", "4": "0.13887416", "5": "0.027858188", "6": "0.23192148"}}
