{"text": "I have always had trouble with over pronation and the various issues that usually accompany same. I was looking for red sandals that would &#34;do&#34;, since  orthopedic sandals in red are limited and/or ugly. I read all the reviews, and decided to take a chance and I am happy I did. I normally wear a 9 1/2 in Brooks Ariel shoe, and a size 8 in the Orthaheel and Vionic lines, and a 9 in Merrell sandals.I ordered a 9 in the Jambu Holly and they fit great and look good right out of the box, wore them around the house on the carpet just to be sure and wound up wearing them all day, very light weight and comfortable. They do not offer the same degree of support that Orthaheels and Vionic, but very much like Merrells, whose line also offer a super comfortable sandal for women with &#34;needy&#34; feet..or women who don't want to get &#34;needy&#34; feet.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13395865", "1": "0.38035268", "2": "0.13334186", "3": "0.1312878", "4": "0.04363872", "5": "0.09649001", "6": "0.08093032"}}
