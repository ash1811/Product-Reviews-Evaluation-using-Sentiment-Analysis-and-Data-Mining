{"text": "I got this for my son.  Of all ~12 timex ironman watches I have owned in my lifetime, this has the very stiffest buttons.  They leave a red mark on your fingers when you finally push hard enough to operate them!!!  I won't even bother to set this watch for my son, i'll only touch it if I need to turn off the alarm at 4:00 AM.  THE WORST USER INTERFACE OF ALL MY TIMEX WATCHES.It's good if you don't plan to push the buttons !!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17865045", "1": "0.10184022", "2": "0.10556347", "3": "0.18629353", "4": "0.09650692", "5": "0.116063505", "6": "0.21508195"}}
