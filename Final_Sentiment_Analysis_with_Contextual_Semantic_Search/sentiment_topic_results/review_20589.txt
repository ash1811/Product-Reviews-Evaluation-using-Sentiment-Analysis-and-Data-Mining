{"text": "Just to be clear, I got this tool when it was priced at $5.95.  For that price, it's a no-frills solution to removing watch backs with the \"slots.\" I had no problem getting it to work on a couple of different brands (Swiss Army, Fossil), but I did not try it on my higher-end watches since I am more comfortable letting the jeweler deal with those. The watches I used it on were ones that [...] and [...] had already refused to do, so this $5 purchase kept me from having to invest the $17 the watch repair shop typically charges for a simple battery replacement.NOTE:  this item comes in a wooden box with all parts but NO INSTRUCTIONS on use.  There was a sticker on the box telling me to go to [...] if I needed help on how to use the tool.  That website has free instructions on removing watch backs in general, so you could go there to see if you can solve your problem without buying any tool.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16048379", "1": "0.12878591", "2": "0.20727506", "3": "0.14838573", "4": "0.14628984", "5": "0.1308751", "6": "0.07790457"}}
