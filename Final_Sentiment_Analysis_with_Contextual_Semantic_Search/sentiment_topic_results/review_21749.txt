{"text": "So this product says one size fits all, that isn't the case. The one I received was small enough that it doesn't cover my ears, but its thick enough that it looks like I'm wearing a &#34;astrakhan hat&#34; from Russia. The only thing true about this product is that it's warm. I would NOT order another one of these and I recommend that if you want a good fleece watch cap you look elsewhere.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.041706115", "1": "0.37064835", "2": "0.17029764", "5": "0.15334971", "6": "0.2566415"}}
