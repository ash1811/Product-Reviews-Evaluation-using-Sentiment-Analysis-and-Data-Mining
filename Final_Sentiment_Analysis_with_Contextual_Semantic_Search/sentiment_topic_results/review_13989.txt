{"text": "I stumbled onto this watch after having looked at many chronograph types.Having read lots of the reviews here I was aware of comments about the band, and now owning the watch, I realize they had a point. On the other hand I like the drab green against the black watch face. So removing the grommets was done to see if it would effect the stiffeness.I discovered the grommets are what makes the band too stiff. The bandmaterial itself is not overly stiff. Its all that metal.Removing the grommets transforms the band. For example the end of the band now tucks effortlessly into its loop keeper, whereas with the grommets in place it required bending and guiding.Heres what it looks like minus the grommets:[...][...]To remove the grommets you need to slide a narrow screwdriverinbetween the grommet and the band on the BLACK side. Twist thescrewdrvier and it will displace the grommet a little. Do that a fewtimes right next to each other and you will create a lip that canbe grabbed by pliers and the halves of the rivet can be pulledapart. Its not hard. Dont use more force than necessary.As far as reviews go, I find the combination of never needing to change batteries and the sealed back, plus the no-nonsense look and size of the case, make for a near perfect package. It would be nice if Citizen offered a few models that 'riff'on this one.. for example different face color(s) and band choices and case finishes. In itself and for what it was designed to do, its a very very strong product. The price makes it a no brainer.Buy one.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.19364336", "1": "0.0408378", "2": "0.33472946", "3": "0.13206986", "4": "0.1878818", "5": "0.027610095", "6": "0.08322763"}}
