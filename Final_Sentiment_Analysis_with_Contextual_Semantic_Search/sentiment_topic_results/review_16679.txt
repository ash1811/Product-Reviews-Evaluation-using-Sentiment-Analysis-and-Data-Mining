{"text": "This cheap pair of shades look great. They actually look much better than the price suggests. The order came with a cotton drawbag.

Best dollar shades you'll find on here.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2949837", "1": "0.11220762", "2": "0.10734726", "3": "0.14088543", "4": "0.22815913", "5": "0.0789297", "6": "0.037487157"}}
