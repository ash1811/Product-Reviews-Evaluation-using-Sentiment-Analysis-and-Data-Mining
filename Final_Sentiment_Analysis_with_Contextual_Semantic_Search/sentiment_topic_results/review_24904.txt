{"text": "These were recommend to me by my orthopedic specialist as well as my fitness instructor. As I have aged a little and constant running and jumping, in the military, it seems my feet have flatten a bit as well as my gait being off. I put these in my shoes and I noticed within an hour or so, my back was not as tight and my gait seem to straighten up a little. After months of wearing these I have noticed decreased back pain and my feet seem to stay straight when walking instead of protruding out. Will buy more in the future. I recommend this product for those with back pain and gait issues. Also, before you buy, get a gait test at a shoe store and find out what type of insole you may need. These might not work for you based on your results.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1564287", "1": "0.26329207", "2": "0.14469731", "3": "0.062409837", "4": "0.19779338", "5": "0.12957047", "6": "0.04580824"}}
