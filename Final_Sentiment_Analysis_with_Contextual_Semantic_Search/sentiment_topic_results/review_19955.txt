{"text": "After using what I believe to be the world's smallest backpack for over 3 years, moving into this feels like a limousine. I can stuff all sorts of things in here from books to shirts to my computer and Tupperware for lunch. It's so large, I managed to lose a Tupperware for a week, actually, then, seemingly from nowhere, it appeared in one of the pockets. I hardly noticed the extra bulk, I suppose. Overall, great backpack, and even though I am now putting more things in it, my back and neck hurt less than with my previous backpack. If you need to lug around a lot of things, go for this backpack. It's practical, nondescript and moderately priced.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.044796027", "1": "0.11709838", "2": "0.25958547", "3": "0.13339588", "4": "0.16931331", "5": "0.13283752", "6": "0.14297344"}}
