{"text": "I can't speak to durability in the long term, but I will say that they feel great on my feet and look sharp. They're not flashy -- you're not going to stand out in a crowd -- and the soles aren't leather, so they won't exactly work with your favorite suit. But with a pair of jeans, these boots look great. They're more comfortable than my old boots, which had leather soles and were made of watersnake skin, and while they aren't as distinctive-looking, they're still very nice.Honestly, I'd wear these boots with anything short of a suit -- so sport coat and slacks? Yep. They're really very nice and understated without being drab. They shine up really well and fit pretty true-to-size. I actually went half a size down from my usual size but got the extra-wide. I probably could have gone with a half size up, but they're still a great fit and comfortable as all get-out. Now I just need to re-learn how to walk in heeled boots...Oh, and one more thing -- these are really great for driving, because the heel is beveled inward, so you can rest your heel on the floor mat while you drive. I think it's a great touch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15003654", "1": "0.2664918", "2": "0.14684922", "3": "0.022319533", "4": "0.20032233", "5": "0.13811952", "6": "0.0758611"}}
