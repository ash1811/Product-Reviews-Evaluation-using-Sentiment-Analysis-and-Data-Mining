{"text": "I recently got my first pair of Birkenstocks with the soft footbed. Previously, I only had the original footbed and broke the original in quickly, with no pain at all. I have plantar fasciitis and was excited to try the softbed out and break them in. I had actually gotten sized in a store to ensure the right fit and the softbed was highly encouraged by the salespeople.I know many people love the softbed and I don't know what the problem is for me. I have been wearing them for a few weeks now and they are painful (right where the plantars is). They are the right size. I obviously can't return them but I will be ordering another pair with the original footbed. The price was right for these however.By the way, I know many people dislike Betula by Birkenstock since they don't use real leather and are supposedly lower end, but I never had a problem with them. They lasted 8 years with no re-soling. I bought them by accident since I wanted a second pair of Bostons and I thought they were the same. No pain at all with my plantars and quick break in period. In fact, they were exactly like the regular footbed Boston Birkenstock and I couldn't tell the difference when wearing them or my Bostons.I will update my review in a few months to see if they will break in more and give me the comfort I have come to expect from Birkenstock.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09423382", "1": "0.14239606", "2": "0.06984626", "3": "0.24403426", "4": "0.17746471", "5": "0.11184027", "6": "0.16018464"}}
