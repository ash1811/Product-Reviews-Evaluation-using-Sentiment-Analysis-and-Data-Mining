{"text": "I bought my first 3 pack of Wigwam socks about 4 years ago, and they've become my go-to socks for work and play.  Although the grey colored heel might work against them as \"dress socks\" they are comfortable and dressy enough for that purpose.  They're rugged and attractive- and not too bulky- and have worn better than many famous name athletic socks I've tried.  Although it's true they feel coarse and not all that soft too the touch, my feet have never noticed.And the fact that they're made in the U.S. certainly helps.  Great product, reasonably priced.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.21168192", "2": "0.06563868", "3": "0.1527133", "4": "0.17311096", "5": "0.2222622", "6": "0.17220171"}}
