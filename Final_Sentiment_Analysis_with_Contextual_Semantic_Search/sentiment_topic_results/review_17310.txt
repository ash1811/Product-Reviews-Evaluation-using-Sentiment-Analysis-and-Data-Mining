{"text": "I loved this watch. I bought it because I wanted an automatic, durable watch that I could wear forever. It looked great. Unfortunately, it just stopped working after several months. That happened to a Seiko diver's watch I bought several years ago, too.As two Seiko automatic watches have failed on me, I won't ever go back to that brand again.
