{"text": "I have just ordered my second pair of these slippers.  My last pair lasted 4 years, which seems miraculous as I work from home and practically live in the things.  The cushioning really does feel like you're walking on clouds.  For this current pair I debated, and finally took, the advice on ordering a size smaller, and am very glad I did, as the fit is much better (didn't know this the last time and 'shuffled' more).  I highly recommend these slippers for their comfort and value and durability.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2501602", "2": "0.08258845", "3": "0.19408822", "5": "0.26649624", "6": "0.20081826"}}
