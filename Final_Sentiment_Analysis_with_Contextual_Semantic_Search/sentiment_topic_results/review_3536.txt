{"text": "Ten years ago, my husband bought a pair of these Merrell shoes locally.  They were the most comfortable shoes he has ever worn.  Now (10 years later), after wearing these shoes on a daily basis, they have finally bit the dust.  We bought the same version from Amazon to replace his old Jungle Slip-on's, and the new ones are just as comfortable.  Out of the box, there's no break-in period needed -- he can wear them all day, with nary a blister.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13561021", "1": "0.2847875", "2": "0.21563548", "3": "0.0975555", "4": "0.1867179", "6": "0.07635031"}}
