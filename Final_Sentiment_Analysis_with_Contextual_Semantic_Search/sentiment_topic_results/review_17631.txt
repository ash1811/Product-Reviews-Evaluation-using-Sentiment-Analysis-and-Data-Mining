{"text": "I've read reviews that these will work for swimming and submersing but they DO NOT.  They are only water resistant.  The reviewers on Amazon saying that they would be waterproof were very very lucky.  Their watches are probably broken now.  If you need a waterproof watch, get a G Shock or the Dive watches.  There are some for $15 although bulky.  I thought I could get away with these watches in water activity but they will fog up and fail.  The first lasted a while and that's why I just bought another one.  These are thin too so I really wanted that but now I am moving to the cheap dive watch.  I completely regret believing the incorrect reviews so I am adding my own.  Only use I'd see this for is general sports activity where sweat may get on it and you needed to rinse every once in a while.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.12383262", "2": "0.35994196", "3": "0.27294242", "4": "0.16104594", "6": "0.077290975"}}
