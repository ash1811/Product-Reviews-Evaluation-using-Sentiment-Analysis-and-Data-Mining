{"text": "As described. Not a big fan of the S/M/L/XL sizing, I am 6'2&#34; and 205lbs so I like a 34&#34;x34&#34; and got the LARGE. Waist is perfect (it has straps to tighten in the back) and the inseam is 32&#34;. So they are a little shorter than I like, but they won't drag the ground so I guess it's okay in the end. Very, very soft material and pockets have plenty of room.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.2525885", "1": "0.46418378", "2": "0.23158288", "4": "0.03898404"}}
