{"text": "I haven't actually taken these out of the package yet, but am sure I'll be pleased. I can't testify to paint on the back, but all the other items I bought from Gem Avenue have been great so I'm sure I'll be pleased with these also.  Again, when I received them, they looked like ordinary non-colorful crystals, but need to get them into the light as I did the others I ordered for make sure.  I think anyone would be happy with this jewelry.
