{"text": "My 10yr old Daughter has hard to fit feet, to say the least! We have always gotten her good shoes usually fitted at Jamiel's or other high end stores. 99% of the time, we get her shoes, sneakers or boots, she wears them 1-2x's & complains about the fit! I'd  about had it & was thinking  it would cost less to move to a tropical climate & let her run barefoot!!!! So far AMAZON has been a lifesaver ( hers anyway!)  I bought NB wide $40 sneakers & she LOVES them, wearing them consistently  3-4 times a week. Snow came & we had problems...... Uggs are her fav pair yet they aren't for snow & rain :( so the hunt was on! Cheap ones, wide, xtra wide, expensive ones, ones we'd never heard of- ALL didn't fit...then, looking thru the WIDE width section of girls shoes on here- I found THESE. Now I had tried a different brand of work boots & they fit terrible & were made even worse, so I worried. I waited days, looked again, 1left in her size 5.5 wide! I grabbed em' , I was desperate!  They came today- I was shaking, she was scared yet another wouldn't fit... Well Dear Lord she put them on & ran around the house smiling & yelling &#34;I LOVE EM' &#34;!!  She has a EE width, yet these in just wide fit perfect! I am now looking to buy stock in the company , as I will be buying soooo many pairs in various sizes! THANK YOU Timberland & Amazon!  Made well, soft leather & the sole is flexible. A great boot-", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07044385", "1": "0.20833749", "2": "0.14769283", "3": "0.0399624", "4": "0.13776167", "5": "0.2229584", "6": "0.17284337"}}
