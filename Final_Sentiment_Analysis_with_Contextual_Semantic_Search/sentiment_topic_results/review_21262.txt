{"text": "I followed the advice of other reviewers and ordered a size larger. They were far too large. I returned them at my cost (due to free shipping) and exchanged them for the correct size and they fit perfectly right out of the box. Ive worn them all day and they are wonderful. Extremely comfortable. I would highly recommend these to anyone working on their feet for long periods of time. No rub. Great support. Cushion feels great without being sloppy. Just order your correct size and you'll be happy. I will buy these again. Side note: To get the shoes, return them the next day, and receive the replacements took 5 days in all.
