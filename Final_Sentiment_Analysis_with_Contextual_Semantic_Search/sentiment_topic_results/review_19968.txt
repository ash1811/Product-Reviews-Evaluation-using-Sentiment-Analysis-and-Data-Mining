{"text": "I ordered a pair of these &#34;one size fits most&#34; and a pair of plus size both from Leg Ave. I have thick thighs and have always struggled to find thigh highs that fit and stay up. I think these and the plus size will both be fine with garters, as they want to roll up on their own without the support. But, SURPRISE, both the one size and the plus size fit me in pretty much the same way. These might have been slightly tighter, but certainly not like I expected once I received the plus size pair first and tried them on and saw how well they fit. Sounds like an issue for both the small petites with slim thighs that would likely find this pair too loose for them and the thick ladies with curvy thighs that need the extra room that they might not find in the plus size pair since I'm still rather small and they fit me comfortably. However, if you're unlikely small percentage of women that is 5'0&#34; 130-140lb like me with a curvy body and thick thighs, then hey, kudos, because either pair will work great for you!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07273677", "1": "0.3180407", "3": "0.23300102", "4": "0.051145583", "5": "0.12129661", "6": "0.20141762"}}
