{"text": "My husband loves these Beatle boots.  We purchased two other kinds before finding the Giorgio Brutini models and these are far and away the best and least expensive of the lot.  We were so pleased with them, we bought a second pair!They're comfortable, of excellent quality, and they look just like the ones John, Paul, George, and Ringo used to wear.  The heel rubber can wear down pretty quickly, as with any shoes, but your local shoe repair can fix that for less than $10.  Just be sure to have it done before the wooden heel starts to wear away.These are lovely boots and are enthusiastically recommended.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05499994", "1": "0.22242755", "2": "0.2822915", "3": "0.031482175", "4": "0.17960814", "5": "0.09244024", "6": "0.13675049"}}
