{"text": "Excellent product. Well-made, true-to-size and extremely comfortable. They're good to sleep in (which is what I bought them for) although perhaps a tad too supportive for that purpose (I don't really mind). Also great for lounging around and even a run to the grocery store! So glad I found this product. I wish the 36C-D-DD would come back in stock so I can buy more!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04077281", "1": "0.28073663", "2": "0.059064735", "3": "0.16755915", "4": "0.04881225", "5": "0.28388447", "6": "0.11917001"}}
