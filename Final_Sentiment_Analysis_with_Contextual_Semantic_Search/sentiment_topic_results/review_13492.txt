{"text": "After all the reviews I read, and the ones my friends told me, I am confused. These 501 shrink to fit jeans shrunk about one inch in the waist, and about an inch and a half in length exactly as advertised and exactly as the first ones I got in the first grade in 1962. These jeans are not as tough as they used to be but neither am I. They will last for me just fine. I can not beat Amazon's price around here unless they are on sale, and not everyone's sale. I ordered them on the ninth and they arrived on the eighteenth. I guess I am spoiled by Amazon because I usually get my stuff faster than that. I guess all in all the whole deal was as good as it always is. The jeans fit perfectly when I got them and after the wash they were a little tight, but after I wear them some they will stretch back to perfect, same as always. The last Levis I ordered came from Mexico, these came from Haiti and there was no difference in the quality at all. I will order them again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13489845", "1": "0.16895987", "2": "0.16398875", "3": "0.16786812", "4": "0.26639688", "5": "0.055996187", "6": "0.041891724"}}
