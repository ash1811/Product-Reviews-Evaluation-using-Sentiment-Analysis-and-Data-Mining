{"text": "I have tried so many bras that didn't fit right.  Generally I ended up with a 38 c and then I got fitted and discovered that I am a 34 dd.  I've tried really expensive brands, since I find that as I am aging (late 40s now), I could use more support.  I am an \"apple\" shape and pretty out of shape, although not too heavy.  I find that this bra gives me great support, is extremely comfortable, and allows me to move freely all day.  I haven't had any problem with the straps being too long and I am avg height (5'6\"). The price is fantastic for the quality too.  I hate hand washing and I don't for these either.  I do close the hooks and put them in a mesh bag though, and I air dry them.  They are holding up well.  The underwire doesn't shift or poke through, the light padding stays put, and the straps don't dig in.  For me, this brand is a total win!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05436418", "1": "0.30470535", "2": "0.12175076", "3": "0.3072698", "5": "0.105986714", "6": "0.103484675"}}
