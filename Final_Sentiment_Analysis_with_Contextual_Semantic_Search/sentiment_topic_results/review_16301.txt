{"text": "I bought two of these, one for me and the other for my little brother. They're pretty cool, have a working barrel and hammer. You can also shoot each other without protection (except eye, always use eye protection!) and it doesn't hurt or sting but its enough force to know you got hit. Be sure to buy ammo for it because it doesn't come with any. Its a good buy", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17811327", "1": "0.32861415", "2": "0.13437451", "3": "0.043886762", "4": "0.1162502", "5": "0.078133315", "6": "0.12062775"}}
