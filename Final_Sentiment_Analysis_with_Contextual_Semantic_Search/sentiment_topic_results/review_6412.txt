{"text": "I recently posted another negative feedback on a different Thorlo sock I bough at the same time as these. This one fit completely better. The padding on the bottom is thick and cushy without leaving me feeling like I'm too loose or sliding around in my shoes. The top of the toe is protected without being overly thick and it breaths nicely. After two washing the socks still fit correctly where the other Thorlo shrunk so much after the first wash that I could not stand to wear them again.I liked them enough that I'm ordering several more pairs after my next pay check.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08276332", "1": "0.29670617", "2": "0.042430248", "3": "0.13789783", "4": "0.058863074", "5": "0.23566662", "6": "0.14567271"}}
