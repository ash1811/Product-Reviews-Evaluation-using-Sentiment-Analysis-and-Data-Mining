{"text": "This is a nice looking shoe, well made and good price.  But I had to return them because the medium width was too narrow for my usual size B.  A wide width probably would have worked, but was not available.  Too bad, because I liked the style and construction, and basic oxfords for women are hard to find these days.  I usually buy Timberland oxfords, and wear a 7 B, but they have no oxford styles for women at the present.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.046225615", "1": "0.6037481", "2": "0.23079403", "6": "0.10897842"}}
