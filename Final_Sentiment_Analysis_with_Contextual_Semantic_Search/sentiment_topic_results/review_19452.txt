{"text": "I give my daughter a Hobo wallet each year for Christmas.  She switches back and forth between the colors. But she loves this style wallet.  We always seem to go back to the Lauren Vintage style.  It is such good quality and the room you have for everything...wow! She likes it because it has several different compartments and the magnetic part holds the wallet &#34;together&#34; very nicely where it is not falling open like some wallets do. It has two top compartments you open to put your change, credit cards, bills, etc...Then you have other areas to place several other items as well. The black color is very rich and classy. Love this wallet!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.25370938", "2": "0.15321316", "3": "0.13838199", "4": "0.061819647", "5": "0.24866173", "6": "0.14186294"}}
