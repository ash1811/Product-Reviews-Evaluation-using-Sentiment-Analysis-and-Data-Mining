{"text": "I am a tango dancer which means spending a LOT of time pivoting on the ball of my foot in 3\" to 4\" stilettos. My feet were getting tired. I thought these looked cute and easy to apply.I like that they have a pattern so that when I'm changing in and out of my shoes people see something fun. They also work pretty well. They aren't anything fancy and they don't seem very thick but I definitely notice now when I wear a pair of Comme il Fauts without them; my feet get tired a lot faster.All in all I would definitely recommend them. They are well worth it for the price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10644045", "1": "0.22772224", "2": "0.1111533", "3": "0.2381269", "4": "0.2351485", "6": "0.07897825"}}
