{"text": "These do not work with Classic style or any UGG that does not have a removable insole. I replaced the insole of my original UGGs that are made in Australia and have a slightly less rounded toe. I can't find the model anymore. So beware that if the insole is not removable, then these will not work! Otherwise, this is a good high-quality product for a very good price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.058616895", "1": "0.24456416", "2": "0.13756543", "4": "0.30351084", "5": "0.1417198", "6": "0.10940724"}}
