{"text": "I've had Rolex watches in the past and love the shape and mechanics, but the maintenance and the stigma became too much for me. So, I bought the submariner Invicta 89260B for nothing, expecting nothing, and am I ever impressed! It works, keeps great time, looks awesome, feels \"right\" on the wrist (not to light, not too heavy) and is water proof (at least in the pool/shower/sweating). What else can I say? No criticisms. It's priced about right. Any more and it'd be too much. Any less and they'd be giving it away.JUNE 2013 EDIT:If you don't wear it for a while (2+ days) it stops. It's purely mechanical so needs to be worn so that your motion keeps it wound. I'd love a battery option... after all it's only $90. Just realize that it's not a pure quartz time piece where a battery will keep it ticking for a year.  STILL LOVE IT though. Nice weight, function, and keeps accurate time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19124664", "1": "0.1837859", "2": "0.07718928", "3": "0.1010126", "4": "0.04872691", "5": "0.13846289", "6": "0.25957578"}}
