{"text": "I am on my second pair of these boots and my grandson's and I ordered their Mom/my daughter a pair for Christmas.  I let them pick the color - of course, they picked hot pink but she was delighted.  She had other pairs of boot like slippers that weren't UGG's, but now she knows what all the fuss is about.  They truly keep your feet so warm - you'll never want to take them off.  My daughter and I wear a 7 to a 7.5 and the Youth Size 6 fits perfects and is so much less expensive than the grownup size.  I even bought two pair of Youth sized outdoor UGG boots for myself this year.  And - they arrived right on time even though there was some concern about the weather preventing a timely delivery for Christmas.  Thumbs up for Amazon and UGG!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.077250004", "1": "0.30595133", "3": "0.049803108", "4": "0.20914134", "5": "0.2059645", "6": "0.14942057"}}
