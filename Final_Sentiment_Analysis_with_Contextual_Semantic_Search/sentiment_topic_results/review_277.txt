{"text": "I have bought 3 or 4 different colors in these shorts and the Paratrooper pants by Rothco and all of them are made extremely well. Great stitching and super soft/comfortable material. I believe they are stone washed and man that made these things very nice to the touch. But they are very durable!Check out a pair in your favorite color and I bet like me you will buy more of them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09552214", "1": "0.64671946", "2": "0.24090055"}}
