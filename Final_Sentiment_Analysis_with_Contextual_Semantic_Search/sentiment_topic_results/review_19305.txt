{"text": "I wanted a watch that would pass for quality to the lay person.  I was not expecting much because of how cheap this watch was, but it really looks like a watch that you could get for $15 bucks somewhere else.  I will add that I do not know much about watches, but my wife and I took it out of the box and instantly decided we should return it.  If you are going to go with a cheap watch and don't care, I would just say to get a simple one from walmart or something.  This watch will not fool people for being high-end.  I am just going to save up for something a little nicer looking.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3672145", "2": "0.4662858", "3": "0.0590549", "6": "0.099751286"}}
