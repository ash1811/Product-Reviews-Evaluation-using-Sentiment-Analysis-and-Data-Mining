{"text": "This set is pretty flimsy.  The garter especially has weak elastics and an &#34;S&#34; style clasp.  The result is a belt that constantly slides down due to the tug of stockings.  The clasp seems to because easily unhooked.  Moreover, after just a few washings the material started pilling.
