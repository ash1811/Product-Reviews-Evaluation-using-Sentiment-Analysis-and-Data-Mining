{"text": "Rainbow Sandals are my absolute favorite. This is only my second pair, though I've been wearing them since 2007! My first pair lasted so incredibly long, and truly, if I had taken better care of them they would still work to this day. Unfortunately, my first pair started to crack a bit in the strap after I took them on one or ten too many rainy/muddy camping trips. If you're a first time user, they are very uncomfortable at first, they will rub your feet in all the wrong ways, but have patience! The leather will literally mold to fit your feet, and before you know it it's as if you are wearing a pair of custom made sandals. The discomfort bit only lasts a few wears anyway. Also, they have a great warranty process!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09268295", "1": "0.2536175", "2": "0.16009967", "3": "0.172374", "4": "0.18782327", "5": "0.13101557"}}
