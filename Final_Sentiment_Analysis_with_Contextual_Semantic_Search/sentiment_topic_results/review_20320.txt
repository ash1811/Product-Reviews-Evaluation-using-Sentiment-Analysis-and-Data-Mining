{"text": "For my fiance, these replace a pair of low-top Merrill shoes.  These provide much more ankle support and probably even lighter.  No vibram outsole, but still a great tread.  She is really hard on shoes and loves these.  Cheaper than the local rei  and there was  coupon for express shipping and it was really fast. Great item, great seller.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.079085566", "1": "0.18989259", "2": "0.14395428", "3": "0.26965585", "4": "0.15299937", "5": "0.10804318", "6": "0.056369133"}}
