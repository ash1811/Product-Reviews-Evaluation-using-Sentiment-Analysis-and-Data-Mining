{"text": "These really are the old style dungaree, so exactly what I was looking for.  They allow for freedom of movement and are warm with a soft flannel inside.  They are a soft not stiff dungaree.  Another plus on these, I have bought several pair.  They are consistently sized.  This has been a problem with some brands of jeans.  You have a pair that fit, buy another pair exactly alike both style and size but they are not the same fit.  If you like the skinny leg jeans these are not what you are looking for.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1768725", "1": "0.3094634", "2": "0.039626226", "3": "0.15795624", "4": "0.08856793", "6": "0.22431831"}}
