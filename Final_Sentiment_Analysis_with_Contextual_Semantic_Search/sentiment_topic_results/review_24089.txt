{"text": "I have owned at least 5 of these Glamorise full figure sports bras and so far Amazon has the best price.  These are comfortable and hold up well with numerous washings.  I have found that in order for the band to be super comfortable, I order a size up.  For instance, most dress bras are 42 for me and I prefer the Glamorise in 44.  Since I do a lot of aerobics classes, that size feel more comfortable.Would definitely recommend this bra for anyone looking for stability in a sport bra.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2563829", "1": "0.19054325", "2": "0.12888154", "3": "0.27596518", "4": "0.10973158", "6": "0.035494205"}}
