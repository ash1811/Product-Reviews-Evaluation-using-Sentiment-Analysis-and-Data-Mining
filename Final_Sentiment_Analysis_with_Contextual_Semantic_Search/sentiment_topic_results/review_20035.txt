{"text": "I love all the pockets on this thing (I had it a month or two before I even noticed all of them). It seems durable. I get comments from strangers about how cool the attached rain cover is (and it's been pretty handy). I would prefer that the chest strap (top most strap connecting the arm straps) were more adjustable (upwards). It is uncomfortable on my shoulders when I ride my bike and lean forward. The waist strap is worthless but I never cared. It only has one waterbottle pouch, which is sufficient for my current needs but not great for hiking. The back doesn't have airflow so don't expect any. The computer compartment is great and has a second zipper on the main pocket for easy computer access.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.087270595", "1": "0.14464267", "2": "0.330735", "3": "0.15919329", "4": "0.13418904", "5": "0.06611157", "6": "0.07785782"}}
