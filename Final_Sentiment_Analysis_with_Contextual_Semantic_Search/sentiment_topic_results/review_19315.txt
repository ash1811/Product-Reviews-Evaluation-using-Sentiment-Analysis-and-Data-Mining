{"text": "I wanted a windup watch because I am trying to use less battery-powered objects in my life. This watch was very reasonably priced, arrived quickly and I have been wearing it now for about 4 years or more. It came in a nice \"tin\" and promptly went onto my wrist, where it has served me well. I can wind it for a good long time, which means it can sit around for a while, off my wrist (like overnight or a day or two) and won't run down on me, No batteries to replace, either, so only an occasional memory lapse makes it stop.The nylon watchband has lasted all this time with little or no wear. It gets a little scuzzy (smelly) from sweat now and then, but a spritz with a disinfectant and a cursory toweling off will revive its more pleasant aspect. When I wore my battery watch with its \"tank tread\" metal band, all kinds of dirt, plus sweat, kept getting trapped in the nooks and crannies of the band, and I had to take it off the watch and dip it every so often to kill the odors.One thing I was not too crazy about is the little tiny window on the face of the watch that shows the date -- and now after X amount of years (I think 4 at least) this watch is beginning to GAIN time.Waterproof? I would not test it to find out -- Water Resistant -- yes, definitely so.But I'm happy with it, except for.....Scuze me now -- I have to synchronize my watch with my cell phone again, Perhaps a trip to the watch doctor for an overhaul and cleaning mught not be a bad idea.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.097168006", "1": "0.16377643", "2": "0.14059724", "3": "0.23888911", "4": "0.058975786", "5": "0.1831367", "6": "0.11745673"}}
