{"text": "Overall the watch is awesome.  I do actually use it when diving, though it is only rated as water \"resistant\" and not waterproof.  I can say it holds up to at least 90 feet.  The dial is very readable at depth, the digital display however is not.  The multifunction display has no backlight and at times can be hard to make out, even on land.  The display does have luminescent hands and numbers that can be make out with no problem.  Very comfortable and functional.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2157939", "1": "0.101344526", "2": "0.23304686", "3": "0.13305752", "4": "0.12250506", "5": "0.04214044", "6": "0.15211171"}}
