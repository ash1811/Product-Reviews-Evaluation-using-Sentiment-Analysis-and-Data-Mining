{"text": "These were great for my son's halloween costume.  Looks fantastic.  They are inflatable - I don't know if you can tell that from the picture.  You have to get them really inflated in order for the wings to stick out straight like they should.  My chief complaint is how the straps (very thin 1/4&#34; elastic) are attached to the jet pack.  It looks like they will break loose any moment.  Mine survived a halloween party and halloween itself, but I don't expect this to stand up to much more.  It did look great with the costume, though!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15989572", "1": "0.28781724", "2": "0.26049343", "3": "0.089666754", "4": "0.11195273", "5": "0.053954057", "6": "0.036220044"}}
