{"text": "The good:This watch is simple (just 2 buttons for operation) and has some convenient features. I use the quick timer the most (1, 3, 5, 10, 20, and 30 minute settings). It also has a stopwatch function, which is is also useful. The rubber strap feels durable and I haven't had a problem--though you might get a bit sweater underneath the band. It's perfect for work at the hospital/clinic or school--I don't have to rely on my phone for the time. I've had it for over a year and the battery is still good.The bad:Should this thing run out of battery, I feel like there's no way for me to replace the battery without risking breaking it--I might buy a new one instead of just replacing the battery.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11925077", "1": "0.22878632", "2": "0.1764878", "3": "0.20688559", "4": "0.1886743", "6": "0.07771246"}}
