{"text": "We purchased these when the pants for our son's Hip Hop dance costume came and were both see through and likely to rip on stage.  We needed something that would be baggy and have lots of pockets.  When I received these I was very pleased.  They are adjustable at the waist so if you order them a bit loose you can still wear them and have them fit well.  The ties at the bottom also make it so that they are very forgiving for height, they also create the look of a Hip Hop pant.One of the best features is in the crotch area  where there is an extra panel of fabric which I have often seen in dance pants.  The panel makes it so that you don't have a seem where you are likely to put a lot of stress on the pant so the back of your plants won't split open even if you are doing the spits.  This is not just great for dancers but if you have a job or activity that you do which requires a  wide range of movement, climbing, bending or crawling I think you will find that these pants are not only comfortable, but rugged.My son usually wears a small mens pant but because we needed them to be on the baggy side we went with the medium. They fit him well and based on how they fit him I would recommend going one size up, if they are a little baggy you can adjust the waist so it might be good to error on the side of a little too big instead of a little too tight.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.101585284", "1": "0.32980075", "2": "0.06902236", "3": "0.15432644", "4": "0.20322636", "5": "0.088674255", "6": "0.053364534"}}
