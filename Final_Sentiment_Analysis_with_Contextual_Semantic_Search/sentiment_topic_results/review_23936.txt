{"text": "This is a very comfortable bra but I ordered it in my regular size and found it a bit too large.  The end of the seams poked out too much and would not be good under a t-shirt. The bra is very soft but does not define, in other words, it ends up a uniboob type.  This would be good for sleeping but not wearing in public.  Does not lift enough.  It is *definitely* a leisure bra.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.29835013", "2": "0.03918146", "3": "0.45390463", "5": "0.05209573", "6": "0.1477905"}}
