{"text": "I wear a 10/12 (usually talls) and the medium is perfect, the waist is up where it should be, the elastic has grip, and the fabric is thick enough for modesty. FINALLYThey are barely long enough on my long legs, but at least they are not short. No massive shrinkage, just a decent legging to wear with a tunic. Happy with the purchase, will look for more colors. The black is nice and true and didn't bleed on first wash with other darks.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11757501", "1": "0.22803695", "3": "0.1759298", "4": "0.17951792", "5": "0.2173959", "6": "0.07795312"}}
