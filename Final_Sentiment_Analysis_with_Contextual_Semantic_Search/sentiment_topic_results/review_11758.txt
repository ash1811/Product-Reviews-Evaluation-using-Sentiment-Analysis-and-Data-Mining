{"text": "Received these as a gift and while as a general rule I enjoy wearing ball earrings I will NOT be wearing these. They are going to be returned ASAP. They really are awful, feel much more like plastic than gold and are sure to fall apart or dent on the first wearing.There are other pairs of 14k gold ball earrings in my jewelry box and even the ones that are much smaller weigh more than these.If your intention is simply to just own something made of 14k gold then I suppose these would serve that purpose but if you want a pretty and serviceable pair of earrings, pass these by.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1917187", "1": "0.27694404", "2": "0.10442619", "3": "0.20290619", "4": "0.13160859", "5": "0.07162916", "6": "0.020767123"}}
