{"text": "I really wanted an ALL Rose Gold look. And this company makes them in all gold and all silver with one side glossy and the other a satin look which would be my first choice, but so far they do not have it in all Rose Gold. I have shoulder length hair and they barely show. I might switch to a dangle shape instead. However they are truly beautiful and rich looking. If I had gobs of money I would definitely keep them! I have to decide....it's hard to know what to do. I have a ring wth rose gold and would like earrings of same color to match.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17170224", "1": "0.11697752", "2": "0.08133069", "3": "0.29623306", "4": "0.055132445", "5": "0.1450199", "6": "0.13360412"}}
