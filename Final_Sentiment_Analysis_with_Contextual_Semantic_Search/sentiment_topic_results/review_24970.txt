{"text": "I bought this at the recommendation of my podiatrist. I'd started having pain in my big toe joint and it turned out I was pronating and probably had been forever. The pain was persistent and kept me from walking more than I had to. I'm not even 30 yet! I took the podiatrist's suggestion to cut off the plastic tabs under my big toes, and after a couple of months, the pain has improved dramatically. I'm going to buy a second pair to swap out amongst my less comfy shoes so I can show up to work meetings looking less like a hobo. Can't imagine going back to shoes with no support.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09086334", "1": "0.31188634", "2": "0.16410348", "4": "0.17607416", "5": "0.11257247", "6": "0.14206393"}}
