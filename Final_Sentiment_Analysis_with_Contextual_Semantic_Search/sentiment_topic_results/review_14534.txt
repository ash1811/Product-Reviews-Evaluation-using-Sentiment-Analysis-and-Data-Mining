{"text": "Been wearing \"Secret Sole\" by Isotoner for several years because I have Plantar Faciitis and have to have the foot support.  However, newer Isotoner styles are too narrow, the old style is discontinued, and some of the new styles don't have the mid-foot support.Researched a bunch and tried the Acorn. Love them except for one pretty big issue.  The velcro closure is based on a hard plastic type of base-- probably so the stitching will be more secure and stay for a long time.  Problem is the raw edge of the plastic has to end past the stitch line, creating a thin line of roughness.  That plastic rubs against the top of my foot, just left of the center, near the toes.  I tried to cut it back a little, but it still rubs.  Doesn't rub a red spot or a blister, just irritates.  Maybe I'll try a fabric tape next.  Only thing with that is that they won't be adjustable since I'll have to tape over the place where the velcro overlaps.I have the same problem with the tags in night gowns.  I suppose companies use that horrid plastic thread so that their brand name will always be in the gown-- well after the material has worn out!Maybe I just have very sensitive skin or nerve endings. :-)Anyway, I have mixed feelings about purchasing the Acorn again.  They're double the price and aren't truly comfortable.  I just don't know where to turn next in my research for a great pair of bedroom slippers that address my foot problems.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10163227", "1": "0.2264438", "3": "0.15577029", "4": "0.3248686", "5": "0.083895914", "6": "0.10514487"}}
