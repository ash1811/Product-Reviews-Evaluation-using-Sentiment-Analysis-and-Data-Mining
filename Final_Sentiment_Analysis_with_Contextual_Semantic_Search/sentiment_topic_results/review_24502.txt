{"text": "They are not true to size. I ordered 3x-4x so they would be a little loose. I am 235 ibs (1x-2x or 16/18) now and 5'5. These do not go up all the way and are too tight. 3x-4x should be able to fix me fine but they don't. As they went up, they tore at the knee. Very cheap. My two stars are for color and design which are fine and precise. Based on other reviews for this, I bought it because the reviewers were heavier than me and it supposedly fit them. So I don't know if I had the bad batch but mine was terrible so I would think twice before buying.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12325504", "1": "0.31928876", "2": "0.21392033", "3": "0.23400149", "4": "0.06941971", "5": "0.03724498"}}
