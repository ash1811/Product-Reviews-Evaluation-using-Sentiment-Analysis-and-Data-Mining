{"text": "Wow..I found it by fluke just browsing at Coscto and I just paid it 89.00 bucks.. Im surprised to see it so expensivce here..Its a great watch..I dont like the green coloured buttons on the side..The temp.  is if off because it takes a reading off your arm,..so it is ALWYAS 7 degree warmer.. You have to take it off your wrist and place it down then in about 25 - 30 minutes the temp will readjust to the correct temperature..Nice watch..but check elsewhere for prices..UPDATE:I dropped the watch out of my car.. \"don't ask..\"  Well it fell onto on coming cars on city road..and I see a small truck just run over it..strap went flying////etc..The watch itself was a total loss..shattered dome, just gone..not a G Shock from what I hear/./", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16367903", "1": "0.18854491", "2": "0.32628855", "3": "0.04737083", "4": "0.06339734", "5": "0.043403644", "6": "0.16731574"}}
