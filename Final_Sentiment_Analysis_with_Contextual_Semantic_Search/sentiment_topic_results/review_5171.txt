{"text": "These earrings arrived on time via prime ship.  The quality is surprisingly good considering the low cost. The weight is good, not flimsy.  Be careful of not accidentally bending the post considering it is on the edge of one of the points of the starfish.  I love how these kind of hug my ear lobes. Very cute. Not tiny, but just the right size for everyday wear without being ultra boring. Love them!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.32003823", "1": "0.14220035", "3": "0.093769245", "4": "0.15003896", "5": "0.1711105", "6": "0.11934666"}}
