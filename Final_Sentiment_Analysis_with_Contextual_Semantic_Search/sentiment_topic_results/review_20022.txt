{"text": "I compared 4 High Sierra backpack models: Access (this model), NeoHigh Sierra Neo Backpack, MayhemHigh Sierra Mayhem Backpack, and InclineHigh Sierra Incline Backpack. I'm a 5'2\" woman.  For my uses (carryon for travel/day hikes), I selected the Neo model.  This pack has alot of extra features, but some are useless.  Best added feature of this pack is the raincover.  I liked the 2 separate shoulder straps on this model as opposed to the yoke straps on 2 other models.  All 4 packs had tags indicating that they could hold a 17\" laptop.  This model and the Incline could not hold my Dell 17\" Inspiron. All 4 packs had pouches in the shoulder straps. The pouch in this one was useless.  It was the smallest pouch and did not fit my iphone. Three of the models including this one, had a larger and probably more durable zippers than the Incline model. The padding on the bottom seems the same on all models. The raincover on this Access pack provides some extra padding when the raincover is in the hidden pouch. The padding on the backs of the packs seem to be about the same.  I didn't use the packs, so I can't comment on the ventilation/airflow materials at the back of the packs.Pros:- Fabric seems durable- Purple print is great color. Like the black accent.- Raincover - nice feature.  Easy on and off pack.  Easy to store in bottom of pack.- 2 unattached shoulder strips (unlike the yoke straps on other models which I don't like)- Waist straps can be hidden in area at back of pack when not used.- Chest straps location can be adjusted up and down about 2 inches- Back access zipper for getting laptop in/out of pack- 3 looped Daisy chain for attaching accessories to the front of the pack- 1 attached Swivel Clip on front for adding gear- Adjustable side compression straps- Larger and hopefully more durable zippers on this model (smaller ones on Incline model)- Comfortable grab handle on top of pack that is not integrated as part of shoulder straps.Cons:- Sternum/Chest straps not comfortable location for a 5'2\" woman- Waist straps not comfortable location for a 5'2\" woman.  Too low.- Only 1 mesh pocket on outside. Why not add one on other side?- Mess pocket on holds one 16-20 oz bottles nicely.  For 1000 ml nalgene bottle, it stretches too much and doesn't go deep enough to be secure.- Too Tight of a fit for my 17\" Dell Inspiron Computer. (16.5\" L x 11.5) Zipper does close at top (barely), but concerned it will cause pack to rip. Fits 15\" Dell (15\"x10\").- Hard to zip because of the flap over the zippers.  If you fold the flap up, then zip the pack, then fold the flap back down, it makes the zipping easier but slower.  IMO, this flap is unnecessary since the pack comes with a raincover.- Detachable pouch for MP3 player or phone (Barely 4\"x3\"). Concerned it may come off causing whatever is in it to get broken or lost.  Pouch is too small for iphone - Velcro closure flap cannot be  closed.- Vapel(tm) mesh Airflow(tm) padded shoulder straps are too stiff and uncomfortably dig into my body- No zippered side pockets- Smaller than expected. Fully loaded, not counting the mesh side pocket, it measures 19\"x13\"x10\" = 2470 cu in.  Less than the reported 2743.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15250713", "1": "0.20809838", "2": "0.20435598", "3": "0.07787627", "4": "0.13697381", "5": "0.0185694", "6": "0.20161904"}}
