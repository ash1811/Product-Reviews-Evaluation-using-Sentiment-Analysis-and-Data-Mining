{"text": "1st of all it came folded over several times which left un-removable creases in the material. 2nd the tops  of the&#34; boots&#34; were large enough to fit around my WAIST which looked ridiculous around my legs. 3rd. the elastic straps on the bottom that are designed to wrap around your shoes are SO short that when I wrapped them under my foot- NO SHOE ON- they scrunched up my foot and it started to fall asleep. No way that would EVER fit over ANY pair of shows I own. Very poorly made.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1126683", "1": "0.22611842", "2": "0.30349407", "3": "0.052755576", "4": "0.1608756", "5": "0.14119466"}}
