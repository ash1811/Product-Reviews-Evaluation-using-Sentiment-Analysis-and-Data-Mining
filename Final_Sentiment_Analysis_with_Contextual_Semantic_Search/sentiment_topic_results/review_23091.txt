{"text": "Great pants. Perfect fit.Wrinkle freeStain resistant. What more could you want?I don't know how other people are getting too big or small pants. I have ordered Silver, Khaki, and Black. They are a perfect fit. I always order a size bigger just in case they shrink after washing. I will update if any changes after washing. I would give this a 5 star but I don't like the clasp closure, I'd rather have a button. But Dickies does not have 34x29L pants with a button closure.Thank you amazon.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15683863", "1": "0.361892", "2": "0.2130978", "3": "0.07077406", "4": "0.09350367", "5": "0.100835524"}}
