{"text": "I love this backpack for its room, room, room! So many compartments to store everything you need. I live out of my backpack, so it's important to me to have plenty of compartments. Plus, this fits my 17&#34; laptop with ease!There are 2 things I don't like: the front zipper is narrower on the new models. This means it's hard to fit your hand in the very front pocket (that's where I like to keep my keys and other stuff). Secondly, the zippers seem to catch and stick, so make sure you use both hands to open and close.Even with those cons, I still love this backpack. They last for years and they are all I will own.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11311318", "1": "0.1210706", "2": "0.23530038", "3": "0.21709065", "4": "0.13455977", "6": "0.17639676"}}
