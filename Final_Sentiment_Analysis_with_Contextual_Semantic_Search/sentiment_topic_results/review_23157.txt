{"text": "This one is made very closely to playtex 4693 as they say.The cups seem a bit smaller at the same size so you may wish to go up one letter.The only reason this got 4 instead of 5 stars is they put the ring for the strap adjustment at the top of the strap right on the shoulder, where it carries a lot of the weight and the darn thing digs and hurts all day.I've had to take some material and wrap it around and sew it on.Wouldn't be an issue if they just flipped it over and put the ring in the back near the bottom of the strap instead. Other than that, it's a great bra.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03040617", "1": "0.21520522", "2": "0.19223253", "3": "0.21473752", "4": "0.20091389", "5": "0.064688586", "6": "0.08181604"}}
