{"text": "I live in a hot climate and I found the footbed makes my feet sweat also got painful blisters on the back of my heel from the strap rubbing. This is my firt pair of Keen and this style seems to run a half size small I needed a 9.5 in venice, I normally wear a 9 in other brand shoes. These make your feet look like boats, not at all attractive especially with socks which is the only way I find them comfortable. I will use them on my kayak where nobody will see my ugly giant boat shoes. Not a big fan of these.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12777361", "1": "0.16710839", "2": "0.07293667", "3": "0.2532333", "4": "0.14082772", "5": "0.10235373", "6": "0.13576661"}}
