{"text": "I like the feel of the wool on my feet - they are snug and warm, without my feet getting hot. I also like these colors and have received a lot of compliments. My complaint is that after washing and drying, they become crumpled up, slightly fuzzy and they are like a trap for any hair that was in the machine. I'm not sure if that happens with all wool socks but it's an annoyance. That said, these are very durable, with no holes in the heels or toes after almost a year.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.28356066", "2": "0.111558594", "3": "0.2784301", "4": "0.14774723", "5": "0.06740033", "6": "0.107890144"}}
