{"text": "I love these  boots. I had been a Doc Martens customer for my work boots for years.  Then they moved the factory to China and the quality went right in the crapper.So after much research I decided to give these a try being made in America by Union labor I was really hoping they would be a good boot. I wasn't disappointed, these boots broke in in just a few days. I spend 11 hours a day on cement floors in a factory. I walk 15,000+ steps on average. The first day they felt good, day 2 they were really comfortable and day 3 I went home with no fatigue in my feet or legs. An extremely short break in period if you can call it that. I did Mink Oil them before wearing them the first time, but I do that with all my work boots.I can't recommend these highly enough. Give them a try if you, like me work all day on cement floors and need a safety boot.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18328965", "1": "0.24196127", "2": "0.041741945", "3": "0.13726598", "4": "0.23736323", "5": "0.124936424", "6": "0.033441514"}}
