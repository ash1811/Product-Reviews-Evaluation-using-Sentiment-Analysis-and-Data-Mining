{"text": "Received these glasses in Australia a day before estimated. Ticked all the right boxes as far authenticity was concerned. So many reviews out there about fakes. BUY DIRECTLY FROM AMAZON LCC. I picked up a 52mm over here but they were a tad too small, hence this pair. My wife is now enjoying the 52mm pair now. My glasses were slightly defective and needed a trip to the optical shop to get fixed, I opted to do this as a return(from overseas) and reorder was a bit of a drama for me. I contacted Amazon regarding this and they sorted out the cost of the repair. All my emails were responded to very promptly as was the refund for the repair. The sunnies are all good now. Go the extra and get the polarized ones, your eyes will thank you in the long run. If you can't decide on the size, go down to the mall and try both the 52 or 55mm out, everyone is different so no point reading reviews for this. At the end of the day I think Ray Ban's quality control needs a tune up, they should test the glasses more stringently if the expect people to pay top dollar before they the factory. I still like the classic look and polarized is the only way to go for me. I would have opted for the rubberized frame version but they unavailable at the time. Even though there was some drama with the sunnies, I must say Amazon's customer service was excellent. Maybe I just got a lemon but I still recommend getting these sunnies directly from Amazon. After all, they have the best price in town.
