{"text": "When I received these, they looked like good quality and the latch looked secure. I wore them to work (I have a desk job) and lost one the first day. Fortunately for me, the cleaning lady helped me look for it and managed to find it on the floor in the office. Now I'm scared to wear them again. I have another pair of sterling silver hoops that have this same type of latch. I've worn them for years, and they've never fallen out of my ears. I can't help but be disappointment with a pair of earrings when one falls out of my ear on the first day, especially when I did not do anything to cause it to fall out.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.087871276", "1": "0.16536278", "2": "0.13550726", "3": "0.19504778", "4": "0.2337271", "6": "0.18009226"}}
