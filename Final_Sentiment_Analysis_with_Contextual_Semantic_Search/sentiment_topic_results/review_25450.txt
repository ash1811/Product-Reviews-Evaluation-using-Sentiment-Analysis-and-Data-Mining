{"text": "I really like my moccasins. I enjoy wearing them around the apartment as the lining is very comfortable.A different pair of slippers I purchased previously claimed to have rubber soles, but the soles felt like frictionless plastic and I almost slipped and fell on my tile kitchen floor. These moccasins grip my kitchen floor well without any danger of slipping.I also would note that my shoes definitely ran at least a size larger than my normal shoe size. I normally wear 9.5 Medium sneakers and I purchased a 9 in these shoes, which leaves about a centimeter between my heel and the back of the shoe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10934056", "1": "0.27657047", "2": "0.2252244", "3": "0.061124165", "4": "0.101408646", "5": "0.07463382", "6": "0.15169793"}}
