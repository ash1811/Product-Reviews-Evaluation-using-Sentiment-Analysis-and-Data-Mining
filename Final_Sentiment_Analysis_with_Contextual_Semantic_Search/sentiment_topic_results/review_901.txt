{"text": "I have never had a pair of Reefs that has fallen apart so quickly.  First the leather lining comes undone on both sandals, then a few months later the nylon part is broken.  My past reefs have lasted at least 2 years if not 3.  This pair broke in less than a year.  I wonder if the manufacturing process has been compromised.  My sons Reefs bought at Costco had to be returned after about 2 months because the leather was delaminating from the sole.  What is up with Reef?", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13368914", "1": "0.35352036", "2": "0.2809913", "3": "0.14954677", "5": "0.048059795", "6": "0.03091681"}}
