{"text": "I bought these for my husband for our trip to an indoor water park. They're really comfy, fit to size and look stylish. The breathable material made them easy to dry and the rubber sole really helped reduce slipping on wet surfaces. He enjoyed them so much that he used them to wear around the house as well. Nice purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11050072", "1": "0.34589675", "4": "0.09494854", "5": "0.27048373", "6": "0.1701889"}}
