{"text": "From the moment I put these on my feet, they fit perfectly and comfortably in the  size shoe that I always wear.  I love the large broad size of the  hard rubber toe for added protection when hiking on rocks and in streams.  The sole is very heavy durable leather tread, for long lasting and comfortable wear.  I love the ankle support I feel with this particular design.  They seem very durable, and work great in all weather conditions. I have challenges finding shoes that fit properly and comfortably, and took a chance by ordering without first trying them on, but I credit the great fit to the fine Keen quality.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.058126077", "1": "0.38380632", "2": "0.12820582", "3": "0.2508302", "4": "0.04220346", "5": "0.07447689", "6": "0.0623512"}}
