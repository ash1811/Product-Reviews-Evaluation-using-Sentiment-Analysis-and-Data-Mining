{"text": "A bit tight after washing and then drying on hot. The torso is not too snug (even for someone who is a tad fat), but the arms are slightly tight. It fits more like how a long underwear shirt fits. I wonder if that is how it is supposed to fit. It is still slightly too long after drying. The shoulders fit me perfectly.I got the XL-Tall and I am usually an XL who needs a slightly taller size.The sleeves widen out after wearing! Turns into a great fit. If you have large biceps or forearms it might be a tad snug.One thing to note is that it does not have a front pocket.---I wonder if the http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002G9U8ZA/ , the regular style Carhartt Henley, fits the same as the textured one? Anyone have any idea? I have the http://www.amazon.com/Carhartt-Workwear-Pocket-Sleeve-T-Shirt/dp/B008G7IM18/ non-henley long-sleeve t-shirt as well, and that one is much less snug.[I edited this review 2013-03.]", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.085863106", "1": "0.35900447", "2": "0.06920801", "3": "0.1011597", "4": "0.095272094", "5": "0.12762433", "6": "0.16186826"}}
