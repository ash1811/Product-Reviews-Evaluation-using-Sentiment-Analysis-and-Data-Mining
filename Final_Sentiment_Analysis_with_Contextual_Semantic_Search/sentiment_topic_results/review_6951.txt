{"text": "Nice fabric feel and well sewn. The proportions are excellent with a good long body, but seems to run a little small. I expect a fair amount of shrinkage with this type of fabric even if preshrunk. Instructions say wash in cold water, but really, who washes heavy duty underwear in cold water? I probably would been happier with 1 size larger. The price at $16 is good but not great unless I am surprised by a lack of shrinkage.3 months later: Only slight shrinkage when washed warm, and gentle machine dried. Upgraded from 4 to 5 stars. I also like that is relatively long so keeps even my but warm.I year later: Still fabulous- no additional shrinkage and wears like iron. By far the best thermal I have ever owned.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10135538", "1": "0.20232297", "2": "0.13639458", "3": "0.14150847", "4": "0.09252729", "5": "0.13702847", "6": "0.18886283"}}
