{"text": "I workout somewhat aggressively for a 60+ guy and I perspire very heavily . Since my fitness area is in my home these are my workout briefs . They are cooler , absorb more perspiration , and do not &#34;ride&#34; like synthetic blend fabrics . Also the neutral color is recommended in the presence of sweat for avoiding rashes and irritation ( treadmill mileage ! ) .And the &#34;brief&#34; style furnishes good support for the ballroom .  Also at two pairs for 16 bux they are a real bargain . However for standard wear I prefer a roomy silk boxer .", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06832854", "1": "0.08151895", "2": "0.15795489", "3": "0.12171113", "4": "0.21633814", "5": "0.15511818", "6": "0.19903018"}}
