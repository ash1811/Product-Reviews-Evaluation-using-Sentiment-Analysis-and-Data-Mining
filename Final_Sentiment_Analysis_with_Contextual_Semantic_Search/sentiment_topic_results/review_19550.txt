{"text": "Good boots.  I bought them mainly to keep from wiping out on snow/ice and embarrassing myself.  So far so good--the traction seems great.  I'm not out trekking through snow for long periods of time, so I can't testify to how warm they'd be in extreme conditions, but for my purposes they've been perfect--kept my feet warm but didn't make them sweat or anything.  I see what others mean about the tops, but I just wrap the laces once around the back before tying and have had zero problems with snow getting in.  I'm usually between a size 10 and 11 (the shoes in my closet are about half and half).  I got the 11 and still have plenty of room left for thick socks, so these seem true to size.  Very comfortable, and pretty cute for something so functional.  My only complaint is that there's a significant difference between the color of the fur on the left vs. the right boot (the fur is a mix of black and white--one boot has lots more black, the other lots more white).  I'm guessing I just got a weird pair, as I hadn't seen that mentioned in any other reviews (although let me know if you have the same problem in your size 11s--maybe we can trade one boot haha).  I noticed it right off but didn't think it'd bother me enough to justify sending them back.  Maybe I should've though, since I think about it every single time I put them on.  I'll ding them one star for that--otherwise wonderful.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11246115", "1": "0.17896155", "2": "0.09685317", "3": "0.2882023", "4": "0.139837", "5": "0.16179882", "6": "0.021886062"}}
