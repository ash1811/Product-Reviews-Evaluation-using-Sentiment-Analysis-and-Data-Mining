{"text": "I was skeptical at first as I heard Leg Avenue runs smaller so when I received these I was impressed they are true to size and you can't go wrong with fishnet for warmer months as its cooler to wear under skirts dresses. I definitely would recommend these for any woman who has larger hips and it stretches so over the stomach is actually comfortable then again fishnet is very forgiving for most body types just doesn't have the control top if you are into shape wear or nylon which you usually have to go a size larger but I always loved fishnet for that comfort and stretch without feeling confined or uncomfortable. They do stretch upon wearing them as I tried them on for my outfit I will be wearing tonight but I think a gentle wash and drying should also help with the stretching issue and they are not so fragile to handle but like with me I have long nails so I had to be very careful putting these on. I am pleased with them and the company that sells and ships them had bought from Lingerie Diva before very good quality lingerie for us larger women :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06326483", "1": "0.24909616", "2": "0.19581924", "3": "0.21950828", "4": "0.09676608", "5": "0.11658083", "6": "0.05896457"}}
