{"text": "I've always had problems with straps slipping off my shoulders.  So annoying.  Well, I've had no problem with the straps on this bra.  It is so so comfortable, as well as pretty.  It doesn't give you that lift up, stick out look that underwires do but I care more about being comfortable.  There is no tag in the back to scratch and it has a gel patch over the fasteners so you can't feel those.  I have just ordered 3 more.  If you like comfort, straps staying up, and a pretty bra....this is for you.  Be sure you know your right size, however, before ordering.  Hope this helps.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17489447", "1": "0.33083934", "2": "0.14627886", "3": "0.1844174", "4": "0.052679222", "6": "0.10813642"}}
