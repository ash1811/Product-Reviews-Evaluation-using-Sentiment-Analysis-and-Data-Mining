{"text": "Because these are over the calf socks, I expected them to be more like knee socks, but they look like a long crew sock.. Because of the other glowing reviews, I'm wondering if I received the wrong socks.. I purchased 2 pair of them for a trip, and they did indeed help with leg swelling and pain, but I had to keep pulling them up over my calf. After I washed them, they look even more like a pair of crew socks... In comparison, I purchased a pair of Jobst support knee socks and they look like knee socks, fit like knee socks, wash great and didn't shrink...plus they cost the same as these socks.. From now on, I'll buy the jobst..I had purchased them elsewhere, but I just found them on Amazon..Wish I'd found them before ordering this brand!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.0762983", "1": "0.29600915", "2": "0.062512144", "3": "0.1399316", "5": "0.29420608", "6": "0.12873559"}}
