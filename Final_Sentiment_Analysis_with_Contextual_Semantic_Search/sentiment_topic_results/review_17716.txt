{"text": "It has all the basic features, it's been durable, and I like the looks of it.  But perhaps the best feature of this watch is its' size.  I shopped around for G-Shock watches, but they are all ginormous.  I have small wrist, and I wanted a larger, but not ridiculously huge G-Shock watch.  This watch is perfect size for me.My major concern is the band.  It's beefier, but if I abused it, I don't think it would withstand the wear.  Of course, I don't abuse it, and it might prove me wrong ten years from now.For now, it's an easy five-star purchase for me.  Very reasonably priced, and it's been a perfect delivery, all-around.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.20397377", "2": "0.20329867", "3": "0.12734054", "4": "0.16968082", "5": "0.21880242", "6": "0.07447386"}}
