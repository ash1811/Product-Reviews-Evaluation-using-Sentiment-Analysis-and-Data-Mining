{"text": "Lovely Bra, very pretty, cups are kinda hard, but not something unusual for this type of bra, they soften after washes. Found it to be a bit snug for 34D, but is ok, I know sizes vary and is hard when you shop online for Bra's. I like it, I would suggest maybe bumping your size up to a 36 if you are a 34 for example. But comfy and very form fitting and adds a nice lift as well without the uncomfortable feeling of a push up bra.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1892064", "1": "0.23125069", "3": "0.2792741", "4": "0.15031753", "6": "0.14385979"}}
