{"text": "For me, Hanes are the best fit.  There's never any riding up and they last a long time.  I would recommend them.This is an update.  I ordered another five pair of these.  I selected \"assorted colors\" and expected to get five different colors, as I did with the first five.  When they arrived, they were like the first five, but were ALL white, no colors.  That I can live with.  The other change was not good though.  After two washes and wears, one pair already has a hole in the crotch area.  I have not put them under any undue stress or through a bad washing machine.  They may not be as well made as the first five, which is a shame.  But they are a nice fit.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.5030051", "2": "0.13618815", "4": "0.034730203", "5": "0.2581703", "6": "0.06319518"}}
