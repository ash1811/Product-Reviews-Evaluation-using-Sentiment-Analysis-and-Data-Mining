{"text": "I wanted to go to all cotton underwear as part of a move to more natural products.  Bought these in size 4 (my pants size) to try them.  I  was unsure what size to buy.  I have washed them, and they shrunk a little i think, but not much.  They fit very well, do not ride up, and are very comfortable. As for the reviewer who thought they come up too high and show over her pants, I suggest her pants are waaaay too low :-).  if these show, she may have bought them too big, or her pants are so low, she is at risk of exposing her doo da!  I am here to buy more today.Update:  Liked so much, I bought 2 more packages.  I bought a size 5 in black and a 4 in white.  Don't see much difference.  Jockey sends a coupon with the first order.
