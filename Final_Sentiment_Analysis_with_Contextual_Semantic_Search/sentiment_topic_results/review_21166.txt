{"text": "My (almost) 5 year old son received this as a Christmas gift and was thrilled!  He and his friends love to dress up like superheroes and run around the house and yard, fighting \"bad guys.\"  This was such a great deal and has everything you need to be able to quickly dress up for some fun!  My son has several more years before he'll grow out of these costumes, which is a bonus.  They are made to grow with the child.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17950878", "1": "0.2075319", "2": "0.13620794", "3": "0.29839587", "4": "0.05776922", "5": "0.06374986", "6": "0.05683639"}}
