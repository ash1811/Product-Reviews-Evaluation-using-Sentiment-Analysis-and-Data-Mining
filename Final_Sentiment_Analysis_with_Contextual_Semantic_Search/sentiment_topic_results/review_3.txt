{"text": "It might just be me.  Although it seems well made and sized right.  It just seems a bit flimsy to me.  I debate if I really should not give it 5 stars as it does everything it advertises itself.  When I travel out of country, I have this around my neck and under one layer of clothing.  I have my &#34;throw away&#34; wallet in my pocket with expired cards and a few dollars.I like the various pockets and zippered security to keep things in place.  The neck cord is a little long so I had to tie it off so the stash would fall mid chest making it a bit more concealed.4.5 stars - minus 1/2 star for long cord and a flimsy feel.  Again though perhaps being flimsy is a good thing being under clothing making it conceal more.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.30300644", "2": "0.53983206", "3": "0.1479127"}}
