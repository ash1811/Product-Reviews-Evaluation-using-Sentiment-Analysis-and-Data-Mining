{"text": "This is perfect for dance class.  All the stores had super expensive leotards but this one was priced just right and had a great variety of colors to choose from too.  Fits well, no tags on the back (which is very important to my 4 year old)  My daughter is wearing a 4t and some 5t's and this fit perfect with no sagging in the rear or gaping in the front.  Will be sticking with Capezio products!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11643122", "1": "0.516467", "2": "0.19395237", "3": "0.045474395", "5": "0.05181483", "6": "0.07209103"}}
