{"text": "This box was VERY pretty!  It is more of a white iridescent...not the blue in the picture BUT yet VERY pretty.  The music sounds great and the ballerina was in good working condition.  My daughter (3 yrs old) absolutely LOVES the box and keeps opening and closing it.  Honestly, this was a GREAT deal....good quality box for the price you are paying.  It also brings back so many memories of my own musical jewellery box as a child...every little girl will love it!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20830138", "1": "0.36900857", "2": "0.15464412", "4": "0.14496885", "5": "0.07059346", "6": "0.04943288"}}
