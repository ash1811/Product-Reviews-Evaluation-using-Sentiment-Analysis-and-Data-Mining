{"text": "I got this to be a X-mas present to me from my 6 yr old because for years I have been needing a \"summer robe\" because my other 2 robes are thick & hot. I received this today & inspected it to see if it was the right color & all. It was but the reason for 4 stars is it runs big but that's not a big deal because robes aren't supposed to be skin tight. Also, the fabric is very thin almost transparent which is not good for a black robe! I doubt this will hold up for very long, I would wash it on the delicate cycle & be very careful not to snag it! It is attractive & I like that it is not too short which is why I chose this one (don't need to have my bum exposed) however, due to the very thin, delicate, almost transparent fabric... I would place the true value of this robe at $10.00-$15.00 & that is being kind.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1933651", "1": "0.33029988", "2": "0.045893725", "3": "0.28405216", "4": "0.14087056"}}
