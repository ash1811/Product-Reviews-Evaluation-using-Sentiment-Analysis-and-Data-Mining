{"text": "I ordered two new TALL sweatshirts on the same day from Amazon. Got them on the same day. Washed them on the same day. The Russell in XL navy blue shrunk up so short I can no longer wear it. Gave it to my shorter sister. The Carhart gray, didn't shrink much at all, and it's my favorite. I won't order Russell anymore with that much shrinkage.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21959135", "1": "0.45048055", "2": "0.044521343", "3": "0.050692752", "4": "0.113669164", "6": "0.116938084"}}
