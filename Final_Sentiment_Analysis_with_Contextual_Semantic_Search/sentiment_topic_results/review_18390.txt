{"text": "Purchased after reading the reviews and viewing the pics of the gold boots.  Thought they would be the thigh highs I was looking for, just for casual wear.  They were very large on my leg, and loose from bottom to top.  Just didn't look right.  They were also stiff and difficult to sit down while wearing.  I tried them on several times with different looks but couldn't find a reason to like them.  So, back they went.  The shoe part also looked very wide with a pointed toe that was huge.  Not a good looking boot, and I wouldn't even wear them for costume since they just didn't look right.  Glad that others found them acceptable and that's all that matters.  The silver ones appear to look great, but I now know how they look.  Too bad....", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2094364", "1": "0.2567915", "2": "0.029850041", "3": "0.24511236", "4": "0.13192856", "5": "0.03812745", "6": "0.08875368"}}
