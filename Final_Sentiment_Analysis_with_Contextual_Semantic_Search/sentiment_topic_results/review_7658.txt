{"text": "I really like this bra.  So much so that I bought another one recently.  However,  don't use the measuring guidelines given to determine your size and cup.  I used these and the bra was much too big, so am having to wear it using the last set of hooks.  When I reordered i brought both the size down by 2 sizes and the cup down by 1 size.  Other than the size, I liked the materials and the style.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15981503", "1": "0.24041863", "2": "0.10147371", "3": "0.3704121", "5": "0.12032874"}}
