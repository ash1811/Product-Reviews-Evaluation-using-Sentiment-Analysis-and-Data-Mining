{"text": "It is hard to distinguish a significant difference between this watch and the Casio - MQ247B2 which is fifty cents cheaper, but apparently this one might have a better crystal and band. In any case I replace the band with woven cloth as soon as possible because of irrtitation from sweat.This is definitely the watch to get, once you replace the band. It is clearly visible under nearly any situation and surely beats a digital.Find out how much shipping will cost. It coudl raise the price fifty per cent. Find out whether they will ship to your address. If it is overseas or a POB (or even AP) they may not. But this is the watch to go for rather than any other. If you need a calendar as well, put one on your wall or buy a newspaper. When you need to know the time, you can count on this watch to clearly provide the information you seek.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.061936583", "1": "0.06525636", "2": "0.22039641", "3": "0.10743302", "4": "0.22935742", "5": "0.16447616", "6": "0.15114407"}}
