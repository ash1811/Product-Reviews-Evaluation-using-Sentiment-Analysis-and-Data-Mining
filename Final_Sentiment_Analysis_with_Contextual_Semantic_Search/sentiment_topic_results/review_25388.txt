{"text": "I was looking for a diaper bag that could double as a purse without me feeling silly carrying it. This bag is perfect. There are enough pockets for bottles, pacifiers, keys, wallet, cell phone etc. and plenty of space inside for several diapers, a changing pad, change of clothes, blanket, burp cloth and meds/thermometer. It's super easy to clean (wipe with wet wipe) and very durable. Plus it's comfortable to carry. I will be ordering different colors (I bought the pink one.) I highly recommend this bag.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03293698", "1": "0.39219165", "2": "0.14166442", "4": "0.077622674", "5": "0.100266054", "6": "0.25275978"}}
