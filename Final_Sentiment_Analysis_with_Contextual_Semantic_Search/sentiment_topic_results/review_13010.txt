{"text": "I served slightly over ten years in the United States Army before I was medically retired out. The first few years of my career, we still wore woodland battle dress uniforms as well as black boots. I believe I spent a good two hours a day doing nothing but polishing black boots for five years straight. During that time I discovered that one of the best polishes for boots is Lincoln Wax.I have taken the knowledge and experience gained from my military life and have applied it to my new civilian career by utilizing Lincoln Wax on my business dress shoes. Lincoln Wax carries a premium over competitors such as Kiwi but the end results that you experience justify the money spent. It does a great job of hiding scuff marks on the leather of your shoes as well as to provide a high gloss finish. The wax also does an outstanding job of softening the leather and preserving it to make sure your shoes last as long as possible.Lincoln Wax is recommended for anyone that is serious about taking care of their shoes and desire the best and proper way to do it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.116449736", "1": "0.10459665", "2": "0.23332858", "3": "0.13516639", "4": "0.15750998", "5": "0.20308417", "6": "0.0498645"}}
