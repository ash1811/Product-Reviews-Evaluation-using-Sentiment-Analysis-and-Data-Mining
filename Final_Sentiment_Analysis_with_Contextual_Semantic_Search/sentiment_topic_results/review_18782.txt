{"text": "I was looking for a pirate costume to match with my girlfriend. This one was perfect. It fit great, I got a M which is where I should be. The material is pretty good for a halloween costume. The pants are short, but they supposed to be since you get the boot covers. I like the arm bracers, it's a nice touch. It doesn't come with a sword or eye patch but even without those it still looks like a pirate costume. Overall, very happy with my purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.3245577", "1": "0.4779294", "2": "0.048738036", "4": "0.07437085", "6": "0.067740016"}}
