{"text": "I love the Sterling Silver 7.5\" Byzantine Bracelet. I've been looking for one for a while and the price on this one was just perfect. It is certainly shiny and attractive, but not bulky. Very light and well made. And the packaging was wonderful, it made me feel like I was getting an expensive present.
