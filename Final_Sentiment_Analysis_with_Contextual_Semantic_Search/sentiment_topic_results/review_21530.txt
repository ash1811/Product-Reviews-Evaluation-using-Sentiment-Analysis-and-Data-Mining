{"text": "Well I'm conflicted. This is a really nice shirt, I love the picture on it... my main problem I think is with the company that I ordered it from. I chose the red option for this shirt and I believe  Penny Lane Gifts sent me a purple on. The color is nothing like the rust red that is pictured... not a huge deal but definitely not what I wanted or ordered. It is for my son and other than that the fit seems good and the shirt itself is pretty awesome", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12986141", "1": "0.516594", "3": "0.27004153", "5": "0.07392225"}}
