{"text": "Sadly, these were returned the day they arrived.  I wear a 12EEE (new balance), and I ordered these in 12EE (no EEE available choices), but sadly could not even get my foot into the slipper!  So this is a caution for those with wide feet.  I do not believe this slipper is a true \"EE\" - on the box it was labeled as 'wide'.The slippers do look nice, but with no chance to wear them, I cannot comment on comfort or how long they will last.  It's back to my LB Evans Klondike that fits.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11082639", "1": "0.2586874", "2": "0.03188213", "3": "0.16991754", "4": "0.073451035", "5": "0.22966935", "6": "0.12556614"}}
