{"text": "This is a very nice looking watch.  It looks like the quality timepiece that it is.  It's got the heft to prove that it's built from solid, surgical-grade stainless steel.  It's a cinch to operate, you just set the time once and it's self winding (no battery, but powered by wrist movements) - but you have to wear it, since if you let it sit for a few days it slows down.  (Note that it comes big, so unless you've got enormous forearms, you'll need to take it to a jeweler to fit it, or adjust it yourself like I did after looking up how to do it online; even though I have large wrists I had to remove two of the links before I could adjust this to fit just right.)The crown locks down, which helps ensure the water resistance.  You just unscrew it and pull it out to set the time and date.  It's bare bones as far as features go, but that adds to the elegant simplicity.  There's no alarm clock, no calculator, no digital timer, no multiple time zones.  It just tells the time and the date, and the rotating bezel allows you use it as a timer (just rotate it to line up with the minute hand and wait until it reaches a deadline up to sixty minutes).I have to say, I'm not a Pro Diver.  I don't ever expect to wear this underwater to 300 meters.  I use it to tell time - and I don't always wear it since it is a bit heavy.  You do feel its weight when you wear it, which is kind of cool, but could be a bit of a distraction for everyday use.  I think of it more like a useful ornament that I'll wear when I dress up.  For most days, I've got a much less expensive plastic digital watch with some of the frills they decided - probably wisely - that for the purposes of this watch were just not necessary.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07287526", "1": "0.1906482", "2": "0.19911702", "3": "0.15022045", "4": "0.09544017", "5": "0.13228296", "6": "0.15941595"}}
