{"text": "These have to be the most comfy shoes I have ever put on in my life. Immediately after putting them on I realized I am keeping them. In terms of size, I am at odds with companies. I am inclined to say order your regular size. By official measurement I should be wearing a 10, I have worn 11 for the past 5 years, but for all expensive shoes I generally fit a 9. Recently some of the nice shoes were slightly too big at 9 so for this order I took 8.5. They seem to be perfectly if not slightly too tight at the toe box. But otherwise they are absolutely fantastic.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.0741471", "1": "0.28828385", "2": "0.13647361", "3": "0.07430835", "4": "0.103860974", "5": "0.10498457", "6": "0.2179416"}}
