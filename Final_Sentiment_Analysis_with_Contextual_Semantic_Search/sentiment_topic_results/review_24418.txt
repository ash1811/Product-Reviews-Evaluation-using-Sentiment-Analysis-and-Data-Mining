{"text": "Company's products of same color totally do not match. Hat Canyon Brown is much lighter shade than is Carhartt Men's Series 1889 Knit Scarf Color Canyon Brown sold by BareBones WorkWear which is more a dark olive brown. Hat is a much smoother texture material than is the scarf. On their own each looks fine but totally do not match in texture or color. Just got these so don't know how well they wear over time.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06354908", "1": "0.29284203", "3": "0.19857302", "4": "0.1357833", "5": "0.23734477", "6": "0.06862349"}}
