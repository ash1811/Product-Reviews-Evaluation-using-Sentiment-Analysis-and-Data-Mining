{"text": "Being of an age to have seen leggings regarded as high fashion for the 2nd time around now (the first time was in the early 90s), these are truly some of the BEST I've ever owned.  I got 2 pair and am so glad I did!  This wardrobe staple is true to size and fits PERFECTLY all the way from just below the navel down to the top of the foot.  They're very stretchy with a higher lycra % than most cotton spandex leggings you'll find, and they're well made of a quality material that is thick enough to give terrific coverage yet light enough to stay put and remain extremely cool in all weather.  But as always, leggings are NOT trousers, so pairing them with a long tunic or a dress is recommended.  And eventhough they are not at all see-through, \"phantoming through\" will happen when you bend over at the gym, so you'll probably want to choose undergarments that provide the desired amount of coverage and are of a solid flesh-tone.  :)  They launder nicely on the gentle cycle and with tumble drying on low or cool.  It was an OUTSTANDING shopping experience with this seller, too!!!
