{"text": "These undergarments are one of the best products I've found.  I have been wearing them for over ten years, they wash up well and are well constructed.  A piece of clothing that is washed every week and maintains its quality is a rare thing in today's market.  The average life of the garment is two years which is really terrific considering that they are in the laundry every week.  The elastic around the leg does begin to fray toward the end of the life of the garment. but I've never experienced any problems with the waist band.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.30728483", "2": "0.14945656", "3": "0.24883518", "4": "0.088561535", "5": "0.12171053", "6": "0.081340864"}}
