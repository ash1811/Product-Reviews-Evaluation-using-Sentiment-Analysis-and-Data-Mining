{"text": "This robe fits nicely and has a button for the belt so you don't lose it, especially when doing laundry. My issues with the product are (1) the color is not ivory, but more YELLOW, and (2) it is too pricey for the quality. Buy a robe from China for $10, wait 2 weeks but get twice the quality. Seriously though, I prefer to buy from Prime but this is not one of those cases.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19436668", "1": "0.3083799", "2": "0.10280581", "3": "0.037617102", "4": "0.095326826", "5": "0.13002144", "6": "0.13148229"}}
