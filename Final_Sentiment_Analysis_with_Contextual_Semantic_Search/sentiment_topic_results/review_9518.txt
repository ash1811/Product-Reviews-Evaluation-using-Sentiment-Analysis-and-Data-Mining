{"text": "I have all kinds of watches, but I love this timex. It is an indiglo so it lights up in dark spots- in one/tenth of a second you can find out the time in a dark movie theater or restaurant.  Lots of people could care less what time it is, but some movies drag on interminably and you are wondering just when you will be set free.
