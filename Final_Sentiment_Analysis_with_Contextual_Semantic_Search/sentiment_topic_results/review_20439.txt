{"text": "I have very hard feet to fit.  My right is size 11.5, my left is 10.5 so I ordered 12's.  The ankle strap doesn't adjust much tighter (there's about 3/4 inch adjustment in the ankle strap b/c of the thick velcro so adjusting tighter is difficult.)  However, because the front two straps are so adjustable, I'm able to make the sandals fit even though they're a little big.  I've just worn them around the house but I'm loving the comfort so far.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.078532524", "1": "0.14422281", "2": "0.1596691", "3": "0.25662917", "4": "0.1679365", "6": "0.1902037"}}
