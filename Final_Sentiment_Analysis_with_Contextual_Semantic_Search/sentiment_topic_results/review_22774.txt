{"text": "This toe ring is made very well. It is adjustable which sometimes in toe rings make the jewelry seem flimsy. Not this one, its a little hard to open and close which is a great thing because it still holds its round shape while being able to BeBe comfortably fitted to your toe. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great toe ring at a great price!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.044787988", "1": "0.48933357", "2": "0.109541915", "3": "0.216798", "5": "0.09912823", "6": "0.036741793"}}
