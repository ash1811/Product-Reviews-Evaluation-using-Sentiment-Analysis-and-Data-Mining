{"text": "I am a 34D and this bra fits perfectly. The straps don't cut into my shoulders after wearing it for a while. Also bought the taupe, it's perfect for wearing white T-shirts or clothes where you might be able to see through the material if the bra is too dark/bright. The taupe color blends in well with my skin.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.5119974", "2": "0.10812334", "3": "0.14246947", "4": "0.1720129", "5": "0.05553336"}}
