{"text": "To start with they arrived on time.  This is my second pair of Minnetonkas since I was a teenager.  My other pair has a sole on it so you can go out in the rain.  As per reviews I bought those (Zappos) a half size small.  They were a bit tight and I am slowly breaking them in.  These don't have the sole and were perfect out of the box. (I am normally a size 8 and purchased a size 7.5) I got both pairs to use as warm weather slippers but I really love them and plan to purchase another pair in a different color.  Even without the sole these will be great around the house or around town for errands and whatnot when its dry out. They are fun, cute and I recommend them as a light casual shoe. ( I would not expect to get more than a couple years out of them if taken care of)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.022806106", "1": "0.40082175", "3": "0.23504592", "4": "0.07451398", "5": "0.1367036", "6": "0.12757808"}}
