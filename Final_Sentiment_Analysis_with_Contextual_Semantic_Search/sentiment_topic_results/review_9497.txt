{"text": "I find the dark numbers on this watch easier to read than my other watches.  Another problem it solves is that I have a tiny wrist and have to trim leather bands.  Then they flop around and catch on things.  I have link watches which I had adjusted and now cut off my circulation.  I wear this as it came.
