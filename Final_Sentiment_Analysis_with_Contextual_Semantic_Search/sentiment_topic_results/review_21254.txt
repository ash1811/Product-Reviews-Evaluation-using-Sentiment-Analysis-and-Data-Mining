{"text": "I've worn this shoe 3 days so far. The 9 was a little floppy in the back but I kept them anyway. They fit better with a pair of sweat socks. So far my feet arches do not hurt after working a 12 hour shift. I have plantar fasciitis which is very painful. Other sneakers lack the support I need after wearing them a few days. The next time I will order a 8.5 size. So far, they have been comfortable and my feet have been pain free.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14370053", "1": "0.18358028", "2": "0.076449715", "3": "0.16788597", "4": "0.16840598", "6": "0.25678295"}}
