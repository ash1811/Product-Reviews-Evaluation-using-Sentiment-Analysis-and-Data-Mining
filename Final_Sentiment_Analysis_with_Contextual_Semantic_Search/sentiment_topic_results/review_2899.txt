{"text": "These athletic pants run 1 size large.  I'm 6'0 and am between 34-36x32 in regular pant size.  I've ordered the Large size and while they functioned well, they were very baggy in the thigh area, with a very odd, low hanging inseam.  The elastic waist band kept them on snugly, but still too baggy for my liking.I ordered Medium size and now they fit perfectly, but they are a touch short for my height.Extremely comfortable and well priced, but the fitment disparities are a bit extreme.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13431811", "1": "0.35697946", "3": "0.2299899", "4": "0.07172787", "5": "0.032248087", "6": "0.1718137"}}
