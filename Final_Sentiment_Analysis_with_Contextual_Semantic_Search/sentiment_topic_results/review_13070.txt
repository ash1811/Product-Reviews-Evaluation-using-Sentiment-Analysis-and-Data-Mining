After opening it, he put it over his shoulder immediatly and did not take it off.  He ended up wearing it home several hours later.  I think he would have liked the bag without the contents. This one was certainly a hit.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.3267208", "1": "0.2284797", "2": "0.08777238", "3": "0.07496019", "4": "0.13253179", "5": "0.047465272", "6": "0.10206989"}}
