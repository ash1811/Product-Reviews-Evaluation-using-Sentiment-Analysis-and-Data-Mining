{"text": "this is exactly what it looks like.  A calculator that also tells the time.  My husband was ecstatic to get this.  It was his favorite thing to get for christmas.

Similar to the one in Breaking Bad so i guess it's good for a big BrBa fan. :D", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16931249", "1": "0.26753092", "2": "0.32643476", "3": "0.0671759", "4": "0.16134417"}}
