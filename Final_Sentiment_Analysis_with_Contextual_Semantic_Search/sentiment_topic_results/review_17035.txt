{"text": "I love the look and the color of the shoes but I could not wear them as they were too small and too tight.  I was about to send them back when my daughter came in.  She asked if she could try them on.  She wears a size 8M and these fit her.  So, I'm out a pair of Keens.  I really like Keens and have 3 pairs, but a different style, but have found them to run small which is why I ordered 8.5M to start with.  I've come to the conclusion I need to try on the shoes in person before buying.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1376587", "1": "0.27704933", "2": "0.06460102", "3": "0.30391765", "5": "0.052754495", "6": "0.16109434"}}
