{"text": "Every few years I need to buy another pair of these. They fall apart in the same place. Eventually the strap breaks apart from the sole on both feet. It is more sad than anything else because you get attached to these, they are my favorite slippers/sandals. I wear them for quick trips to the store, walking the dog, outdoor projects, washing the car, get the mail. These are my go to shoes when i need to talk outside really quick and dont want to fart around with laces.Its that time again, I need a new pair! I wouldn't buy anything else. You will not be disappointed with the comfort, why do you think they are always sold out? They rock.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.13112424", "2": "0.21161501", "3": "0.18818896", "4": "0.13239935", "5": "0.20845984", "6": "0.12593792"}}
