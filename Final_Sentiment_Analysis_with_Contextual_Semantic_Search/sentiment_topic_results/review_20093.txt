{"text": "I bought my son a different back pack for 3rd grade. We thought the character ones would cut it. But, being in 3rd grade, books are getting bigger and his folders are too. TRAPPER KEEP REQUIRED THIS YEAR. So, it all wouldn't fit. I have high sierra products, so I did a search on amazon. We LOVE all the different places to stow things. Very nice back pack. I also love how well it fits him And with all the safety features, he doesn't suffer any back or shoulder pain carrying it around. I highly recommend High sierra products. and really nice price on amazon", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14943431", "1": "0.4152982", "2": "0.07515972", "3": "0.042520527", "4": "0.20882894", "5": "0.07761726", "6": "0.031141033"}}
