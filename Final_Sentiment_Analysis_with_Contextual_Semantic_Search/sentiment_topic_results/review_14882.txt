{"text": "This is a good pack.  Seems sturdy and is clearly larger than your average Jansport, yet smaller than a full-on camping pack.  Great in-between size.  I use it for gym clothes and other gear.Only drawback is the waist strap is utterly pointless.  It's way too high and provides no support whatsoever.  A case of lazy design.  Otherwise, it would have been 5 stars.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13538802", "1": "0.20845798", "2": "0.22244175", "3": "0.22857754", "4": "0.08471438", "6": "0.11665179"}}
