{"text": "They are a little heavier than my 20 month olds shoes so it took about 10 minutes of him walking in them with me having to hold his hand to get used to them. After that he was off and running. I bought these because my son loves to jump in the rain puddles. These boots are great! They kept all the water out. His feet and legs were completely dry after wearing these to jump in rain puddles. They are very sturdy, very well made. We got the red color, they are so cute! I highly recommend for other little puddle jumpers!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.26412743", "2": "0.14968443", "3": "0.20484535", "4": "0.20135723", "5": "0.15451317", "6": "0.022487434"}}
