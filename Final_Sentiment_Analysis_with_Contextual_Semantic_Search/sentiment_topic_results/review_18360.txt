{"text": "I've been buying Arcopedico for about four years now. I stumbled on this style in a specialty shoe catalog which caters to people with orthopedic problems. I ordered a pair in tan and it was instant love. Because they are knit, they provide plenty of ventilation and tons of wiggle room. While they are dandy for home use, they are even better for quick trips out or long vacations.I took a pair of these to Williamsburg a couple of weeks ago. Lots of walking and standing there so these shoes were heaven sent. I was amazed at how decent my feet felt despite a little swelling after 9 hours of walking. When these get dirty, toss them in the washing machine on a cold cycle and then air dry. After cleaning even multiple times they still look new and have not faded. The rubber soles wear evenly. I wear a womens size 9 and wear these in the European equivalent size 40. They seem very true to size.I currently own these in beige, black, and navy blue. When I think about foot comfort I know I can't put a price on that.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13048552", "1": "0.11170585", "2": "0.16658606", "3": "0.24040551", "4": "0.050499476", "5": "0.10143398", "6": "0.19888358"}}
