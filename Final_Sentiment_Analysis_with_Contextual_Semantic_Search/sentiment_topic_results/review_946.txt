{"text": "Let me just say that people who said order a size down were not kidding. I usually wear 9.5 (I know, not big feet), but for these shoes I ordered 8.5 and it fits me great.The shoes look great, feel good, and can be worn with pretty much ant pants. I'm thinking of ordering different colors of these same shoes.They were not meant to be worn on cold weather. They are perfect for little hotter weather as they keep your feet nice, cool, and comfortable.The heal was not as comfortable as I thought. I have smaller feet so I wouldn't blame the shoes for this. It kind of scrapes my heel after few hours of walking around. It rubs my heel on the inside and it is kind of painful to walk. I think I might find some heel cups to solve this problem.They look stylish though. I got few compliments so far from both males and females.UPDATE: I still give it four star rating. I got some heel cups to make these shoes more comfortable. They seemed to be working.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.058374975", "1": "0.3614726", "2": "0.10073726", "3": "0.07410363", "4": "0.12899263", "5": "0.11932555", "6": "0.15699334"}}
