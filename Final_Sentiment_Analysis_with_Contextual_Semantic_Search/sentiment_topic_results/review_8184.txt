{"text": "This is my 4th or 5th healthy back bag. I have a closet full of pocketbooks, but this is the one I use. The picture shows the old style bag. The new edition has broken the exterior flap pocket into 2 separate pockets. This is handy, because I can now use the smaller of these pockets for my cellphone, while the exterior spline pocket holds my sunglasses. A huge improvement! The large exterior pocket, as well as the flap pockets, are now closed with magnets. This is very handy. I was concerned that the magnet would de-magnetize the credit cards in my wallet, as well as the flash drive that I always carry with me. I measured the magnetic field with a little contraption that I have. As long as the wallet and flash drive are kept on the side of the bag with the zipper pocket, I think they'll be OK. The 2-pocket side had a stronger magnetic field on the inside, so I wouldn't put sensitive items on that side. There is a new interior zippered pocket for tablets, which is padded, so I won't be throwing this new one in the wash every couple of years. (Which they never wanted me to do anyway.) My only problem is that I carry a handgun, which I used to keep in the outer flap pocket and now it doesn't fit. All in all, at least 5 stars!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12923516", "1": "0.30659768", "2": "0.1789516", "3": "0.16089794", "4": "0.07189287", "5": "0.08868434", "6": "0.06374038"}}
