{"text": "It's a great watch for the price.  I think I paid $130 for it.  Sure, the swiss 25 jewel movement version is nicer, but I thought I'd try the lower-end 21 jewel.  It runs great, keeps good time, and is probably one of the best watches you can get for the money.  High quality work, very close in look/feel/weight to a R*lex.  We'll have to see how the gold plating wears over time, but other than that, it's a great watch.EDIT:  Had to change my review, the movement has been giving me problems, first I couldn't quick-set the date, now the hands jump when trying to set the time, and the second hand stops on me even when it's running.The case, the band, everything else is top notch for a $150 watch, but the cheap automatic movement really ruins it.  In my opinion, get the one with the 25jewel swiss movement, and pay the extra $100.  I have to send mine back for a warranty repair, and wish I would have bought the other one first.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08481691", "1": "0.31249017", "2": "0.13226293", "3": "0.077258006", "4": "0.14338225", "5": "0.14981969", "6": "0.09997006"}}
