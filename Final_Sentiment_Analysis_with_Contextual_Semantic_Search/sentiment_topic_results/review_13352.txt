{"text": "I love these shoes. I was skeptical when I tried these sandals on at REI b/c for some reason they just didn't seem to feel comfortable. Now I am convinced that the reason why was b/c REI pumped up their building with so much air conditioning that the shoes felt stiff and just uncomfortable. Trying them on from the box after Amazon shipped was great! All it really took to make them as comfortable as possible was adjusting the straps - you don't want them to tight or too loose. Somewhere in between - play around with them. Great shoes - I wear them everywhere. I also have a bit of a foot issue on my left foot - kind of a snapping sensation with one of my toes but only in certain shoes that don't ride right for my foot. I must say that these Chaco's offer the greatest comfort-ability and support of any shoe/sandal I have ever owned. They are expensive but certainly worth every penny. Excuse my rambling but I love these sandals!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.031630646", "1": "0.21777022", "2": "0.19692312", "3": "0.15209876", "4": "0.19930182", "5": "0.09805318", "6": "0.10422223"}}
