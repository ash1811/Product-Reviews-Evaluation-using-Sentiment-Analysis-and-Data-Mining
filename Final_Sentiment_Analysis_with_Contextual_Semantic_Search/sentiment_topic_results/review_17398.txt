{"text": "People wonder why I choose wool when hiking in the heat of the Summer.  Wool keeps your feet DRY.  Dry feet are happy feet. These also offer exceptional cushioning.  Cotton socks will get wet as you sweat and stay wet.  That will cause blisters and painful, achy feet.  End of hike.  Wool wicks the sweat away from your skin and evaporates leaving you feel much more comfortable.  The Wigwam brand of socks are the ones I use year round.  These low cut in the Summer and Fall with shorts and the full length in the Winter and Spring for increased warmth.Highly recommended.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15437463", "1": "0.17358866", "2": "0.097347386", "3": "0.2254215", "4": "0.21010105", "5": "0.098982334", "6": "0.04018445"}}
