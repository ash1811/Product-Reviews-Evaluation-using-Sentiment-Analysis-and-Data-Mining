{"text": "I got these a week ago and I like them so much that I just ordered a second pair in a brown shade!  They were a bit tight when I first got them, but they became comfortable in no time.  It's nice to wear cushiony, supportive flip flops.  I sought these out because I have pretty severe Achilles tendinitis and flip flop season exacerbates the problem.  These aren't a cure, but they do allow me to still wear my beloved flip flops and have arch and heel support.  They seem to be well made and I'm hopeful that they'll hold up for several summer seasons.  This is money well spent!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.055107687", "1": "0.34256262", "2": "0.16642231", "3": "0.24758984", "4": "0.02431702", "5": "0.077822745", "6": "0.086177796"}}
