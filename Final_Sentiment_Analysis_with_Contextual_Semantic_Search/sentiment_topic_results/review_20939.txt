{"text": "After reading all the reviews on here, I was expecting some fancy shoes.  However, these are pretty cheap by any standard.  They fit just a shade small, are pretty thin, and my shoe laces that came with the shoes weren't the same size.  I'm not really sure how the same size of shoe ended up with two different lace length.  I'd shop at walmart before buying these again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10422172", "1": "0.29098925", "2": "0.28068814", "4": "0.1476674", "6": "0.16846806"}}
