{"text": "I bought this for our 10 year old who is pretty tall and slim for his age. (Size 12-14 costume) It is still a bit short in the legs. This is a common problem, so I won't judge too harshly there. One thing that is strange is the muscles on the upper body, though. They are not stuffed with cotton, but are actually stiff because there is a firm foam lining that part. They won't hold their proper shape because they came out of the package \"smushed\" and it held that same shape. My son isn't heartbroken over it, so it could be worse, but it does look really odd. One thing I did not like is that there were two layers of packing tape along the opening of the package that looked randomly placed, very much like someone had opened it then lazily resealed it with a couple lengths of tape. (The way it was folded on the packaging supported this. The garment wasn't faced out , but rather simply stuffed inside.) It was in no way factory-sealed. Overall, it looks like it will last for the day (unless he gets rough at recess) and that's really the point anyhow. This is absolutely a case of the price being right for a one-time-use product!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.27556312", "1": "0.18831183", "2": "0.18151031", "3": "0.18188915", "4": "0.10701286", "5": "0.063089795"}}
