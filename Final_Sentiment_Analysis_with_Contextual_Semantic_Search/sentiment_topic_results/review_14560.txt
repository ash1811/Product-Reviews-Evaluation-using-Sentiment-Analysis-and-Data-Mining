{"text": "I cycle 15mi round trip to and from work. I'm using these as cycling glasses.Inexpensive, well made, good tint and polarization. I like them a lot. They do not look like $200 glasses, that's okay. Glasses are failry large. I'm 6'3\" and they fit well.The frame is fairly beefy and sits against the eyebrows. The lens sits in front of the frame and is vented. This prevents fogging and prevents sweat and such getting on the lens as easily. It does not provide as good wind protection as closer-fitting glasses, but I have not found it objecitonable. It is the best overall balance I have found betwene protection and ventilation.Minor complaint is the frame is bulky enough it slightly obscures the top line of vision. This is not objectionable in normal use, but when crouched in riding position, looking through the top of the glasses, is a bit more noticeable.Great buy, highly recommended. I will get a set in Clear for night riding as well.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13372676", "1": "0.18635593", "2": "0.0916717", "3": "0.25913358", "4": "0.18430623", "5": "0.117223024", "6": "0.02758282"}}
