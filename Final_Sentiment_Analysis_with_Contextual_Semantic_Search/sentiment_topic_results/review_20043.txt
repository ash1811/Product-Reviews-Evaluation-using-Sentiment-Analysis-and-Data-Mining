{"text": "I've had my bag for about two years and one of the shoulder straps started to come apart at the seams. I went to High Sierra's website and filled out an RMA request. They got back to me within a day and had me destroy the bag and email them a few pictures of the destroyed bag and the tag (which I kept specifically for the warranty). They sent out a new bag via FedEx and it arrived later in the week. The whole process from reporting the problem to receipt of new bag took 5 days.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15807126", "1": "0.14704078", "2": "0.06401692", "3": "0.3601694", "4": "0.10141142", "5": "0.16653465"}}
