{"text": "i purchased the first pair in the gold.  i found i could walk forever in these shoes.  at 70 yrs. that is saying a lot.  so then i just bought this pair in black.  great price too.  my friends are buying them online as well.  the only problem is getting all the colors in your size but everyone is patient.  i think the next might be brown or beige or white.  i am going to take them with me when going on a trip. they are easy to remove at the airport going to security which is a problem with some shoes at my age.  love them.  i shouldn't write this because everyone will buy the shoes.  that's okay.  enjoy them as much as i do.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12813066", "1": "0.26047626", "2": "0.16486457", "3": "0.095217034", "4": "0.11769982", "5": "0.096120864", "6": "0.13749081"}}
