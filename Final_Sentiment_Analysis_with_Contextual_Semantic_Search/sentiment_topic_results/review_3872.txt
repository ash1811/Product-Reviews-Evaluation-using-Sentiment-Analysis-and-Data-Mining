{"text": "I am amazed at how comfortable the Spanx was.  I made one error though.  I attempted to put the Spanx on as soon as I got out the shower; I should have waited until I was totally dry. Once I got the Spanx on, Hallalulah!!! I have not looked that good since I was 30 pounds thinner.  I EVEN HAD A WAIST LINE (AS TOLD TO ME BY MY DEAR HUSBAND). I looked marvelous. I looked 3 sizes smaller and that made me feel REAL GOOD. I am a size 14 but I looked like a size l0-1/2 (smile)! Keep up the good work Spanx.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1626062", "1": "0.15313932", "2": "0.039970525", "4": "0.29213825", "6": "0.34702352"}}
