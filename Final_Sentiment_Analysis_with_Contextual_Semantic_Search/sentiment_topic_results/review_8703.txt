{"text": "Setting the time is very dificult.  You have to hold the button down on the top left, and it is dificult to hold down.  Plus, the arms only move clockwise, so it can and most likely take several minutes to set the time.  The instructions even warn you about this.  Absolutley crazy and semi painful to hold the button down.  Everybody who has this watch will say this.Also, looking at and reading the watch takes a bit to get used to.  The minute hand is long as seen in the picture.  Sometimes it makes you have to look at it twice to see what time it is.  Also, the when it is 6:30 or so, you can't see the digital display.Good watch, but somewhat interesting with the strange design flaws.  I would not buy this watch again.  Can not recommend it.  However, it is a G shock and will probably last for four years.  So i am stuck with it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08812375", "1": "0.15701811", "2": "0.09769747", "3": "0.19570516", "4": "0.19252284", "5": "0.0640141", "6": "0.20491856"}}
