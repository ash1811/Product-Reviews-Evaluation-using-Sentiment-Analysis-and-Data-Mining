{"text": "Just received the watch recently and it's just gorgeous. Really very beautiful. I do wish it had a second hand but I knew it didn't when I bought it. Another reviewer mentioned that the closed clasp when you wear it doesn't form a circle around your wrist. It's true, it's kind of square-ish where the clasp is and at first it bothered me but it doesn't anymore. I can't see it unless I turn my wrist over and it doesn't feel weird or anything. Just a minor thing anyway. The watch is not too small, not too big and is thin and sleek. I get compliments on it. I love it!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1442669", "1": "0.1580386", "2": "0.23546404", "3": "0.0824351", "4": "0.21448283", "5": "0.11232464", "6": "0.052987855"}}
