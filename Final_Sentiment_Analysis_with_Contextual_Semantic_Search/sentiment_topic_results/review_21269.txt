{"text": "Read all the reviews here and went up a half size to a 9 and next time might try the 8.5 as they are just a little too big. Have walked about 20 miles in them in a week and no complaints at all, other than if you walk where some gravel/rocks are you might get some grit under your feet. These shoes are very comfortable on and my feet do not hurt after a long walk(5 miles or so) in them. Will be ordering at least one more pair.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04959734", "1": "0.24170299", "2": "0.25442332", "3": "0.25023055", "4": "0.080512814", "5": "0.045350283", "6": "0.078182675"}}
