{"text": "I just got this watch and its a fun to wear nerd watch for not a lot of money. If you like nerd watch, you can't go wrong with this one.- The watch is light weight and the strap is comfortable to wear.- In time keeping mode, you need to press the \"divide\" button to see the date. I kinda wished that the date is shown as default.- The chronograph will *beep* every 10 min. It will count up to 24hr but you need to press the \"divide\" button to check the elasped hours.- I don't think I will be using the calculator function heavily. It works, but its not a scientify calculator.- Not a lot of calculator or databank Casio watch with keyboard is water resistant, but this one is. Its nice to know that you don't have to worry about the watch when you are washing your hands.- No back light! I kinda wished that it has one.- Not all settings are easy to find. e.g. To set the time from AM/PM to 24hr, in time setting mode, you need to hit the \"+\" button; to set the button beep on and off, in calculator mode, you need to hit the \"ADJ\" button.- Drilled lug hole is a nice touch. I like it cause its easier to change strap with that.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.26041138", "2": "0.2375246", "4": "0.15696794", "5": "0.049577728", "6": "0.290803"}}
