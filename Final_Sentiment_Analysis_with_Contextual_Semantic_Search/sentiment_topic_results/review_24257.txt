{"text": "Duofold makes excellent thermal midweight crew t-shirt styled underwear for those cold, cold days and nights. The 96% polyester, 4% lycra fabric is soft and extremely well made. This may be single layered fabric; but man, how it works to keep you warm!Truthfully, this underwear thermal t-shirt lasts years with proper care. It can be worn as underwear under your outdoor clothes or you can wear it in bed with your pajamas on over it. Whatever way you choose you can't go wrong with Duofold thermal underwear.At first the shirt may appear flimsy and floppy before you put it on--but after you're wearing it you'll notice a huge difference. You'll be a lot warmer with it! It also does not bunch or wrinkle easily.As for maintenance, I just put mine in the clothes washer and dryer and everything always comes out fine. If you have any concerns about the color of this undergarment \"bleeding\" onto white colored clothing, just wash this with garments that are not white. You'll be fine. In addition, it shrinks very little. They say it's odor resistant; but don't think you can skip any deodorant--it isn't a substitute for that!Be sure to check the pricing and availability chart and the merchant sizing chart if you want to order this here.Overall, Duofold makes one awesome midweight crewneck thermal long sleeved undershirt. I have worn this many times now and I highly recommend this product.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17009604", "1": "0.106602505", "2": "0.059872184", "3": "0.28407276", "4": "0.14999086", "5": "0.048218727", "6": "0.18114688"}}
