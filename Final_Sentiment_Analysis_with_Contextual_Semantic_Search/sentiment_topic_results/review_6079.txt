{"text": "These are very well made, comfortable right out of the box, and beautiful! Picked up my fave color, red, and I'm really impressed. It's a very deep tomato shade, very saturated, very matte. I followed other reviewers' advice and ordered my exact size, which is 8.5. In heels or cheaper shoes,  I always order 9 for 'give', even though in flats I'm exact 8.5. I ordered 8.5. These fit awesomely like size 8.5 shoes that know your foot well. Also, the seam  directly behind your toes on the footbed, may or may not rub your feet. It would depend on sensitivity. I'd just gotten a fresh pedi and it started rubbing after about 2hrs of wear standing/walking. (going to invest in some affordable 'petals'). That's the main reason they're not 5 stars. More pros than cons- All in all, Pick these up! Gorgeous and flattering, perfect height, and comfort as well.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.061106145", "1": "0.2872914", "2": "0.09472175", "3": "0.07134136", "4": "0.2190723", "5": "0.1693295", "6": "0.09713756"}}
