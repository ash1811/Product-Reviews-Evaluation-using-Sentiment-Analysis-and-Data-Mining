{"text": "Okay, my skx009 review is pretty lengthy, therefore, I'll keep this one short. I discovered the joy of automatic watches, and Seiko is touted as a pretty good buy on an entire slew of watch forums, so I lept. Therefore, I also jumped when I fell in love with the 009 (pepsi dial). I wanted a different look to the 007, so I purchased the super oyster bracelet (also on Amazon from Strap Code). I chose the \"super\" because they are solid links, and have a hefty feel. I've posted a pic (image is a horrible attempt to replicate the Rolex Submariner image that can be found on the Rolex site) and this watch is now a true beaut with the oyster bracelet change! I have decided to purchase the super jubilee bracelet (on Amazon) to add more weight to the 009. A great watch that will likely outlive any other watch I own. Get it, you wont be let down.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15876429", "1": "0.15383913", "2": "0.27746662", "3": "0.065431274", "4": "0.20116249", "5": "0.09958272", "6": "0.04375348"}}
