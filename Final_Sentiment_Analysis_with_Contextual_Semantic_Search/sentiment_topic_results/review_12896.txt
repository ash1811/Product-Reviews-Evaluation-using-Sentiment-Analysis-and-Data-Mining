{"text": "I chose this item as I like purple and the style is fine.  However, a friend of mine had a pair of Bear Paw boots, same color same style, actually same everything except for the price, which was $200 cheaper.  I ordered the Bear paw boots and they are fantastic.  Fact, they are true to my size, which is between 6  - 6 1/2.  With UGGs, I have to buy a size larger.  Also, Bear paw has sales on their boots, which you very rarely find with UGGS.My suggestion for your next pair of boots is &#34;Give Bear Paws a TRY&#34;", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1579799", "1": "0.18148594", "2": "0.17537956", "3": "0.06270106", "4": "0.245361", "5": "0.06492352", "6": "0.11216901"}}
