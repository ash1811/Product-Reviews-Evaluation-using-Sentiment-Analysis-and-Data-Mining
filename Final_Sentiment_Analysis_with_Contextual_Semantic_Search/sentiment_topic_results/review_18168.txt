{"text": "First off, I am not someone who buys watches just to beat the devil out of them.  I don't wear them in the bath or shower, and I have no intention of wearing them underwater.  I treat them with reasonable care and expect them to last a very long time.  I don't like to spend a fortune on a watch for just a fancy name.  Up to now I have been mostly wearing Seiko kinetic auto-relay watches, but I am sick to death of spending several hundred dollars on a watch that requires no battery but craps out after 3-4 years requring a $150 repair.  What I want is a watch that is reliable, relatively inexpensive, stylish enough to wear at work or when dressed up yet not so prissy that I can't wear it casually.  This Casio watch definitely fits the bill.The photo of this watch really does not do it justice.  It is a very attractive watch and has a good size to it without feeling bulky or excessively large on the wrist.  The gold face is a really nice touch, and the illuminated hands are very easy to see in any light.  The hands illuminate in the dark far better than any watch I've ever owned.  I like a watch with analog hands, and the second hand on this one is very precise.  The digital portion of the watch can display a separate digital time, an alarm time, or the day & date.  In my case, I prefer to use it to display the day & date.  It is very easy to set to the precise second if desired.The band on this watch is rubber, which seems appropriate since this watch is advertised to be a dive watch (it is reported to be water resistant to 100 meters).  A leather band would have been nicer for a dressier look, but there is only so much one can expect for $56.  The band is replaceable, so it is really not a big deal.My only criticism, which is very minor, is the relatively loose bezel around the face.  I've never understood why a moveable bezel is needed to display north, south, west, east and 10-minute divisions, but if one is going to be used it would be nice if it stayed in place when adjusted.  This one moves too easily.  Again, the criticism is minor, and I never utilize this function anyway.If you are looking for a stylish, accurate watch with chronograph features and a reasonably low cost, the Casio AMW320D-9EV Ana-Digi Alarm Chronograph Dive watch is a great choice.  If you are looking for a watch to abuse, Casio makes G-Shock watches for that purpose.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12839527", "1": "0.1488862", "2": "0.17550026", "3": "0.11078888", "4": "0.13703792", "5": "0.14791113", "6": "0.15148033"}}
