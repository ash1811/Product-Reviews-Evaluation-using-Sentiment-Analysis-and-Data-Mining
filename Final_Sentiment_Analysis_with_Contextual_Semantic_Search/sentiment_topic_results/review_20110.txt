{"text": "Love the bag. Fast shipping with Amazon prime. This bag is built to last. My 8 year old daughter is rough on her things...book bags especially. This has held up well and hides the dirt of her throwing it on the ground all the time. There is plenty of room for all her books (seems like she brings home half her desk) and her lunch bag. I am very pleased with the purchase....did I mention: hides the dirt!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16236079", "1": "0.4507563", "2": "0.2548287", "4": "0.06823477", "5": "0.056826178"}}
