{"text": "This feels like hemp or jute type webbing ,it might be cotton but boy it is stiff.It most definitely is not synthetic, at least not the khaki I received. Sizing is good, I'm a 36\"-37\" and a 44\" leaves 7\"-8\" past buckle. The buckle is a little hard to loosen the first couple times but getting easier.I can not see the buckle getting loose or coming off under any normal circumstance.Don't think you will find a better belt at this price point. Really don't see how a more expensive belt could be any better.Will be ordering more in different colors.The color I have is khaki w/ black buckle.OOps, downgrading from 5 to 1 star. Been wearing this belt for a little over a month,not daily.It has now become smooth where the catch grabs the webbing and will not stay snug.When sitting or bending  the belt now slips and becomes loose.Constantly adjusting to fit.I doubt it will be usable much longer. Will not be buying more.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.23435234", "1": "0.16865154", "2": "0.13416082", "3": "0.1359848", "4": "0.11418641", "5": "0.085204035", "6": "0.1274601"}}
