{"text": "These shoes are the most amazing shoes! They're the craziest amount of comfortable that youve ever felt. Plus I get compliments on them all of the time.I agree with the other reviewers. You need to &#34;Season&#34; them first before you wear theme everywhere but they ARE an outdoor/every day shoe. I waterproofed them two days in a row and then wore them around by backyard only for the first couple of weeks. It really helped them to be a shoe that is able to be worn all of the time. This sole is durable!This will be a shoe that you have for many years to come!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.10254517", "2": "0.29082763", "3": "0.104103714", "4": "0.10042978", "5": "0.29633436", "6": "0.102764055"}}
