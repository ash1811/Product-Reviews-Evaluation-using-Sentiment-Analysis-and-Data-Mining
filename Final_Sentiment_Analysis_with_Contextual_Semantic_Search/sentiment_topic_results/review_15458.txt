{"text": "I've had this watch for about a month and a half as of 9/4/06 and it has kept accurate time, I compare it to my Casio Waveceptor watch (MTG920DA-1) which calibrates itself every day.The dial is a beautiful blue color, which catches the light nicely. The easily adjusted band is comfortable, and the entire watch and band are so thin and light on my wrist.While I don't wear it every day, it has shown no signs of wear and has a good quality feel to it, though thin and light (once again).This watch will look elegant on any wrist, it's simple: no date or sweep second hand, but eye-catching.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16001171", "1": "0.30419344", "2": "0.11212104", "3": "0.07272146", "4": "0.092063345", "5": "0.13230373", "6": "0.12658526"}}
