{"text": "I bought 3 pairs of El Naturalista shoes, including this one. All of them are very stylish, and the leather is soft and of excellent quality. However ALL of them are very narrow. I wear regular width shoes and never had a problem buying shoes in stores or online, this is the first time. Buy only if you have skinny/ narrow feet.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05412162", "1": "0.3612696", "2": "0.27241918", "3": "0.08203388", "4": "0.16656974", "6": "0.059098583"}}
