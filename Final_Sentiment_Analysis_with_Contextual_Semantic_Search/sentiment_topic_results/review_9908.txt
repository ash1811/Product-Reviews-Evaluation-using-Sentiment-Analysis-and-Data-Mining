{"text": "I don't wear watches to look cool. I have a very real need for accurate time all day every day. I've tried the G-Shock watches and they work just fine but are so large hey hurt my wrist, especially when wearing a jacket, plus as I get older it's hard to read the little display on them.I finally broke down and bought the Ironman and what a difference! The watch is just the right size and shape and it light and comfortable. The display is perfectly readable in just about any light and at any angle! Day, date, and time at a glance! I love it!The buttons are large enough to be very easy to use but not so large that they push against your wrist when working. The interior of the band is very smooth and doesn't pinch at all. The buckle is nice and smooth and the strap has a very nice little locking nub on it that keeps the strap end in place.The menus are very simple. I managed to set the watch in just a few minutes without ever looking at the instructions. I like to \"hack\" my watch so that the time is accurate to the second. This watch made it very easy, just set the watch one minute fast, and then set it to the seconds mode. Watch the time count down and \"hack\" it when the minute changes and you're all set.It holds the time to within about 3 seconds per month, very accurate!In short, if you need a good watch for TELLING TIME this is a great product. It may not be super cool looking but it's not bad, and for the money, you just can't go wrong.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24273445", "1": "0.18034226", "2": "0.13143933", "3": "0.16127361", "5": "0.13206506", "6": "0.1497974"}}
