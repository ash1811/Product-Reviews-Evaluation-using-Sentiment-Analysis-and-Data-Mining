{"text": "I work outside on a laptop year round.  These gloves are great for keeping your hands warm while you type and for using a touch screen phone.  This was my second pair where the first pair I had lasted through 3 winters before they started falling apart.  I'm pretty rough on them too pretty much wearing them from Nov-March just about every day.  They are a little bit itchy at first, but its never been enough to bother me.  Overall I love them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.41735825", "2": "0.06460199", "3": "0.17688026", "4": "0.043784548", "5": "0.21403098", "6": "0.08020674"}}
