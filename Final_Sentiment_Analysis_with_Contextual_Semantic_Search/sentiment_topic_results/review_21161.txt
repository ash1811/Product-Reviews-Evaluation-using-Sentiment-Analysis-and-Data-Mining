{"text": "My son got this for his 4th birthday and has been inseparable from it since.  It comes with three costumes in the box - Robin, Superman and Batman.  Each is a single piece of fabric, half of which forms the cape and half of which gets tied around your kiddo's waist to form the shirt.  It's not like a Halloween costume, and it's not a complete costume.  That being said, it's still a lot of fun!  My son has asked to sleep in these costumes every night for a week.  He runs around the house as one of the superheros, and has been dressing his baby sister in the robin costume so she can be a superhero too.  We've had hours of wonderful adventures in these!Pros:  They're FUN!  Three costume choices, two of which come with masks.Cons:  They have held up pretty well, but the seams are starting to look a little iffy on my son's favored costume after a few weeks of play.  I also wish they were a pull over the head type costume, with a full shirt, instead of something to tie around the waist, but overall it's a fantastic buy for the money.Highly recommended for any young superheros out there!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16901825", "1": "0.17061836", "2": "0.06930878", "3": "0.25559828", "4": "0.121757954", "5": "0.10344235", "6": "0.11025604"}}
