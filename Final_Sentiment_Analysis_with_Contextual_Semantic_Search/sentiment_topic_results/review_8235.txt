{"text": "I love the 569 category from Levi's. I've been wearing these since 2002, they are a great fit. No matter what weight I am at, I can never fit into 501's(at least not comfortably); too tight around the thighs and seat. These 569's are looser and give a comfortable fit for people who aren't built like twigs.I would give 5 stars, however the material that Levi's uses is not as durable or thick as the 569's I purchased in the early 2000's. Those pairs, which were worn a lot by me, are still holding up nicely. The Levi's which I bought a couple years later, with the less durable material, has worn down more quickly. Still, 569's look nice and fit well.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.041121077", "1": "0.49137208", "2": "0.059629727", "3": "0.028654756", "4": "0.053928394", "5": "0.04096704", "6": "0.28432697"}}
