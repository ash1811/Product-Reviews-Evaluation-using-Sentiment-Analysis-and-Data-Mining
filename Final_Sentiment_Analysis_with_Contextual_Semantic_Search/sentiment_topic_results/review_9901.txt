{"text": "I loved this watch until the band came off and neither I nor any watch repairer I talked to could replace the band on the watch. Which is a total scam - how in the world does Timex get away with manufacturing a watch whose band can't be replaced?In any event - this would be a great running watch if the band stayed on.
