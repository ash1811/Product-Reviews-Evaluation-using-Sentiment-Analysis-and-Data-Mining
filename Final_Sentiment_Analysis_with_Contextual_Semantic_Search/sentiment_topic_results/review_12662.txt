{"text": "I bought this after reading that it gives you the pin-up bullet look. I does indeed, If you do not have long breasts you will likely need to buy or create inserts in order to fill the cone tips. Round inserts will not work. That being said this is a very comfortable bra. I had a little trouble at first adjusting the slip straps but once you do, they stay put. The Cotton straps do not stretch and jiggle you around the way elastic ones do. For your comfort they do have a small elastic stretch panel near the hooks in the back. If you want retro this is an amazing value.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09601886", "1": "0.17758474", "2": "0.10326213", "3": "0.122388266", "4": "0.13923495", "5": "0.24697755", "6": "0.114533514"}}
