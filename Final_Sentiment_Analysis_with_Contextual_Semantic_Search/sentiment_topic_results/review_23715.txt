{"text": "I purchased this product for the men in my household who seem to go through &#34;sock fights&#34; monthly.  This brand of Hanes socks are GREAT, comfortable, the right height, strength, and not too thick/bulky in quality.  I also decided to wear one of them around the house, they are so comfortable and keeps my feet warm, I sometimes forget I have them on and not my slippers or flip flops.  The price is reasonable, the quality is great, quantity is great 6 pairs in a package.  The delivery was excellent and on time, and packaging great.  I would recommend this set over many others I have tried, reviewed, seen and purchased in the past for the family members in my household.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15104209", "1": "0.37679514", "2": "0.11492175", "3": "0.11069515", "4": "0.12528683", "5": "0.05197907", "6": "0.06927997"}}
