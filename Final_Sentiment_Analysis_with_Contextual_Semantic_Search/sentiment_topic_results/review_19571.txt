{"text": "I'm a big Le Mystere fan, and when I was a C cup the lace style was definitely a fav.  It's just a tad itchy (not too bad) and not quite as smooth under tight tees as the dream tisha, but the pretty aesthetic of the bra definitely makes up for it.  It also tends to minimize just a little compared to the Dream Tisha, which is a plus for me.My experience is that the lace tisha tends to run a bit smaller than dream tisha, so you might need to order a cup size larger if you're between sizes.  It also looks better on C, D cups.  I recently gained some body fat and went to a DD/E, and I don't feel as supported with the lace version (some spillage issues).  So I'll stick with the Dream Tisha until I can lose the extra pounds, but will def return to the pretty lace version when I'm a D cup again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13992815", "1": "0.14590845", "2": "0.13697365", "3": "0.23406719", "4": "0.08661677", "5": "0.03950041", "6": "0.21700543"}}
