{"text": "I used the Casio W-93H wristwatch for about 8-9 years before the battery died. Despite the low price, it was a great watch that kept very accurate time (I only reset it twice a year when going on or off daylight saving time). During this period, I was active in scuba diving, and I wore the watch on hundreds of ocean dives, going as deep as 100 feet. When the battery finally died, I bought another W-93H, which I'm still wearing, although I'm no longer diving. I bought the new one because I doubted if the old watch would maintain its watertightness after opening up the watch and disturbing the seal to put in a new battery. But I went ahead and changed the battery (a CR 1616 lithium battery that costs about $2.00), and that watch is still keeping good time for a nephew who I gave it to.For such an inexpensive watch, it's loaded with features. I seldom used some of the features like the alarm and stopwatch, but it was very convenient to have them there on occasions when I did need them. The illuminator light was one feature that I did use often, and it was great to be able to read the watch even in total darkness.The Casio W93-H is such a good watch that I've bought several more over the years for birthday and Christmas gifts.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.23909496", "1": "0.17603868", "2": "0.110003464", "3": "0.13353837", "4": "0.08740408", "5": "0.14983694", "6": "0.104083516"}}
