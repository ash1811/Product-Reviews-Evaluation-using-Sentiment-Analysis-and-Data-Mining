{"text": "I'm in vegan shoes heaven. I love all the different colors these come in.  As for the fit, they are minimalist.  I need a lot of arch support so I bought inserts for mine.  These are very hip looking and when people notice them I get compliments.  I wear them with jeans and causual clothes, not for working out.  I would love for Saucony to come out with a line of vegan running shoes.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.37559387", "2": "0.17614543", "3": "0.10852901", "5": "0.17096856", "6": "0.16137597"}}
