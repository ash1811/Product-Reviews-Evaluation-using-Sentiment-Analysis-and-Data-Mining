{"text": "This is a full-function watch in a stylish form factor, and low profile enough to swim with. The straps are not forever, but the strap HAS been improved -- the little band that holds the end of the strap down now has a nice little nubbin that corresponds to a notch in the end of the band that makes it much less likely you'll have a strap-end flying in the breeze or in the water. I like this a lot.Best of class, nice looking, lots of easy functionality. I keep coming back to the Triathlon. This is a medium sized Men's watch. For a smaller watch (for Women or small-wristed men), try the Unisex version, T5E961. I purchased that version and it was way too small for me, both the face and the strap are small. The 961 is really a Women's size watch. The 901 (this model under review here) is a perfect men's size version.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2804842", "2": "0.3018029", "3": "0.11599049", "4": "0.15504283", "5": "0.044546455", "6": "0.09986065"}}
