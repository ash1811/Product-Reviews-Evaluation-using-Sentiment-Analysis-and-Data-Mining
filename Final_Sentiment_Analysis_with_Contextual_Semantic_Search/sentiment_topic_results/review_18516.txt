{"text": "These are really nice shoes. I was a bit skeptical at first because of the low price and the fact that the shoes are waterproof. My concern was that they would not shine well. I spit shine my shoes and as a result, need top quality leather that shines well. To my surprise, these shoes shined up brighter and nicer than any of the military shoes I have ever owned. The comfort is spectacular. The shoes look dressy, but don't have that uncomfortable dress shoe feel.The support is great! These aren't casual tennis shoe feeling shoes. The support is solid and strong, but very comfortable. There is no need for much break in. I have found myself a new number one shoe choice here, as long as Rockport makes them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.056602452", "1": "0.23340377", "2": "0.26824525", "3": "0.16970338", "5": "0.15199727", "6": "0.11773008"}}
