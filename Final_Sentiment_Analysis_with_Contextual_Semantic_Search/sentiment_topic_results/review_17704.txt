{"text": "I used this watch for surfing with wetsuit covering it.  I soak it in fresh water after every session.  I had the other non metal version as well and both leaked.  I got them because they were cheap but they just aren't made to handle the rigor of salt water exposure and cold/warm temps.  I think the battery actually started to give out on one as well.  Although it's a 10 year battery, it's warrantied only 1 year.  I would not buy this again for surfing or even for casual wear.  The metal version bands are cheap looking with the edges a little sharp.  The surrounding border around the dials for both the metal AW80D-1AV and the black resin band version both wear out as it's a silver paint. Underneath is a yellow/off color plastic.  I got these for ~$15 so no complaints since I got good use of them but don't expect durability or long usage in salt water.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17572297", "1": "0.28675142", "2": "0.12855586", "3": "0.03529097", "4": "0.1452941", "5": "0.20398241", "6": "0.024402319"}}
