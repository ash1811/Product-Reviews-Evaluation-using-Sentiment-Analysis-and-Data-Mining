{"text": "I chose these buttons because I trust the Carhartt brand.  The buttons are sturdy and fairly easy to attach.  I use an awl to punch a hole through the fabric first. My right hand has a slight tremor so if I can do it so can most other people.  Buttons can be used for more than suspenders like replacing buttons or taking an inch off the pants waist by putting a button next to the regular fly button.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.19820689", "2": "0.12598358", "3": "0.09167601", "4": "0.15907262", "5": "0.1298343", "6": "0.2914288"}}
