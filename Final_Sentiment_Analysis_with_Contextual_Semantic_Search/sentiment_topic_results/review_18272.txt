{"text": "I bought this to use for work, as it is not expensive and my job might damage a watch by scratching it.  It keeps good time and was easy to adjust.  The band is perforated along its length and wrist size is easy to match, though plastic is not the most comfortable band to wear in warmer weather.  Have not tried the alarm function as I don't need that.  It's a good basic, inexpensive watch that does what I need, and I would recommend it for anyone who needs to keep time without spending a lot of money.UPDATE:  I wasn't using the alarm function or any other function except timekeeping, so I was surprised to hear a tiny beeping that I couldn't seem to shut off.  Had to find the instruction manual to figure out the buttons, which are very tiny and the indicators on the face are hard to read without a magnifying glass.  If these drawbacks aren't bothersome, it is a good watch, keeps time, is inexpensive enough for everyday wear.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13842312", "1": "0.2656054", "2": "0.06426775", "3": "0.039485484", "4": "0.21969396", "5": "0.08692507", "6": "0.18559925"}}
