{"text": "after reading the reviews, i went with a medium.  i'm 5'2&#34; and 114 lbs.  pretty slim all over (petite build) but a slight belly and 34c bust.  i didn't want anything tight or riding up.  this fits really perfect.  there was no shelf bra which i am okay with.  they usually aggravate me anyway.  also, for those interested, there are no snaps at the crotch.  i'm not a dancer...just like one piece leotards under skirts and shorts sometimes.  i can't stand to tuck a top in...they never lay right.  i will end up getting the sleeveless and the long sleeved versions as well.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08954656", "1": "0.29396886", "2": "0.11278006", "3": "0.13103057", "4": "0.13135476", "5": "0.16092706", "6": "0.0803921"}}
