{"text": "This is the 6th pair of Keen shoes I have owned but my first pair of sandals. I love them. I tried on all the different styles in the store and these were the most comfortable. They are great for walking in the summer because they offer comfort and support but are vented more than sneakers and IMO look better with shorts.I wore these to Sleeping Bear Dunes on our vacation last week (big mistake) and sand got pretty heavily imbedded in the foot beds. I took a toothbrush to them when we got home and it all came out pretty effortlessly. I love that they are machine washable too.Another great thing about Keens is that they come in size 10.5!  Most brands skip 10.5 and go right to 11. I am a 10.5 and these run true to size. 11 would be too big.I love these every bit as much as the shoes I've purchased. I wear out every pair I get, I use them so much.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19099678", "1": "0.20119803", "2": "0.08464975", "3": "0.15540856", "4": "0.13482194", "5": "0.048740756", "6": "0.18418424"}}
