{"text": "What I like most about this hat is that it has a stiff brim that doesn't fall into my 1 yr. olds face, thereby annoying her and prompting her to rip it off. I like that you can make it snug both around the head and under the chin. I still wish I could find a good one with velcro. Love the color and material. We tested it out in the playroom yesterday and she wore it for a while. We'll see how she does with it camping this week :-)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15539405", "1": "0.1849552", "2": "0.15132482", "3": "0.1334381", "4": "0.13200086", "5": "0.15477547", "6": "0.088111505"}}
