{"text": "I wasted a lot of money buying other clogs that looked pretty in the photo with their floral or other type design, but were just not the quality and easy-fitting shoe this one is.  Because it's got a thicker,sturdier upper, you can slip your foot right in without using your fingers.  They're very comfortable and last a long time.I keep a pair by each door for running outside for the mail or to potty our dogs.  They feel so good on my painful feet I walk my dogs or run to the store in them as well.  They're perfect for warm or cool weather and keep my feet dry and warm in rain and snow.Unlike when I wore the clog with the floppy upper my feet don't sweat in them and they don't look like gardening shoes.  Love them!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1640503", "1": "0.25868922", "2": "0.08029469", "3": "0.073739745", "4": "0.18442439", "5": "0.20040403", "6": "0.038397603"}}
