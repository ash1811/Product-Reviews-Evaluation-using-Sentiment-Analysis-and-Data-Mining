{"text": "This is great casual dress pant for a repair shop office.It fits a little tight all around where the denim version in the same sizing feels just right. It looks great the first wear, but as the day progresses or you wear it 2 days, it looks wrinkled and worn and loses the pressed look.A good pant but not as nice a look throughout the day as a pair of Dockers or Chinos.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14188257", "1": "0.47259322", "4": "0.16548216", "5": "0.05725017", "6": "0.15581347"}}
