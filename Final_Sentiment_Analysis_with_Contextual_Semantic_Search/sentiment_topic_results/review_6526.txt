{"text": "I have never experienced such comfort in a pair of socks! I ordered these spectacular socks to wear with my hiking boots here in Afghanistan where I am deployed. I needed: Cushioning, Long Lasting Support, High Quality, Odor and Moisture Absorbent socks, and these definitely fit all the criteria! These are so amazingly comfortable, I even wear them as slippers.  I wear my boots at a minimum, 14 hours per day and these socks hold up and continue to support my feet very well the entire time. Odor and moisture is kept to a minimum while wearing these socks and my feet are quite grateful for these amazing Thorlos!Thorlo socks are by far the most comfortable, high quality socks I have ever owned and best of all, they don't devastate my wallet.A note: I wear a women's size 11 shoe and the size Large fits PERFECTLY.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.036509316", "1": "0.28088683", "2": "0.020926243", "3": "0.13520966", "4": "0.1318286", "5": "0.22928481", "6": "0.16535455"}}
