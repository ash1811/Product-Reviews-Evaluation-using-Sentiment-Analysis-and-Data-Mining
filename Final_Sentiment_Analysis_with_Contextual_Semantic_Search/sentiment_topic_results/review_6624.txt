{"text": "I have been a fan of carhartt pocket t-shirts forever, long  sleeve and short. They are extremely durable and can weather the grind I put them through in exttreme temperatures here in Phoenix , Az.  what is really special is the relaxed fit they have when you order your size , Comfortablity is a big factor for me and these allow a comforable fit without armpit tightness. So don't hesitate and buy these, you won't regret it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20484456", "1": "0.3360119", "2": "0.24774842", "4": "0.12592922", "6": "0.07790226"}}
