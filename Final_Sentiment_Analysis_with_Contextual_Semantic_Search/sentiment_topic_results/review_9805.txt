{"text": "I love this entire Onitsuka Tiger line.  The style, design and variety of colors is plenty to be happy about, but I'm really surprised that the shoes are also very comfortable.  They have great arch support and they're super lightweight. I highly recommend.... Actually, I don't, because I like having a different style shoe from everyone else.  So find another shoe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.25020945", "2": "0.28111878", "3": "0.110527895", "4": "0.18245539", "6": "0.16814668"}}
