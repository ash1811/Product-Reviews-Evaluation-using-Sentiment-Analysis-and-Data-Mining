{"text": "I love these boots.  They are super light, nice and ventilated, and comfy for long hikes.  I have hiked a 10 hour trail on them so far, and they were like wearing slippers.  They feel great on the trail, if I were on the road, I would expect a litlle different support, so dont hike the asphalt.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.17774005", "2": "0.23760922", "3": "0.08340477", "4": "0.1135578", "5": "0.095897876", "6": "0.28701413"}}
