{"text": "All I needed was something that was cheap, not fragile, and would tell me the time. This fit the bill. Mine was $9.35 and was well worth it. I bought it a couple months ago and it is all I could ask for. The band is a flexible resin (which is essentially thin rubber), the casing over the face and hands of the watch is plastic so I don't have to be concerned about breaking it on anything, the knob to set the time is easy to maneuver, and it was less than ten dollars. This is a watch that does what it is supposed to, doesn't seem like it will break, and even if it does it can be easily replaced.
