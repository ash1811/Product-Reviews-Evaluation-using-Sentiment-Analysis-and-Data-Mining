They aren't super stretchy, which means they sort of sag behind the knees and stuff.  Meaning that they aren't super attractive, but since they're worn under clothes it doesn't really matter.  MUCH warmer than some other brands I've tried.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11771803", "1": "0.26049238", "3": "0.16953607", "4": "0.1687989", "6": "0.2747673"}}
