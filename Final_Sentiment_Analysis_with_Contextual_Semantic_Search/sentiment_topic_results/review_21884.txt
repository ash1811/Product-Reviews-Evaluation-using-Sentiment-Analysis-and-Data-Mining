{"text": "im about 5'5 and 150lbs. this body stocking is too short for me!! the leg part fits well but its not long enough to cover my breasts! i guess thats no big deal since it wouldnt last long in that area anyway but still. im short and its not long enough. thats ridiculous! it was semi easy to put on. the material didn't rip when i was CAREFULLY!! pulling it up my legs. but thats the ONLY good part about this product. 2 stars only because shipping was fast and material was soft. don't waste your money if your over 5 ft tall!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14649469", "1": "0.2239157", "2": "0.10646644", "3": "0.24183135", "4": "0.13909058", "5": "0.094953835", "6": "0.04724742"}}
