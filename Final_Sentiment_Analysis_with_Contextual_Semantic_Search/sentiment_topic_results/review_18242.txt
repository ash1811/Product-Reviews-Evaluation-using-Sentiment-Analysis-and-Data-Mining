{"text": "I have always loved Casio watches. I have collected several over the years. I have worn the G's quite a lot. Let me tell you though that this DW290 is one my favorite Casios.This model is old school cool. It has a great wrist presence with a nice clear display. The numbers are easier to see than on other more expensive models for some reason. The screen is not cluttered with useless graphs and flashing nonsense.For this price there is NO WAY you can go wrong. It will give you years of service. A big, muscular, retro, MONSTER!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.121769056", "1": "0.16012968", "2": "0.18713348", "3": "0.21522021", "4": "0.15881528", "6": "0.15416984"}}
