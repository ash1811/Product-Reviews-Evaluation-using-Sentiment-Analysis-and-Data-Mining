{"text": "First to help with Real vs. Fake Uggs....If you look at the Left boot inside behind the label is a reflective sticker that has Uggs written on it with Sun's which will help let you know if they are real.The same sticker should be on the box. As of 2013 Uggs changed the security feature when you turn the boot 90 degree's the sticker will change from Black to White. You can go to the Uggs website to see the pictures of the stickers and get a more detailed explanation. Depending on what year your boots are made will depend on the security feature.Next Sizing....I usually wear a size 7/7.5 pending on the shoe. The Uggs site tells if that if you are in between sizes to order DOWN as their boot tends to run large, torn between a Big Kids 5 or 6 I ordered the BIG Kids 5. They fit PERFECT, a little snug, snug with a thick sock on BUT.... Uggs form to your feet which is what makes them soooo comfy, so after a few wears the snugness will hug my tootsie's just right with socks on. I know some like to wear with no sock but I have to wear socks.Now to tell you what you probably already know... Uggs... LOVES them, how could you not, they are like having pillows on your feet, they are like walking up a staircase of clouds taking you to HEAVEN. Yea they are that comfortable. When they first came out I swore I wouldn't jump on the bandwagon so much so that I would wear the EMU and BearPaws or as I would freely admit &#34;Fuggs&#34;.Uggs are without a doubt the BEST boot in this type of style, you know the sheepskin, warm & fuzzy, cozy & comfy, that you can wear with sweats, jeans or shorts because they feel that AMAZING on. I have worn BearPaw, EMU and other popular competitors and without a doubt Uggs is definitely the way to go. The popular competitors seem to over do it with either the boots are too heavy on the feet or they don't given enough support.If you are looking to keep the feetsie's warm, want comfort and something you can wear with anything these are the boots you want. Don't settle for the knocks off whether they are they are unknowns or popular competitors. Ugg's LOVES them :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.123887405", "1": "0.05170608", "2": "0.08678429", "3": "0.32631093", "4": "0.21406406", "5": "0.10566953", "6": "0.09157769"}}
