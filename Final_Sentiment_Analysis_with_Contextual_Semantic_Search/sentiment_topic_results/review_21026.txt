{"text": "I'm 5'6\" and 128 lbs - the medium fit well except that the leggings were sooo long. They were about 4 inches too long - not too big of a problem if you roll them up at the bottom and stuff them into boots. However, I did like that they were well made - my H&M leggings were getting thread-bare and I don't think that will be a problem with these.
