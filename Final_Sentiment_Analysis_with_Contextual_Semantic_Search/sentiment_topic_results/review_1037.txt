{"text": "I bought this sandal around one month ago, its very nice model and quality but unfortunately its size is somewhat small. I returned all its cost and I hope if Amazon give another chance to buy this sandal with more suitable size by waiving the shipping fees or by give me a special discount such as 70% because I like this sandal but I cannot buy it with shipping fees.At the end, I have to say &#34;Many thanks to Amazon&#34;", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12110385", "1": "0.2984303", "2": "0.18581332", "3": "0.100154765", "4": "0.10667935", "5": "0.040452745", "6": "0.14736566"}}
