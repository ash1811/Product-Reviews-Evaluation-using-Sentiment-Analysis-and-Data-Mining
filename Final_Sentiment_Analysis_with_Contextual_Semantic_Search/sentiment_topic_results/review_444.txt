{"text": "My biggest beef with most jeans nowadays is the material. It's almost impossible to find jeans made of real denim anymore instead of the stretchy, cheap-feeling crap. These are a good weight of real old-fashioned denim. Very comfortable. The &#34;finish&#34; looks exactly as pictured which is also rare these days. My only issue is that i think, being &#34;relaxed fit&#34;, they could have a tiny bit more room in the buns for sitting down comfort. That would make them 5 stars for me.  Also, I wish they came in 28 inseam (I'm built like a Hobbit, but that's not Wrangler's fault, it's my parents).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.086943835", "1": "0.23155314", "2": "0.120848335", "3": "0.13559787", "4": "0.19565532", "5": "0.13182068", "6": "0.09758084"}}
