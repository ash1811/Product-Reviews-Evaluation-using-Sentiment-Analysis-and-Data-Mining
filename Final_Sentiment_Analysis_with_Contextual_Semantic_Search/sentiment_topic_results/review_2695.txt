{"text": "My previous Skagen was a titanium one with a blue/purple face. Very sharp looking and it received many compliments. Unfortunately, after many years of use, the band gave out (though the actual mechanicals are still working...), so I needed to purchase a replacement.I did look at getting the same type, but opted for this version, as it was cheaper. And I wanted a change.Note: It's not as &#34;whilte&#34; as it appears in the picture (thankfully!). It's more of a silver color.Note: I also received mine already running, so not sure how long the battery will last. But that's an inexpensive fix.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12754521", "1": "0.20752573", "2": "0.085149415", "3": "0.09948026", "4": "0.21598156", "5": "0.15501474", "6": "0.10930315"}}
