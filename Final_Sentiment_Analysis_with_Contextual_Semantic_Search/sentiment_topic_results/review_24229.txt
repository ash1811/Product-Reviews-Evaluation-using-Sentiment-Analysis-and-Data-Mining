{"text": "Pros:  Liked the back. Seems sturdy strong material.Cons:  Runs a bit small, Not enough separation between the cups.This bra caught my attention because of the back.  I have to alter my bras in the back so the straps come closer to the center.  Because I need sturdy bras T-back bras aren't enough support.  I'm returning because the front cups squeeze the girls together instead of lift and separate.  It runs slightly small in the band size.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09675836", "1": "0.20422524", "2": "0.06243857", "3": "0.40019965", "4": "0.091082826", "5": "0.045003247", "6": "0.100292146"}}
