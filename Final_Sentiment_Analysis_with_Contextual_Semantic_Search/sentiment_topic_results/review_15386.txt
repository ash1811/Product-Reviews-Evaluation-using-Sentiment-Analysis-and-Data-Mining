{"text": "Great glasses.  Fit perfectly.  I'm a pretty large headed guy and the 55mm's fit perfectly.  They are authentic &#34;Made in Italy&#34; units with the RB watermark on the lens.  I thought they might be a little &#34;too lightly tinted&#34; for sunglasses, but I live in San Diego and they are GREAT sunglasses.  Super happy with them!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09608489", "1": "0.32158884", "2": "0.23928133", "3": "0.120796815", "4": "0.108830765", "5": "0.080271274", "6": "0.033146035"}}
