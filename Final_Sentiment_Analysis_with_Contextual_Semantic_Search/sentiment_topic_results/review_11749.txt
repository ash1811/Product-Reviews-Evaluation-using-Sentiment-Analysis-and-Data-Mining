{"text": "I am very pleased with these water shoes. They fit snug (but not too tight). I wear a women's size 6 1/2 shoe and ordered these in the size 6. I use them for water aerobics and they provide comfort and stability.The inner sole lining stays put and does not bunch up under my foot. The sole is sturdy enough to walk across gravel comfortably. I would recommend these shoes to a friend.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06478997", "1": "0.31782684", "2": "0.1726788", "3": "0.087123826", "4": "0.11581059", "5": "0.17482233", "6": "0.06694768"}}
