{"text": "The color was nice. A light casual blue tone. The picture here is a bit dirty looking. But the actual item is nice.The material is also a bit heavier than my other two recent 524s.Unfortunately the straight style does not look good on me as the boot cut or flare, so I'll be returning this. Will stick to the boot cut. But this is nice for those who likes the straight cut.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.49590006", "2": "0.08110211", "3": "0.104575075", "4": "0.13573", "5": "0.12529004", "6": "0.053602286"}}
