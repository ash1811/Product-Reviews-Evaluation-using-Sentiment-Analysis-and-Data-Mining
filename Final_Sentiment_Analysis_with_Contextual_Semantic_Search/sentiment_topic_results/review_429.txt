{"text": "i was afraid to use it on my fine jewelry in case it would actually harm them. i tested it on a dull necklace that i got on sale and it looked brand new! super shiny and so easily too! i also shined an old silver jewelry case of mine with a wipe, and now i can see my reflection in it. eventually i gathered the courage and used it on my prized tiffany necklace and i'm so glad! it's bright, clear, and shiny again! i'd definitely recommend this product!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13266037", "1": "0.1230969", "2": "0.26143628", "3": "0.21652251", "4": "0.10616701", "5": "0.046419688", "6": "0.11369723"}}
