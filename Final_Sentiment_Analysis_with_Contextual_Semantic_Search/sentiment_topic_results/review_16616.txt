{"text": "I wanted to write a review for this watch based on my personal experience.  In some cases, not all, some customers will give a watch \"one star\" for not being what they expected, nothing more.  In my case the Mudman watch was in perfect condition and I loved all of it's various functions, the way everything worked and set up and it's wrist appeal.  The only problem I had, as some others did was the little \"nubs\" on the resin case back that provided clearance between the back of the watch and top of your wrist.  I wear watches on my left wrist and have a very small 6.5\" size.  One of the nubs actually rubbed the skin a bit raw and I could not wear it for any length of time.  The buttons on the right side were tough to push but I expected this, that's why they call it a Mudman....right?  It is sealed well and can probably withstand any punishment you can dish out.  I tried various settings on the band, tighter to keep it from moving around somewhat on my wrist, and one hole looser to see if the chafing problem would clear up but it didn't.  Other than the problem with the \"nubs\", a great watch and I would recommend it.  It might be better suited to people with a bigger/thicker wrist size.  I simply returned it to Amazon for a refund and have since ordered a different G-shock.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0578087", "1": "0.14652202", "2": "0.39496914", "3": "0.093997106", "4": "0.089244746", "5": "0.16243017", "6": "0.055028155"}}
