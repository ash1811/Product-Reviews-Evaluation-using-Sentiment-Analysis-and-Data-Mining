{"text": "i recently got engaged and wanted something to sparkle up my ring as I am always doing something with my hands and lotions dull up the shine.Just for that this works well. My ring looks wonderful when I am done soaking it for a bit.I have tried it on tarnished earrings and it didnt do anything but shine it a bit where it wasnt tarnished. It didnt take away even some fresh rust so it is not a deep cleaner by any natureI also think the tiny little brush that it comes with is somewhat of a joke. It is so flimsy with such little bristles I couldnt see how it could possibly do anything better than shaking the ring in fluid.If you are looking for the most basic shiner for your diamonds and such then this is a great thing to have on hand. I dont regret the purchase, just wish that a cleaner had a bit more versitility. I will still get my diamonds professionally cleaned every now and then despite having this.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15121283", "1": "0.31801596", "2": "0.20974995", "3": "0.026978869", "4": "0.055245165", "5": "0.1008617", "6": "0.13793552"}}
