{"text": "I've worn Reebok Princess tennis shoes for many years cause I found them to be very comfortable from the first day I put them on.  However, this pair is very disappointing and I'll have to return them.  I ordered the same size as always but these are way too large.  And, what happened to the awesome arch support in these shoes?  This pair didn't have it at all.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04789555", "1": "0.061657768", "2": "0.1689085", "3": "0.41934565", "4": "0.09142658", "5": "0.12413683", "6": "0.08662908"}}
