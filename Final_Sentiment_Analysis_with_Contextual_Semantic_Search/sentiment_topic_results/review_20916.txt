{"text": "I am over forty and hated wearing jeans or any fitted pants until low rise became the style because I have NO hips to speak of.  If I bought women's jeans to fit my waist I wore a size 16 but swam everywhere else.  With low rise cut I fit into an 8 and they fit everywhere. For years I wore guys jeans until the low rise jeans came out a decade or so ago.When low rise jeans started to go &#34;out of style&#34;  I bought 30 pairs (no joke) because I wear them everyday as a college prof.  Well that was 7 years ago and I am starting to rapidly wear them out so I started to look for low rise women's jeans.There just isn't any out there anymore in the women's dept so I ordered these, praying that they would fit and they DID!  YEAH!I usually wear a size 8 in women's pants and these fits pretty good.  If anything, I think I would go up to a size 11 because the size 9's are very slightly smaller than the size 8's I used to get.Besides that, these are great jeans and I am so happy to find the levi's low rise once more.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.028868033", "1": "0.33614188", "2": "0.051971786", "3": "0.09199822", "4": "0.16473748", "5": "0.15642646", "6": "0.16985618"}}
