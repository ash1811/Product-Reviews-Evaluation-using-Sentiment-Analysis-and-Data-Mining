{"text": "I bought these for my husband for our last wedding anniversary. His grandmother had macular degeneration, so I worried that he may be prone to getting it too, and I read a lot of good information on these sunglasses.  My ONLY complaint is that there is no protection on the sides of the glasses.  But I like the looks of these iconic sunglasses so much I bought myself a pair of brown tortoise new wayfarers, and I absolutely love them.  Again, just the issue of no protection on the sides, but they look SOOOOO cool!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1400697", "1": "0.17483528", "2": "0.09791026", "3": "0.15118934", "4": "0.11636291", "5": "0.24260288", "6": "0.077029586"}}
