{"text": "I got this and am returning it.  The watch itself seems nice, but the band is too small for me.  I am on the last slot, so it is awkward.  The display is very clear, and about 1/4 recessed from the shields of the G-shock, so I doubt it would get damaged very easily.  If the band was longer, I'd keep it.  Love the idea of the 10 year battery.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19489628", "2": "0.21395412", "3": "0.2843738", "4": "0.15704556", "5": "0.099973716", "6": "0.045526773"}}
