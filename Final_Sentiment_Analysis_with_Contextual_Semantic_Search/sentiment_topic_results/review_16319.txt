{"text": "I needed opaque tights for the winter months and other brands kept falling short (not actually opaque, not enough stretch, tear easily, etc.) and I kept having to throw them away.  These, however, have not only lasted a long time, are actually opaque and provide a little bit of shaping (though not much).  They are extremely comfortable and durable.  I've had these since October (it's now late February) and they look just as new as when I first got them--even after several washes.  I will say that the sizing chart seems a bit off to me.  Based on my height and weight I am squarely in the middle of size C.  However, that size was too small and way too uncomfortable to wear all day so I upgraded to a size D and it was perfect.  It could be that I have long legs, or that one needs to size up in general.  Either way, I'm buying another one in a different color.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08309329", "1": "0.31237975", "2": "0.10712866", "3": "0.24538615", "4": "0.08786268", "5": "0.07485452", "6": "0.089294955"}}
