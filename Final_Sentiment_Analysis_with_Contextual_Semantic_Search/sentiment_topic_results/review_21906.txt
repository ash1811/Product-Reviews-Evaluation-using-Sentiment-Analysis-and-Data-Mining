{"text": "I got these after my wife came home with some of her own she purchased at a physical therapy/training session. They seemed perfect for my workouts without shoes. The Medium socks fit me very well (size 9us) and the grippy sole ensures that I can do my stretching and workouts in our upstairs workout room without regualr shoes. I do TRX and stretching and there is carpeting in the room - so I like having something that grips without having to wear shoes.the socks are very well constructed - putting them on is very similar to putting on my five fingers shoes. It takes a little work, but the end result is serious comfort. They are also nice and warm to wear around the house without worrying about cold feet.Overall I like them quite a lot and they are well made.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.27119595", "2": "0.13048634", "4": "0.09243366", "5": "0.31665653", "6": "0.18445109"}}
