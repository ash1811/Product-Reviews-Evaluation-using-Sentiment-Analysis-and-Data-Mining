{"text": "I bought a calculator watch once before from Timex. I was reasonably happy with it, except that it would beep with every button press, which there was no way to turn off, and that it was lacking in some of the other features of a digital watch which are common. This has all of the above. I do tips in my head, but it's great for figuring taxes and unit pricing, and you'd be surprised how much more calculating you find yourself doing when you have a calculator so close at hand. It's also great to have a stopwatch and calendar, too.Because this watch has a full complement of buttons, it's much easier to operate than something like an F-91W, and it's much less prone to accidental resets of date and time. Features are also fewer button presses away, although the buttons are quite small and require a bit of dexterity.It's also waterproof, which is what ended my Timex calculator watch.The only thing missing is a backlight, which I rarely use. Were I to need that, I'd just got o my phone for the time.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13501485", "1": "0.21932988", "2": "0.1936724", "4": "0.15433396", "5": "0.11783585", "6": "0.17705798"}}
