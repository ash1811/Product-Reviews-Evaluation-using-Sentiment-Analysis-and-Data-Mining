{"text": "My husband loves that these are leather instead of suede.  I feel like they are too stiff and not as comfortable as one would expect considering the price.  He has had these slippers before and I do not recall them being so stiff.  The fit is good and again, he prefers leather to suede so they work.  I just expected them to be more comfortable. Other reviewers have mentioned that the stiffness relaxes after a few days.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0923469", "1": "0.37376404", "2": "0.10644163", "4": "0.18872538", "5": "0.17933455", "6": "0.05490117"}}
