{"text": "9/16/13  I recently purchased several different styles from different manufacturers for my fiance.  We returned all but these (two pair).  My fiance is happy with them.  He says they are comfortable.  I see that some people felt that the waist band was rough, however, he is not experiencing this issue.  I have now washed & dryed both pair at least a half a dozen times and I see very little shrinkage.  I dry them to the almost dry stage...just very little dampness left..the pockets will be the dampest....and then hang them up in the laundry room to dry the rest of the way.  This is our experience with them...really...this is a personal choice...not everyone likes the same thing.  Also, people buy these for different uses.  My fiance would never go out in them other than to make a quick run to a local Wawa for whatever.  During the gardening season he has stood outside on our property in them helping me water, but other than that he is not wearing them anywhere.  He is never wearing them in place of jeans or shorts.  For my fiance they work for something to wear around home to relax in.  I would say try them and if you don't like them return them...returns are easy...", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.22812438", "2": "0.1898931", "3": "0.10035152", "4": "0.23807499", "5": "0.16162635", "6": "0.07958107"}}
