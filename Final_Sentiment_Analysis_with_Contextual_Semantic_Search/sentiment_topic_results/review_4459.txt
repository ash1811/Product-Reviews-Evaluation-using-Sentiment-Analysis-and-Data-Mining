{"text": "HEre's the thing....everyone says these sandals need a \"break-in\" period --- a) that's ridiculous, and b) they absolutely DO NOT fit a wide foot (E, EEE, or EEEEE). These are soft leather, nice looking and for a thin foot probably very comfortable.  I wear a 7.5 EEE.  I ordered one size larger (8.5 - 9.5 MEdium) and they absolutely DO NOT fit -- while you can get your foot into the strap, they cut into the skin between the toes, and there is absolutely no way to \"break in\" the sandle....I wore them for about an hour and found that a) not only do they not loosen up in any way they also dug into the top of my foot and created bloody welts. These 50.00 sandals became unreturnable because they have been worn, and they have dirt on them, and they have blood on the straps.$50.00 worth of garbage within one hour. DO NOT BELIEVE all these folks on here who say \"just break them in\"....they do not fit a wide foot, period.
