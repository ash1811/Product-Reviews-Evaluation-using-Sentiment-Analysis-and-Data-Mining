{"text": "My husband has been wearing the original Sperry Top-Sider since his college days & WON'T WEAR ANYTHING BUT THEM!!!  I have bought his shoes throughout the years ... even when he didn't think he was ready for a new pair : )  or as he says, he just got them the way he likes them.I have bought other brands in an effort to find black ones because I couldn't find the Sperry Top-Sider in black.  Never thought I would find them on Amazon ... KUDOS TO AMAZON!!!I was unable to put how they fit yet as they were bought for his b/day & it isn't for a couple of weeks.  But thank you Amazon for the quick shipment!Will post a new review after he tries them on ... usually with Sperry's ... I order a size 12 and they fit perfect every time!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.26140863", "2": "0.15796858", "3": "0.25150916", "4": "0.2296423", "5": "0.09433056"}}
