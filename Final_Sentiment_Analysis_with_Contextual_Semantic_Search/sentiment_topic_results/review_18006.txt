{"text": "I wanted a watch that I could wear during the summer going hiking and kayaking and didn't want to wear any of my nicer watches.  This watch is lightweight and durable.  It hardly feels like it's there.  The water resistance seems to hold up.  I've taken it kayaking and although i take it off when i swim, it has gotten dunked and splashed with no moisture seeping under the crystal.  I like the color and design.  It has kind of a military look to it.  The watch battery is supposed to last ten years so I hope a replacement band is available as I'm sure the Velcro might wear out in the mean time.  I'm very happy with my purchase an affordable yet durable timepiece.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13053992", "1": "0.16515091", "2": "0.18657717", "3": "0.10380672", "4": "0.16192776", "5": "0.12396377", "6": "0.12803377"}}
