{"text": "First, I did not know that I was only going to get one pair for the price I paid. Either I missed where it said only 1 pair or it did not say that in the ad. Also way to expensive for a pair of socks. My feet sweat a lot so I wanted to try these out for the wicking properties they have and the great reviews. When I received these, at first glance they seemed very thick, almost like a winter sock. So I put them on and within an hour my feet were burning up. They have a lot of cushion on the bottom and it seems like only the top has the wicking material. I would think that the wicking material would be on the bottom, where I sweat the most. However, I am not a sock expert or a sock engineer. I do not speak for everyone, since everyone might have a different reaction to this product, but based on my fist time impressions I would not recommend this product if you have feet that sweat a lot and you don't want to break he bank shopping for socks.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.10839012", "2": "0.11959648", "3": "0.1926231", "4": "0.20630477", "5": "0.23043427", "6": "0.14004414"}}
