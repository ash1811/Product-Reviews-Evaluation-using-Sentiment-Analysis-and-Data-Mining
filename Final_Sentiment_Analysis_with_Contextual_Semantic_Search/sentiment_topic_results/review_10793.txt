{"text": "This is the second Geoffrey Beene wallet which I have purchased for my husband. The first one was more than five years old and was beginning to look `tired', especially after an unfortunate incident in the washer. I purchased the same model for my husband and he is immensely pleased with it. This wallet is small, but not so small that it is not able to fit dollar bills and credit cards. The clear plastic liner fits an ID card, and there are compartments for a couple of credit cards as well as dollar bills.I'd recommend these wallets to anyone looking for an affordable, soft and supple men's wallet.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.040990833", "1": "0.40165502", "2": "0.23226881", "3": "0.055620182", "4": "0.13940743", "6": "0.127489"}}
