{"text": "Not really a digital watch kinda guy but I had to pick up one of these little gems to keep. Retro style to some, just plain style if you ask me. The illuminator function works great, stopwatch great, loud alarm. Seems to keep time within 1 second per week. I set it a month ago and its 2 seconds off of the time.gov eastern time zone now. Not too shabby. I'm going to wear it to work for a few weeks (at a CNC Machine Shop) where it will be covered in metal chips, machine coolant, oil, grease, water, etc on a daily basis. If it manages to handle all of that this will be the perfect digital watch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1701375", "1": "0.19655846", "2": "0.12016983", "3": "0.10496068", "4": "0.12299587", "5": "0.08797555", "6": "0.19720216"}}
