{"text": "I need a comfortable shoe that I can put my 3/4 orthotic in. I wanted a clog with a &#34;lip&#34; in the back to hold it in place. I work at a preschool and am standing for several hours and wanted something that would work for me with my &#34;new&#34; lovely plantar fasciitis and heel spur. I am pain free in these shoes with my orthotic in them for the extra cushion and support. I bought a wide to accommodate  the extra room that the orthotic requires and its a perfect fit! I can easily walk and stand around in these all day.  I'm sold. I have 2 pairs of these and 2 pairs of the Travelwool now.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.055385184", "1": "0.27195784", "2": "0.18818912", "3": "0.15177135", "4": "0.19827312", "5": "0.06400258", "6": "0.07042083"}}
