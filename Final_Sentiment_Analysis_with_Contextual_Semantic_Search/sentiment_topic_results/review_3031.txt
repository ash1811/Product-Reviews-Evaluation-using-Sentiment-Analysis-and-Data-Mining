Wow, it definitely supports them, and they'd better not ask questions!!!I went around all day feeling like my boobs were 'out there', well-managed, and not going anyplace.It's not something I'd buy again - it's just a bit too uncomfortable - like they were stitched from the same material used to make backpacks, but the one I have will probably last a good while.2 stars because it is indeed well-constructed.
