{"text": "I have owned this belt for around 1 month.  It is an affordable, good quality, classic looking belt with no frills.After a month of occasional wear it appears that it will hold up for a long time.  As other reviewers have mentioned it can leave some brown stains on your pants.  I only noticed this on a pair of medium wash jeans.  For me it did come out with a wash.  I have worn with other pants including lighter color chinos and did not notice any staining.  It's possible this will only happen when it is brand new.Sizing seems correct.  I wear 35-36&#34; waist pants and the 38&#34; belt fit as expected.The end of the belt is completely square rather than rounded or pointed which isn't shown in the picture.  Just be aware if this matters to you.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16412453", "1": "0.27493635", "2": "0.16977383", "3": "0.096145436", "4": "0.09887138", "5": "0.08947372", "6": "0.1066747"}}
