{"text": "I think these socks are incredible, not just for tennis but for daily wear. The toe area and heel are thickly padded. The socks are well-made, high quality. Worth the money! Cheap socks are a misery. These are definitely worth the price. They're comfortable, they stay up... I have nothing negative to say about them. Highly recommended!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13309573", "1": "0.2069175", "2": "0.13437748", "3": "0.10832284", "4": "0.11138976", "5": "0.20927544", "6": "0.09662123"}}
