{"text": "This silver chain is excellent. It's a true snake chain and does not tangle (as snake chains shouldn't). It also has a nice quality \"loop\" clasp not those chinsy circular clasps. I got the 16\" chain to hold a small pendant I have. If you are unsure of what size to get the 16\" chain is very close to the neck. I got this specifically because it is a small pendant I was hanging from it and that was how it should hang. The standard chain length is 18\" and hangs right where a necklace should so if you are unsure of what size to get that's probably the one you want to go with. 20\" is a longer chain and isn't so common but is often used if one is wearing two necklaces and wants them to hang at different lengths so they are both visible. The silver seems to be of good quality and came shiny and polished. It hasn't tarnished much at all and cleans nicely with a cleaning cloth. I have had it for a while and don't wear it every day but so far there is no discoloration. IMPORTANT: this is a very thin chain. It says in the description and title 1mm but in case one wasn't really paying attention to that it is important to note that it is very thin. For me this worked great and it is a beautiful delicate chain but for someone looking for a thick chain this is not the one you want.Overall it's a great chain and the price is exactly where it should be.5/5 stars", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08189663", "1": "0.11032556", "2": "0.15917766", "3": "0.21573755", "4": "0.21892238", "5": "0.10189475", "6": "0.11204549"}}
