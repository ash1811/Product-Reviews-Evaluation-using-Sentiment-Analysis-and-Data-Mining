{"text": "I'm a dancer who has taken a few years off, and therefore I have nasty, ugly, temperamental, and out of shape dancer feet. I have just started doing Zumba to get back in shape, and I have tried a bunch of shoes in the few weeks I've been doing it. I tried:-my regular running shoes (too much traction = painful joints and they made me look even more ridiculous doing the moves since I kept sticking to the floor)jazz shoes (not enough cushion = VERY unhappy feet, but I looked much more fluid doing the moves)Reebok Dance UR Lead, (no support, pivot point was sticky and they fit weird... but they did look cool)And now the Bloch Women's Boost Dance Sneaker. I'm in love. I can't believe I've finally found shoes! These have the perfect amount of traction so you don't loose your feet, but they also have amazing turn-ability. Just enough cushion that your feet don't hurt, but not so much that you can't feel the floor. They feel very comfy right out of the box.Sizing: I am usually an 8.5 and I ordered the 9.5 and they are perfect. I have insanely high arches, and the split sole works wonderfully.oh and they don't look as dorky in person as they do in pictures... I promise.Hope this helps!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19698939", "1": "0.114265725", "2": "0.121593505", "3": "0.19485025", "4": "0.1721519", "5": "0.12028888", "6": "0.07986038"}}
