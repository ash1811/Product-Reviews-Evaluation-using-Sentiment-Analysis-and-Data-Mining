{"text": "I like the shoes but they sent me the wrong color (Kelly green instead of Charcoal) so I had to return them and order the correct color again which is a somewhat hassle.  Shoes runs a bit bigger but not too much; I had to tie the laces a little tighter.  They are good looking with reasonable comfort but not too much arch support. I guess you can say they are a fashion statement and good for short walks.  Overall, I like them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10521811", "1": "0.28662676", "2": "0.25003663", "3": "0.20644987", "4": "0.031995256", "6": "0.11626677"}}
