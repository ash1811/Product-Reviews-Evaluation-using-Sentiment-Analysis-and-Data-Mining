{"text": "I wear a size 9 and these fit but they were very tight. I would have done better in a 9 1/2. I used my shoe stretcher so I could wear them. They are so cute and I got lots of compliments but they are very uncomfortable. My poor feet hurt for 2 days after wearing them. I'm disappointed. Will try to sell to a smaller footed person:(", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.05991612", "1": "0.1998132", "2": "0.094605215", "3": "0.3935681", "4": "0.057778224", "5": "0.06619007", "6": "0.12812908"}}
