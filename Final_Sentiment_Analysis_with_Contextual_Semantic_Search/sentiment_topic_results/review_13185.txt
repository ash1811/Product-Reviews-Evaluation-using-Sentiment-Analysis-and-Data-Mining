{"text": "I really like the side buttons feature to help in removing a soaking wet diaper from a soaking wet baby. It's sized at 24 months and my 20 lbs. 1 yr. old is going to grow out of it definitely by the end of the summer so I'm not sure what's up with the sizes. She's chunky but not so much so that I have to size everything up for her. This is the 2nd Iplay diaper I purchase  - they ALL RUN SMALL!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.052480787", "1": "0.2386763", "2": "0.16822898", "3": "0.17914942", "4": "0.11043585", "5": "0.13488255", "6": "0.1161461"}}
