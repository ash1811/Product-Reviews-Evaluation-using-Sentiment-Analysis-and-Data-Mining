{"text": "I like the dress itself. I have got a plus size, and was highly disappointed. The open front tries to run back to my butt making a huge very ugly whole in the front. Yes, I have a big butt, but it's not AS big - size 16. And advertised PLUS size will, perhaps, only look good on 8-10 butt size. But PLUS means up to 1-3X! It will perhaps stretch on to a girl of 3x on the top, but the open front will look ugly. I am returning the item, cause for 17 dollars it's too bad-looking on big girls. Do not purchase plus size if you are more than size 12, it will not look good on you. Especially if you are also tall.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11940809", "1": "0.24745841", "3": "0.3399231", "4": "0.1209005", "5": "0.028087648", "6": "0.14194015"}}
