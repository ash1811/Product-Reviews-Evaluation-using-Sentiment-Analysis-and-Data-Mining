{"text": "I was having such a hard time finding shorts that were not plaid for my infant son.  I just wanted some simple cotton shorts for him to be comfy in, and these fit the bill.  They are soft cotton, and they run a little big.  The 0-3 month ones fit my son who is 2.5 months old and 13 pounds, even though he is wearing 3-6 mo in Cater's stuff.  They have good elastic in the waist, but they did fade a bit after the first wash.  But for the price, you can't beat it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.18089841", "1": "0.25865138", "2": "0.10993939", "3": "0.15839696", "4": "0.059971806", "5": "0.11940165", "6": "0.11274044"}}
