{"text": "I purchased these for a river clean-up, and they turned out to be MUCH larger than I expected. I ended up wearing two pairs of thick wool socks and they are still too big. The boots smell really bad out of the box with a strong rubbery smell, and they also feel somewhat greasy to the touch.That said, they did serve their purpose, protecting my feet and toes as I waded into the Los Angeles river (yes, it exists) to pick up trash. If purchasing, be prepared to size down significantly: I've worn size 7 men's shoes (I'm a Women's 9), but these almost seem 3 sizes too large.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15948519", "1": "0.22499625", "2": "0.10836658", "3": "0.20204028", "4": "0.07594582", "5": "0.07283546", "6": "0.15633042"}}
