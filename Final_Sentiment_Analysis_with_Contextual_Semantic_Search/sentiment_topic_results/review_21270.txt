{"text": "These have to be the most uncomfortable shoe ever. They are super cute but After 3 weeks of wearing them my feet and legs are killing me. I have rheumatoid arthritis and after wearing these shoes I thought the arthritis had spread to my feet and legs then I remembered I had new shoes. The inside insole/arch is extremely too high, I've been walking on the outsides of my feet since wearing these shoes. I do not recommend these shoes, unless you turn your feet inward when you walk, wearing these shoes will definitely keep you from doing that.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04309392", "1": "0.22417997", "2": "0.32549095", "3": "0.22063766", "4": "0.10951718", "5": "0.045083936", "6": "0.031996403"}}
