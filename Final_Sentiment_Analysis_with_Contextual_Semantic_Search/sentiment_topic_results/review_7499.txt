{"text": "My Wrangler denim jacket fits me comfortably well over my denim vest. It is roomy still.The jacket is sturdy and well made. I like it. It is a little shorter length wise on the torso than my Levis denim jacket.The front chest pockets are a little smaller than the Levis denim Jacket and denim vest pockets; but large enough to fit my sunglasses though I cant close the button closed on the pocket like I can with the Levis.This vest is comfortable and warm to wear.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.059824545", "1": "0.35577816", "2": "0.15597604", "3": "0.107783705", "4": "0.14717299", "6": "0.17070127"}}
