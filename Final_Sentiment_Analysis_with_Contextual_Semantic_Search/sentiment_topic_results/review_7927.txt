{"text": "I usually wear an 8.5 but I also often buy a size 9 in very high heels, so I got the 9. They're super cute! Good color, nice material, good heel.  My calves are on the smaller size and they fit perfectly, if you have large calves I don't think  they'd zip. My only issue with them is that the sole of the shoe is very thin and the toes are very pointed, which, in addition to the heel height, makes them uncomfortable to walk in and I don't think I'd want to be standing, walking or dancing in these for more than an hour.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3531332", "2": "0.026450198", "3": "0.33350042", "4": "0.07517593", "5": "0.10721148", "6": "0.101778105"}}
