{"text": "We travel often- 4-5 times per year, and this is a fantastic cover for our Britax Marathon Convertible Car seat.  My husband throws it on his back and away we go through the airport.  We've had ours for a year and travelled with it 5 times.  It still looks brand new and it has kept our car seat in great condition.  It is very thick and durable.  This is a must for anyone travelling with their car seat.  It really does protect it and make travelling much easier.  And for the price??  You can't beat it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14769131", "1": "0.2001646", "2": "0.15684415", "3": "0.175191", "4": "0.1298161", "5": "0.11792953", "6": "0.07236332"}}
