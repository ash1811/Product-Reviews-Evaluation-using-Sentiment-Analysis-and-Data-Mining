{"text": "I bought this as a dress, church, or interview shoe. It is one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I've tried. (I have purchased many Rockports and several SAS's in the past). I've worn them about 50 times since I've bought them and they've never disappointed me. It has a matte glossy finish. Even after a year, the shoes look great and I haven't had to polish them yet. Even though my pair feels about a half-size too big, I don't mind at all as it is still VERY comfortable. I will likely buy another pair, but will try it a half size smaller.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03242412", "1": "0.27733457", "2": "0.10768931", "3": "0.30072114", "4": "0.17210968", "5": "0.03599552", "6": "0.07372568"}}
