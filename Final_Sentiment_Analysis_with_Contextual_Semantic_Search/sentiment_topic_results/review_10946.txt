{"text": "I used to buy Duragold years ago, and was surprised and pleased to see it available here. I bought both the 4 mm and the 5 mm yellow gold ball studs. Please note the posts are shorter than normal, which I love because I can sleep in them without them poking the back of my head. The butterfly clasp is small, so I replaced them with a locking type of clasp from a different pair of earrings. I have worn the 4 mm ones in my second hole continuously for well over a month with no problem. One thing great about Duragold is that they're hypoallergenic, which is important for those who can have reactions to different alloys in gold. I really like this brand.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.27160278", "1": "0.23069336", "2": "0.10014853", "3": "0.06560696", "4": "0.18760742", "5": "0.046434678", "6": "0.0979063"}}
