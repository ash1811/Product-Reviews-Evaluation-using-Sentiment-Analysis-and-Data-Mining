{"text": "Not sure why more people don't talk about this knife. It's a chronograph with a little screen for stop watch, date, or another time. Plus an alarm clock. The dial is a good size. Easily visible. The casing is bright and attractive but not flashy. The rubber straps are thick and wide making it tough and making it look tough. Doesn't get 5 stars because the North / South dial does not sit right on too of 12, and the glow in the dark is a little too green for me. You can see it during the day and a night it's very bright. Wish it was a little more subtle.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03595193", "1": "0.2263267", "2": "0.16580607", "3": "0.15192123", "4": "0.13948666", "6": "0.2779018"}}
