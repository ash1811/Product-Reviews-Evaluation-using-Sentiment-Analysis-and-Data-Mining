{"text": "In 2005 I purchased Keens H2 sandals, and later the Kenn Targhee II tennis shoe, and they were worth every penny for my bad feet.  I was confident that this shoe would be another winner when I saw it - and I was right. It has the same comfortable footbed as the other shoes, the sole surface was more tame than the Targhee since this is street model and not a hiking model. It looks good around town, is comfortable, with great arch support. Has the Keen toe bumper, which I like. The shoe is good looking in person, and does not have an odor or get sweaty inside like some tennis shoes. The exterior finish has held up the past year like new, I bought the black pair. On sizing, I recommend buying one full size larger than usual; all models of Keens seem to be undersized. They have kept my feet dry in the rain, but I have not submerged them either.  The lacing system is secure for street wear and around town, but I do not recommend these as hikers. Overall a great shoe for around town.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.025312375", "1": "0.27525496", "2": "0.28451455", "3": "0.11913004", "5": "0.16783552", "6": "0.12563938"}}
