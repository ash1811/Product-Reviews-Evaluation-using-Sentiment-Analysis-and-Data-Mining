{"text": "As the title says, this is my fourth pair since the lucky day when I found Reef sandals. These sandals are the most comfortable I've ever worn and I don't plan to change. I use them all year round, reason why I'm on my fourth pair. Each pair has lasted me over 2 years of constant wear at the beach,  street, etc.I got a pair of 9 M US. This size measures 11 inches in length and just a bit under 4 inches in width, measured at the arch, so I suggest you pick the right size depending on the size of your feet. I normally wear 9's and they fit just right, if I'm able to find them, I prefer 9.5.Size 10 leave too much room at the heel.This model, The Fanning, is the one everybody knows, it still has the metal bottle opener on the sole and the air cushions at the heel. If you are new to this brand and are still thinking about it, buy them already, I assure you, Reef will be \"the brand\" you'll be wearing from now on. These are made in China (what isn't nowadays), but they are high quality, very well built and last forever. I still haven't thrown my old pair out, just like another reviewer here, I keep the old pair for when I work on my yard. Great sandals.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.102092534", "1": "0.14989515", "2": "0.06596082", "3": "0.40783727", "4": "0.091186434", "5": "0.08029951", "6": "0.102728255"}}
