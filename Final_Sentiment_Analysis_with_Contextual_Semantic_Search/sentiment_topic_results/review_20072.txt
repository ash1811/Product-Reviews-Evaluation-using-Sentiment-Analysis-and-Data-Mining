{"text": "I bought this pack from Amazon mid Feb this year, used it moderately for about 3 months, and the seam split on the right side of the second pocket 2 weeks ago and the zipper broke today on the back large pocket (the zipper has come undone on both sides and wont correct itself).  Also, even when the zippers do work, they tend to unzip while walking without you knowing until you hear something fall out of it behind you.  I don't recommend this pack.  Spend a little more and get something well made.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12198599", "1": "0.41242966", "2": "0.14677049", "3": "0.081992686", "4": "0.12405197", "6": "0.110209525"}}
