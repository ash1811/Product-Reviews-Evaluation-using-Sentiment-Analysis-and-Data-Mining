{"text": "This is the only type of watch my husband likes - the Casio G-shock. He's a machinist and works with his hands a lot, often gets banged up getting into and under machines. He also goes fishing in the ocean (actually goes into the ocean, up to his hips, surf casting) and the watch gets wet and sandy. He only replaces them when the band breaks, but the watch is still good. This is the third one he's had in 20 years. I'd say that's not bad considering the price. Sadly we can never find a band to match so we just buy a new watch each time.PS) He doesn't have the best eyes but he can see the time just fine in daylight or in the dark (back lit). And he finds the alarm easy to program, loud enough to wake him.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18508321", "1": "0.1620647", "2": "0.19514887", "3": "0.18794386", "4": "0.12949255", "5": "0.054700725", "6": "0.08556607"}}
