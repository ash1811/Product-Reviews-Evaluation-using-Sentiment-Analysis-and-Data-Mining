{"text": "This bracelet came today, and it's very pretty.  Feels sturdy and well-made.  I'm considering buying a few more as gifts.  I didn't know this before purchasing, but the bracelet has two clear \"bands\" on it that hold the guides in place.  You can set them wherever you want so the strap part doesn't come out from under the guides and flap around on you.  Even better, Sabrina Silver got the bracelet to me very quickly--I ordered on Friday, and received it on Monday.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.27811563", "1": "0.2589477", "2": "0.14686896", "3": "0.11132223", "4": "0.04419712", "6": "0.15712292"}}
