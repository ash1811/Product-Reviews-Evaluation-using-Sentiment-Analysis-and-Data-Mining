{"text": "Our son has a large head (12 months, 85% percentile head circumference) and this fits him just fine.  The chin strap keeps it on his head when the wind blows at the beach.  Most importantly it really protects his face, ears, and neck from the sun.  He doesn't seem to mind wearing it either which is a plus.
