{"text": "I love these glasses.  I have never spent more than $30 on sunglasses and I now regret all those flimsy, throwaway purchases!  These are wonderfully balanced.  The glass gives them nice heft while the sturdy frames provide solid support comfortably.  The honey shade is both attractive and soothing on sunny days.  Awesome colors for a redhead. :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07333304", "1": "0.156538", "2": "0.110045664", "3": "0.09927204", "4": "0.21489228", "5": "0.25196278", "6": "0.093956225"}}
