{"text": "These are nice-looking shoes.  I got the 8 C/D.  I couldn't quite say that it fit a bit large, but it is a little roomy in the heel area.  The rest is all perfect.  I was nervous about buying shoes online, so I'm pretty relieved.  As another reviewer said, these are not made for hard-core walkers, just everyday here and there walking.  They're very light-weight, and the heel isn't real high.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.26522344", "2": "0.08219443", "3": "0.1032193", "4": "0.10551942", "5": "0.23444812", "6": "0.20552695"}}
