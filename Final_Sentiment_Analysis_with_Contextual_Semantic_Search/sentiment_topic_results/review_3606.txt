{"text": "I am sooooo disappointed with this bra!  I have never purchased a bra online and my first experience was this..  The underwires are digging into my armpits and the middle front of the bra is digging into my chest.  The cups are about the right size, except for the fact that THERE IS NO PADDING IN THE CUPS!!!!!  I cannot wear a bra with no padding, for obvious reasons once I put a shirt on..  I hate being that way but that's the way I am.  The straps are the only thing I like about this bra.  $30 later and I still have nothing.  What a joke.  I am just not happy at all.  Very sad but I literally have nothing else to wear so it's not like I can return it.  Oh well.  Guess this will be my last resort bra once I find some that fit.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.23978408", "2": "0.07597648", "3": "0.32138005", "4": "0.120482974", "5": "0.20201337", "6": "0.03764151"}}
