{"text": "I received this today and I am impressed with the almost everything about this watch.  It is very classic in its style and easy to read except the date that is a little small for me.  The band is comfortable and just the right size for my average size wrist.  I you have a large wrist you will likely find the band short.  The band is surprisingly stiff and is not simply a canvas band, it is more substantial.  The operation of the chronograph is very straightforward and the date has a quick set function.  One interesting feature is there is a 24 hour time indicator in the upper right (2 o'clock position).  The watch feels solid and neither too light or too heavy.  I enjoy watches and have collected a number over the past 25 years but think this could be my everyday watch for a while.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14329726", "1": "0.18161061", "2": "0.16577534", "3": "0.09172676", "4": "0.2702371", "5": "0.057603847", "6": "0.0897491"}}
