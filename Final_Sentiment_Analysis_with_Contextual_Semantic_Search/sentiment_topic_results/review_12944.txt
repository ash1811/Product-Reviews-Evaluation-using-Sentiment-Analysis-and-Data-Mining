{"text": "I purchased these because I've had 4 hip surgeries & 4 spinal fusions.  Very difficult for me to get down there to get my socks & shoe's on.  These Skecher's save me pain & time getting ready.  They do run small, so order a size up.  Also be very careful if you have weak ankles & don't walk over big rocks in them.  You will twist you'r ankle.  Otherwise, I Luv these shoe's, this IS my second pair!
