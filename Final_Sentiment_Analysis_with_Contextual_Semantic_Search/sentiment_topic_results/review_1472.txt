{"text": "I always buy JanSport bags for my children because they are durable & long lasting. We needed a solid color backpack as part of  school requirements, this was the best we could find. It is a good size and a nice color. Lots of compartments for school items and books. Definitely would buy again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.044264384", "1": "0.41109955", "2": "0.19206084", "3": "0.15302742", "4": "0.14687994", "6": "0.048189316"}}
