{"text": "I have used Thorlo socks for over 20 years - love them. I remember an add back in the late 80's or early 90's that showed a guy in a triathlon that couldn't find his running shoes for the 10K portion of the race. He just ran in his Thorlos. At the end of the race, the socks were still intact (no holes). I wear them all the time. Used to run a lot but can't now so have taken up hiking (we live right at the base of a sig mountain). Got these socks for our hiking. They certainly live up to what I have come to expect of Thorlos. Highly recommend!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.27834603", "1": "0.07837152", "2": "0.17485473", "3": "0.1379189", "4": "0.12974496", "5": "0.17142849", "6": "0.029335327"}}
