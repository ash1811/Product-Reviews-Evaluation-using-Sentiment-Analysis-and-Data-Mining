{"text": "I ordered maroon and was surprised at how brown it actually was. I held it up to a pair of brown pants and it basically matched. It was not a wrong product because they do not offer brown. Other than my complaint about the color, it feels like a pretty nice belt. Seems strong so far and quite durable. Good belt good price, expect a darker color.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09572555", "1": "0.48256546", "2": "0.13406184", "3": "0.121483885", "5": "0.107561", "6": "0.054598242"}}
