{"text": "The first question was which computers to install this program - Rosetta Stone has a two seat minimum. I ended up putting the 2nd installation on a laptop, expecting to use the program in other locations.  However, Rosetta Stone's immersion method feels too intensive to me for use in most places away from home.  Installation was easy enough even though the program got stuck a couple of times along the way. The gear, headset with microphone, is sufficient.Pros:* For total immersion-type instruction without the benefit of communicating with other people, this seemed very good.* The voice recognition software is impressive. I was able to immediately begin speaking and progressed to the second level of difficulty fairly quickly. There are plenty of exercises and repetition, and this will surely help in many ways including pronunciation.* There are learning sessions in this software to allow speaking with native French speakers.*For me as an individual, this is a better way to learn than a formal classroom.Cons:* The limitation in the number of seats (2). This wasn't a problem for me yet it's something to know about.* Lack of matching supplemental physical material such as index cards with conjugations and grammatical rules. I feel the need for this and can source it out separately, but again I prefer to learn outside a formal classroom.* Lack of simple visuals to help with identifying grammatical patterns.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07177536", "1": "0.39278543", "2": "0.13799903", "3": "0.06756998", "4": "0.16545698", "5": "0.059602704", "6": "0.104810536"}}
