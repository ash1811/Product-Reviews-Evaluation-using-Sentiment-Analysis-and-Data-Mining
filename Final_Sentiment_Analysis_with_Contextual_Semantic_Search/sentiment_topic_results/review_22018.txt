{"text": "I ordered size 8 Frye Veronica Slouch black tumbled full grain. The color was at a discounted price. Perhaps it's not a big seller because the hardware is more of a brushed brassy color and not silver. I got a steal at one hundred forty six dollars!! Way less expensive than my niece who works at a high end store and gets discounts on top of discounts!! I tried my size on first at a store and I knew size 8 would be more roomy than my usual size 8 boots but that is ok because I'd rather have more room than not. I do notice some slippage in the back of my heel when I walk but I'm sure this can easily be fixed with a heel insert or foot bed. They are completely comfortable!!! I find some boots tend to be more snug in the width but not these they fit perfect! I do have wiggle room for the top of my toes but nothing that is overly sloppy that I would say these boots are way too big. I've read reviews of some saying to size up, some saying to size down-- My recommendation is to stay true to your size. As for the slouch. I have no problems  with mine. They are a little &#34;crumbly&#34; if you will near the top instead of starchy stand tall but they do not slouch and fall like a loose sock or anything. Hardly even notice the slouch in my opinion. The leather is soft! and that is why you get a small amount of slouch instead of buying a hard stiff leather boot. The &#34;tumbled&#34; appearance in the leather is a nice effect so don't expect a smooth shiny black boot, but slightly pebbled grainy like a purse with texture. I'm super satisfied. I'm hoping with proper care these boots last a long time!! Also to mention as others have said-Yes you do have to put a little &#34;oompf&#34; in getting your ankle/foot into the boot. I did not have to loosen the bottom buckle at all, it's just stiff and rigid on the ankle shoe bed unlike the softness of the shaft. Not that big of a deal but don't expect them to slide on like a slipper!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.049298517", "1": "0.37959987", "2": "0.051035557", "3": "0.15551089", "4": "0.08780438", "5": "0.07962421", "6": "0.19712655"}}
