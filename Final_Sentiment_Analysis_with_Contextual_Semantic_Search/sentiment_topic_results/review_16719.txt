{"text": "These pants are very soft, due to being stone washed before they sell them.  They fit very well and the color is a nice brown color.The material seems to be real sturdy and would be great for hiking around or wearing around town.  The stitching seems to be very good and doesn't look like it will fall apart.It has ties down at the bottom of the pants legs like old school BDUs...I cut them off.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.042381886", "1": "0.6498788", "2": "0.07300603", "5": "0.14484838", "6": "0.08303924"}}
