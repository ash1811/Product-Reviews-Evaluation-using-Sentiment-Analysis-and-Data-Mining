{"text": "I bought these shoes because my friend has been wearing this same style for hiking for over 15 years and said how comfortable they are.  I agree that the heavy sole seems to cushion the foot and provide more protection.  I love the slip on style rather than dealing with ties.  I like the toe protection, especially when hiking around rocks.  The material is a stylish swede and I love this particular color.  They are very comfortable for hiking.  The only criticism I have is that there is no breathability for the foot, but since it is not too heavy a shoe, I think it will be ok.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15935309", "1": "0.26995915", "2": "0.19028418", "4": "0.12508094", "5": "0.17595859", "6": "0.07643278"}}
