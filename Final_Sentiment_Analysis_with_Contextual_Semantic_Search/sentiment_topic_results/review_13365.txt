{"text": "This is the second 'Orange Monster' I have owned.  Last one was about 10 years ago.  Overall a watch I like very much.  Heavy and durable.  The lume is very bright and will stay that way for quite a while without further exposure to a light source.This model uses the Seiko 7S26 automatic movement.  It does not hack, nor can it be wound manually, only via wrist movement.  For those who desire the hack or wind function, take a look at the second generation Monsters.  They use the Seiko 4R36 movement and have that capability.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1768592", "1": "0.13013291", "2": "0.08584224", "3": "0.29549554", "4": "0.09554815", "5": "0.04406526", "6": "0.17205672"}}
