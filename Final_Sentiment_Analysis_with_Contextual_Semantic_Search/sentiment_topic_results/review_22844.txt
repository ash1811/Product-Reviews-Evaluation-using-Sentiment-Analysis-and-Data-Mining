{"text": "This dress was of decent (not great) quality - enough that it could be used more than just one night on halloween.  The material is thin but sturdy enough.  The collar is separate, padded, and attaches easily with velcro.  It was also roomy enough to be worn over thermals for colder halloween nights.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.3387941", "2": "0.05156956", "4": "0.38125363", "6": "0.21407479"}}
