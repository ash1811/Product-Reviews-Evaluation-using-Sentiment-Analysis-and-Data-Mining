{"text": "This hat is good for keeping the sun out of your face and off your neck, but has a few drawbacks. First, I should mention that the cord is very handy to keep the hat in place when there is a breeze or heavy winds. However, this hat is very hot and although there is a breathable mesh on either side, it doesn't really breath at all. Also, the rim is made from cardboard that is easily damaged if you're not careful. Within a few weeks of owning this hat, mine had several ugly creases in the rim that cannot be fixed.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.029539628", "1": "0.120784596", "2": "0.15338992", "3": "0.36832538", "4": "0.19494723", "6": "0.12996776"}}
