{"text": "For a \"comfort\" bra this was very uncomfortable!  I usually wear a 36 to 38D but this one in 38D was very tight around the band and also itchy.  This was even on the last hook.  I don't usually wear Playtex so maybe the sizing is different -so it's back to Victoria's Secret for me.  I was really hoping for a comfortable and supportive bra that didn't add anything - not so easy to find.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.26199564", "2": "0.09510585", "3": "0.1666024", "4": "0.053999733", "5": "0.27986056", "6": "0.1386564"}}
