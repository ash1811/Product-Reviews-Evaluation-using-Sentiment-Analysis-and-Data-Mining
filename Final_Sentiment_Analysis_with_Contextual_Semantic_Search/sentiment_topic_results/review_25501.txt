{"text": "The first thing that gave me a red flag on this item was that the directions and warnings were not translated correctly. Actually, it was so bad I could see a possible law suit, but will leave that alone.Second, the packaging had more of a feel of something you would get at a \"porn\" shop and not something actually packaged for women.Third, they were wrapped in a plastic covering which was almost impossible to get off.And last, I am a 36D and like to wear thin, cotton bras and even though I  have small nipples I always seem to have \"my headlights on\". So I really wanted something so I would not always be giving a \"free show\". The petals did attach and stick properly, but even through my bra if I \"got cold\" I could still see the high beams. I am happy I didn't spend much on these. Very unhappy with them. My friend told me to try the ones they sell at Victoria's Secret, which I will.Would give zero stars if I could.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07510913", "1": "0.2450264", "2": "0.08485262", "3": "0.13275795", "4": "0.19257402", "5": "0.15714978", "6": "0.11253012"}}
