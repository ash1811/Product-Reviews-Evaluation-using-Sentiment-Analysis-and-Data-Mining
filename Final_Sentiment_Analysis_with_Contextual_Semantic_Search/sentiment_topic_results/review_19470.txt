{"text": "AMAZON has the wrong shoe photo on the description-that shoe is the Penny loves Kenny shoe(or something like that).The real shoe is classy and good looking. I bought black and antique (red) in size 12. They look great!However, I have trouble keeping them on my feet when taking the stairs. They have slipped right off my foot and then I step on the back ridge of the shoe and it really hurts me.I have hyper-sensitive feet and ANYTHING that I \"step\" on feels like sharp rocks-so when the shoe falls off and I step on the shoes ridgid back-I cringe in pain. I am glad no one saw me-You'd think I had been stabbed or something.I decided to take the long way and use the elevator so this would not happen again...while in the elevator several women commented on how comfortable and nice they looked.I just said Thank You...rather than tell them the real truth about how NOT comfortable they had been.They are okay for comfort unless of course they slip off foot.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.056884233", "1": "0.17130567", "2": "0.40663874", "3": "0.09186474", "4": "0.093738355", "5": "0.13217133", "6": "0.04739692"}}
