{"text": "I wear slippers around the house all year long so wanted these for the summer months.  I purchased a pair of Acorn slippers at Costco for almost half of what these cost.  They fit perfectly and are so comfortable.  I really wanted a pair in black because they do get dirty fast so purchased the black online.  They aren't the same slippers.  Apparently I'm under the impression that Costco is selling a less expensive version as the soles are made differently but are made just as well.  The top strap on these are heavily stitched around the front and they tend to dig into your skin.  They are quite uncomfortable.  I will wear them again but for now they are sitting in my closet.  I did go back to Costco and they still had their version of this thong so purchased another pair in pink.. perfect.  I wish Acorn would get it together and not sell one version at a cheaper price and then sell another version online for more money.  They aren't the same slippers.  Please offer both alternatives Acorn!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05455774", "1": "0.35822076", "2": "0.21564387", "3": "0.18564202", "5": "0.09246098", "6": "0.09096282"}}
