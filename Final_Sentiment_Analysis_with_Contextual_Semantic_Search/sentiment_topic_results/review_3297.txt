{"text": "Love Levi's jeans and the 550 fits me the best. The pants I bought are black with a black leather label with silver letters. The small Levi's tag is red. Not faded, not washed, the jeans have a new look but are not stiff. The thing that pleases me the most is buying them from Amazon. I take a popular size and when I go to the department store my size is more often than not &#34;sold out&#34;. How nice it is to not only have my size but also a choice of colors!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.0436884", "1": "0.30458695", "2": "0.068129785", "3": "0.29839304", "4": "0.08439259", "5": "0.06198973", "6": "0.13881946"}}
