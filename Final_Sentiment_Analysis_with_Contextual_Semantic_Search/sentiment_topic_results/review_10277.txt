{"text": "color in ad is accurate.  nice quality bandana.  I don't use for head wrap, i drape over small lamp to moderate the brightness at night, works well for this purpose and is a good size (22 by 22) unlike many bandanas which are more hankerchief sized.  Watch for dimensions when you order this type of product.  Arrived very quickly.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11534059", "1": "0.22787654", "2": "0.2695395", "3": "0.19308953", "4": "0.059268966", "5": "0.10396595", "6": "0.030918906"}}
