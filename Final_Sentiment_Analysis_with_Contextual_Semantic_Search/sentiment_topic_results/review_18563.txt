{"text": "I work as an engineer for a general contractor in California and duck Carhartt's are too hot, so I wanted something lighter but still as durable. They're definitely lighter - the canvas breathes much easier and I can wear them in 90+ weather without dying, but the sacrifice for durability is awful. I've had them for ~2 months and I've already torn one pocket completely off, have holes in the knees and the crotch seam is starting to wear. The thin fabric also means you can feel everything - kneeling on anything is painful. Definitely will not be buying these again, I can't afford to replace them every few months. I'm honestly extremely disappointed because this is the first time a Carhartt product has let me down.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08669533", "1": "0.17485778", "2": "0.16825488", "3": "0.21678717", "4": "0.10128585", "5": "0.12271821", "6": "0.12940075"}}
