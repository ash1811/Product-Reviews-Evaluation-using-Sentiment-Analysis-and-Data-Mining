{"text": "I admit it. I'm a watch addict. Nothing as fancy as an Horologist, I just like watches, and when I see one I like, I buy it (as long as the Wife Acceptance Factor, or WAF, is present).This tool makes it simple to remove links in bracelet type bands for sizing purposes. Out of the box or due to weight loss/gain, they never fit quite right. Jewelers and watch repair shops charge more than this unit costs just to remove a link one time! Last time I paid, it was eighteen bucks!!!It did not come with instructions, but previous reviewers had noted that, and five minutes on the internet was all it took to find them. (Paylak.com and then click on... drum roll here... \"How to size a watch bracelet\"). It's a VERY simple operation, which is good, because I'm very simple myself...I could also wish that it came with a case of some sort, maybe even with storage for all those links I've removed, but in general it is as advertised, does what it's supposed to, easy to use and seems well constructed and durable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.26943332", "2": "0.17383206", "3": "0.0739839", "4": "0.2838338", "5": "0.111649126", "6": "0.08522201"}}
