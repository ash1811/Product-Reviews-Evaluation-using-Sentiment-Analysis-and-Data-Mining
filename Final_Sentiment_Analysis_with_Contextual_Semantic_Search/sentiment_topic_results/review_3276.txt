{"text": "I work as a skilled craftsman, and I've gone through a number of jeans recently, and these have proven to be the best all around for looks, fit, comfort and work capability.They are baggy enough to be comfortable in the seat and thighs, and don't ride down on the belt when you sit. The material is very soft, and not very thick or stiff. These sit at the waist and have a tapered leg.I've been on a mission to find good looking jeans for a guy who works with his hands for a living, but doesn't want something that looks too stiff or ugly. Fashion jeans that sit low, and tight like the Levi's 514 may be currently stylish, but they compact vital man parts when you sit, and expose plumber crack when you are in any position other than standing. I noticed this especially when driving or working on something in the garage. Further, low cut jeans make people with stumpy legs look even shorter. On the other hand, spacious Work jeans are nice and heavy, but make your posterior look like you've got a sack of idaho potatos tucked in there. These bridge the gap between form and function.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.24389286", "2": "0.0725763", "3": "0.36666733", "4": "0.098983586", "5": "0.056193978", "6": "0.1592158"}}
