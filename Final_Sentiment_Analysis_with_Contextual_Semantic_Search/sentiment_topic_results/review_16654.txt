{"text": "This is one of the nicer looking G-Shocks I have seen. I have 3 G-Shocks of different style and wanted one that was a bit more stylish that I could wear in more formal situations but was still easily identifiable as a G-Shock. I also wanted one that was a bit smaller that I can wear with my Motorcycle jackets tight fitting sleeves and gauntlet gloves. This watch fits the bill perfectly. It looks great and fits just right with my motorcycle gear.I gave it 4 stars because the LCD display for the seconds is way too small and virtually useless and the band is one of the stiffer plastics that is not quite as comfortable as my other G-Shocks.The functions are great, I use 3 of the alarms daily to assist me to take my meds, I am a diabetic. I use the count down timer allot too for cooking and timing the watering of my plants and lawn.As a G-Shock watch, I expect it to last a very long time. One of mine is 12 years old and going strong. I wear them hard. Using power tools, off-road and street motorcycle riding, snow and water skiing etc.If you are looking for a nice looking, smaller, analog digital and obviously G-Shock watch, this is a great one", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12491516", "1": "0.31766957", "2": "0.221126", "3": "0.05518052", "4": "0.22412401", "5": "0.03243902", "6": "0.024545688"}}
