{"text": "Lovely--dress them up or down/ light weight/ lever backs!  Have worn these with jeans and a dress to a wedding.  The simple turquoise balls mean they can dress up jeans--and the crystal elements mean you can wear them with dresses.  Great colors!  The addition of black crystals adds.  Finally, lever back earrings are great for security--lose them less often!  Great earrings.  Lightweight despite all the stuff added on.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10209708", "1": "0.20380446", "2": "0.061025415", "3": "0.093972474", "4": "0.14163563", "5": "0.18217355", "6": "0.21529143"}}
