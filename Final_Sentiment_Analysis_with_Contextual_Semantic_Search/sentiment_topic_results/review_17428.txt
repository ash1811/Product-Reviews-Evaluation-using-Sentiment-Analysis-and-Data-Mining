{"text": "I bought this sweatshirt from the merchant The Deal Rack. The shipping was so fast that I was caught off guard when it arrived. It was almost like I bought it in the store and had it home the same day. They deserve credit for their fast as lightning shipping. As far as the quality of the sweatshirt, you cant go wrong with this item. I have bought a few in the past both in Oxford Grey and Black for work. They hold up really really well and fit perfectly. Every time! Thats why I came back looking for more. And I am grateful that they still make this style and its available. If your looking for a warm easy to wear long lasting sweatshirt, you cant go wrong with this style........and the merchant either!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1673224", "1": "0.3894307", "2": "0.10540133", "3": "0.19229962", "5": "0.11036448", "6": "0.03261887"}}
