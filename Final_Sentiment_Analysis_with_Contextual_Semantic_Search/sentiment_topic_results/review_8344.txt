{"text": "After reading the reviews on these shoes, I bought a half size larger than I normally wear. I was really surprised that even with the larger size, I couldn't even get my foot in them. They are being returned and it's going to cost me an additional $6 because I am having the package picked up at my house. I'm disabled and don't have any other choice of how to get them back to Amazon. I can't imagine why a manufacturer would produce a shoe and keep it on the market knowing it has a size issue. I hope Amazon will remove this product, since so many people have had the same issue.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04018748", "1": "0.1552189", "2": "0.18048634", "3": "0.2808252", "4": "0.15798184", "5": "0.18252301"}}
