{"text": "I have now been wearing this daily for about 2+ years. Accuracy has been near perfect with very few periodic time adjustments.  There have been no service outages and only 1 complete battery drain event - my fault. The watch recharges quickly and runs for days without light. Sunlight charges the watch much faster than incandescent, in my opinion - no surprises there.  The strap has been durable and very comfortable. Given a couple more years of use, the strap will likely need to be replaced. The fit of the watch on my wrist is perfect and the dial/hands is easy to read, even in the dark.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14975525", "1": "0.26589325", "2": "0.16072653", "3": "0.1272577", "4": "0.12915742", "5": "0.07153229", "6": "0.0956776"}}
