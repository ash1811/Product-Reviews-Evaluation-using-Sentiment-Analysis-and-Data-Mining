{"text": "About the Size:I saw some reviews saying that these boots are a little larger than it should be, so I ordered a size 6, while I wear 6.5 to 7 normally. The size 6 is just as big as my feet, but when I walk in it, it feels small. So I returned the size 6 and got a pair in 7. It is perfectly fit for my feet, and I feel very comfortable when I walk. Different people has different shape of feet, my feet are long and narrow, so I would feel tight in size 6 and I feel size 7 is perfect for my feet.Quality:The boots are soooo warm that I feel so good, the fur covered every where inside of the boots, but my feet did not sweat at all.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06880456", "1": "0.43626097", "4": "0.18860167", "5": "0.066424385", "6": "0.2352091"}}
