{"text": "This is certainly the Lord of the Rings. It is simply indestructible. After months of wear, I didn't have one scratch on it. Many people noticed it because it retains its sheen for that reason. They often mistake it for platinum.I have had to revert back to wearing my original wedding ring which is made from Titanium. It is full of scratches, but very light. In fact almost unnoticeable in weight.This ring is heavy, but it is not its weight that makes it uncomfortable. It's the fact that it is so rigid. Tungsten is amongst the hardest metals in the universe. Combined with Carbon it becomes SUPER stiff. It is so rigid, it eventually dug into my fingers after months of wear even though it is a Comfort Curve designIt became so uncomfortable I couldn't wear it after 6-months, which is a real shame. In hindsight I wish I had bought a half size larger.I don't blame the ring. It is perfect sizing and hence fit. But I wish the manufacturer warned about the rigidity and recommended ordering a half size larger. Hence, the 3-stars.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.23765165", "1": "0.2176155", "2": "0.15490209", "3": "0.12726575", "4": "0.17840852", "6": "0.081644446"}}
