{"text": "The marketing for this watch indicates &#34;quick charge, high visibility&#34; for the glow on the luminous hands and indices.Only the hands glow at a visible strength for more than a few seconds - in fact it lasts several minutes, but the REST of the indices, numerals etc. do not and are only visible even in total darkness for maybe 60 seconds.I recently learned that the only &#34;glowing&#34; type of watches that have strong and long-lasting visible glow are ones that use &#34;Tritium tubes&#34; for their glow illumination.The watch itself is nice enough and has a good look, but it's not the MIL-SPEC watch Wengers' marketing materials make it out to be.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06486541", "1": "0.14205144", "2": "0.10302407", "3": "0.15756391", "4": "0.25169826", "6": "0.2783665"}}
