{"text": "I think this is a nice watch for the money.  Its a little smaller than I thought it would be but not a deal breaker.  I work in retail so I've broken a few watches on the corners of shelves or lifting things so I now know better than to wear anything too nice to work and this fits the bill.

As others have indicated it does tick loudly but I don't sleep with it so a non-issue for me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.16025546", "2": "0.17679732", "3": "0.34702393", "4": "0.0931034", "5": "0.21682656"}}
