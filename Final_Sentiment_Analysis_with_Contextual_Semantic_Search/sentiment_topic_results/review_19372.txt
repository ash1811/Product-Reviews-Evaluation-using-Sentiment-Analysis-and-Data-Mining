{"text": "Just got these and tried them on.  The color is lovely, the workmanship is fine, however, I walk right out of them, cannot even take a step without them coming off.  I tried an insert, no help, socks, no help.  They are made to be pretty wide and something about the design makes them not adhere to the foot in such a way that they don't slip.  BTW, the size was correct, I couldn't have taken a smaller size as it would have been too short.  So, sadly am returning them.  As a reference, for me the Classic Birki's clogs fit fine and last forever, so am getting a pair of them in exchange for these.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15139472", "1": "0.26914808", "2": "0.14855814", "3": "0.20845127", "4": "0.08358372", "6": "0.13638286"}}
