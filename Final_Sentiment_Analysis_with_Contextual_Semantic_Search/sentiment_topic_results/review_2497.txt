{"text": "I have now tried several models or styles of Dickies Men's Pants. I must say I have been very pleasantly surprised every time! First, the price is definitely right. Check to see the seller and shipper every time you look up a style and size as they may change. Although 4 of the 5 orders I placed were sold and shipped by Amazon, one was sold and shipped by Elite Hero, a Market Place vendor. In this case all worked out very well as I had no problems whatsoever with any shipment or product and in the case of Elite Hero they proactively followed up to be sure all was well with my order which was the case. I like these jeans because they are not &#34;baggy&#34; yet they are soft and comfortable to wear and feel. I would say they are roomy for their size. They do not feel like a real stiff canvass type material as some jeans do. These jeans and all Dickies products look, feel and wear as though they are well made and made to last. I will buy more for myself and as gifts for others and appreciate that Dickies is proving an excellent product can be made without sticker shock.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.05458965", "1": "0.13571462", "2": "0.21073487", "3": "0.11618782", "4": "0.08466802", "5": "0.32262385", "6": "0.07548113"}}
