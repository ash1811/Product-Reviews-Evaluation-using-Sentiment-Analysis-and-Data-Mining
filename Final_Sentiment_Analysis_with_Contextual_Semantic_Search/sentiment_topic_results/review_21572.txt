{"text": "This makes your earrings neat and organized, and it shows them off well.  Some earrings won't fit on it because earrings come in all shapes and sizes, but this works for many.  You can't put pairs of different earrings side by side or else it is super cramped and you can't display them as well, but I wouldn't do that anyway because I don't want a cramped organizer.  Spaced out, the earrings look great on this.  I keep the ones that don't hang well on it in a dish, and that's fine.  Most of mine are displayed and it looks very classy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1549297", "1": "0.34301883", "2": "0.17230237", "3": "0.04803797", "4": "0.12119248", "5": "0.0338048", "6": "0.1267139"}}
