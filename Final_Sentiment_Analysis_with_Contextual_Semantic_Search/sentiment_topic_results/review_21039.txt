{"text": "There are so many leggings out there now, and I just wanted plain, very black, comfy, opaque, leggings with enough stretch to never bag (and not be $40-50, that's NUTS to pay for heavier tights!).  These are PERFECT.  I have bigger legs and I got the size L and they fit like a dream, without squeezing and making my legs look worse -- and without having to yank them up or 'arrange' them like I have with thinner or less elastic pairs.I should mention that I am about 5'6\" and the length is perfect.  No issues here with that for me.I don't know if they pill or not like someone said I have worn them long enough, but I totally *hated* taking them off after wearing them for the weekend. They look great with a tunic and wedge boots or high heels or with a tee shirt, blazer and wedge sneakers.  LOVE them and am going to buy more.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12832946", "1": "0.11242964", "2": "0.0970852", "3": "0.09158873", "4": "0.19790179", "5": "0.10741986", "6": "0.26524532"}}
