{"text": "I am plagued with wicked blisters whenever I walk or run more than 45 minutes, so I got these socks to see if they would make any difference while I am training for a marathon relay. I still have some friction on the bottoms of my feet, but nothing like before, and no new blisters on my last 60 minute interval training session. The socks are well made, nice and soft inside, and didn't affect how my shoes fit - I was afraid the extra padding would make my shoes tight, but that didn't seem to be a problem. I will definitely pick up a few more pairs.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17818211", "1": "0.16315304", "2": "0.09903272", "3": "0.22766571", "4": "0.05554162", "5": "0.16167298", "6": "0.114751846"}}
