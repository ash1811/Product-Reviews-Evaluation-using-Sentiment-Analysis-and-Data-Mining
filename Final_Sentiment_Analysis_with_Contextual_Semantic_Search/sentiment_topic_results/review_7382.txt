{"text": "The pants fit well and seem to be just as described. The pants button fell off on first trying them on. The button used a pin and metal button receiver. However this button used a plastic receiver instead of metal and it was cracked. I installed an after market all metal jean button and pin and it works great. Shame a good pair of pants uses a cheap button.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13322636", "1": "0.42859906", "2": "0.2312455", "3": "0.048603747", "4": "0.03862015", "6": "0.116209865"}}
