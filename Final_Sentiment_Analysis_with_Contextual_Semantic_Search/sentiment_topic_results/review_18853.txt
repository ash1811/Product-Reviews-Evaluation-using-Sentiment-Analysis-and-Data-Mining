{"text": "Good jeans, soft pre-washed makes them feel and look as if I've owned then a while. I generally like my jeans to fit snug and tapered.These fit good up top and around the waist and nicely in the behind. The back of the legs, however, are not as tapered as I like and fit somewhat loose. 501`s fit better there but I don't care for the button fly on 501`s. Overall, waist & inseam are accurate. 4-stars", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2725413", "2": "0.0900009", "3": "0.26504955", "4": "0.044664852", "6": "0.32122418"}}
