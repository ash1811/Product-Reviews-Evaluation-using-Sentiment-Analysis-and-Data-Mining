{"text": "This product was recommended by my foot doctor as I was having problems with both my right (bunion) and left (inflammation) foot!  This size fits perfectly inside my size 10 Women's shoes, no need to trim it.  I guess if you are wearing a size 8.5 to 9.5, you have to trim it to size.  This is really good for my feet.
