{"text": "So far so good! I purchased this to go under my A-Line wedding gown. As most reviews stated, this showed up literally vacuum sealed and rolled up! No wonder other ladies were complaining about it not preforming. After reading the reviews, I knew what to expect, and cleared out all items from our coat closet the moment I opened the package, to give this beauty some space to breathe. I tried it on, it fit great! perfect length! great drawstring! then I immediately took it off, hung it up and began poofing and working with the netting. Every few days I open the coat closet and fluff it more. The longer it hangs, the better the shape and poof gets. With this product you need to have patience, and order it early so it has time to return to the proper shape. Haven't tried it on with the wedding gown yet, my first fitting is in December. As long as the petticoat works with my gown, I will be one very pleased camper!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13220532", "1": "0.29690626", "2": "0.22808915", "3": "0.059678122", "4": "0.055475406", "5": "0.16664648", "6": "0.06099923"}}
