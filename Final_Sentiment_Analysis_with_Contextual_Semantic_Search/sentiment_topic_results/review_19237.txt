{"text": "I suspect I'm like a lot of people -- trying to find a wallet that works for everything, each new purchase falling slightly short of the mark.  Not so with the Mundi Big Fat Flap Wallet!  This one is IT!I purchased my first Mundi from another source -- a lovely pale beige nubuck number.  I've had it for almost a year now, and it's holding up extremely well, despite living daily in my book bag (I'm a full-time \"non-traditional\" university grad student) and being transferred several times a week into my purse.  It's starting to show a little wear -- just a bit of shine around the edges of the nubuck, not a hint of wear on the interior (I haven't noticed any problems a previous reviewer had with it picking up \"grime\" -- maybe I keep my hands cleaner or something?), but it still functions perfectly.  It holds all my cards (student ID, copy card, credit cards, insurance cards) with room to spare.  Cash is securely stowed in the zippered compartment.  Checkbook and pen have their own places.  And it fits in a smallish Kipling bag that I use for day-to-day errands.  It's maybe a bit larger than your typical \"checkbook wallet\" -- so bear that in mind if you carry a REALLY small purse.I just ordered my second Mundi Big Fat Flap Wallet, this time in red from Amazon for a much better price than I paid for the beige.  No more annual wallet purchase trying to find the right fit!  This one's for life.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12568855", "1": "0.24133721", "2": "0.13461782", "3": "0.21063928", "4": "0.15517598", "5": "0.08896495", "6": "0.04357615"}}
