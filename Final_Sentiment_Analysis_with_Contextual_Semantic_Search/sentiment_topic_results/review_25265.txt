{"text": "I bought a pair of Merrell Ventilators this winter at REI to replace my Nike hiking boots which had worn down after about a year of regular hiking.  The Nikes gave me blisters and weren't cushioned enough for more strenuous hikes, but I had always bought them because they were the only ones in my price range.  Frustrated with blisters and discomfort, I decided it was finally worth my money to upgrade.  I'm very glad I did.  These are the lightest, most comfortable boots I have ever owned.  They hold your feet in place snugly with a padded collar and a thick, cushy shoe tongue.  They breathe very well, which is critical since I live in a warm climate.  They also have enough traction to grip rocks when I go bouldering.  They seem very durable so I think they will last me at least several years (I usually try to keep hiking boots for at least 2 or 3 years if not more).Funny story - my buddy bought a pair of $120 Vasque hikers the same week I got these for $80.  By the end of a strenuous hike, he was complaining of foot pain.  I was not.  Proves that spending more doesn't always get you something better.  I think these are really a good value product.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13471228", "1": "0.13200422", "2": "0.1595351", "3": "0.11634774", "4": "0.20487384", "5": "0.08491806", "6": "0.16760878"}}
