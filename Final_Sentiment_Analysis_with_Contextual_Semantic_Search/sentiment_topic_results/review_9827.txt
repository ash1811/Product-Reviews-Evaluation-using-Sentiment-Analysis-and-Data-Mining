{"text": "Nice to be able to buy my actual size 10 and fit into it, not have to go up to an 11 just to squeeze in my wide foot.  Will be roomy and comfy in the ankle, which at my plus size, I don't normally experience.  I'm going to buy a pair for my mother-in-law who has single wide feet, as these also come in W.  I bought the WW which suits me awesome!  This is my second Bass purchase in less than a week.  :)  Can't wait to get more Bass shoes for Fall too!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.30787578", "2": "0.18211617", "3": "0.19374709", "4": "0.17413943", "5": "0.0823331", "6": "0.056802455"}}
