{"text": "This is a wonderful light-&-breezy type nightgown. It's the perfect length to sleep in for my tastes. I bought the very pretty rose colored one and intend buying a few more colors. It's going to be wonderful for hot summer days/nights around the house and for the days my hot flashes are worse than ever. If you don't like nearly sheer, you won't like it but I bought it for the comfort factor and it's very comfortable. It's a bonus that it's a great fit also.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.22112711", "1": "0.19165948", "2": "0.14906801", "3": "0.09558909", "4": "0.086249195", "6": "0.25280228"}}
