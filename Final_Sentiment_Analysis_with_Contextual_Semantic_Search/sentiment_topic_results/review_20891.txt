{"text": "I generally wear size 9.5, these I bought a bit smaller, so they do not rub on bare foot. I find Keen shoes slightly generous in their sizing also fairly wide. Great colour, goes with everything, sturdy and at the same time very light shoe. I wear them every day walking my dog in the woods and sometimes wading through a river, or anywhere around town. They are very comfortable and show very little wear and tear so far.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.24521154", "2": "0.16555402", "3": "0.10954727", "4": "0.09967836", "5": "0.3051656", "6": "0.07172588"}}
