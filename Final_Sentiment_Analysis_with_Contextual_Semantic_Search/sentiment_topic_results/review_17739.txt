{"text": "I like Casio watches. I needed to replace one that had served me well for years. Too bad for me that Casio has made changes in its design.In particular, on this model, the Adjust setting button, which is used for selecting the function you want, is slightly recessed and I simply cannot manipulate it easily with my fingertips. Either the mild arthritis I have isn't letting me be nimble enough or my fingers are too big. I can do it with a thumbnail if I get it just right or stylus, but not with my finger tip.Sorry, but that is not what I want.Styling is nice, though, and I still like Casio. Wound up with one of the humongous G-Shock models that has four big buttons.Jerry", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1329113", "1": "0.20386201", "2": "0.2144002", "3": "0.08953509", "4": "0.15644203", "5": "0.0472486", "6": "0.15560077"}}
