{"text": "OK, so I usually wear a medium and bought in XL because thanks to all you alert writers who warned me the sizes come smaller than expected.  And the XL fits great, looks terrific, is super-comfortable, and perfect for year-round wear.  I usually wear it all by itself with no other topping in summer, and layer it in winter--works wonderfully, and is modest enough to wear alone.  So if you want to buy, get a couple of sizes up and you will be happy!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10737468", "1": "0.3865928", "2": "0.10322196", "3": "0.14005786", "4": "0.06475651", "5": "0.086586565", "6": "0.11140962"}}
