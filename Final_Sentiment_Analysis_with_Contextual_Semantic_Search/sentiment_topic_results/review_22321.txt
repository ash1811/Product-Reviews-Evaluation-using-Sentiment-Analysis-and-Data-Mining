{"text": "My wife and I walk briskly just over three miles every day on a nearby trail which includes several hills.  After four consecutive days, we both start getting blisters, that is, we used to.  These socks have eliminated the blister problem completely, and they're more comfortable than regular socks to boot.  If that were the whole story, I would give this product 5 stars.The deductions.  I have rough toenails, and in spite of great effort to trim and smooth the edges, it is a major effort to put these socks on.  In fairness, that isn't a defect in the sock, just a limitation for me--but maybe some others as well.  Second drawback is that after only a few weeks (bought two pair) and ten wearings each, there are definite signs of wear.  No holes yet, just the threat, but still they seem a bit flimsy.So, if you can get them on, and you can afford to replace them fairly frequently, these are 5-star socks.  For me, they get 4 stars.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14867443", "1": "0.15635657", "2": "0.06940554", "3": "0.14730568", "4": "0.07427587", "5": "0.2371059", "6": "0.16687605"}}
