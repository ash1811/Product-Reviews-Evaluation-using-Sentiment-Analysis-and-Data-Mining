{"text": "I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it. It is the right fit, and the bill is the right size for him. It fits him very snug. He wears it everywhere, he even falls asleep in it. He finds it very comfortable. The only thing I have noticed is that is coming apart a bit on the edge of the bill, but I did wash it once and that might be why. It did great in the washer and dryer. I think the bill insides is made from plastic and it is really durable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.52823776", "2": "0.0473082", "4": "0.09122804", "5": "0.22561707", "6": "0.100776844"}}
