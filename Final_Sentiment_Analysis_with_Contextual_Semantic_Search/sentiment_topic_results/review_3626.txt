{"text": "This has been my favorite bra for years.  However, over the past couple of years, Playtex has made the straps longer than ever.  I have wide/big shoulders, and I still have to make the straps as tight as they will go.  I really need the straps to be even a little shorter than that.  Plus, they seem to \"untighten\" when putting on the bra.  Other than that, the support is much better than any other bra I have tried.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.19105", "2": "0.17776948", "3": "0.5026666", "4": "0.084457956", "6": "0.036497936"}}
