{"text": "My wife complains that I buy too many hats.  She's probably right.  That said, I love this hat!!  It is super soft and extremely warm.  I deliver papers in the morning, so I am driving for 90 minutes with my windows down.  This keeps me warm...almost too warm at times.  I've also got a big ol noggin, and this fits fine and keeps its shape.  Definitely good purchase.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.19342738", "1": "0.2886085", "3": "0.2622678", "4": "0.16679761", "5": "0.05662682", "6": "0.028662313"}}
