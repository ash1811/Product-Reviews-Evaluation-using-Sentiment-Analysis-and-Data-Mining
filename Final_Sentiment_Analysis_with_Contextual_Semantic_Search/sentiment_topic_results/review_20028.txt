{"text": "This is a super cool back back! I feel like a super-spy when I wear it. It has oodles of pockets and a cool rain-cover that comes out of a bottom pocket. There is a laptop pocket inside that fits my behemoth computer in it. The round pocket on top is shallow, good for something you don't want to have to dig for. There is a cell phone pocket on one of the straps. A pocket for pencils and other office supplies. Side pockets, small pocket, big pockets! It's very sturdy and it is very comfortable, even packed with textbooks. Support chest straps are a plus if you want to use it for hiking. Like I said, heavy duty multipurpose back pack!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.075890034", "1": "0.3143156", "2": "0.12027951", "3": "0.102765225", "4": "0.099960454", "5": "0.02686435", "6": "0.2599248"}}
