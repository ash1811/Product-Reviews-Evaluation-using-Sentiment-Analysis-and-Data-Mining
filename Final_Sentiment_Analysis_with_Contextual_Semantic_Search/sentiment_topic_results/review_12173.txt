{"text": "These things are hard to come by these days. I remember growing up we all had them to slip over our shoes during inclement weather. These fit fine over my Clarke's dress shoes size 10. I'm glad I read some of the other reviews and ordered the XL which is a size larger than listed. I don't think I could have gotten smaller ones over my shoes. Very happy with the purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19417374", "1": "0.22935516", "2": "0.19720049", "3": "0.11908385", "4": "0.14327385", "6": "0.112822086"}}
