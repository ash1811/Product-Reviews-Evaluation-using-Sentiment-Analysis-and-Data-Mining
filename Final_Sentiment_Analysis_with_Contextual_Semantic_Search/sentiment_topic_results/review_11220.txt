{"text": "I bought these boots for my husband for our Alaska cruise.  The wet landings require a boot at least to mid-calf and suitable for walking on soggy terrain.  While the boots are very heavy in the hand due to the steel toe, they don't feel heavy on the foot for walking but if you have weak thigh muscles you might them them so.  The quality of the rubber is good: thick yet flexible.  The sole is very flexible for walking.  They have a lining so rubber does not touch your skin on the interior but a high thick sock is recommended.  These are heavy-duty boots that seem they will last.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16690764", "1": "0.19245572", "2": "0.07150667", "3": "0.063565165", "4": "0.18802147", "5": "0.20013441", "6": "0.11740891"}}
