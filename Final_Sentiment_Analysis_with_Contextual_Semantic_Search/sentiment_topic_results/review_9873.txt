{"text": "The crocks brand deck shoes I wore through after constant use for a year had been discontinued so I replaced them with these.  I like them; the soles are fairly thick and they seem well made.  But I preferred the look and fit of the crocks because the front/toe area of the crocks was much wider. I am female so these are okay for me, but I'm not sure they would be wide enough for a typical man's foot.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.4133257", "2": "0.24192636", "3": "0.13847807", "4": "0.051113375", "5": "0.14799525"}}
