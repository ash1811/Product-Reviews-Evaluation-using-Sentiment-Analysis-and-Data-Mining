{"text": "I only bought this socks because of a requirement to wear socks in our physical training uniforms. So these socks allowed me to wear my five finger shoes during required PT. What I found was that I actually felt more comfortable in the Five Finger shoes with this sock than I did without them. They add just a slight amount of cushion but little bulk. I had worried at first they may bunch or cause trouble in the toe pockets but that was not the case. They also do a good job of absorbing sweat and water during longer workouts or when wearing Five Fingers during inclement weather. All and all I am quite pleased with these socks and plan to add a few more pairs to the drawer.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.049422618", "1": "0.29304835", "2": "0.17920378", "4": "0.19810164", "5": "0.2753547"}}
