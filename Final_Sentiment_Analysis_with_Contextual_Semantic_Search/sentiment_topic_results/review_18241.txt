{"text": "This watch is FANTASTIC for the price, I might even go as far to say unbeatable in the >$40 category.  I purchased this SAME model back in the early 90's and I just now replaced it with a new one.PRO'S:- Durable- Large buttons- Easy to navigate and set- Handsome- Very comfortable- SUPER BRIGHT EL light- Count down timer- Long battery lifeCON'S:- Plastic buckle/clasp for the band.  Honestly, metal can't be expected at this price though.- Light green print on the watch case wears off.  I wish it were recessed and printed with the same color so it wouldn't wear off as I think it looks great.This watch is G-Shock caliber for 1/2 the cost.  The only thing about it that doesn't make it a true G-Shock is the lack of a metal clasp on the band, but it is still sturdy regardless.  It is comfortable to wear all day, in all activities, and all weather.  I put my last one through hell and it is still working perfectly, even after two battery replacements and a couple band replacements.If you need a durable watch at a great price, look no further.  This is the ticket.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12045483", "1": "0.28954133", "2": "0.19132705", "3": "0.09208318", "4": "0.16093336", "5": "0.10034161", "6": "0.045318607"}}
