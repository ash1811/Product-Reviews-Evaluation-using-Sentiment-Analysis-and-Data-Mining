{"text": "But they're super comfy and they can be made to look cute enough with the right pants. I got these in the cherry red color and they brighten up my jeans and trousers on dull days. I've worn them to travel, worn them with socks in the winter, worn them walking miles as a tourist and they're easy to slip on and off and always comfy.Fit-wise, I usually wear a size 11, after reading the reviews, I got these in a 10 (one full size down) and they were comfy on first wear. I could probably have sized down to a 9.5 or even 9 especially since my 10s have widened and are now as loose as slippers which is great and comfy but I probably should get an insole for a more secure fit. Another thing to note, these have great suede insoles (which did stain my feet the first couple of wears but not anymore) but there isn't much padding or arch support so if those are things you're looking for, you may need to look into an extra insole- you'll have the room in these don't worry.I'm definitely going to get another pair or two in other colors. I really really like these shoes. I was disappointed at the look of them when I first opened the box (thought they were ugly) but they've really grown on me and I think they &#34;work&#34; on some level. Great shoes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.060811274", "1": "0.25714752", "2": "0.08936912", "3": "0.04236913", "4": "0.16015616", "5": "0.18606386", "6": "0.20408292"}}
