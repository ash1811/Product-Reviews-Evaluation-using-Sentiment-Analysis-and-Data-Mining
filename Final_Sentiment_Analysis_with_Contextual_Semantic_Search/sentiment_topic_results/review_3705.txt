{"text": "The rating would be 5 star, as the product itself was great. Beautiful glasses, really. Would definitely buy again, esp since the price on Amazon is so great. But, Amazon happened to send me the 58mm, even though the order was for 62mm. Luckily, the product fit perfectly. (It was a gift) So, although there was a mix-up, it turned out to be quite fortunate for me, since it saved me the trouble of (probably) having to send it back for another size. So, thanks for that Amazon. I love you guys, but I still have to give you 4 stars out of technicality.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19418614", "1": "0.24622178", "3": "0.18477817", "4": "0.17866938", "5": "0.11413233", "6": "0.07957638"}}
