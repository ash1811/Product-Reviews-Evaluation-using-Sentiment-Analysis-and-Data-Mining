{"text": "I picked up the White Scatter Backpack on a Friday Sale.  I wasn't shopping for one, but the price and JanSport name was all I needed. When I received it I was questioning my choice in design because it's bright, BUT it has been great for a couple reasons - My kids can find me in a crowd within seconds and I don't worry about getting it stolen because of it being so noticeable. As for the actual backpack, it is very large and roomy, plenty of pockets, wide padded straps for comfort and I can tell it's well made and meant to last.  I plan on buying JanSport this year for the kids back to school because I have been so impressed.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.02940488", "1": "0.22304381", "2": "0.18001783", "3": "0.10054393", "4": "0.097913615", "5": "0.30914375", "6": "0.059932165"}}
