{"text": "I have had two serious abdominal surgeries that have left my digestive tract in confusion. If I eat the wrong food or my system gets upset I can encounter fecal incontinence. If that happens, it is not too bad, but I sleep with bottoms that are made with a saddle so I can use a pad to insure my security at night. These shorts by Hanes fill the bill. I do not like a fly at night as it tends to ease the fit I am looking for. I do wish Hanes made a 2XL as I have a waist of 42 and a bit of a tummy so they are a little snug. But that is not a problem, they fill my need quite well and I'm happy with them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.110574685", "1": "0.20675181", "2": "0.17885391", "3": "0.10367222", "4": "0.07606494", "5": "0.137564", "6": "0.18651845"}}
