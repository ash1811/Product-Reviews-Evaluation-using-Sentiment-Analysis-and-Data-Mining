{"text": "The slippers by Tamarac are very nice looking and comfortable (as long as you buy a size or two bigger than you normally wear--and for a short while, anyway). The lining is not genuine sheep skin. It is some crappy synthetic fiber that rolls into little balls and/or tubes and, after a month or so of wearing, it will rapidly disappear--resulting in very cold and unhappy feet. I will never buy this product again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15420838", "1": "0.259078", "2": "0.18834196", "3": "0.11474274", "4": "0.1442038", "5": "0.09788319", "6": "0.041541938"}}
