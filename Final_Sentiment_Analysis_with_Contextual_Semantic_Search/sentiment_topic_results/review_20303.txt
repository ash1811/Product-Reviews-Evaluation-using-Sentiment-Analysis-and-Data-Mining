{"text": "This product was absolutely fabulous! After searching high and low in bridal stores, you get tired of getting the same sky high price for a simple undergarment thats needed just to fluff up your already expensive wedding gown! Most places will charge $80 - $120 for this, while this VERY reasonable price of $40 was a life saver! True to description, it will fit all sizes, I am a size 5 and it snugged right to my waist, I was also able to fluff it out of the box, take a little steam to it and voila! It stayed nice and plush for a month before the wedding, I simply hung above my closet and it was ready to go. Would highly recommend for any brides desperately seeking undergarments for an A-line or Princess style wedding gown, its a great product and great price!!! Thanks a million!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16652222", "1": "0.28717914", "2": "0.13413945", "3": "0.18018082", "4": "0.049233485", "5": "0.056585815", "6": "0.12615906"}}
