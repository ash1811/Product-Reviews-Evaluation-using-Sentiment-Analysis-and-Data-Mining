{"text": "I bought Carhartt jeans for me and my son at the same time.  I like the fact that Carhartt has a very broad selection of both styles and sizes to choose from.  I am at the weird end of the spectrum body type wise, and am very skinny, but long legged.  A 30\" waist but a 34\" inseam...yeah, I am all leg!  My son is better proportioned and has a 32\" waist and 30\" inseam.  Finding jeans that fit me is difficult.  But, thankfully, Carhartt has pants that fit me.  I really enjoy the jeans I got, except for the fact that they only have 5 belt loops instead of the 7 I am used to.  My son's relaxed fit jeans are great. He wears them frequently.  He is into body building and needs a jean that does't fit too tightly to his thighs (which are understandably quite large now).  So these relaxed fit jeans fill the bill nicely.  He doesn't feel pinched or bound up in them and finds them to be all-day comfortable.  Construction is rugged and quality is excellent.  They fit well and wash/dry well.  These are really high quality jeans and worth the price.  Oh, and the price was very NICE.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.025615444", "1": "0.344763", "3": "0.16065124", "4": "0.1055211", "5": "0.10273222", "6": "0.25839695"}}
