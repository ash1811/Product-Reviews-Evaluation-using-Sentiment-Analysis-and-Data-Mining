{"text": "Super comfy socks with an excellent amount of padding. I wear these with my dress shoes, even though they're not exactly designed for that purpose. Thicker than your typical black dress socks, so they will fit comfortably in most dress shoes, while providing the amount of support and comfort that you generally get from your more athletic socks that you wear with sneakers. The material is of great quality- soft, heavy cotton.This is a great &#34;add on&#34; product for when you just need to get your Amazon order over $25, so as to qualify for free shipping. They cost about what you would have to pay in shipping, anyway... and you could always use some more socks, couldn't you?", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.094593175", "1": "0.20250411", "2": "0.10126869", "3": "0.086540565", "4": "0.1292688", "5": "0.26722923", "6": "0.11859545"}}
