{"text": "Have always loved Minnetonka Shoes.  I do think these run a little small.  I ordered my regular size and as long as I do not wear a heavy sock they are fine.  Because they are leather they will probably stretch out some.  Moccasins are my go to shoes when I don't want to wear sandals.  Love them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.46351302", "2": "0.27430716", "3": "0.13465905", "6": "0.11267627"}}
