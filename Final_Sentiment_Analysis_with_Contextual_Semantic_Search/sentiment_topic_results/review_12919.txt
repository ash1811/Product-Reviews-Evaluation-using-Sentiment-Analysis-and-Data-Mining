{"text": "I have been wanting ugg boots for about 2 years now and since no one would get them for me I finally broke down and got a pair. I love these boots, they are everything I expected and more.  I'm glad I read the other comments because I normally wear  women's 8.5 or 9 so according to the reviews they suggest a size smaller, I ordered a women's 8 and they fit perfectly.  Also I have very thin legs, like you can measure my ankles with the thumb and middle finger and have room to spare and these boots don't give you that saggy look in the leg area, which us a bonus for me.  Love them and can't wait to wear them", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13101555", "1": "0.35549533", "2": "0.080711655", "3": "0.17219101", "4": "0.21378022", "6": "0.044459153"}}
