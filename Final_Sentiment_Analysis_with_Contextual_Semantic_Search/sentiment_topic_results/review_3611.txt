{"text": "I do like this bra and the gel shoulder straps, it does make it more comfortable.  I do have an issue with the length of the straps and where the gel shoulder strap sits.  I guess my chest is lower than average, so I always have difficulty find bra's with long enough straps.  This bra's straps are long enough, but the gel portion is a little off center and does not really give me the full intended effect.But overall, a good bra.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.043228295", "1": "0.1053101", "2": "0.25804666", "3": "0.32908472", "4": "0.106924474", "6": "0.15398224"}}
