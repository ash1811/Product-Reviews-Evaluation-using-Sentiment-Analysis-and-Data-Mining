{"text": "Finally ordered my new Reefs. I have three pair from years ago. They are made a bit differently. First, the footbed is textured which is very nice. They are oh-so comfortable. Secondly, they will wear just as long as the old ones. It seems products change with time to save money, you expect the same and get less than expected. Not so with these. Go ahead, order a few pair, you'll be glad you did.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.19721484", "2": "0.09477879", "3": "0.17004359", "5": "0.42545766", "6": "0.105303325"}}
