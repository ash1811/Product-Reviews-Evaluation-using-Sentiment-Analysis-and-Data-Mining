{"text": "Although I am a big Levi 550 fan, I did like these.  I think Levi is a heavier denim (which surprised me since Carhartt is known as work apparel).  These are comfortable though, and some may like the slightly lighter weight.  They fit well.  Am doing laundry today, so will soon know how they handle shrinkage.  Only wish they came in the very light stonewash like Levi's do.  Good price as compared to Levi.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09027906", "1": "0.41658947", "3": "0.07038805", "4": "0.06738471", "5": "0.107909", "6": "0.24426517"}}
