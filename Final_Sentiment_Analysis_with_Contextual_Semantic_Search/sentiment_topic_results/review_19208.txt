{"text": "I would have loved to give this 5 stars but the black was not as shown (white stitching).  The one I received has black stitching. Other than that - this is an awesome wallet with enough pockets for everything.  It's so hard to find a wallet that can fit EVERYTHING in it. Medical cards for me and my kids, credit card, debit card, discount card, gas card, driver's license, costco membership card, coins, checkbook, receipts, coupons and cash. THEY ALL FIT!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08370125", "1": "0.2633165", "2": "0.35981", "3": "0.09112354", "4": "0.06555359", "5": "0.10821375", "6": "0.02828136"}}
