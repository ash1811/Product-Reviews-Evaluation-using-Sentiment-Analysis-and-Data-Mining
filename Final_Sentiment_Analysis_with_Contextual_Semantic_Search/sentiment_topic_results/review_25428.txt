{"text": "My husband's last pair of these lasted more than 2 years and he wore them out into the backyard and in the garage so they certainly weren't pampered! He absolutely loved them and until this pair of slippers has never wanted slippers. Now he doesn't know what he'd do without them!They are warm but not too warm and he said they are extremely comfortable. As long as they continue to make these with the same quality I'm sure we'll continue to buy them!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.054957516", "1": "0.3979651", "2": "0.151598", "3": "0.18668434", "4": "0.058383465", "6": "0.14663538"}}
