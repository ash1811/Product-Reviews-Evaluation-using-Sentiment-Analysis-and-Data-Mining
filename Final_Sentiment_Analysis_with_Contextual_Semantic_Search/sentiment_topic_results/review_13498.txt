{"text": "The Easy Spirit Traveltime Mule is the perfect shoe for oh so many things. I like an easy-on easy-off shoe that offers arch support, and this one is perfect. Lightweight yet durable. True to size for me (9M), stays on, even when I work out on the recumbent bike.I do a lot of arts and craft shows in the autumn and find this shoe ideal for standing long periods of time as well as rugged for schlepping my gear in and out of event halls.A wonderful shoe at a very affordable price. I'm a happy camper.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15758798", "1": "0.19930077", "2": "0.33654332", "3": "0.09510074", "4": "0.093575716", "6": "0.11532361"}}
