{"text": "These jeans are B17,s.  The description states they fit at the natural waist.  Not so, check Carhartt's web site and B17's are described as fitting slightly below the waist line.  Plus, the waist size runs way small.  I ordered 35\" waist and the waist was more like 32\" or 33\". Had to return.  However, Carhartt B13 does fit at the natural waist.  I am a Carhartt fan.  I wear B151's everyday to school and they work great. Sometimes sizes may run a little inconsistent.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.031044615", "1": "0.19761705", "2": "0.3084774", "3": "0.076942764", "4": "0.099937305", "5": "0.06405114", "6": "0.2219297"}}
