{"text": "Had trouble finding Navy boat shoes for my husband until I found this pair on Amazon.  He said they felt a little snug at first, but didn't take long to break in and become quite comfortable.  They were also the exact shade to match his navy blazer, so they were a nice finishing touch to his boating association dress attire.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this great shoe!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.121191554", "2": "0.09813923", "3": "0.2100534", "4": "0.19865605", "5": "0.18211749", "6": "0.18607675"}}
