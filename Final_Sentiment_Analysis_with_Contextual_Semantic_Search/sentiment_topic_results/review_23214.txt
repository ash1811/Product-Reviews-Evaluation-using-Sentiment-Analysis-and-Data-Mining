{"text": "There is a lot of space without being to big. There are 5 pockets on the fron with a window spot for an Id. A pocket on either side, a zipper pocket on the inside, a pocket on back, and a flap that goes over the top and front. There is plenty of room in the main body of the purse. The strap is adjustable. It is very nice and handy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07494204", "1": "0.39613244", "2": "0.20133825", "3": "0.08959763", "6": "0.22904365"}}
