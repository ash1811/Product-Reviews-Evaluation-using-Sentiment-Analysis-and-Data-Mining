{"text": "I bought these for my girlfriend since she started coming to bowling nights with me.  After owning Dexter shoes myself, I knew exactly which pair I'd be getting her.Bowling shoes are very well made and Dexter is the best in the business.  The bottoms of these shoes are unparalleled to anything I have worn in my 8 year bowling career.The whole front of the bottom is a soft piece of cloth that makes sliding a breeze.  TheEbonite Ultra Slide Powderif perfect if you want to give the felt bottom a refresh. Especially, if you accidentally walk into the bathroom with your bowling shoes on (which you should never do) this powder will help dry the bottom out.  Speaking of getting the bottoms wet you should use a damp cloth to get any of the liquid out then dry them with a hair dryer on low setting to get the moisture out. Apply some of the Slide Powder and you should be good to go.The bottom of the shoe heel is like a hard pencil eraser and helps you stop as you get closer to the foul line. After a couple weeks I usually check the bottoms and lightly scrape the rubber with a wire brush to remove any gunk that has built up on them.Overall, these are a great shoes and are light-years ahead of the rentals you're used to using at your local alley.  They might be 34 bucks, but they pay for themselves after a few weeks! The price is worth it!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.21763587", "1": "0.3546449", "2": "0.14577687", "4": "0.05295717", "5": "0.10704168", "6": "0.1198626"}}
