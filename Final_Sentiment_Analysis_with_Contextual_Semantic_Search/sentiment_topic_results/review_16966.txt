{"text": "The moss color shows a much lighter green than the actual shirt. It is a very dark navy green. The fit is also really off. I ordered medium, which is normally perfect for me. (Although sometimes I have issues with sleeve lengths being too short.) This is labeled medium, but definitely a large. However, I can tell that if I were to exchange it for what they label as small the sleeves would likely be a bit short.The shirt itself is very comfortable and looks durable. I ordered several other Carhartt clothing and the fit is all over the place with them. Everything is either larger or smaller than it should be.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.065003745", "1": "0.5114013", "2": "0.2068705", "3": "0.06593311", "4": "0.06672424", "6": "0.08154601"}}
