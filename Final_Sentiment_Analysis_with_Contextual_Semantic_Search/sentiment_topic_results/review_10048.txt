{"text": "The straps on the watch are tiny, im 6'1\" and i weigh 155 pounds so im not big by any means. The watch sits crooked on my wrist due to the straps not being long enough. The quality is sub-par, the long arm does not line up on the minute marks even when the seconds hand is exactly at 12. Not a big issue but it's definitely annoying, and i realize this is a budget watch. It keept time pretty well for the months ive had it. I work construction and i got this for work because it was cheap and i didnt want to destroy my more expensive watches. It regularly becomes unlatched from my arm because, again, the straps are not long enough. I would recommend this for children, but for an adult's hand it is not suitable.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13555162", "1": "0.19640765", "2": "0.26504737", "3": "0.10469779", "4": "0.118104145", "5": "0.11037049", "6": "0.06982092"}}
