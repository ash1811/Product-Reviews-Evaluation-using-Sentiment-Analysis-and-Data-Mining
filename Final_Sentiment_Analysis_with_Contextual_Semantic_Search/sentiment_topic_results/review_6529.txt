{"text": "I ordered these for a hiking trip and have been very happy with them.  I also bought a pair of the thicker cushion Thorlo hiking socks.  Both are great, very comfortable and wear well.  I like having both these \"semi-thick\" and the thicker ones depending on the day, the weather and how much cushioning my feet need that day.  I plan to get another pair of these in a different color.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11902654", "1": "0.3640865", "2": "0.115254335", "4": "0.110333346", "5": "0.1543363", "6": "0.13298012"}}
