{"text": "If, as advertised, you want the ORIGINAL FOOTBED - which is NOT the \"Soft Footbed\" - then these are NOT what you want.  I ordered them expecting the original foot bed and received the \"Soft Footbed\" version instead.  This was not mentioned anywhere in the ordering process.  Pick size, pick width, pick color and material, but no options regarding the footbed.  So now I am packaging them up and sending them back, which is a waste of my time.  Yes, I am annoyed because I think this is deceptive.  Amazon should get it right.  The reason they are cheaper may very well be because, in general, people don't want the Soft Footbed, so they are trying to get rid of them.  So now you won't be confused or fooled.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10247657", "1": "0.31020302", "3": "0.10547728", "4": "0.14866273", "5": "0.328235"}}
