{"text": "I had ordered these in the patent leather last year, but it rubbed on my pinky toe and after I got them I didn't really like the patent. I ordered these nubuck and love them. They are very comfortable and find I could wear them everyday. Nice enough for work and comfortable for casual weekends too. I have a narrow foot, but Clarks have always fit well and I order the Clarks alot. Size is very comfortable!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15725729", "1": "0.5215122", "2": "0.052119784", "3": "0.18091908", "4": "0.0810117"}}
