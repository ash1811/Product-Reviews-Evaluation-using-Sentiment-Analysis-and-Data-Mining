{"text": "I found these socks to be really comfortable on my hands. As a sock puppeteer it's difficult to find a pair of socks that are comfortable and don't chaff. These socks are perfect. They keep my hands cool during the puppet performances I give. They material is easy to write on using a sharpie. Craft glue sticks to it rather well, too. Most sock puppeteers prefer crew socks for their puppets. I like using over-the-calf socks because it allows me to not only make a puppet face, but an entire puppet costume for the rest of the body. These are the type of socks for the true sock puppeteer.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2302078", "1": "0.14589374", "2": "0.16133827", "3": "0.06412015", "4": "0.02883675", "5": "0.25243017", "6": "0.11717313"}}
