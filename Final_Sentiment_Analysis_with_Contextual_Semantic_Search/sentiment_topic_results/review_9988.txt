{"text": "I got this watch when Timex came out with the Indiglo series - a long time ago.  I've gone through several batteries. Just this week the band broke at the band bars.  The replacement band is about $10, and the replacement watch is $38, so I'm just going to get a new watch even though my old watch works perfectly.  I just set the compass for the first time, and am impressed how well it works.  (I'm embarassed to confess that I didn't know that this watch had a built-in compass until i read the promo material for its replacement.  so much for reading owners' manuals!) This is a well-made watch for the price - in fact for any price!  I have worn my expedition nightly and on weekends whenever I'm on the boat, working in the garage, remodeling houses, etc., when I didn't want to run the risk of damaging my Seikos.  I've gone through three Seikos, but this watch, the one that took the most abuse is still working great.I'll try to clarify a few things about Timex Indiglo watches battery replacement as the reviews indicate some confusion.  First, the required CR1620 battery is very inexpensive - I buy the energizer 5-pack  (current price on Amazon is $4.26 for the 5-pack).  After all these years, I'm still working on my first 5-pack.  Second, the battery is trivial to replace if you have a set of jeweler's screwdrivers.  (if not, you can get a set of 16 by Fuller on Amazon for $12 - though I'd recommend getting Xcelite or Wiha @ twice the price but they'll last much longer).There are 4 phillips screws on the back of the case.  A PH00x60(approx 1/16\") phillips screwdriver works fine.  You remove these screws, then pull up on the colored, sticky tab and the battery comes out.  Before you pull out the battery, note the position of the arrow on the tab.  The arrow points to the reset button.  After replacing battery and tab, push the reset button with the screwdriver tip and reassemble.  You're done. (hints: perform this operation on a piece of white paper as the screws are *very* small.  I use tweezers to align the screws with the holes.  don't overtighten.  There's an o-ring on the case that provides watertight integrity with the case back and it compresses easily.)Hope this helps.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.2445649", "1": "0.1160962", "2": "0.2416551", "3": "0.23049752", "4": "0.050620146", "5": "0.089923695", "6": "0.026642444"}}
