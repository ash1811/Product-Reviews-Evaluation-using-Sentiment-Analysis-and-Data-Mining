{"text": "Pre-pregnancy I wore a 00 and my trouble with tights was that they were usually too long.  At 22 weeks into pregnancy, I have enjoyed wearing these tights for at least a month.  The band comes just beneath my bra and the lace panel is quite pretty.  No tugging, stretching, or excessive pressure - they fit just right.As an added bonus, the weave on the tights is high quality and I have no worries about snags or runs, even after several wearings and washings.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.207087", "1": "0.10241213", "2": "0.04271124", "3": "0.32306203", "5": "0.2900785", "6": "0.031320274"}}
