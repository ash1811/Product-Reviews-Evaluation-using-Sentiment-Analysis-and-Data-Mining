{"text": "I wear these socks with a pair of flip flops for going through TSA security at the airport when I travel. It is so easy to just step out of my flip flops and put them on the scanner conveyor belt.  My feet stay clean and the grips on the bottom are almost like having shoes on.  After I am through security, I just put the small socks and the flip flops in a ziploc bag in my carry-on and put on my regular shoes and socks.  I have clean feet for the whole trip.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.19198713", "2": "0.29418817", "3": "0.12685323", "4": "0.22522704", "5": "0.15537465"}}
