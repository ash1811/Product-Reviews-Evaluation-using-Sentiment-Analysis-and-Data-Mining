{"text": "A lot of workout bottoms nowadays tend to ride up or roll down, if you know what I mean.  It's increasingly difficult to find anything that stays put as needed when running, walking, stretching, whatever.I've long been a fan of Champion for their low prices and high quality products.  That's why I turned to them for my most recent gym-bottom purchase.These shorts are prefect.They rest comfortably on my upper waist and stay in place by way of an inch-plus wide elastic band that is comfort encased by a soft material (it's a new elastic product as I've found that same band on sports bras of a different brand).  The 9\" inseam is long enough to keep the short just above my knees without creeping up.They keep me cool and dry off quickly for those who may not have the luxury of doing laundry every day.Overall, highest marks.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.2249063", "1": "0.19004822", "2": "0.059733067", "3": "0.17138761", "5": "0.20242141", "6": "0.149423"}}
