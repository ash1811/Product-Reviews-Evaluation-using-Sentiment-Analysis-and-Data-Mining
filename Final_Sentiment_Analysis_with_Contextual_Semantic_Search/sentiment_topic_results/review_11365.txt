{"text": "I love my fryes. I got them in dark brown they are lovely. I got my regular size which is sz 10. My feet are a little wide so they fit perfectly. I did not have to break them in they were ready to go from day one. The bottom is slippery at first so watch out. I am still giving them 5 stars because I love them so.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.16727565", "2": "0.13235974", "3": "0.2411764", "4": "0.17378904", "5": "0.17999096", "6": "0.10104836"}}
