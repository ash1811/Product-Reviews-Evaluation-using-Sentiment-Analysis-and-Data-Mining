{"text": "Before buying this link remover, I had been using the ubiquitous blue version that comes with the cheap watch repair kits. The blue one was obviously pretty cheap and occasionally difficult to use, but got the job done. After the actual metal pusher part broke on that one, I decided to pay a little more for better quality. This grey Paylak tool is superior in every way - easier to use, easier to align the bracelet with the pusher, comes with extra pushers, and just feels better-made overall. Plus it doesn't stain my hands with blue dye.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.22649239", "1": "0.2293704", "2": "0.12552959", "3": "0.04350512", "4": "0.09418681", "5": "0.064283565", "6": "0.2166321"}}
