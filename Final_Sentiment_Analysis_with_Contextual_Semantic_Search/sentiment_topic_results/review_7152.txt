{"text": "Cute... but so dainty, you can hardly tell what they even are when you wear them. I mean, I should have realized this by the photo. They are clearly smaller than an earring backing, so this is clearly my fault for ordering them and then being disappointed. I have still worn them plenty, and they have stayed silver, so that is nice. Also, they don't irritate my ears, like many other cheap earrings.
