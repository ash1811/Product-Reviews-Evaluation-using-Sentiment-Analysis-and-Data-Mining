{"text": "We bought this watch for a college graduate and he was impressed.First of all, the watch looks really good.  It's definitely a watch for a graduate's first job or a night out to a nice restaurant.The watch is powered by the sun.  Our graduate appreciated that fact, as he will generally not spend $15 to get a new battery.  He has a numberof watches with dead batteries.The only minor (very minor) complaint would be the band, that is brown but it's just a little over the top in terms of it's striped look.  I have this same band onanother watch and it gets worn looking after a few months.Hopefully our graduate will replace the band when it's worn, rather than replace the watch.All in all, this is a GREAT gift or even a purchase for yourself.My understanding is the battery in these watches are good for 20+ years, but by then who knows if anyone will be wearing watches any more.This is a great gift.  You could pay a lot more and not get a better, more practical watch than this.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.054224156", "1": "0.19033186", "2": "0.28302068", "3": "0.17982861", "4": "0.12008981", "5": "0.08265855", "6": "0.08984634"}}
