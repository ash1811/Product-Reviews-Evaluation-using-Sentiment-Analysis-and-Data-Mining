{"text": "I finally broke down after 5 years and bought my second pair of Acorn Slippers. I probably could have gotten another five years out of my first pair, but, I wanted another color!  My feet are always hot, so closed toed slippers do not work for me.  These are so soft and comfortable.  I throw them in the washer and dryer (not sure if that's what the company recommends) and they look and feel brand new again.  These slippers are perfect anytime of the day but especially after a day of high heels......aahh.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11679258", "1": "0.25215495", "2": "0.052911222", "3": "0.23824324", "4": "0.15325671", "6": "0.18393505"}}
