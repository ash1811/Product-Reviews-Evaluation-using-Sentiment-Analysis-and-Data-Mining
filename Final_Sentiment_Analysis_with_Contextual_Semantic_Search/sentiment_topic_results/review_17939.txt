{"text": "I have been transported straight back to the 1980s.  This watch is perfect for my needs:Cheap!Waterproof!EL light (very easy to read in dark)StopwatchCalendarDaily AlarmI really like the fit style of the bracelet and the fact it doesn't pinch my arm hairs.  I am a very large person (6'6&#34; tall) and the bracelet fits my large wrist very well.Setting the time and alarm is fairly straightforward.  I read the manual but you can figure it out on your own in a few minutes even if you don't do that.The watch is very lightweight and looks quite stylish in a retro way.  I seriously can't believe I only paid $17 for it, including shipping.  I'm now buying similar Casio watches for all my family.The only feature I wish this watch had was a countdown timer.  Oh also it would be nice if the backlight stayed on for a few seconds on it's own instead of immediately going off when you release the button.  Still, those are minor quibbles.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03563249", "1": "0.2682355", "2": "0.13867484", "3": "0.122791246", "4": "0.09341818", "5": "0.11282223", "6": "0.22842555"}}
