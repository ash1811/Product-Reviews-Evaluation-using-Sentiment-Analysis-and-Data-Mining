{"text": "Terramar Thermasilk Glove Liner by Terramar, Size 9.5-10 XL, ADULT GLOVE LINER S-491 X-LARGE 010-BLACK.These silk glove liners fit great on the thumb and middle finger, but the index finger, ring finger, and especially the pinky finger are very long for the size. I don't know what they use for a sizing model, but the main thing is that the thumb and first finger should either fit or be a little loose, to prevent ripping out the area between the thumb and first finger.  The 1 \" long wrist area is elastic, similar to the elastic area at the top of a pair of men's dress stockings.  These silk glove liners are thinner (more sheer) than the \"SSG  Silk Liners Gloves\" that I also reviewed. By being thinner, these gloves will fit more easily inside any other gloves you own. Driving gloves may present a problem if they are too snug to begin with. The last thing you want is gloves so snug that they restrict the blood circulation in your fingers, and make your fingers colder instead of warmer. Silk clothing in general, is known for providing insulation while wicking away moisture. Terramar Sports touts their EC2(R) QWIK DRI(TM)process, saying that the \"QWIK-DRI(TM) COMFORT CONTROL TECHNOLOLGY ELECTROSTATIC EVAPORATION OUT PERFORMS WICKING.\" Sounds nice, but I don't know if it really works, and is an improvement over regular silk, or if it is just a likely story marketing gimmick. Who knows, it is hard to tell by just looking at them. Buy your normal glove size. Four stars, due to the strange finger lengths.Care instructions: Machine wash warm cycle. Do not use bleach. Hang dry.
