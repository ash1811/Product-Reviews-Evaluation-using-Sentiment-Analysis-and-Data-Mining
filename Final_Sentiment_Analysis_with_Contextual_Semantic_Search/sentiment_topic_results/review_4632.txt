{"text": "While looking around for something to replace my 10-year- old topsiders, I decided to give these a try. What a pair of great shoes. They look good enough to wear with a suit, and are casual enough to wear with shorts. I love these shoes. If you travel, no need to pack more than one pair of shoes; just wear these.The leather appears to be a good quality, and the soles seem very sturdy. More cushioned than regular topsiders.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.036734108", "1": "0.45278177", "2": "0.20286606", "3": "0.20643516", "4": "0.060069576", "6": "0.037781123"}}
