{"text": "I wear a 10.5 size shoe and hoped the XL size would fit. The length only needs to be about 1/4&#34; longer to feel comfortable. I kept them because while a bit small they are what I needed for a soft slipper with a good sole. They are attractive and very well made. The cost was a factor in my decision to purchase them, too.If your size is closer to a 10 then you will be very satisfied with these slippers.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0934289", "1": "0.33226788", "2": "0.047084343", "3": "0.108535916", "4": "0.07203036", "6": "0.3428812"}}
