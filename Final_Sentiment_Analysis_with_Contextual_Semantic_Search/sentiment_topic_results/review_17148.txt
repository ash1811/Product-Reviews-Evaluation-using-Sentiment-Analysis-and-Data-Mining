{"text": "I normally wouldn't buy this kind of wallet but chose this one because I was tired of the plastic photo insert in my current wallet falling out.  This wallet has a two large zipper compartments -- aside from a small one the outside which can hold a little change and small one in the second larger compartment.  I use the first large zipper compartment for credit cards and drivers license and cash, the second compartment holds the plastic photo insert from my prior wallet.  I don't need access to the photo insert often but when I do it is there and the rest of the time it's protected from falling out.  The manufacturer includes a small mirror that is attached and useless.  That should be eliminated as it takes up space that could be better used.  The leather itself is quite stiff, I hope with use it will become a bit more supple.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.1549961", "2": "0.24735618", "3": "0.21832399", "4": "0.17204052", "5": "0.11280375", "6": "0.09227436"}}
