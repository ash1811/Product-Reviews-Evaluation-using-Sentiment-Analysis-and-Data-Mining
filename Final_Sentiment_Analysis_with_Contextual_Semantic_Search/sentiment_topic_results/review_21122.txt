{"text": "I needed to buy some nice slacks for work, and they definitely work. They're comfortable and cute. But they are also dress slacks, so they are meant to be worn with high heels. I am on my feet all day though, so high heels can get extremely uncomfortable fast. Therefore, they are an inch or two too long for my 5'6&#34; and look kind of baggy around my calves and ankles. With high heels they fall nicely. They fit nicely around my hips and thighs though. In my case, I would need to do some sewing alternations to make them look they way I wanted.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.028418755", "1": "0.23431544", "2": "0.11294394", "3": "0.22145772", "4": "0.17057383", "6": "0.22977597"}}
