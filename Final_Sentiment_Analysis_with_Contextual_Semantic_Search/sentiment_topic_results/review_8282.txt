{"text": "These are a good pair of jeans. Got the jagger style, always got compliments on them, I did like the pattern. But unfortunately just a few months after getting I lost weight and they are too loose now. I gave 4 stars just because they are a little thinner than the last 569's I bought. Now need to get more in a smaller size. Seller shipped fast.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06856571", "2": "0.20053144", "4": "0.2710602", "5": "0.1834752", "6": "0.26814944"}}
