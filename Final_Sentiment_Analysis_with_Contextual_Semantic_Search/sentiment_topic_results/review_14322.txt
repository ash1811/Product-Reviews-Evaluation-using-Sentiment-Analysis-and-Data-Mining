{"text": "However, with some adjustments of the straps, I made it fit nicely.The leather in these moccasins is soft, wearable with or without socks and is comfortable all day. We've had some hot weather lately and I was worried it might bore holes in the bottom of these shoes, but it hasn't. They're sturdy too. I wouldn't play basketball in them but they're great lounging shoes and great office shoes. I wear them to work all the time now. I definitely have less stress while wearing these than I would a pair of tennis shoes or dress shoes.Plus I can walk quietly with these and not leave a traceable shoe-tread. I mean, I don't know why I'd want to stealthily evade someone or anything, but if I had to, these would help in that endeavor.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.22159567", "2": "0.27252072", "3": "0.13514456", "4": "0.11923852", "5": "0.12680727", "6": "0.122419946"}}
