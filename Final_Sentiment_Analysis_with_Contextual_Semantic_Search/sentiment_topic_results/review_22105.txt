{"text": "I received my order ... the picture does not match the gloves that were sent.  I received &#34;Gripper Fingerless&#34; gloves not the ones that are shown.  I was a bit disappointed that I did receive the ones in the picture because they looked like a smaller fit than the ones I received.  I will keep the ones sent to me as a backup as my hands get cold and some protection is better than no protection.  Oh yes and they are in Made in USA which is a plus.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.047411263", "1": "0.13665418", "2": "0.17271602", "3": "0.32336357", "4": "0.16117235", "5": "0.15500873"}}
