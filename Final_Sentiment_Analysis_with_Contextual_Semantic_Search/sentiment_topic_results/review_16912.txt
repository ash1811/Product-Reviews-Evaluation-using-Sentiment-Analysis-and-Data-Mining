{"text": "I also own a pair of dickies double knee, and those are the only to which I can compare: and I feel the need with reviewing these as they are much alike with a few differences- though admittedly I haven't washed these yet and am comparing them as they are now fresh off the truck, I can say these are a bit stiffer, they are probably made a bit better, for me, meaning they are going to last longer, probably longer than I'll live. My Dickies are however, softer, more flexible, and more of a suede feel than these (though admittedly, maybe after a few washes things will be different)- one thing worth noting which I'll probably just learn to deal with as every piece of clothing they have their own issues, you can feel the chilly rivets through these- like, up against your skin. I do like the slightly more tapered cut of the Dickies double knee I have more than these, as they'd more likely be able to be used as a dressier pair than these Carhartts.. the waist of these are a wee bit more snug in comparison. Once again, perhaps many of these issues will resolve once ashed ten or twenty times, but upon first try, this is my initial impression. If things change I'll return and edit my opinion here in this review. Hope it has been of some use to you- by all means a pair to grab, but worthy of comparing to Dickies double knee first.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.146336", "1": "0.17627335", "2": "0.20549251", "3": "0.20993797", "4": "0.08868138", "5": "0.06287717", "6": "0.11040162"}}
