{"text": "I really like the way this watch looked, and I am disappointed that I haven't been able to get one that wasn't defective. So far, I have had three defective movements. The first one would lose an hour a week. The second one stopped randomly. The third one did not have a working Indiglo light. Seems like a nice watch, but with poor quality control.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13252224", "1": "0.24457666", "2": "0.38734487", "3": "0.22393954"}}
