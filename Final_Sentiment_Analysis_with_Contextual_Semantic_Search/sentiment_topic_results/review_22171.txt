{"text": "Started wearing the nylon Vanity Fair gowns when my son turned two - slept in the nude before that. I love these gowns. They are so soft and so comfortable. I have many colors. My son is now 19, and I'm still buying them. Haven't slept in anything else since. I highly recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.29544958", "2": "0.32443127", "3": "0.06287156", "4": "0.18244977", "5": "0.084563516", "6": "0.045609694"}}
