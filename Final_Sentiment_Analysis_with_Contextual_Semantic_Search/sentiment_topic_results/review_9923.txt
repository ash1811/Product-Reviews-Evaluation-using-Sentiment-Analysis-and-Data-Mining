{"text": "For years I owned a Timex Alarm Chronograph watch.  It was a great timepiece, all stainless steel; it took a lot of hard use and still looked good. When it finally broke down Timex couldn't fix it but only offered to replace it with a watch with fewer features.The only watch Timex offered like it iwith the same features, alarm chronograph, timer etc. was the Atlantis 100.  (I wouldn't be surprised if it has the same electronics inside.) However it is not nearly as good a watch. The body is made of plastic with a silver coating which wears off and looks shoddy. The LCD part is set deep into the watch, it is like looking into the bottom of a well, making the numbers hard to read. The clasp on the band has a way of becoming unhooked, just at the wrong times.  I don't know why they stopped making the better product; I would buy it at event twice the original price.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13139084", "1": "0.10884862", "2": "0.26124138", "3": "0.110305965", "4": "0.23846762", "5": "0.03684182", "6": "0.11290376"}}
