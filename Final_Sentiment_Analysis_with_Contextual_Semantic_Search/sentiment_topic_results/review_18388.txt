{"text": "My boots just arrived today and I could not wait to try them on.  They fit perfectly and felt very good on my feet, I can't wait until this fall and winter when I will be able to wear these out they are much to hot to wear now.  These boots match my school colors so they will look great when I go to late fall football games and winter basketball games.  I have to agree with the other reviewers that these boots do fit tight.  I am a very avid cycler and have muscular calves and thighs from many miles on my bike.  As I zipped these boots up they were tight but not a problem.  When I had them zipped all the way up the were just what I wanted.  They fit every curve in my legs snuggly and looked great.  I had been looking at these boots for about a year trying to decide if I should buy them affraid that they would not work for me because of my athletic legs.  When the price got below $40 I had to buy them and find out.  I love them and am so glad I bought them, I will be purchasing these in more colors.I am an Amazon Prime member and got free 2 shipping with this order and they arrived on time in perfect condition.  Great service, great product!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.051577304", "1": "0.44374165", "2": "0.08911942", "3": "0.150607", "4": "0.21898232", "6": "0.043319654"}}
