{"text": "this is an update, one wash, count that..one wash and they shrunk 1\" in length.  I have the same exact jeans in the inky blue from Costco and washed both for the first time together.  The inky blue did NOT shrink but this kale, did shrink and one inch makes the difference between fitting perfectly and being almost \"high water\".  I frankly was shocked to have them shrink let alone shrink an inch.  I know it may be quibbling but you expect more from Levi and face it you pay more for Levi.  Disappointed! and yes, cold water wash and rinse, no hot water whatsoever was involved.  Grrr!The jeans fit exactly how I expected.  I had purchased what I thought was the same pair of jeans at Costco for ten dollars more than the price I got here at Amazon.  I tried to get all the correct numbers off of the label and order the exact same thing here at Amazon.  Levi has a very difficult to decipher part number.  They also have a wide range of colors.  If I am buying a new pair of jeans, I prefer them looking like new jeans, I will add the wear as I wear them.  The one I got from Amazon are the same color every where but on the thighs which have that slightly faded look.  Since they fit so well I kept them but I was disappointed that they were not exactly what I wanted.  However at the price I couldn't turn them down.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06341532", "1": "0.24543715", "2": "0.124982364", "3": "0.14978218", "4": "0.14072897", "5": "0.18615152", "6": "0.0895025"}}
