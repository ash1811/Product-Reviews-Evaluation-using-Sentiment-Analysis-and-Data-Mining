{"text": "I have a similar pair of these (also skecher's) in brown, they don't match everything so had to get another in black.  These are awesome, especially for anyone who wants something quick to put on to run out in the snow or semi wet weather, as they have a nice durable non slip/skid sole..  I personally hate having to put on a bulky boot if I don't really have to (like taking the dog out for a couple of minutes).  They are true to size, might be stiff at first but take the shape of your foot very quick.  nice with a thin sock or none for a quick on off.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07697884", "1": "0.26209542", "2": "0.10091001", "3": "0.2194575", "4": "0.16539046", "5": "0.13220096", "6": "0.042966824"}}
