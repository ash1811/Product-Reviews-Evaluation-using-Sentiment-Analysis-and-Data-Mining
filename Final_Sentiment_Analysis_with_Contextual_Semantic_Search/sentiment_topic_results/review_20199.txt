{"text": "I bought this for my daughter, age 4, in the size small. She normally wears a little girls size 5, and she's very tall for her age, but this dress was still way too big for her. Very large in the bodice, as well as extremely long.We decided to keep it since it's actually very nice for the price, and obviously it will fit her for playtime for many years to come.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.054956503", "1": "0.29064423", "3": "0.27021736", "4": "0.18823962", "5": "0.075147346", "6": "0.11691773"}}
