{"text": "I bought two pair of these to wear after my c-section.  They were perfect! The waist is high so they didn't rub on my stitches/scar and the button-up top made breastfeeding access easy.  I wore these almost every day for the first couple months. I still wear them because they are so comfortable and lightweight for hot summer nights.  They wash well in the washer.  I highly recommend these.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09173288", "1": "0.23317714", "2": "0.14257444", "3": "0.14809948", "4": "0.047204345", "5": "0.22307159", "6": "0.1141401"}}
