{"text": "I've had this bag for a few years. The adjustable one-click closure, a few extra pockets and a good solid structure make it a fairly ideal man purse. I carry my bike tools and locks in it when cycling, a mini umbrella books, etc. when walking around, and my lunch. It could use an expansion panel - sometimes I can't fit odd shaped things in it.The dye is not colorfast though - get it wet and it will fade like crazy and possibly bleed onto your clothes. I wish it was just a tiny bit bigger so you could fit a magazine in it. I'm looking for something along those lines.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08587384", "1": "0.27248487", "2": "0.11620173", "3": "0.2920719", "4": "0.14450786", "5": "0.055683415", "6": "0.03317638"}}
