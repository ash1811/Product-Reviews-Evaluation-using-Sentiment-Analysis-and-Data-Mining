{"text": "These could be good sandals however the pair that i was sent, the left sandal was made screwy, one strap was so tight I could wiggle my foot in, but couldn't wear them, and I have narrow feet.  If you order these definitely size up,  I wear a 7 and the 7-1/2 barely fit.  The cost to return made it not worth it. I think the cush in the sandal is good, just made screwy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20493893", "1": "0.3579916", "2": "0.09962431", "3": "0.034193225", "4": "0.13815428", "5": "0.056365825", "6": "0.10873181"}}
