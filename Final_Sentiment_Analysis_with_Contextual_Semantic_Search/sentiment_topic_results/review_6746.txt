{"text": "This is my everyday watch.  It is good looking, well-made (for the price) and durable thus far. Only con is that it seems to gain couple seconds a day, therefore, at the end of the month, it is about minute or two fast -  I suppose it's better than  being slow but this is expected from a non-quartz movement type of watches that use unadjusted automatic movement.  It's a trade-off for not having the need to replace the battery every few years.  If you are like me and like to wear different watches for different occasions, auto-movement watches can be a pain unless you invest in auto-winder or two.I disagree with some people; I think Invicta watches in general (I have several Invictas) have decent bands that are nicely finished and have sufficient heft to them. Compared to comparable Seiko 5 automatic watches, Seikos have cheap, light weight, rough feel to them, although the Seiko 5 are also a good choice for a daily beater - their bands tend to give out long before their auto-movements do. These Pro Diver series that ape Rolex/Omega design are the ones that put Invicta on the map in the watch world.Although the style is easy to copy, customer service apparently is not as noted by many user here and other watch forums. But then, if I get several years of trouble-free use out them, I'm happy. If you want the legendary service, you gonna have to pony up for a real thing (Rolex) through its authorized dealer.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16828096", "1": "0.17033716", "2": "0.21158819", "3": "0.17259859", "5": "0.15433282", "6": "0.12054344"}}
