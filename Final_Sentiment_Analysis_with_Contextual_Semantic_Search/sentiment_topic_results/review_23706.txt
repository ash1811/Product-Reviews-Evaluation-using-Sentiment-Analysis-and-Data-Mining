{"text": "I bought these for my son and gave them to him today - his birthday.  He really likes Hanes for everyday wear.  He lives in the city and walks most everywhere.  So these are basically his &#34;walking socks.&#34;  They wear quite well and wash and dry beautifully.  They also stay white longer than most other brands.  I usually replace his Hanes tube socks every 3 to 5 years.  That's pretty good quality, and he thinks they are &#34;Sweet!&#34;", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07714652", "1": "0.493071", "2": "0.05988723", "3": "0.05237671", "4": "0.09358213", "5": "0.15038823", "6": "0.07354815"}}
