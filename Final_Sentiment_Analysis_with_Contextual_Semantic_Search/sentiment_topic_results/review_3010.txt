{"text": "Great bra for the price.  I got the Pink Belles Rose 40C but I use those Bra Extenders and therefore I can make it quite comfortable with ease of adjustment. The bra is comfortable but on the stiff side perhaps that will change after a few washings.  You can't beat the price.  I do suggest that the prices shouldn't increase according to the color that is selected.  Pink is less than the light Blue bra - don't comprehend the difference.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05168063", "1": "0.25721624", "2": "0.20872402", "3": "0.15969694", "4": "0.12195067", "5": "0.041652996", "6": "0.1590785"}}
