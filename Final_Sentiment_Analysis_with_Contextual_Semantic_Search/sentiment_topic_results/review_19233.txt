{"text": "I have a wallet similar to this one that I have used for over 10 years.  It is starting to fall apart so I was looking for a replacement.  This was the closest I could find and am thrilled with it!  Plenty of places to move my id's, credit cards, and so on over.  One limitation of this type of wallet is that it doesn't hold a lot of change very well--so I just dump it into the bottom of my purse.  The advantage of the larger wallet is I can grab it from my purse and I have what I need.  I can put it in a briefcase for meetings, then transfer back to the purse for dinner. This makes my life simple--just one thing to worry about!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.26661476", "2": "0.18983963", "3": "0.09250116", "4": "0.04100233", "5": "0.17976338", "6": "0.22728266"}}
