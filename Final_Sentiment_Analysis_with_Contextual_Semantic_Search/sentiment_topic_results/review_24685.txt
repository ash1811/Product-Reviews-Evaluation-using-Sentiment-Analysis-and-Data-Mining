{"text": "These flip-flops are really nice.  They look great.  They have nice arch support.  The rubber bottom is durable and strong.  The strap material is soft and feels wonderful on my foot.  The strap keeps its shape (doesn't collapse) and you can just slip your foot in and go. The only negative is that the thong that goes between your toes is pretty thick.  I got used to it, but I still wish that thong was more narrow/thin.  I got a size 8 and I wear a size 7.5 - 8 and the 8 fits perfect. They run true-to-size. I purchased a pair of Teva Mush Flip-Flops at the same time and these Reef Flip-Flops are 100 times better. These flip-flops are great! I gave them 4 starts because of the thong strap being so thick.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0990764", "1": "0.35851866", "2": "0.04337745", "3": "0.33879197", "4": "0.046444263", "5": "0.11155269"}}
