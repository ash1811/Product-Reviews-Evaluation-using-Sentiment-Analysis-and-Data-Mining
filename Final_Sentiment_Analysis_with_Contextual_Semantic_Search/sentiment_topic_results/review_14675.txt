{"text": "I love these boots. They are very nice looking and very good quality for the price. They took me only one day to break them in and they are now very comfortable. I stated that they are somewhat big but what I meant by that is that they are just slightly longer in the toe area than I expected. The size is exactly as I ordered and they fit me fine. I just didn't think they were quite as pointy toed as they are. However, that is my own personal opinion and I still give these boots 5 stars based on comfort, quality, appearance and price. I highly recommend them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.065256156", "1": "0.4121487", "2": "0.1781914", "3": "0.09224998", "4": "0.12409692", "5": "0.05044242", "6": "0.0776144"}}
