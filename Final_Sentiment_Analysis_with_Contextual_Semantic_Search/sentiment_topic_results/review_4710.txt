{"text": "I would have kept it but my husband is a stickler for &#34;perfect&#34;. Unfortunately he wears 38W x 29L pants. The item came in good time and was packed very well (it came with my other orders). The material is of good quality, great for guys like my husband who is &#34;hard&#34; on clothes; the jeans are well-sewn, and I like the indigo color. Too bad not many companies offer hard to find sizes, e.g. for shorter men, they offer short inseam BUT smaller waist. They tend to put together pants that they feel are proportional: bigger waist, longer inseam, taller people. Unfortunately it doesn't always work that way.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.43820813", "1": "0.21642987", "3": "0.054000996", "4": "0.15713239", "5": "0.054803606", "6": "0.07724259"}}
