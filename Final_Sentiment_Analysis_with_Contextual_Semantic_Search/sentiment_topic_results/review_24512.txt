{"text": "We own a Basset - the original hush puppy mascot, but that did not influence my decision.  I've owned Hush Puppies for most of my life, and they are consistently the most comfortable shoes that I ever owned.  They tend to run large, so consider ordering a size smaller than normal for a closer fit.I took this specific pair on a 3 day vacation to Catalina - no break in period, and never had a problem or hot spot.  In retrospect that was poor planning, but the hush puppies came through.This specific model has a very well cushioned sole, and I highly recommend them.  One note: It is not easy to get a snug fit with the fastening system.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16458085", "1": "0.16576682", "2": "0.11872131", "3": "0.3587226", "4": "0.028569391", "5": "0.028362552", "6": "0.13527645"}}
