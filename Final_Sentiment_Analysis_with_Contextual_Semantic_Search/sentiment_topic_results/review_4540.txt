{"text": "I bought these lee Jeans over 2 years ago. The reason I gave these jeans a 2 is because they shrink. No, I haven't put on weight because the Levi 501's I bought at the same time are still exactly the same fit. At first these jeans were a good fit. I always needed a belt to keep them up and they were easy to move in them. I am still around 185 lbs in weight and 6 ft plus tall. I noticed that these Lee jeans did shrink a little with each wash. I use reasonably hot water to wash them but no other brand jeans shrink like the Lee regular fit. I did buy Lee Dungarees a month ago to replace these in my normal size and they are a little big, but the Lee dungarees don't shrink. I have 4 pairs of Lee regular fit jeans in different colors. I like the style, color choice, and the heavy weight of the denim. I'm going to try for the next size up and see if they shrink down. I want Lee dark blue denim jeans that haven't been rubbed or bleached and by the look of the Lee range I can only get them in Regular Fit straight leg. I will let you know if this size change works. These jeans do shrink so remember this unless you buy them big in the first place they will shrink and may be tight on the legs and the waist. They did also shrink in the leg length. Great jeans Lee but fix this problem.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.083938815", "1": "0.2606897", "3": "0.07849541", "4": "0.12403308", "5": "0.20378844", "6": "0.24680938"}}
