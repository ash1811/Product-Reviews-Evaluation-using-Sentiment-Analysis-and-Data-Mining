{"text": "My 3 yr old needed a good quality sun hat that shades her head, face, neck and upper arms.  This hat does it AND it is UPF50+!At first I balked at the cost of the hat and dithered about whether or not I wanted to spend the money versus just getting her a little cheap hat at a discount store.  I also was a bit miffed at what the hat looked like online thinking that it would make my toddler look silly.  This hat is worth it and then some.  It shields her, provides a high UPF, offers an adjustable chin strap so it doesn't blow off on a windy day at the beach and looks cute.You cannot go wrong with this hat for sunny days.  I love it so much that I just bought myself an adult sized version from Sunday Afternoons (Adventure Hat by Sunday Afternoon Hats) which I will wear everywhere this summer if I need to be out in the sun for long periods of time.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06888767", "1": "0.14891559", "2": "0.24505875", "3": "0.23410296", "4": "0.18232764", "5": "0.062841356", "6": "0.05786599"}}
