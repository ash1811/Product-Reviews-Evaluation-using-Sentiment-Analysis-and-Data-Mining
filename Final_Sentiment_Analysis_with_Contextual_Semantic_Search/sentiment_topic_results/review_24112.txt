{"text": "For many years I have purchased sports bras from Lands End, but they stopped selling them.  So, I have been looking for a new source to replace my old ones as they wear out.  I purchased several types through Amazon, including this one (in cafe and black).  It is very much like a regular bra, but with more support and mesh fabric.  Overall is is well constructed, but I did have some seam sewing let loose where the cups cross the first time I wore it.  I would not recommend it for medium to high impact activities, which is what I mostly use these for.  But, I have found that they are a good choice as a more casual bra for weekends.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09495861", "1": "0.18196677", "2": "0.12853815", "3": "0.26600933", "4": "0.12973556", "5": "0.12166585", "6": "0.07712569"}}
