{"text": "Reading reviews I bought this bra for the lift and support. I am wondering where the lift and support is? The bra is rather flimsy, underwire is not strong, and the side lifts do nothing to lift and support. I am a Bali fan, but this bra is a waste of money for large busted women (36C, size 6 petite) looking for a good lift. The straps are wide, so if you are one who doesn't like showing bra straps with tanks, tees, this bra's straps can't be hidden. Amazing that photo shows a lift, but on me the bra buckles and stiples at the cup tops. Will not be wearing this one out of the house. Comfort? Well, because it is so flimsy, I guess you could say it is comfortable. My sugggestion is if you are small busted it may work for you.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03675477", "1": "0.2901922", "2": "0.15223269", "3": "0.27509093", "4": "0.07820282", "5": "0.059439898", "6": "0.10808672"}}
