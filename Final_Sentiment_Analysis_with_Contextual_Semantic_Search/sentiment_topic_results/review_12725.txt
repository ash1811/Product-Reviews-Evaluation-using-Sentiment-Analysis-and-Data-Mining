{"text": "I bought this for my two-year-old.  He can't tell time, obviously, but he loves watches and wanted to wear one like Daddy.  It is so so cute.  The strap is completely adjustable, so I can pull it down to fit his tiny little wrist.  He will still be able to wear it when he is much older.  There isn't a second-hand; instead, two lizards go around the dial.  It is just precious and very sturdy too.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.18021935", "2": "0.33485588", "3": "0.19270718", "4": "0.10205", "5": "0.15031472", "6": "0.036082618"}}
