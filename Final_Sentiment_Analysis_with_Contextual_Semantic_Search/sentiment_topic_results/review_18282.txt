{"text": "If you want a fuss-free watch at a bargain price, this is it.  I am grateful to the other reviewers for recommending it.  It is light weight, never a bother, keeps excellent time and at this price I think I can discard it when the batteries die (estimated at 2 years).  I still need to read the directions (which are adequate but not terrific) to change the time - but that is only necessary at daylight changing times!  Considering the price it has many features, like alarms and date functions but I just like a dependable inexpensive watch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15102503", "1": "0.066175565", "2": "0.13423108", "3": "0.13324802", "4": "0.1749325", "5": "0.17762388", "6": "0.16276395"}}
