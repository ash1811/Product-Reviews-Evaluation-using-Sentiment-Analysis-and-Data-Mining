{"text": "I live in NH and we frequently get snow and ice.  I walk the dog before going to work, and I have a need to go back upstairs to get her KONG and make coffee in my travel mug.  Well, after I've just been outside walking through snow and ice, I don't want to have to unlace my boots to run upstairs for two minutes and have to put them back on.  Problem solved!  I wear a size 6 women's boot and while I have plenty of room in these, I am concerned about my husband putting these on his 10.5 shoes.  I ended up also buying a size XL and I'm quite glad that I did so that we're both able to run upstairs if we forget something.Oh, and since I'm putting them on for mere minutes, I am able to reuse these a few times to get extra mileage out of them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.070861615", "1": "0.16742174", "2": "0.063553676", "3": "0.19089198", "4": "0.10778778", "5": "0.26240882", "6": "0.13707437"}}
