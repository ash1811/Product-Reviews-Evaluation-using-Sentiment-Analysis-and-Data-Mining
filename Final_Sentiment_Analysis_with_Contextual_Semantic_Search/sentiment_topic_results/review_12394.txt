{"text": "I had a pair of leather Sanuk sandals and after about a year my feet hurt every time I wore them.  Not sure if it was the sandal, but I bought a pair of these bad boys and my feet don't hurt at all.  They are like walking on a cloud.  For the price you can't beat it either.  Once these wear out I'm definitely getting another pair.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.37675473", "2": "0.16941667", "3": "0.10468708", "4": "0.16136144", "5": "0.07299472", "6": "0.11056965"}}
