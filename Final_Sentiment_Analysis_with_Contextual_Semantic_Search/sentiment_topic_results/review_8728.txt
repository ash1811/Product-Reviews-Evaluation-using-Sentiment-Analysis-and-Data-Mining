{"text": "I rarely wear watches, but in dealing with clients who are more old-school and traditional, they would often jest that I never wore one. I just don't find them necessary when my cellphone can keep time and I always have that.Nevertheless, I bought this watch to \"complete the look\" in a business sense. I opted for a cheap watch since I will hardly ever wear it, but it doesn't take a keen eye to tell that it's not a well-made watch. The face looks great, but the band itself seems dull. It's also a bit uncomfortable, but that may just be me not being used to watches in general.It gets the job done though. I've never changed the batter after over a year. Each time I break it out of the drawer it still has the correct time.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13878405", "1": "0.20500655", "2": "0.2475677", "3": "0.23944485", "4": "0.083777264", "5": "0.041741725", "6": "0.043677863"}}
