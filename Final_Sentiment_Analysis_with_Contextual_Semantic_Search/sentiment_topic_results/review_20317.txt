{"text": "I needed a boot to hike around the hills of Georgia and since I've used Keen shoes before I thought  I would take a chance.  I order a 1/2 size larger because I have thick ankles and I may want to use thicker socks for the winter.  Perfect fit.  I wore them a day to break them in and really didn't have to do it because they were comfortable all day and no 'break in'. I would highly recommend them for comfort.  The soft soul will work for my purpose but if you need a more firm soul select another product.  I was thrilled with the color blue and look forward to wearing them often.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07584793", "1": "0.30217922", "2": "0.024884036", "3": "0.20855632", "4": "0.112661496", "5": "0.14511451", "6": "0.1307565"}}
