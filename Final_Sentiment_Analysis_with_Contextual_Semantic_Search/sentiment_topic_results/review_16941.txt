{"text": "Bought this at the request of my husband.  He loves Carhartt.  Can't say enough about the quality.  You can't go wrong.  Just make sure you buy the right size (LOL).  I accidently bought the wrong size but returning was a breeze!! I simply asked to return, printed a label, ordered the new size and woolaa!! Easy, simple, happy, WILL return customer!!!  Thanks so much for a quality product and EXCELLENT, OUT OF THIS WORLD, customer service!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06321908", "1": "0.25816852", "2": "0.13046627", "3": "0.20979002", "4": "0.1278518", "5": "0.06260503", "6": "0.14789928"}}
