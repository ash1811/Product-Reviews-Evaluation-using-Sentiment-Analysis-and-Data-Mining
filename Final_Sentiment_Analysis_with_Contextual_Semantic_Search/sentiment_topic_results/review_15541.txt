{"text": "I have been on a mission to find scrubs that are durable, comfortable, and fit in an aesthetically pleasing manner!  These scrubs do not encompass most of these features.  They are durable, but the fit is not ideal.  They are too loose, around the waste, but they have the right length.  As a result, I am constantly needing to retie the drawstring, since my pants are always falling down, which is not ideal in clinic.  The cut is also not flattering.  The material is not soft, and it can be irritating at the end of a long day.  I have found other scrubs that I prefer (greys anatomy scrubs by Barco), so I won't be buying these again.  They are generic and inexpensive, so they do their job, but I want scrubs that are more comfortable and fit better.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.029177245", "1": "0.25382948", "2": "0.049834974", "3": "0.15667997", "4": "0.17347908", "5": "0.13828261", "6": "0.19871669"}}
