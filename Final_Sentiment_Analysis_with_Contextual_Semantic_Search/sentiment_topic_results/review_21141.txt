{"text": "I just received these pants in the mail. I ordered them for work. I'm a cook/server. I originally wear a size 5 in pants so that's what I ordered. They fit me perfect. Now, they are a little tight on the waist. But they definitely fit my thighs and butt and I expected them too. The length is perfect. I'm 5\"5 and I weigh 127.  I might've picked up a few pounds. So I say 127-135 .. :)I would def recommend these to a friend. The price is great. And there a good quality pair of pants too", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05376889", "1": "0.52421844", "2": "0.08977074", "3": "0.09329066", "4": "0.07942727", "5": "0.039769392", "6": "0.11975466"}}
