{"text": "My last Minnetonka moccasins finally developed a hole at the toe seam so I had to order some new ones. These are excellent quality and a beautiful color. My only complaint is that these and my gray pair of kilty moccasins make a terrible squeaking noise every time I take a step on tiled floors in my school buildings. The noise is literally so annoying that it sends chills down my spine. Not sure how to combat this problem. The last chestnut colored kilty's that I owned and developed a hole did not have this problem. I have just been wearing these mocs on days that I am not in class. Kind of annoying, but I do love the shoe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14217433", "1": "0.19067414", "2": "0.21833414", "3": "0.10325006", "4": "0.10159327", "5": "0.10076139", "6": "0.14321269"}}
