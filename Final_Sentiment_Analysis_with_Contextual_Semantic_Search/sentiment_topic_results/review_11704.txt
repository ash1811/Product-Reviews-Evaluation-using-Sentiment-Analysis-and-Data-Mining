{"text": "This is by far the best bra I have ever purchased and I have purchased a lot of them (and paid big prices for them too).  I have trouble with either the underwire (poking like heck), under arm area not protruding, not enough minimizing and the list goes on and on.  What I love about this bra is that it fits perfectly in all areas that you want support and provides superb coverage.  I'm actually an in between size so this does the job perfectly.  Took a long time to find this and I will not be changing.  Sure thing.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.4093619", "2": "0.09724534", "3": "0.18094674", "4": "0.0942511", "5": "0.1401501", "6": "0.07512087"}}
