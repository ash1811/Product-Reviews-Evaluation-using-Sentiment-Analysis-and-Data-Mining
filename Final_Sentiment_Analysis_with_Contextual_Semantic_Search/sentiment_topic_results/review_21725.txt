{"text": "I just recently purchased my first pair of these SPANX Women's BODY SHAPING Tights, I was very reluctant as of the higher cost of them, even compared. to the DKNY, HUE,CK,PP hosiery I normally buy. They appeared very thick when I first took them out of the package, but after trying them on for the first time I was pleasantly surprised, as they did not feel like thick tights, at all, like others I have worn. In fact I could hardly tell I was wearing them. I have to say; that they are the most comfortable tights I have ever worn. They did not bite in at the waist or roll down, at all. Actually they felt as they were like a second skin to me. I noticed absolutely no baggie or sagging anywhere. Also I do feel like they seem like they lift my derriere, but without that real tight constrictive feeling. They look great too, very opaque, with a hint of skin and my legs have a matt looking sparkly shine look to them, if that makes any sense. I think I am hooked. The only down side, besides the cost,is that the panty portion is sort of long,which could show wearing a short skirt/dress.I am glad I orderd the next size bigger,so they were plenty big,I could easily pull the panty portion up higher on my thighs to hide that. Oh yes,there was 1 other thing,they seemed like they had a peculiar odor when I first took them out of the package, but after hand washing and drying them it was far less noticeable. So I guess you can still say you get what you pay for and in my opinion these are absolutely worth the extra money. I will defiantly buy more of these tights and also recommend them to others to try but you might want to order a size bigger too.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11622192", "1": "0.20243062", "3": "0.18475041", "4": "0.07320675", "5": "0.14982262", "6": "0.27104312"}}
