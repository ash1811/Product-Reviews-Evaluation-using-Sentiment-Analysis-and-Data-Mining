{"text": "I wanted a watch with analog and digital interface. so found this witch looks great, the digital clock has big and clear numbers. the auto light function is so cool. it has 4 alarms, world time and other Casio features.the only thing i hate about this watch is build quality. my jacket scratched it on my first week. the screen is made from plastic and it catches every scratch. you can even scratch it with your finger nails if you want. not just the screen, every thing else is also cheap. after few months of everyday usage you will need to change it. bad bad bad please Casio keep the same design but make it better. add a glass screen, change the plastic case with something better. i will be willing to pay an extra 100 bucks for a quality similar to sieko or pulsar.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11220373", "1": "0.17878897", "2": "0.21427326", "3": "0.07771154", "4": "0.14280376", "5": "0.08672838", "6": "0.1874903"}}
