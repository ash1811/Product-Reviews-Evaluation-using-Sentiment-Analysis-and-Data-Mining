{"text": "First off, I am happy with the thickness, feel and knit quality of this Original Weight and have found that they wash well.My foot is 10 1/8&#34; with the second toe 1/8&#34; longer than the big toe. That would normally be a woman 9.5 or man 8 in US sizing and falls between small and medium in these, on the sizing chart. I read other reviews that suggested these may run just a tad small, and ordered the medium. It is a great fit. Perfect, in fact.I have had other toe socks and am delighted with the superior quality of these, which are 70% Coolmax, 25% Nylon and 10% Lycra. I normally like the moisture absorption of cotton, but over the years have come to be even more fond of the wickingness of Coolmax, and definitely like the durability of Nylon and the lovely caress of Lycra.I immediately ordered three more pairs of these socks. They are, of course, just what I need for my Vibram FiveFinger Seeya running slippers, but also I love having my toes separated in regular shoes, both in warmer weather and as liner sox during the cold New England winters, now that I've gotten used to that feel. I first purchased toe socks 'way back in the 1970s when living in Seattle and shopping at Uwajimaya (did I spell that right?) as they are traditionally worn in Japanese culture.  Now I don't have to fly across the continent or to the Orient to get them!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.075049095", "1": "0.49486652", "2": "0.026525905", "3": "0.10872037", "4": "0.10780819", "5": "0.042774536", "6": "0.1442554"}}
