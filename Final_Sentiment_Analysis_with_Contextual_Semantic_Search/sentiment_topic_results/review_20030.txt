{"text": "This is an awesome backpack, it is going to last me a long time. I don't use it for my laptop but I could see how it would work for that. It has great pockets in the right places, feels great on with and without weight and is not obnoxious at all. People will see the red, but there is enough gray and black to really balance it out. Whenever this one wears out I will definetely buy another High Sierra backpack. It comes with a lifetime warranty and you can't beat that!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06577195", "1": "0.35395488", "2": "0.13943769", "3": "0.07578845", "4": "0.31566727", "5": "0.046391424"}}
