{"text": "When I was looking for a watch I figured I'd spend the usual forty or fifty bucks for a so/so watch..but.. I spied this one and wondered if, at that price, it would be worth checking out.  I liked the looks etc. but couldn't help wondering if it was really a GOOD watch?  I've now had it over a year and it keeps very good time.  I use the stop watch often and have no problems with it.  It still looks good, runs good and even the band seems to be of good quality.  (though it was a bit of a challenge trying to shorten it),  Bottom line is... Don't let the price fool you, this is a great deal!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3463834", "2": "0.16891062", "3": "0.25841892", "4": "0.07521609", "5": "0.074755095", "6": "0.0741067"}}
