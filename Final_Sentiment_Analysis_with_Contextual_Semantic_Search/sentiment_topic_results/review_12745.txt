{"text": "I read reviews on everything I buy, and I agree with everyone, this boot is quality made and very durable. I wear a size 14 or 15 depending on the manufactor, so I heeded everyone's warning and stuck with my old trusty size 14, boy was I wrong! These things are huge, so I would recommend going down two sizes from what your norm is! I will buy another set of these when I wear these out, nothing a good thick sole insert and a thick pair of socks won't fix! Buy these boots!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.031444833", "1": "0.27539203", "2": "0.071913294", "3": "0.27890387", "4": "0.14460619", "5": "0.11371972", "6": "0.08402006"}}
