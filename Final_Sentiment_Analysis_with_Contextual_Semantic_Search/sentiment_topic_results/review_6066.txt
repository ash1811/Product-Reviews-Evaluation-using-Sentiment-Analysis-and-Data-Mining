{"text": "I wear a 10.5 to 11.0 in regular shoes; I ordered an 11.5 in these, but could have ordered a 12.  They are pretty narrow, but will stretch a bit after wearing a while.Very well made, look great, and are a steal at this price.  If you are looking for US made Minnetonka moccasins, these are not the ones.  These are made off shore, but still are well made.  I'd be willing to pay extra for US made moc's; but this option is not available on these.Do yourself a favor and order at least 1 size larger than normal.  I can't wear socks with mine, it's too tight, but they are OK at 1/2 size larger than my normal without socks.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.27272812", "1": "0.33085167", "2": "0.13148199", "3": "0.16351275", "4": "0.05207777", "6": "0.047067005"}}
