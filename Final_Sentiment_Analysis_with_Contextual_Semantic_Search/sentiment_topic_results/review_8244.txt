{"text": "I have been wearing Levi's 569 for a long time, I decided to get some new pieces for work etc. These things fit NOTHING like the older 569s. The waist is correct, so is the inseam. But that is about it. The seat and thighs are tight! I ordered my usual size in black and they sent a stretch-cotton! WTH! Working men don't need stretch jeans. Plus the legs are slim around the knee area resembling a 517 bootcut. The material is thin, and feels nothing like the older 569s. I am very disappointed in this product. Levi's need to to stop forcing the \"skinny jeans\" look onto their customers. If we want skinny jeans we will buy 511s.VERY DISAPPOINTED!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09015722", "1": "0.2779208", "2": "0.13735378", "3": "0.122864656", "4": "0.023303013", "5": "0.071267985", "6": "0.27713254"}}
