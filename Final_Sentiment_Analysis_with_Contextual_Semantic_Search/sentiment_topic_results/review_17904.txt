{"text": "My husband as been a wearer of Casio watches since high school... over 25 years ago!  They are amazing watches and over time we feel that the quality is still the same... wonderful!  This watch was no exception.  It is well made and arrived in a Casio box and then inside another box.  It was running when he received it and is still going strong!  Naturally, the bands are the same as ever and I am sure the watch band will break/die way before the watch does, but for the price you can NOT go wrong.  Oh, and as for the large digital numbers... hubby can read them w/out wearing his glasses.  LOL!  Great item!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.077148706", "1": "0.16556893", "2": "0.21690473", "3": "0.16653234", "4": "0.1147544", "5": "0.065193154", "6": "0.19389772"}}
