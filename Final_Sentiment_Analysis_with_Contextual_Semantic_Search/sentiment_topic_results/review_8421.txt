{"text": "Unfortunately, I'm big.  I have fat thighs and I know it.  But when something says \"one size fits most,\" I expect it not to cut off my circulation.  I understand, because of my size, that I would normally need garters for stockings, since stockings tend to bunch and roll down on me.  However, I have to wear these stockings just above my knees so they won't cut off my circulation.  I'm only a size 12, which is still in the \"average\" range, so why a \"one size fits most\" item won't fit an average-sized person is beyond me.  From now on, I'm buying stockings that have size categories that INCLUDE Queen sizes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.028153293", "1": "0.29775974", "2": "0.11165478", "3": "0.18130843", "5": "0.07692477", "6": "0.30184895"}}
