{"text": "I have been buying Lee's Regular Fit at the same size for at least a decade. They have always fit and worn pretty well. This last purchase found the waist the same but slightly larger in the seat and thigh areas than my last purchase. I'm not a skinny man so that's not the problem. I decided not to return them since this was not worth the adventure of finding another company that might fit a little better. In my experience, that's not likely. I'm not sure if this is a reaction to the big pants generation or not.Fred B.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13634855", "1": "0.276743", "2": "0.11317401", "3": "0.16101983", "4": "0.071592666", "5": "0.06582427", "6": "0.17529768"}}
