{"text": "These items are great for those of us with pokey nipples. I can wear 3 shirts and they STILL are too noticeable. The nipple covers fit easily and adhere sufficiently while coming off super easy. Rinse them, let them dry and they're good to go again. I've used one pair about a dozen times, often wearing them 8+ hours in a row. They are just now starting to loose adhesion, but given how cheap they cost, I definately got my monies worth. These are great for us smaller busted gals who don't like to wear a bra. It lets me be free and not self-conscience or covering them up with a hoodie. Wonderful product. Will be ordering them regularly.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.058262613", "1": "0.33371702", "2": "0.096405365", "3": "0.20745426", "5": "0.15766768", "6": "0.14431784"}}
