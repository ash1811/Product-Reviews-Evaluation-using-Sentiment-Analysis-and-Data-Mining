{"text": "I love the bearpaw brand, but sadly this particular style doesn't just run small, it could cripple.  When these boots arrived I was totally psyched, but when I tried them on (1/2 size larger than I wear) I lost layers of skin off the top of my foot.  In the end felt like one of the ugly stepsisters attempting to try on the glass slipper....yeow!  I'll continue to buy bearpaw, just not any boot/shoe with this design.  Needless to say these have since been returned.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.23066714", "1": "0.2502905", "3": "0.28036794", "4": "0.18331906", "6": "0.048957434"}}
