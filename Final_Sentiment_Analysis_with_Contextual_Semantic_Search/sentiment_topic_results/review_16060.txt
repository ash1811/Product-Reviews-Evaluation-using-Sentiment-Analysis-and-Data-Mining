{"text": "Perfect cut, totally true to size. (I wear an 11) very comfortable. I had two other pairs of this brand ( not this style) and they were great, too. I have a wide foot and the straps are a tad tight but after wearing them for a few hours, they seemed to stretch just a bit and with no blisters.  I will wear these every day and all summer.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10080742", "1": "0.4068134", "2": "0.05925508", "3": "0.24388386", "4": "0.13494112", "6": "0.049662687"}}
