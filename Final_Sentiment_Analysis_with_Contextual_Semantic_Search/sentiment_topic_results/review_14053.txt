{"text": "I wear this watch everyday, for everything. I have to say up front I didn't buy this on Amazon, but I wanted to give it a review here anyway, as I like it so much. I was given this watch as a Christmas gift a few years ago by my wife and as I'm a retired Marine, she bought it at the PX. So it was a little less expensive than you see here ($250 vs. $276). In any case, IMO it's well worth the money. In fact I think it's worth much more. This watch is heavy, big, thick, simple and has no stopwatch, no alarm, no nothing special really. But it does one thing really, really well. It keeps great time in ANY conditions. I have worn this diving, during adventure races, fishing, hiking, rock climbing, hunting, doing military PT, including running \"O\" courses. It has never failed me. It looks great in any attire, people ask me about it all the time. I rarely take it off and hope to have it for the next 20+ years.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06720006", "1": "0.2656493", "2": "0.18051703", "3": "0.10775059", "4": "0.2148917", "6": "0.16155848"}}
