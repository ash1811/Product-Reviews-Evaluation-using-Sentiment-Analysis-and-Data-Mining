{"text": "I give these four stars because of the fact that they came so cheap and didn't break after four uses. I ordered about 10 pairs of these sunglasses because I kept losing them. So far, they haven't broken or anything. The lens don't fall off either, unless you put them in your pockets and go around bumping into every object known to man. If they fall on the ground they can get scratched easily, unless they fall on carpet on some soft thing like that.Now, what I don't like about them is that they don't offer superior protection against the sun. The reason I didn't give them five stars was because I was expecting to be able to look at the sun without having the color of my irises melt off my eyes. If you just want to dim the brightness somewhat these are the perfect sun glasses for you.However, if you want a cheap alternative to this, which, in my opinion, is sexier and offers better UV protection, get the &#34;G&G; Mirror Aviator Square Sunglasses Chrome Deluxe Spring Hinge&#34; sunglasses.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2227744", "1": "0.42139566", "2": "0.13926128", "3": "0.08693815", "4": "0.03443061", "5": "0.06440502", "6": "0.030794881"}}
