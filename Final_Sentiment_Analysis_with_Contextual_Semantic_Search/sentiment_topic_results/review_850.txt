{"text": "What's more to say? I own three pairs of Reef Fannings.These are the most comfortable, dressy and casual flips you can wear. I have a super clean pair for summer nights when I need to dress up, a worn pair for daytime activities and a backup pair to change into in case my nice ones get worn out.The built in bottle opener has come in handy many times. The sole grip is good for around 2 years (depending on your wear frequency).These flips are well made of quality materials and they won't let you down or leave you stranded.I'd find it very hard to buy any other flip after having worn these for three+ years now.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06703613", "1": "0.35614878", "2": "0.15511468", "3": "0.20036186", "4": "0.06733563", "5": "0.02093213", "6": "0.13307074"}}
