{"text": "I bought this watch to wear on the weekends so I don't beat up my good watches. I knew the band would be small and weak but I had an older expansion type band from another watch. When the watch arrived I cut off the canvas band, put on the metal band set the time and date and put it out in the sun for the rest of the afternoon. I have not touched it since!! I select and wind what good watch I want to wear during the week and when Saturday morning comes I grab this one, put it on and go! The luminous hands and markers are very bright at night! I am a large guy and a larger dial would have been nice. However if you can get an eco-drive that never needs a battery for this price that is alway set and ready to go after sitting in the dark for a week then you have the perfect weekend watch.This is the only Citizen watch I have ever owned so I cannot attest to durability. Accuracy has been dead on! I guess since all the WR-100/200s have the same movement pick the one that suits you and you are all set.I would buy this watch again and will buy another if I ever need to do so.Good Job by Amazon on delivery, good job by Citizen to make a reliable product that is technologically advanced and fits the needs of most guys.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2355142", "1": "0.22109622", "2": "0.17832656", "3": "0.13346784", "4": "0.14177173", "6": "0.08730663"}}
