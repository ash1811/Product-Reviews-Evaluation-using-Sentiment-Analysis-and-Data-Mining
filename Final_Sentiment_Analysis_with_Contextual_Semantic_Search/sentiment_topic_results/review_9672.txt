{"text": "I never intended to use the band that came with this watch, so I won't comment on that.  The watch istelf was set to a date about 15 days away from actual, so I had to wind it for a long time to reach the right date.  In the process, the winding stem came out.  I was able to screw it back in.  On an older Timex that would never happen.  Timex used to be the go-to cheapie that still had reasonable quality; great for people like me who are a bit hard on watches.  Somehow, I don't think this one will be around very long.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1501903", "1": "0.20084836", "2": "0.15713666", "3": "0.123741716", "4": "0.1615739", "5": "0.13385616", "6": "0.0726529"}}
