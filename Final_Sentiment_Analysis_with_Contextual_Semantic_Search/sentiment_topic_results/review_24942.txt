{"text": "I have been wearing Superfeet for (at least) four years. I wear them in my sneakers, and am pleased to say that they really help me. I have had fallen arches since I was about eleven years old, and I am nearly thirty now. It is so important to take care of your foot health. Your feet really do support your entire body. If you don't have proper support it can effect your knees, legs, back and basically, the entire structure and way in which you carry your frame. I try to walk at least a mile a day, and I have noticed significant difference in my feet, ankles, shins, legs and even back when I don't wear orthotics. It isn't a positive difference. I really need them every day, any time I intend to walk for an extended period of time, or stand on my feet for a while. Superfeet Unisex Green Premium Insoles are cut on a bias, for maximum coverage of feet. I am a size 11 in women's shoes, so, I greatly appreciate this. If need be, you can cut the toe section of these insoles to fit the shape/contour of your shoe. The latest pair I purchased did not require trimming. They fit in my shoes perfectly. Also, these insoles usually last upwards of a year for me, so it is an extremely good investment, and well worth the money. Yes, they are a little more expensive than insoles you might normally purchase at the drugstore, but, the investment really does pay for itself, and is also a very important means to take care of your foot and arch health. We are only born with one pair of feet, and we have to take care of them, so that they can take care of us!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.19862933", "2": "0.079203956", "3": "0.1668583", "4": "0.11678363", "5": "0.27392504", "6": "0.162241"}}
