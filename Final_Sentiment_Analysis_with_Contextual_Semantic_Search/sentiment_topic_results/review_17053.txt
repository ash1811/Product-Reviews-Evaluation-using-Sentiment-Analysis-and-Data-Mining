{"text": "I can't stress enough the importance of being fitted properly in a store like Nordstrom, Bloomingdales, or Bravissimo.  If you are being fitted at Victoria's Secret, you are most likely wearing the wrong size and if you use your VS size to order this bra, you won't be satisfied.That being said, this bra will probably work best for people with larger breasts (D and above - I wear a 32H).  If you have little boobs, by all means, don't spend this much on a bra and definitely wear something more comfortable!!!  This bra is worth its weight in gold, though for people like me who want the firmest support possible and are willing to sacrifice a little bit of comfort for it.  This bra really gives a great natural lift that other bras can't even come close to.  Yes, it is a bit stiff, especially at first, but it looks wonderful under clothes and, with the little bows, it is as cute as it can get for such a functional bra.  For women with a small back size and large cup size, it doesn't get better than this.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.046629213", "1": "0.26249412", "2": "0.019976635", "3": "0.23540655", "4": "0.088806316", "5": "0.2688872", "6": "0.0778"}}
