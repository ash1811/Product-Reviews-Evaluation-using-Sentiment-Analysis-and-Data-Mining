Not all watch bands fit in the guide, but you can remove the handle and use it without the guide base. I broke one pin and bent one pin so far, but there are plenty extras. Would be nice if there was a depth adjustment for the guide to account for bands of different thicknesses.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12946743", "1": "0.26299533", "2": "0.19340634", "3": "0.043569557", "4": "0.18302006", "6": "0.18385856"}}
