{"text": "This is made in china and must be a size 0. I wear a size 10 and could not get this cheaply made &#34;nightgown&#34; over even half of my body!! If I had left the lacing about 12 inches across, perhaps I could have gotten the garment to stay on. The photo for the item must be either photoshopped, or a different item.  If you are going to sell Chinese made items in the states, at least get a sizing chart and sew accordingly. Especially with one-size-fits-all garments!
