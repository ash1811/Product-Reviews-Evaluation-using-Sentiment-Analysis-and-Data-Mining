{"text": "These are so soft and flexible, but I have to say, they are stitched very closely to the edge (didn't use to be) so I'm not sure how they would hold together if trimmed to fit. So make sure you get the exact size of the boot. (don't know why you wouldn't, but I threw it in there anyway) Every year I buy a new pair of these which also fit my Emu boots as well as my Uggs. I take the year old pair and put them in my house slippers and house socks...nice! If you wear Emus by any chance, these insoles are much more comfortable. Buying a new pair always snugs up a stretched out pair of boots just enough to make them feel like new again. Well worth the money.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11448765", "1": "0.2667267", "2": "0.15718468", "3": "0.24163814", "4": "0.08946542", "6": "0.1281409"}}
