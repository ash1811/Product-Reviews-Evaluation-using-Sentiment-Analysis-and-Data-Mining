{"text": "Will leak after about a year or less of sea water use.  Even after soaking in water after each surf session(Made sure to check dial knob was depressed), it will not keep this watch from surviving.  Cold will leak some water into this watch.  I bought this cheap and it works for non surf usage so I'm not rating low but others who rated this to work for water really need to reedit those reviews because I'm sure they have leaked by now.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03304642", "1": "0.09904467", "2": "0.2615138", "3": "0.31141508", "5": "0.1769567", "6": "0.114846185"}}
