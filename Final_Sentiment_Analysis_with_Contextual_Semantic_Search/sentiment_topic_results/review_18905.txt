{"text": "I have also submitted a detailed review of a khaki colored pair I bought of these jeans.  As mentioned in other review, you will find these to be very true to size.  The cut is wonderful as they follow original designs of Levi products with a butt that does NOT sag, wider legs but a cuff that is regular, not a taper or boot cut design.I like the weight of the material as well.  Not a thin denim nor a bulky or heavy material either...just right!  I own a few different pairs of these in different colors and caution you on this particular color (Inky blue) as the color will bleed if not washed before wearing.  I also recommend you wash separately the first time.  I have owned these for a couple months and worn several times and found that the color bleed was very minimal and the separate washing was only done the very first wash cycle.  I kept my rating at 5 stars simply because these darker jeans are to be expected to have some color bleed.  The great thing about these is that even after a half dozen washes the color is still that same rich dark blue as I expected.Shipping was quick through Prime and packaging was in a poly bag and sent in a mailer pouch.  All around a winner for Levi's and me!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.05692406", "1": "0.32484466", "2": "0.087103575", "3": "0.15997441", "4": "0.13219245", "5": "0.13448542", "6": "0.10447541"}}
