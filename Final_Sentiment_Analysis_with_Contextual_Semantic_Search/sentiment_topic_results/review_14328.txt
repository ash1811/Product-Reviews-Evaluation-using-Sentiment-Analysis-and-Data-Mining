{"text": "The pictures I saw of these shoes led me to believe I was getting sturdy, comfortable shoes with a rounded toe. In person the suede is very thin and so is the bottom. The base is also not wide enough for my feet so it feels strange to walk in them. The worst part is the toe, which is not rounded but square on my pair. I actually thought I'd been sent the wrong pair initially. I hate square toes because they look masculine on me. The only thing these look ok with are flared jeans. I'm tempted to give them away.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11849872", "1": "0.43777", "2": "0.23383576", "4": "0.100840054", "5": "0.074504465", "6": "0.031839162"}}
