{"text": "These are awesome garden shoes! I was so happy they are exactly what I wanted. I was between ordering an 11 or 12. I chose the 11...and it is perfect! The short heel makes them convenient to slip on/off. They are heavier than crocs...and I like that. Perfect for slipping on and going outside for awhile. Not for walking hours on end.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.34919626", "2": "0.09523101", "3": "0.15906475", "4": "0.18641718", "5": "0.12941295", "6": "0.076051205"}}
