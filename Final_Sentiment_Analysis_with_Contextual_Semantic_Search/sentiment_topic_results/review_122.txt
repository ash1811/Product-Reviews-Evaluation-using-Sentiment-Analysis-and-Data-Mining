{"text": "My son is a big man and needs 4X and 5X clothes.  I ordered two of these and they were reasonably priced around $25 each.  I noticed they are more expensive now, however, they might even be worth a few dollars more than what I paid.  They are plenty large and warm, we do get a few cold spells in Florida and this will serve its purpose for him when he goes out on those cold nights.  You don't need a lot of coat here, so these are perfect for the few cool nights and mornings we get here.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3630528", "2": "0.05281538", "3": "0.18023725", "4": "0.14396988", "5": "0.1269519", "6": "0.12985797"}}
