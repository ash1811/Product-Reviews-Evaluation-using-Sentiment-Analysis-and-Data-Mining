{"text": "I order ankle bracelet 4 years ago from Gem Avenue and it just brook. I never took it off and silver color never faded away. I wear a size 7 and 9' ankle bracelet fits me perfect. After the first one broke 4 years ago I purchase one in store (different brand) lasted 3 days. So I came back to amazon to re order same one. Item was shipped within 6 days and already using it. I love Gem Avenue ankle bracelet so much.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1508892", "1": "0.15150903", "2": "0.1039923", "3": "0.19652137", "4": "0.18097089", "5": "0.043744843", "6": "0.17237236"}}
