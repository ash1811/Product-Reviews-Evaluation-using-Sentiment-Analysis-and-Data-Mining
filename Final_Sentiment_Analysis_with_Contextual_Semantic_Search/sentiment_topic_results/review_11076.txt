{"text": "I was given a pair of Acorn slippers about 20 years ago.  I literally have worn them every winter...and although the soles show no wear out the memory foam on the inside sole had worn thin.  I found these replacements on line at Amazon.com and ordered my size.  They arrived just as advertised and fit perfect and feel so comfortable and warm on my feet. I plan to  order another pair next year in a different color.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.154357", "1": "0.28062832", "2": "0.10317659", "3": "0.21067427", "5": "0.08899334", "6": "0.15890786"}}
