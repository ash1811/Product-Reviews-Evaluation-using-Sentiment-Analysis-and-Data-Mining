{"text": "This bra was great in the beginning over a short time the material started stretching out and I find myself having to keep adjusting the straps to pull my boobs back up in place. I purchased three but I wish I could return them. Plus side they are made from a nice soft fabric , shoulder straps are comfortable and they wash well , they are not the worst bras I have ever had. But if I know that I would have to keep adjusting the straps all day, they would not have been my first choice.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.050298866", "1": "0.33834684", "2": "0.15725394", "3": "0.23027113", "5": "0.11994289", "6": "0.1008386"}}
