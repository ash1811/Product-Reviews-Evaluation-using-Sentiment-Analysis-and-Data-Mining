{"text": "Having left my small umbrella in the grocery basket, I was looking for a replacement.Based on the reviews I purchased this product. It was the size I wanted and the price seemed reasonable. I put it in my car and I have yet to use it so I can't comment on how well it works except to say the automatic oprning mechanism seems to work fine. The umbrella also looked well made. I am happy with my purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.23746765", "1": "0.20400797", "2": "0.07256844", "3": "0.08777025", "4": "0.1173272", "5": "0.15629227", "6": "0.1245662"}}
