{"text": "Comfortable, stylish, and very sturdy. I haven't washed them yet, so this review may be updated after the first wash. I hope they hold up because I really love them!!  I originally gave these 5 Stars ...~~~~~~~  THIS IS AN UPDATE TO THE ABOVE COMMENT:Now I give these 3 stars at best ... COMFY, PRETTY, APPEARED TO BE DURABLE ... BUT:I did wash them after this original review above.  The right slipper fell completely apart.  I loved them SO MUCH and am so disappointed.  Because they are white, they do need to be washed every other week at least ... I used the gentle cycle, warm water, mild soap, and when I opened the washer, there were pieces/parts everywhere!  Only the RIGHT slipper fell apart, the left one held its shape and looked fine.  I have NO IDEA what went wrong with the right slipper.  :-(", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.079223625", "1": "0.306301", "2": "0.10827217", "3": "0.10849177", "5": "0.22437069", "6": "0.17093687"}}
