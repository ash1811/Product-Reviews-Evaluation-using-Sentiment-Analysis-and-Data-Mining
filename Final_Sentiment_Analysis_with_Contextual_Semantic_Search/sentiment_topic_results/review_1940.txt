{"text": "My picky husband has been wearing these slippers almost every day since Christmas. He wears them while walking all around the yard and driveway, watering plants, pulling weeds, or just sitting on the porch with his coffee.  Not only do they still look great, but he says they're the most comfortable slippers he's ever owned, and he loves the support and safety of the rubber sole. Definitely a winner.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.16705814", "2": "0.07822028", "3": "0.1227874", "4": "0.09558089", "5": "0.42865148", "6": "0.10402858"}}
