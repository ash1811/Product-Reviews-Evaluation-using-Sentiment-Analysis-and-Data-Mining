{"text": "After the resin strap on my super cheap Casio finally broke, I decided to replace it with a super cheap Casio with a nylon strap-in the hopes that it would last longer. I settled on this watch-although the name says &#34;Resin Strap&#34; the strap is actually nylon and some leather-like material.On the plus side, it has the usual basic watch functions, is low-priced and seems sturdy. On the minus side, the aesthetics are a bit &#34;bleh&#34; and it is a bit annoying to set. To set it, you have to push the mode button 3 times (from the time &#34;screen&#34;) to get to the set mode. The 12/24 hr button changes the numbers. To move between the number (seconds to minutes to hours etc.) you need to push the Light button. You also need to wait a bit before switching again-if you push the button twice or more quickly it will just switch once. Push Mode again to get out of the setting  mode.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19957694", "1": "0.2867632", "2": "0.19838822", "3": "0.015125475", "4": "0.050571386", "5": "0.04929754", "6": "0.20027724"}}
