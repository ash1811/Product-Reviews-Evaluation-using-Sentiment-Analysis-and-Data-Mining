{"text": "I was expecting these to be a more \"tan\" color, but they are definitely a darker brown than I consider \"tan\".  That said, I don't hate them, but they're not really what I wanted.  I guess they are not far off from the picture in shade, but I was expecting them to be closer to a \"tan\" than they appear, and also didn't expect the glossy appearance.
