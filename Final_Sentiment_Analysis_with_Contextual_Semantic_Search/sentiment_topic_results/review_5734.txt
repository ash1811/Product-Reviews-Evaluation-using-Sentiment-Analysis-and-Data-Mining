{"text": "I normally wear medium t-shirts, but I read here that these Beefy-Ts run small, so I bought large. I am 6'2\" and 180 lbs, and these fit me well in the shoulders, neck (~16.5\"), and length, but the girth of the shirts is roomier than I would prefer. They seem like they would fit a man of my height who weighs 200 or more. They do shrink after (hot) washing and warm tumble drying, for sure. The weave is dense and satisfyingly crisp; they really keep the heat in.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15717307", "1": "0.17956465", "2": "0.1622051", "3": "0.28127936", "4": "0.107679136", "5": "0.088759765", "6": "0.023338903"}}
