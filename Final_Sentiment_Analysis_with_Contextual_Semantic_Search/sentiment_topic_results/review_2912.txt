{"text": "I bought this pant long time ago... Maybe a couple of years ago... And definitely... It's my favourite Adidas pant ever... !!! I wear it almost everyday... It's fantastic to exercise... Or simply take a walk around the block... The fabric is GREAT and comfortable... Nice fit and colors... Maybe It's a little baggy... But that's not big deal because I like that way... A lot of room on my legs... In fact... I ordered a few days ago a new one in Black... 100% Recommended.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04867789", "1": "0.3552441", "2": "0.09205264", "3": "0.22532822", "4": "0.044486474", "5": "0.127002", "6": "0.10720866"}}
