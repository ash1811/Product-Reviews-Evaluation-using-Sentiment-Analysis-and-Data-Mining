{"text": "Invicta's automatic watches that utilize the Miyota Japanese movement, in my experience, are great work-horses.Others have written in more detail and with more knowledge than I could...but I wanted to put my vote in and say \"job well done!\"I have several automatics [including the regular \"scallop\" 8926] and this one, with the \"coin\" bezel, is a classic-style, and easier to turn than the scallop-style bezel. I am not sure what the difference is between the \"OB and the \"C\", though...anyone care to comment?My watch came in pristine/new condition and worked beautifully out of the box. If they allowed, I would have given 4.5 stars [nothing is perfect!...5 stars leaves no room for that...but this is darn close ;-) ]", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2682615", "1": "0.11382016", "2": "0.20725772", "3": "0.08023609", "4": "0.14459695", "5": "0.07769405", "6": "0.108133495"}}
