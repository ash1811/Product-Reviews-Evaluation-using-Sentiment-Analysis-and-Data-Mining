{"text": "I always wear Saucony because they run wider.  I usually power walk using the Saucony Hurricane but just couldn't see dropping $125 for shoes when I have previously picked them up for $65-70.  so since I no longer run, just walk hard, I tried this shoe because it is also designated for pronation (like the Hurricane).  I was worried I wouldn't adjust to a heavier shoe, but so far so good.  Didn't feel like they needed any breaking in.  They have a lot of support but I still use them with a prescription gel orthotic.Novemeber 2013 - I have now worn these for months and would definitely buy them again.  I think I needed the heavier shoe with even more support.  And being a girl, I love that they are white on white and match whatever I am wearing.  Look nicer than running shoes.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07540142", "1": "0.23956957", "2": "0.18632525", "3": "0.16792987", "4": "0.07208342", "5": "0.141923", "6": "0.11676752"}}
