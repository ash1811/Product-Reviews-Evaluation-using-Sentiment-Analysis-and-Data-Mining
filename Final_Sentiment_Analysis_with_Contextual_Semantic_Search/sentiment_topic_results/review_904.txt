{"text": "My daughter wears a women's size 11, so I purchased these in a men's 10. She loves the way they feel. I just hope they last. Will update if something goes wrong with the shoe.P.S. What's with the metal bottle opener on the bottom of the shoe? As if I would want to drink out of a bottle (or whatever was poured out of a bottle) that had been opened with this shoe bottom bottle opener. People (and animals) spit, piss and whatever on the ground and you walk thru it and then use this opener? Oh, hell no!UPDATE: I bought 5 different pairs of mens sandals for my daughter. The Reef Fanning is by far her favorite, most comfortable pair. They are also the most casual pair. I still remind her not to use the bottle opener on the bottom.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.036492165", "1": "0.24282578", "2": "0.27689075", "3": "0.04056644", "4": "0.09681546", "5": "0.20535", "6": "0.10105935"}}
