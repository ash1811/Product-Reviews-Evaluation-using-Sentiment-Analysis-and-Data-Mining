{"text": "Slighly small for me, but as I have gained weight recently I can not fault anyone but myself.  I normally wear a size 6, and these are a size 5.5 - 6, so the fact that they are slightly snug is not the manufacturer's fault but mine.  The color is very pretty, and they had a good solid sole and are well made, glad I bought two pair at a fab price.
