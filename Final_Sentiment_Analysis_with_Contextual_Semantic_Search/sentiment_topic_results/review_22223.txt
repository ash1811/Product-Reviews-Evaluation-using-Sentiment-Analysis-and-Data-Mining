{"text": "We bought several tutus at once, and they are got high reviews. Sturdy and seemingly well-made. The girls have been wearing them regularly, including out to play, and the tutus have stood up well. Fits the 3-yr old & the 5-yr old well. Clearly plenty of room to grow. Only con is that when the kids pull off the tutus, the waste band gets twisted, and an adult has to un-tangle. But this is not difficult.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07504306", "1": "0.20984498", "2": "0.22255266", "3": "0.12171696", "4": "0.03796011", "5": "0.27651438", "6": "0.056367844"}}
