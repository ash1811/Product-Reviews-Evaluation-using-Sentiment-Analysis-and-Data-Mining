{"text": "My brother lives in a small town in Louisiana and never finds shoes that fit well. I took a chance and ordered these and sent just knowing the size he said he wears. He received them on time and really likes them. My one complaint - is that they are called Sport White, so named by the makers I guess. When ordering I just looked at the picture and to my mind they were &#34;Bone&#34; (which they are). I get my confirmation of order and the shoe is described &#34;Sport White&#34;. I think, Oh, no, I meant to order beige or bone - - so I try to cancel the &#34;Sport White&#34; and order them in Bone - - only to discover that Bone is called Sport White by some color blind Rockport ad writer. I am advised by Amazon it is too late to cancel  (which means 2nd order was processed in the speed of light!) and I (my brother in Leesville) may refuse delivery on the second package. Which he did. But I have yet to hear from Amazon about a credit on the second pair.  Meanwhile, My advice is for someone somewhere to get themselves a color chart. Beige/Bone is not Sport White. And it would be nice to be advised of a credit without having to inquire.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14012715", "1": "0.25612453", "2": "0.08635949", "3": "0.12691608", "4": "0.1289363", "5": "0.04571151", "6": "0.21582495"}}
