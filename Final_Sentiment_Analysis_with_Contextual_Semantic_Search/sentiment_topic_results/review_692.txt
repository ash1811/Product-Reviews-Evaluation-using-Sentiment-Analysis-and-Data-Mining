{"text": "I have bought this style in the past so I knew they would fit.  So I bought more in size 9.  They are comfortable but seem to run a little small.  But not so small that they are uncomfortable or that I want to buy a bigger size.  Just more snug.  My previous purchase said they were made in Costa Rica and these say Honduras.  I don't know how that makes a difference, but these are definitely a little tighter.Even so, I prefer them to most other underwear and I really like the comfortable waistband.  They do shrink a little in the wash, but I find they really hold up in general.  I took these underwear (my previous purchase) abroad for 6 months where I had to hand wash them and hang them in the sun... this will destroy clothes pretty quick.  But these held up great.Jockey isn't what it used to be... the material feels thiner now.  But I still prefer them over other underwear for comfort.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11034637", "1": "0.34235826", "3": "0.3275065", "5": "0.057823975", "6": "0.15684877"}}
