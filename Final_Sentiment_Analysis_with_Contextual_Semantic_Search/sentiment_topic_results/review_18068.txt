{"text": "I was ready for something a little different from my trusty Timex whose battery had died so I decided on this watch. I do like the look but functionality was lacking.It fit me OK but as others have said, it's only for smaller wrists. My wrist measures 6 inches.As others have also said, the end of the band does not want to stay in the keeper and when it escapes, it pokes straight out.The ultimate reason why I sent it back: on the very first day of wearing it, I found it on the floor without even noticing it was off my wrist. Luckily this happened at home but I sure would not keep a watch that can just jump off your wrist.I suppose that the end of the band got loose and then was able to work all the way loose. I was just at home doing regular stuff like opening the mail, checking email, etc. The watch is very light and comfortable so its absence from my wrist was not felt. I was very surprised to start to walk into another room and find my new watch laying on the carpet.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12223376", "1": "0.28334525", "2": "0.0965053", "3": "0.0988291", "4": "0.19491413", "5": "0.2017815"}}
