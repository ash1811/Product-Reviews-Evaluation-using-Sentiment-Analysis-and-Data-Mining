{"text": "I bought these slippers when Amazon had them for less than $15, so I probably shouldn't complain, BUT... First, the size is quite small. I wear a 10 and ordered a 10 and an 11, based apon others reviews. The 11 BARELY fits, and I can feel my toes bumping against the ends of the slippers when I walk.As far as quality goes, the slippers do look nice, but unlike other similar slippers I've owned (and paid a lot more for) there is little to no cushioning inside the shoes. I'm not just referring to the cushioning between your feet and the floor, but between your feet and the seams where the sole is sewn onto the bottom. I can feel the pronounced ridges of the seams all the way around the bottom of my foot, and they make standing in the slippers for more than a moment or two quite painful. If the slippers were bigger, maybe I wouldn't feel it, but I finally had to put in a pair of insoles, which did help a bit. All in all, I'm pretty dissapointed.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15041178", "1": "0.16416444", "2": "0.05063749", "3": "0.19244389", "4": "0.22480278", "5": "0.082554124", "6": "0.13498552"}}
