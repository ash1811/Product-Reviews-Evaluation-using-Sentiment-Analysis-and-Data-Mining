{"text": "This hat is way too big for my 8-month-old baby (who is 99th percentile in length and 95th percentile in weight, with a proportionately large head).  It is impossible to keep on his head (even when he is not trying to take it off).  The hat appears to be good quality and might work well for him a few months from now, but it is much larger than you would expect for a \"6 - 12 months\" size hat.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06258362", "1": "0.3713384", "3": "0.40257454", "4": "0.10307887", "6": "0.05342999"}}
