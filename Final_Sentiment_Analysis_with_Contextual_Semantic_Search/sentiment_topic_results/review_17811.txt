{"text": "I purchased a model DW-5600E with module 1545 in Feb 1997 for use while crew on a sailing ship.  The primary reason I chose this watch was its slim design.  I needed to be able to fit the watch inside a tight sleeved jacket.  The paperwork that came with it said the battery should last about 2 years with normal use.  I have been wearing this watch for the past 13 years, using the backlight sparingly.  In addition to being captain and crew on sailing vessels, I am also in the landscape construction business.  Although I don't think it has ever been completely submerged, this watch has been subjected to violent storms at sea, being dropped from extreme heights, burying in the mud, and various other abuses over the years.  It is STILL RUNNING on the ORIGINAL BATTERY.  I did replace the band about 6 years ago after it got brittle and broke.  I paid only $25 for it back then, so that works out to less than $2 per year.  Best bargain I've ever had.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12155053", "1": "0.19517112", "2": "0.16474742", "3": "0.086144075", "4": "0.20607635", "5": "0.0963497", "6": "0.12996088"}}
