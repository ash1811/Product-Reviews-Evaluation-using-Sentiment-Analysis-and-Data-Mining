{"text": "I'm so glad I read the reviews about going with a size that is SEVERAL sizes larger then you normally wear.  My husband normally wears a 32/34 and I got this in a 38.  They are just right.  There is no way a 32 would have fit.  Also, these were approx $40 cheaper then at my local farm store.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10834367", "1": "0.1643205", "2": "0.05418207", "3": "0.3750733", "4": "0.17496385", "6": "0.11833729"}}
