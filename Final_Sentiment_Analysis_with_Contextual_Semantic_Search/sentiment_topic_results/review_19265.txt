{"text": "This is the 3rd Invicta watch that i have purchased from Amazon.The 2 tone bracelet is just stunning...had to remove 2 links and fits fantastic. Probably 1 of the best looking watches that i ever owned.Keeps great time, only off 2 seconds over 3 days. So glad i got the 38mm face..watch looks like it meant for my wrist.I also have a 43mm Invicta.I now prefer this over the oversize Divers Watch.I will probably purchase Invicta again.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.21579506", "1": "0.26047897", "2": "0.09463681", "3": "0.11959968", "4": "0.12444668", "5": "0.13329095", "6": "0.051751833"}}
