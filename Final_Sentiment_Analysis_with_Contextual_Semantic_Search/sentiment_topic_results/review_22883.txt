{"text": "I bought these shorts for casual wear around the house while recuperating from a broken hip.  They are easy to wear, the material is soft, and the fabric breathes to release moisture.  They are well made, and durable.  Have washed them a few times and they still look and feel like new.  These are definitely a great buy, especially if you want comfort in a pair of shorts.  By the way the color isquite attractive.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.102576956", "1": "0.39616883", "3": "0.12960108", "4": "0.054082163", "5": "0.09830828", "6": "0.21568568"}}
