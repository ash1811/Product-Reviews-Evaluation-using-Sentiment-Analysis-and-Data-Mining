{"text": "I misread the description when I purchased this bra because I was looking for a sports bra not a support bra.  However, it turned out to be great for either use.  I've mostly been using it to workout and keep me firmly held in place.  After doing laundry one day I decided to try it out just as an everyday bra under my regular clothes.  Because I'm top heavy I have always worn underwire bras to give me the lift and support I need, so I was pleasantly surprised how well it looked under my non-active wear.  I have such great support from this bra that I will have to buy another one to dedicate as an everyday bra since I no longer want to wear my underwire bras.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.02292233", "1": "0.21409889", "2": "0.080079325", "3": "0.3599423", "4": "0.048885748", "5": "0.12208197", "6": "0.15198949"}}
