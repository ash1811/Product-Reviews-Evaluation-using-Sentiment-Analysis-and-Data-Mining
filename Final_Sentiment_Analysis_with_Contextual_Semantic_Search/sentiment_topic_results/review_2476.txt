{"text": "Let's start with this - Rainbow sandals are by far the best you'll ever buy. They last forever and actually have arch support.I had purchased a pair of small Men's sandals 9 years ago because they didn't have a large enough women's size at the store (I wear a 9).  They lasted all that time through daily use while in college in Florida.  As they recently got a small tear in the strap, I purchased these women's sandals because I had always wanted the more feminine thinner strap.  Based on the reviews, I went a size down and purchased the Large (7.5 - 8.5).  The strap was extremely tight but the foot bed was the right length, maybe slightly small.  Unfortunately, my dog ate them after one use (the new leather smell is quite strong).  So the next time, I purchased the next size up plus a pair of men's for my husband.  The strap was just as tight, but the foot bed was way too long.  So I returned them.  After trying on my husband's pair and realizing how comfortable the strap is on the men's, I plan to go back to the Men's small.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.081979476", "1": "0.25826234", "2": "0.12496002", "3": "0.18882762", "4": "0.15120521", "5": "0.08401846", "6": "0.110746905"}}
