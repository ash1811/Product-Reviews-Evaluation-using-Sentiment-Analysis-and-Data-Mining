{"text": "I bought a pair of short boots last season and these for walking my dogs when it's rainy, wet or muddy out.  They fit great, no break-in period required, very sturdy and wife off or clean off easily.  LOVE THEM and love the KEEN brand.  Will definitely be back for more.  These are shoes that will last more than 1 season which is great!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.065809086", "1": "0.41744733", "2": "0.16278075", "3": "0.077422775", "4": "0.11999197", "5": "0.120738216", "6": "0.035809856"}}
