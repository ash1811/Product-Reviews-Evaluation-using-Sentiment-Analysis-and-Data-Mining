{"text": "I purchased these for my son who wore his Skeletoes without socks the first time and said he needed socks. Odd coming from someone who loves to wear his sneakers without socks...He is between a size 7 and 8 mens so I purchased the small (size 5-7). They are a little tight but I was afraid if I got the next size up they would be swimming on him. They fit fine and snug which is probably good since you don't want a lot of extra fabric in these form fitting shoes.So far so good. They were comfortable for him to wear all day and when he first put his foot in the Skeletoes with the socks on he said, \"That's so much better.\"We'll see how they hold up with use and washing. I'll come back and update after we've used them for a number of months.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.057983875", "1": "0.4407483", "3": "0.012178554", "4": "0.033858065", "5": "0.3000773", "6": "0.1527924"}}
