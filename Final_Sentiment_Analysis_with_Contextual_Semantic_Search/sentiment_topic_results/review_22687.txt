{"text": "I said finally, because I have been looking for girls brief at different retailers without  any luck. Seems like nowadays girls just want to wear boy shorts, hipsters and bikinis. My daughter is a little more than a little over weight and I don't want her to use the styles I mentioned because I don't want her body to start deforming! Yes, I said deforming, because I have seen how my body deformed by using those tiny underwear. I highly recommend this brief if you have the same concern. I ordered a size 12 and fit my daughter perfectly, I thought about going to size 14 but I guess those will be too big for her. So far, they haven't shrink, and even if they do  I guess at this price I would just order more.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18898243", "1": "0.21004859", "2": "0.066628404", "3": "0.079189256", "4": "0.17771977", "5": "0.11440151", "6": "0.16303004"}}
