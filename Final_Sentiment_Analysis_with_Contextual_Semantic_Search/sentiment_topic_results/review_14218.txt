{"text": "I was a little skeptical ordering these sandals online but they are the most comfortable flip flops I have ever own. I ended up ordering a second pair in black so that I could wear them at work. They are \"dressy\" enough to wear on casual Fridays at work and look great with a summer skirt or dress. I'm usually a size 7.5 and I ordered my sandals in size 7 and they are a perfect fit. Highly recommend it and fabulously as stylish beach shoes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10974502", "1": "0.43440425", "2": "0.15625516", "5": "0.17542595", "6": "0.11792689"}}
