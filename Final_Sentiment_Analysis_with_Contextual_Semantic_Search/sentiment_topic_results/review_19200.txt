{"text": "This is the perfect wallet for someone who carries a lot in their wallet.  I often just carry this instead of my whole purse.  It can hold your checkbook, plenty of credit cards, store savings cards, and more.  It also has a great calculator and a place to hold a pen for balancing the checkbook.  The quality is great and it even comes in multiple colors.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14300248", "1": "0.32971394", "2": "0.21323833", "3": "0.12165842", "4": "0.14805642", "6": "0.040242266"}}
