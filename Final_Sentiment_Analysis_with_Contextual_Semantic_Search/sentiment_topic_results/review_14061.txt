{"text": "Yeah it's a little big, but it fits great. I haven't taken it off since it arrived. After the first day or two you don't even realize you have it on. The strap is different, but it keeps the watch secure and doesn't allow it to flip around on your wrist. It's super accurate (so far) and the second hand lines up with the markers... which is very important on a quartz watch.This one is definitely a keeper!UPDATE:I've been wearing this watch almost 24-7 since the day I got it. Last night I took it off and noticed that the metal band keeper, was wearing a hole in my wrist. Looks like I'm  going to have to find a different band for it :(UPDATE II:I was wearing the watch 24-7.. or, I was wearing it while sleeping. I stopped doing that, and the metal keeper stopped wearing a hole in my wrist... fair trade if you ask me!
