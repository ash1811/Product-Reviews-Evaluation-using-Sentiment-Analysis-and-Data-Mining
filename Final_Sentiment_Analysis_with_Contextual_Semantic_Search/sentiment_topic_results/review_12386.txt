{"text": "These are by far the most comfortable flip flops, or slippa's if you from Hawaii, you can buy.  I've been wearing flip flops my whole life and when sanuk married their slippas with yoga mats, and birthed these bad boys, my feet were in heaven.  The reason I labelled these as durable is because I have a previous pair I bought 5 years ago that I still wear to this day.  However, when the price dropped to $9, I had to upgrade.  Actually, I bought two pairs for myself, one for backup, and then I bought another two pairs for my dad at the insanely low price.  The green color goes well with living on the island of Oahu.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for a comfortable and durable pair of slippas.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09972015", "1": "0.44714692", "2": "0.17510477", "3": "0.12574013", "4": "0.04975608", "6": "0.10025519"}}
