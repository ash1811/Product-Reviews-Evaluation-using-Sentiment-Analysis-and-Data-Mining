{"text": "This is an absolutely beautiful watch. Big, chunky, well made. I bought it because the women's version of this is way too tiny, and I'm into oversized watches lately. I had to take out 4 links for it to fit properly.The watch is heavy,  the ring turns easily, the numbers are clear, and the date is easily readable. The only issue I've had with it (and it's not enough for me to knock off a star) is that it's really hard to get the stem in the right position to change the date. Other than that, the watch is exactly what I wanted.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.050104585", "1": "0.34440818", "2": "0.33188194", "3": "0.04265218", "4": "0.10612717", "5": "0.06793971", "6": "0.056886207"}}
