{"text": "I am a size 16/18 in bottoms & size 20 in tops. I ordered a size 1/2x & was worried about how it would fit my tummy considering I have had 4 children, one just 3 weeks ago. It has great length & is not at all too tight in the tummy area. I found it very comfortable & flattering. My only small flaw is that it may be a little large in the breast area, I am a 38D & while it seemed to fit & look ok in that area, the netting is larger, like it is meant for much larger breasts. Even if you have smaller breasts though there is no need to worry because the shoulder straps are adjustable.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.26753956", "2": "0.030246457", "3": "0.23743059", "4": "0.15522604", "5": "0.07941862", "6": "0.22757737"}}
