{"text": "I guess I got the measurements wrong with this item, but when it came in, it was pretty dingy. The watch face is really small, there is no light option, and reset bottom seems like it's falling off when trying to hold down. Overall the concept is cool, I like the retro 1980's kick back to the watch, the calculator seems easy to use, just keep in mind the buttons are pretty small, but considering the watch/calculator combo, it's not bad.Pros--------Seems durable, but pretty small, and looks a little \"girly\" on a bigger dude like meCalculator is a nice option, especially being in the medical fieldCons---------No light that I can findreset button is not durablevery flimsy and small", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15170984", "1": "0.08956513", "2": "0.15781094", "3": "0.30775276", "4": "0.025431937", "5": "0.117504686", "6": "0.15022467"}}
