{"text": "These are so comfortable! I wear these for hiking, camping, every day, even for amusement park visits. Open enough to breath but closed enough to feel comfortable in cool weather. I will be wearing these until it gets really cold out. Great sole and grip too. Worth the price. I was also impressed at the color and style options - mine came delivered as accurately as expected too.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22665288", "1": "0.14107913", "2": "0.03441922", "3": "0.05918874", "4": "0.16712177", "5": "0.31630886", "6": "0.05522945"}}
