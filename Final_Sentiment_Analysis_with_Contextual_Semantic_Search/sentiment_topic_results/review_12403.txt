{"text": "These aren't fashion leggings. The crotch droops down a little low and, while they fit snug on the legs and butt, they are a little loose around the waist and crotch area.They are, however, great for exercise and workout. I wear them when I dance and I have a great range of flexibility. They are also very comfortable and warm (lycra).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.4015109", "2": "0.110583305", "3": "0.14246677", "4": "0.10977948", "5": "0.13856506", "6": "0.09262354"}}
