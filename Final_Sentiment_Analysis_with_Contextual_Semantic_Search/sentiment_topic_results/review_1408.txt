{"text": "When I was in high school several decades ago, I remember my and my friends' Jansport backpacks being much sturdier-built than this one.  I bought this sight unseen for my nephew just because he specifically asked for this brand backpack for his birthday, otherwise if I were in a store looking for a non-specific-brand backpack I am sure I would not have picked this one.As the previous reviewer noted, the materials and build quality simply do not impress.  I guess Jansport is just living off of its name cachet while outsourcing production to the lowest bidding sweatshops in Asia, like all too many product brands these days.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.16127282", "2": "0.19270174", "3": "0.19534881", "4": "0.07026126", "5": "0.14400616", "6": "0.23380663"}}
