{"text": "I've been a fan of Savane dress pants for years, and these did not disappoint.  I'd put them up against my $90 pants from Jos A Bank and Men's Wearhouse any day.  They do it right for the big man, they don't just make everything larger like most brands.  They keep the legs reasonably thin (because my waist is bigger doesn't mean my calves need to be 3x bigger too).  They also have the belt loops in the right places as well (big men will understand...).  Quality pants, very comfortable, and the sizes are always right with Savane too.  None of that \"these run smaller\" stuff.  All that for the price of terribly made Dockers?  5/5 without a doubt.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08711664", "1": "0.23173524", "2": "0.17196195", "3": "0.20355046", "4": "0.21104692", "6": "0.09245166"}}
