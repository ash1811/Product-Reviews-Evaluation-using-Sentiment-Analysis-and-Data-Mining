{"text": "I have these as well as the 3 fringe boots and while I love them both, I tend to wear these more. I think the 3 fringe boots are perfect for spring (adorable with dresses and skirt and shorts) while these are better for fall (I have the pile lined ones for winter). I like that I can wear these with straight leg and skinnies and they still look adorable. It looks very casual chic to wear these with ankle length straight leg jeans all frumpled around the top. these are really comfortable and work well as everywhere shoes. I'm considering buying a pair or two in another color to supplement these. I really wear them everywhere and with everything. I can even get away with wearing them to work sometimes. My boss has a pair of the tramper boots as well.They are insanely comfortable, with a nicely padded footbed, soft suede upper, and very flexible sole. The grip on these is not quite as good as the kilty mocs, with the little rubber nubby things, but they are still grippy. I navigated across a sheet of ice yesterday without issue. I have walked up to 4 miles at a time in these without a single blister. While there is very little arch support, I never find that to be painful in Minnetonkas, not sure why. I found them true to size. I have narrow-ish feet with very tapered toes (big toe is the longest). If you have wider feet you might want to size up.These are probably my favorite Minnetonkas I've bought and way way way more versatile than they look.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.032048073", "1": "0.3735546", "2": "0.0772745", "3": "0.09172084", "4": "0.12788995", "5": "0.21404824", "6": "0.083463795"}}
