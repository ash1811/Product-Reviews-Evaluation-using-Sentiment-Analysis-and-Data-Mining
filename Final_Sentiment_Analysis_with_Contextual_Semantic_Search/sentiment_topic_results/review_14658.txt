{"text": "I bought the Levi's Men's 501 Original Fit Jean, Dark Stonewash, 38x29.  Other reviews said that the Dark Stonewash was the best material.  However as someone who used to own multiple pairs of 501's years ago I was sorely disappointed.  The cut is not what it used to be.  These pants should have fit my butt perfectly, but it seems the cut is now a bit saggy in the butt and crotch.  The material is a lot lighter and cheaper than what I remember too.  Original fit???  Shrink to fit???  Nope nada no way!  I have already washed them and there was no shrink to fit.  My pair of jeans were made in Malaysia.I recommend going to a brick and mortar store and trying out various brands and sizes as Levi's which I used to be able to buy just by size is no longer what it used to be.I give these Jeans only 2 stars: Minus 1 star for bad material, minus 1 star for bad fit, minus 1 star for not being American made any more.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15393648", "1": "0.5285424", "3": "0.15525685", "5": "0.057512034", "6": "0.100263186"}}
