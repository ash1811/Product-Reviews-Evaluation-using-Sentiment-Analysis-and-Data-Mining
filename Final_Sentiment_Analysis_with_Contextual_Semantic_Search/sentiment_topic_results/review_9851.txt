{"text": "Ordered these boots for my son. He is 5'11&#34; and 175 lbs. He has a long but wide foot and these boots fit perfectly! He likes the low cut because of summer weather and they don't look odd with shorts . The steel toe is a necessity in construction.They are just perfect with some thick ankle socks. He wears them after work, as well. Great strength, wet doesn't seem to hinder them; just simply comfortable working and wearing boots!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04347478", "1": "0.52743703", "3": "0.09815471", "4": "0.22531332", "5": "0.09893892"}}
