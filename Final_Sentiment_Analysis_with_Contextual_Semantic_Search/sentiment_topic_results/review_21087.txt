{"text": "It won't hold heavy canned goods like a cotton canvas bag, and is a little smaller than paper grocery bag. Good for the beach or knitting carryall. The fabric seems to be polyester with a waterproof coating inside that also stabilizes it. The plastic smell does go away in a couple of days IF you open them up to air out. There's no stiffener in the bottom so it folds very flat. While the seams are stitched adequately, they are not finished on the inside, though a couple of colors do have taped seams. But for $3.50, they are a bargain.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0703456", "1": "0.18251252", "2": "0.14250787", "3": "0.264489", "4": "0.096382745", "5": "0.15442184", "6": "0.08934044"}}
