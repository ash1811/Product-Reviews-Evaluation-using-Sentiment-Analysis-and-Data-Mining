{"text": "Feet change with weight. I lost more than 100 pounds and my feet changed with the loss. I went from a 10-10.5D to a 9.5-10B.  As I lost weight, my feet kept changing sizes and my shoes were just all over the place on how they fit. So, I got these. On some shoes, I used THREE heelz to get them to fit again.Now that my weight is stabilized and I got rid of the Wide size shoes, I use these for when I like a pair that's just too tight at 9.5 and too loose at 10. Very handy to have around.If you have unevenly sized feet (like one foot is a half-size bigger or smaller than the other), or you're losing a lot of weight, or you just have feet in-between sizes (not quite any standard size), these might help.NOTE: BE CAREFUL. The glue is VERY sticky, and once placed, I find them a chore to reposition or remove. Be very careful that you're placing them in the right place and you get it right the first time. :)I also find that some shoes, even expensive ones, can manifest a weird sensation on a seam, With these, you can cover that seam (cut the Heelz or use it whole if the shoe is slightly loose). I've used them on the sides, not back, to cover an annoying seam causing an abrasion.I was really happy to save some of my fave shoes (a suede pair of 9 West in size 10 that were flopping off my foot, and I had that same style in two colors, just a style that I love). By adding Heavenly Heelz to make them fit as my food shrank. :DHave happy feet!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11066864", "1": "0.2062792", "2": "0.19737491", "3": "0.124972425", "4": "0.16212916", "6": "0.1961493"}}
