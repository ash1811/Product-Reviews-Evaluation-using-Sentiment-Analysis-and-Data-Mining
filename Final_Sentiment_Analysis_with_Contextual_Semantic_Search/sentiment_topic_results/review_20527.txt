{"text": "Used this to remove four pins out of the Diesel sba watch.  The band was to wide to fit inside the holder so I unscrewed the pin punch and used it manually by hand.  I lined the punch up with the pin and pushed really hard being careful not to scratch the watch.  When the first pin came out my hand was to close to the pin and it stabbed me.  After that I realised how sharp the pins where and to place the hand holding the watch away from where the pins would be exiting.  The next three pins came out without incident.  I was able to resize my watch and now it fits perfectly.  Great tool that works as advertised and paid for itself the first use.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.087032", "1": "0.32818002", "2": "0.2151189", "3": "0.16355535", "4": "0.109047875", "6": "0.09471044"}}
