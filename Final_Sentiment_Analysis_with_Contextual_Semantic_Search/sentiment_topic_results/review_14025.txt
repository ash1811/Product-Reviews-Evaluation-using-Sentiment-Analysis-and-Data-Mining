{"text": "I bought these for my husband, who is a 31-year-old with an athletic build. They fit well, look modern and are versatile - can dress them up or down. The color is nice. My only warning is that you must wash these jeans before sitting anywhere in them - they left quite a stain on one of our suede chairs - I still have to try to get that out. We bought another pair because he liked them so much. The really great price sold us.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1283915", "1": "0.36566916", "2": "0.090379186", "3": "0.17001198", "4": "0.21452975", "6": "0.02751507"}}
