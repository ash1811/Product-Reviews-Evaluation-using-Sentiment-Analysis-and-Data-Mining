{"text": "I purchased this, as recommended by a therapist, to provide some compression to alleviate some of my special needs daughter's sensory seeking behavior.  She recommended buying a size smaller than normal, so I purchased the 2-4 (my daughter wears size 4-5T).When this came, I was a little upset, because it didn't look like it would fit at all.  I honestly thought of keeping it as a fairy costume piece for my 7 month old, that's how small it looked.  That said, when I put it on my 3 1/2 year old (who wears size 4-5), it was just a bit tight, which was exactly what we wanted.  No doubt this would easily fit a child who wears sizes 2-4.  The stretch is awesome.The material seems decent, it has held up to washing without fading, and we are happy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22431885", "1": "0.2392775", "2": "0.15184338", "3": "0.27596036", "5": "0.03644706", "6": "0.07003921"}}
