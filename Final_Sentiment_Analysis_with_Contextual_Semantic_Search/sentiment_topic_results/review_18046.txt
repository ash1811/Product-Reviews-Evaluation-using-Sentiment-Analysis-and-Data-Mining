{"text": "i like many of you dont like a watch thats all plastic. and amazon needs to come up with better filtered search results. i searched through almost five thousand watches to find one that had an all metal stainless steel case. this one looked nice and what attracted me to it was the fancy extra dials. i wanted a watch that looked like it was expensive. a watch for dress occasions. the watch does not have a light to see it in the dark. which i believe it should have, the smaller dials are extremely hard to read, you almost need a magnifying glass to read them.5 stars for the fact that its all metal. 2 stars for the fact that it badly needs a light and the smaller dials are hard to see.overall, its a good analogue watch to have. and its metal, not resin plastic that the majority of watches are made of.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13639793", "1": "0.10445385", "2": "0.25687855", "3": "0.20054924", "4": "0.13527936", "5": "0.023692522", "6": "0.14274856"}}
