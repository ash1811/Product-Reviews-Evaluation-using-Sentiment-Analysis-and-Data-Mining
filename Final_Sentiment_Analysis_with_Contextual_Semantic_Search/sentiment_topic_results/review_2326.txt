{"text": "I have an old pair of black Dockers plain-toe oxfords that are well broken-in and, though a bit cheap looking, respectable enough dress shoes. So I thought I'd get a pair in brown. Compared to the $200 shoes I've been wearing, these new Dockers feel like they're made of plastic. Very shiny, very stiff, and just totally lacking in the soft leather feeling I was looking for.
