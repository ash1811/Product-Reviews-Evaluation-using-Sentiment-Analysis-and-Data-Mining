{"text": "I've had several G-shocks over time.  I was actually looking for a G-shock that was sort of &#34;bigger&#34; in diameter.  I found that the diameter of this watch to be &#34;just right&#34;.  It wasn't as big as I expected it to be (I was looking for a big ass diameter watch, something that will immediately draw attention to it).  This one is sort of subtle.  Not really a &#34;WOW&#34; watch.Overall, the watch is what you can expect from a G-shock: tough and durable.  I have worn this in several mountain biking activities, and it's still working (granted, it hasn't been through a major spill yet).  I'm also a fan of the G-shock look.Other reviewers are right: that the long hand sometimes cover the digital display making it hard to read, but it's OK with me since I only use it for the date function.Buttons are a bit hard to press but still workable.  Not too big a deal.Luminosity of the hands and the number is OK but a bit subdued.  You can still read it though.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.060033835", "1": "0.23325023", "2": "0.14136179", "3": "0.1709259", "4": "0.056901872", "5": "0.13199149", "6": "0.20553489"}}
