{"text": "Amazon usually has the perfect watch at the perfect price, but I still manage to go through these Timexes at a fairly alarming rate.  No complaints about the watch itself, but about the 3rd time out I was perhaps overly hasty in strapping it around my wrist.  I couldn't get the pin to lodge into one of the holes in the leather band--and then I discovered that the pin had bent in the middle by 180 degrees.  I held my breath and was able to straighten it without breakage.  I'm still breathless each time I strap on the watch.Cost-cutting by employing a cheap pin for the strap may not be the best place to start.  Even a watch that runs a tad slow or fast is better than one that won't fasten to your wrist.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.29762724", "2": "0.19469716", "3": "0.22536701", "4": "0.042720933", "5": "0.21694711", "6": "0.02029385"}}
