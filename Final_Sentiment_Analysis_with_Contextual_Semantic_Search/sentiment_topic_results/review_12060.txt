{"text": "I noticed some of the reviews \"love\" this necklace.  While it is a very nice necklace, there are many similar options available at other retailers (brick and morter) which allow you a chance to look at this, and others like it, before you buy.  I buy EVERYTHING on Amazon; I've not bought a single Christmas present this year from a store, but when it comes to something like this you may want to review your options in person, pricing is about the same.The chain is of good quality, the pendant is as described, though personally i thought it was a little \"plain\".  If you know this is exactly what you want go for it, but if you'd like to see a few other options easily I would (and wish I had) look around.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.26433393", "1": "0.34693158", "2": "0.041078523", "3": "0.051913485", "4": "0.16782485", "5": "0.017787611", "6": "0.110130005"}}
