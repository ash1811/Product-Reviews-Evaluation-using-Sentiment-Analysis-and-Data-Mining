{"text": "I have a terrible time finding shoes and boots - I can find almost nothing that doesn't give my heel blisters.  Hiking boots, are, obviously, a nightmare.  These are fantastic.  They are comparatively light weight for the support they provide.  They provide enough room in the toe and good arch support (without being too much arch).  I wore them to walk a few miles in the park to break them in, but I didn't get blisters and they were comfortable right away.  I went through more than 10 styles and makes and this is the clear winner.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1559396", "1": "0.25312787", "2": "0.15388647", "3": "0.20150867", "4": "0.09713677", "5": "0.13553876"}}
