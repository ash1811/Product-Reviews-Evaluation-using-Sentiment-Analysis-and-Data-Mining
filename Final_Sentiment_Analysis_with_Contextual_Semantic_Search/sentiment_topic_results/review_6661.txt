{"text": "I do a lot of walking, 3-5 miles a day, so I need something that will hold up and last a long while. These socks pull the moisture away from my feet and keep them cool. The cushioning is great, not too thin or thick, and the upper cushion pad prevents my foot from rubbing against the tongue & lace area which is great since I have a bone spur in that location. I've been wearing Thorlo's for years and I highly recommend them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.041746415", "1": "0.1642147", "2": "0.20897761", "3": "0.15406825", "4": "0.14084429", "5": "0.20663403", "6": "0.08351472"}}
