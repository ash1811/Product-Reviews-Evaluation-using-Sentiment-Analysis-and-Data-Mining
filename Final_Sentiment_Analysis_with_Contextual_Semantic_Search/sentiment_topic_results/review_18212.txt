{"text": "Casio Men's CA53W Databank Calculator Watch. Module No. 3208.One of the things that I really like about this plastic watch is that it is very light in weight at 0.3 ounces. Casio makes a lot of fancy watches with as many functions as a Swiss Army knife, but they also weigh as much as a Swiss Army Knife. I would not wear a big, heavy, clunky watch, no matter how fancy it is. I do not need a weather station, compass, and altimeter on my wrist or shirt pocket.  Some of these fancy watches really overdo things in terms of what I really need.At $14.97, this watch is pretty much in the disposable range when it comes time to replace the battery in five years.  I tried to replace the battery on one of these watches, but the flimsy rubber water seal broke when I removed the back, and I do not know where to get a replacement rubber seal. So, I broke down and spent $14.97 (including shipping) to get a new watch. This watch is handy, but the calculator numbers are very tiny, and the calculator functions are printed in dark red against a black background, making them impossible to read except under a bright light.  My ability to read small numbers and symbols is fading, so I may have to get a different model calculator watch with more visible numbers and functions that may not \"look adult\", but who cares, as long as I can read it. This watch will be on the back of my clip-on glasses case anyway, held on by a couple of heavy rubber bands under the clip. I have been using this Casio model for years, and except for problems replacing the battery, I have not had any other problems with it. One thing I would like Casio to add is a button and light for the display.CASIO COMPUTER CO., LTD., 6-2, Hon-machi 1-chome, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo 151-8543, Japancasio.com/products/Watches/", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.18898085", "2": "0.21811002", "3": "0.14710407", "4": "0.20715693", "5": "0.10507416", "6": "0.13149923"}}
