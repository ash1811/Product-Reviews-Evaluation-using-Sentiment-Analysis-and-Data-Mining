{"text": "I decided to go cheap this year for costumes.  I got tired of spending $35 a piece for 4-6 costumes which got covered up by coats because it was too cold/rainy to go out without one.  Plus with three super hero crazy lovin' boys, it was a hard deal to pass up.  Before you get too excited, remember these are just sort of a tabard like thing.  They slip over the head and tie around the waist.  Personally, I was cool with that.  That means no trying to dress warmly and squeeze the costume over the top.  I was able to dress them in everyday clothes (complete with jacket) and then just throw this on top. Guess what?  Not one sniffle or cough this Halloween!  Cheapie costumes for the WIN!!  Batman comes with his tabard (cape on the back) and a mask.  Superman has red leg covers (these just pull on, like thin padded leg guards) Robin has green arm guards and a mask.  The masks attach by elastic band that join in the back by a tiny piece of velcro.  I can see this piece wearing out if it's worn a lot, and the masks were by far the worst part of this set.  They were a great detail piece to add but they don't really fit the face well.  I had a four year old wearing the Batman mask and it was just sort of like the eyes didn't set in the right place and then a 9 year old wearing the Robin mask and he had the same trouble.  Almost like it poked them in the eyes to wear them.  I don't think it was a child size issue seeing as they were so spread apart in size.  But the best thing yet is that they now have three super hero costumes I can leave out and let them play with all the time if they want.  No more having to tie on a blanket for a cape.  :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18701957", "1": "0.22832395", "2": "0.08310068", "3": "0.25208646", "4": "0.08726647", "6": "0.15996137"}}
