{"text": "There is honestly no question about Seiko and the way they've delivered with their watches. They definitely handle with the best of intentions, and the way the watch should be designed for the owner, as a triumph. That goes well with all of their watches, and this Seiko automatic watch is a absolute perfect example. This Seiko Men's Diver's Watch is a comfortable and convient watch that handles very well in comfort, and water resistance, over 600 feet. So you can definitely go swimming with the watch, and it will still keep on ticking with the motion of your wrist. The price and the watch is definitely right, and you'll continue to keep watching the watch for all this is worth from Seiko.Price: BComfort & Setup: B+Overall: B 1/2+", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.11221417", "2": "0.34638157", "3": "0.14984499", "4": "0.17456327", "5": "0.08652993", "6": "0.12795517"}}
