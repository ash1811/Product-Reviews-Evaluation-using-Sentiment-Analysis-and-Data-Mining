{"text": "I am a pretty normal guy. Not fat or overweight at all. I run, so my thighs are also bit muscular. These are skin tight on my thighs and seat. There is almost no rise in these jeans. For reference, I ordered the 31 waist and had room for a water bottle between the waistband and my waist. So, skin tight thighs and seat, but oversized waist.
