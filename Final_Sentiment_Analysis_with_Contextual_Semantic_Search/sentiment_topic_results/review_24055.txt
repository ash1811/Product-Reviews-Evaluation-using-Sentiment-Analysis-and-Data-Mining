{"text": "this was my 4th merrell purchase and as previously experienced, they are the best.  this shoe is a little bulkier (less feminine) than my others but also has more cushioning. great stability as always.  will make an excellent walking/hiking shoe as the sole tread is aggressive. this will be my go-to shoe for the next few months as i rehab from an auto accident and the extra comfort and stability will be a great asset. i highly recommend this shoe and this brand. sizing has been consistent in all four styles. delivery was quick and as always, thanks amazon for the great value!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.26947093", "2": "0.17560114", "3": "0.23484373", "4": "0.1152206", "5": "0.106156826", "6": "0.09594457"}}
