{"text": "This watch for the size is very comfortable. If you have a smaller than average wrist you might think twice before purchasing. The back is straight not curved so a larger wrist works best. This watch keeps good time and the chrono functions are easy to operate. At 200 meter w.r. this is a good sport watch. The band is extremely well made for the price; in fact people will pay as much for a band/strap like this as they would for the watch. A good watch for my collection  and I am sure if you get one you will also like it. Lots of good fortune and Namaste'", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06304086", "1": "0.26817378", "2": "0.31873217", "3": "0.13185288", "4": "0.111014076", "5": "0.104715735"}}
