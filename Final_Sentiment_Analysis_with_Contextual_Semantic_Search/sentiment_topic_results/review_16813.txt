{"text": "I ordered these while deployed, as shower shoes.  I had to walk across rough, golfball size rocks to get to the shower.  It was tearing through my cheap flip flops.  I used these daily and never experienced any noticeable wear and tear.  For a durability, i give these a 5 of 5.If you need them for something similar, i recommend.
