{"text": "I chose this boot after reading several reviews on many different boots. I purchased these boots for my Lake Tahoe vacation in the Summer time. They were very comfortable and it provided the stability that I needed for my ankle for the different terrain. Also, the support for the toes was highly needed as I walked in to little rocks here and there while mountain hiking. I would recommend this boot to anyone.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.3374727", "1": "0.30658343", "2": "0.030938298", "4": "0.2583782", "5": "0.058877908"}}
