{"text": "Got this for my daughter to start 1st grade and she just started 2nd with the same bag.  It went on vacation with us and everything and is still holding up great.  Others asked us where we got it.  Lots of pockets are good.  Its a little big for the younger grade kids but that way I can fit her lunch box in it too", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10767604", "1": "0.3705681", "2": "0.20969127", "4": "0.045772787", "5": "0.19675407", "6": "0.06519291"}}
