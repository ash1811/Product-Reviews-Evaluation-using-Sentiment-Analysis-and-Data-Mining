{"text": "Bought this for my 4.5 year old daughter. We got the pink in small. It fits her great. The sleeves are a little longer then the small Danskin we bought. So if you have a little one with longer arms you'll like this. It's not to long for my daughter as they stay up well. This one also has a liner that covers the entire front panel. I like that it will offer a little more warmth. It seems very soft and of a good quality. I expect it to last a long time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10796815", "1": "0.44958895", "2": "0.14604518", "3": "0.013525111", "4": "0.12452652", "5": "0.092771195", "6": "0.06557487"}}
