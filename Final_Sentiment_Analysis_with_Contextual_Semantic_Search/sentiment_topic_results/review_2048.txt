{"text": "They fit very comfortably right out of the box.These shoes are terrific for style. My first pair were in 1977.The same company, same levels of quality, same classic iconic timeless look.What in the world can you rock for decades and still love? Not a lot.These are awesome. I really like both Sebago AND Sperry. Because they are both fantastic.Worth every penny.
