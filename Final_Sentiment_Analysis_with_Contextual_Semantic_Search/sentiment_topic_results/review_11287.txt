{"text": "I bought this stuff to re-glue insoles in a pair of mocassins and a pair of Florsheims, where my bare foot/sweat were sticking to and pulling out the insoles.  The stuff goes on easily, clamp or mash it down(I put the shoe on and wobbled my foot to set the glupe), let it sit overnight and that's it!  I can't comment on other uses, but it sure worked on my shoes!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08480364", "1": "0.15439294", "2": "0.22594805", "3": "0.18548974", "4": "0.13768628", "5": "0.20780893"}}
