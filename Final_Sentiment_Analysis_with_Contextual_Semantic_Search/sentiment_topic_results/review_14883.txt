{"text": "This backpack very comfortable on my shoulders and back since its straps are padded. The material is nice and pretty thick, although at first the smell might be an issue. The side pockets are big enough that I could pack in two regular water tumblers on each pocket). The stitching is nice, but mine tears up a bit on the top pocket. Not a problem, though, since it doesn't influence the zipper or anything. I don't mind the giant main compartment since I'm not picky with my packing, and I could pack a two-week stuff for backpacking, including sandals. All in all, it's practical and neat, and I could even fit this into the overhead compartment in the airplane.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10310737", "1": "0.39736766", "2": "0.19325219", "3": "0.14717284", "4": "0.1126943", "6": "0.044196233"}}
