{"text": "I've been a big fan of Sanuk sandals for a few years. I had a couple of pairs that had a different type of foot bed, and found out they stopped making that type in the women sandals. I was hesitant to try the yoga mat sole, but I love them! I've been wearing them for a month or so (almost every day), and they still look great. The sole is also starting to slowly conform to my foot bed so they just get more comfortable every time I wear them. I also didn't have any problems with blisters or sore spots in the beginning, which I often do with new flip flops. Great purchase! Note: The color on these is a little lighter gray than in the photo.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20626709", "1": "0.32871738", "2": "0.12127312", "3": "0.19316278", "4": "0.14594384"}}
