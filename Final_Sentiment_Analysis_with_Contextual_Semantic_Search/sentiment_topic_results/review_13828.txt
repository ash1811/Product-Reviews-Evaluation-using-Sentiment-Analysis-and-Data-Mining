{"text": "I like the watch. The orange face is distinctive and provides excellent contrast above and below the water. The day and date are large enough to read without being intrusive. The glow markers are quite visible at night for nearly one hour. When I can get the watch to run continuously (more on that later), it is very accurate -- to within 3-4 seconds per 24-hour period. The band is comfortable and secure, but easy to release with side buttons. Yes the watch is waterproof -- I swim with it often and have taken it to 30m diving with no issues.The case diameter is just right for me -- not too big, not too small. However, the watch is very thick and very heavy -- by far the heaviest watch I've ever owned.The machining and finishing on the bezel and case is very good for the price. The bezel has nice, subtle clicks when it is rotated, though on my watch I cannot precisely align the \"zero\" dot on the bezel with the exact 12 o'clock line -- the bezel locks just slightly left of center. Also the triangular greenish glow mark at 12 o'clock was affixed slightly off-angle, so the center line in the top glow triangle does not line up with the 12 o'clock black line on the face. Poor QC on a $200.00 watch.The main issue I have with the watch is keeping it running. Even if I wear the watch for 24 hours straight, it is a \"crap shoot\" if it makes it through the night without stopping. I have taken to consciously shaking the watch 3-4 times a day for a minute or so, and shaking it before I go to bed. I have to make this extra effort many times a day to get the watch to run without stopping. I did send it back to Seiko on warranty. They said the watch was operating \"to spec\" and my only option was to replace the full mechanism on my nickel. The stated cost was $149 for mechanism replacement. However, the Seiko service center said they would NOT guarantee the new mechanism to run all day and night if worn constantly. Additionally they told me that, if the mechanism was replaced, Seiko would no longer warranty the watch against water intrusion. So, I kept the watch \"as is\". I still enjoy wearing it, but it is annoying to have to take it off many times a day and shake it to keep it running. After this experience I will not buy another Seiko automatic watch. YMMV. Other people, hopefully, have a better experience. I do note that I typically sleep very soundly with very little movement for 7 straight hours, which could make my experience different than others.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07030678", "1": "0.23404106", "2": "0.267171", "3": "0.15899932", "4": "0.1045287", "5": "0.023365306", "6": "0.14158784"}}
