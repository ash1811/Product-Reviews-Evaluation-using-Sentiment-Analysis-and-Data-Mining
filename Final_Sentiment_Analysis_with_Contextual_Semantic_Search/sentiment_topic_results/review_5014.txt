{"text": "Women's size 11 shoe size here (Men's 9 1/2) and I ordered the large.  Could not be happier!  I love the padding, and the comfort in terms of temperature and moisture.  I have a foot injury, and I need support and cushioning for my toes and the ball of my foot- these socks are perfect.  They are very thick- so make sure your shoes can accommodate them- but aside from that caveat, these should not give you any trouble, and at least for my shoe size, the fit was perfection.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.12440612", "2": "0.1911739", "3": "0.24590255", "4": "0.17250325", "5": "0.12512912", "6": "0.13763493"}}
