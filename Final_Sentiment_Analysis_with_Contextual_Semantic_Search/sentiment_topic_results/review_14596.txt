{"text": "I had a very similar pair of sunglasses that I paid more than double this price for, and the two are nearly identical. This pair might actually be better, in fact.I wear these for driving, and playing golf, and they are light and comfortable. I wanted a bigger lens to cover some of my peripheral vision and these do the trick.They did come with some silly-looking logo tags snapped to the sides, but they were easily snapped off. I think the brand tags are interchangeable, they come from the factory with holes in the frame, so that the label pieces can be stuck in. I prefer the frames all black with no markings.I'm satisfied with the value for this price point. I tend to lose my sunglasses periodically and if I do lose these, it won't break the bank, but I don't want to lose them as they have been a good and serviceable replacement to my last &#34;favorite pair&#34; that I lost.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.21421419", "1": "0.1551973", "2": "0.11036471", "3": "0.17421271", "4": "0.09411046", "5": "0.09956858", "6": "0.15233207"}}
