{"text": "The orange/gray model was only $23 when I bought it, a real bargain.  I've been using this guy on a daily basis for biking to work  carrying lunches and gym stuff and am satisfied.  The zippers are smooth and had never jammed and it's fairly roomy.  I'm able to fit shoes, a towel, toiletry bag, a lunch, and gym clothes all in at once.  Granted the bag is completely full at that point but that's not bad for a normal-sized backpack.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.21367697", "1": "0.19384141", "2": "0.08738639", "3": "0.13146317", "4": "0.11884726", "5": "0.13712254", "6": "0.11766224"}}
