{"text": "If you want the wayyy cool look these are the shoes to have, great casual style for jean, shorts or just hanging out in. My grandaughter has at least 4 pair & I have some myself. I like the leather and the plaid are very easy to match to anything. Sperry's are the most comfortable you can get in a casual shoe, look high end & priced right if you buy from Amazon. Go for it, you'll love them, get more than a couple of pair in different colors. Great to shop in.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07348465", "1": "0.25561762", "2": "0.18273862", "3": "0.078792185", "4": "0.10313252", "5": "0.18519212", "6": "0.121042304"}}
