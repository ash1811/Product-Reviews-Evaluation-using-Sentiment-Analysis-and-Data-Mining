{"text": "This is a good looking watch.  It gains about 2 seconds per week which is good for a low priced quartz watch.  I like the green canvas band with leather lining. The watch band is almost too short.  Someone with a large wrist will find they will have to replace it with a longer band.  If it came with a longer band I would have given it 5 stars.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.28073078", "1": "0.23519395", "2": "0.32882276", "3": "0.07333565", "5": "0.07437749"}}
