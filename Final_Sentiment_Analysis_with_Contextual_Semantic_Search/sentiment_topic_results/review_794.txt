{"text": "I was buying other bras online that are my safe, go to bras, and this one came up as &#34;others bought.&#34; I've had Wacoal bras before but only occasionally over the years when I see a deal because they're so expensive. But hey, this looked good so I ordered it. I opened the package and recognized the bra as one I'd owned and loved several years ago. So pretty, and fits so great - light and simply cut, yet provides good support and a natural, flattering shape under clothes. Moderately good coverage, too - not as reliable as petals, but decent under most clothes. The lace seemed scratchy when I first put it on but seems to soften up with wear and washing and is not bothersome. I really love this bra and will try to replace it in kind when it reaches the end of its useful life.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16864492", "1": "0.14422229", "3": "0.34855375", "4": "0.21892302", "5": "0.041540954", "6": "0.07587727"}}
