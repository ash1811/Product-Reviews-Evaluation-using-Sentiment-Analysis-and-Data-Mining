{"text": "No question Oakley has an excellent product. They price on brand and they are not the best for the price. I'm not being critical (well, yes I guess I am), I have 3 pair, but I have others as superior for far less price. My single most irritating issues is that they don't offer DOD civilians working in war zones any significant discounted prices. Many fine companies do and many (including Starbucks) offer free product. Yes, Oakley offers a military line at a discount, but they are far inferior to the consumer brands, so they aren't offering the military and their support any value. Save money, get another pair of fine polarized sunglasses. Oakley is a name only. Look at their Kitchen Sink Back Pack for $200. Are you kidding me? Twice the price at half the value. The next thing they will sell is high end women shoes!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1538993", "1": "0.18030214", "2": "0.15630397", "3": "0.15528288", "4": "0.13043565", "5": "0.1854462", "6": "0.038329817"}}
