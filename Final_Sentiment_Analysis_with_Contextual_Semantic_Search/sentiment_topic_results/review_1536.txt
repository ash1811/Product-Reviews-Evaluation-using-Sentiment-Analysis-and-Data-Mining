{"text": "I haven't been able to buy undies that fit for over a decade. With the 'fattening' of America, new clothes are cut larger. Pant legs swim on me, yet they fit at the waist. These undies fit at the waist and in the buttocks but like all of them I buy, the leg openings are too large & with these, the leg opening elastic is too stretchy. That makes them ride up. I have now bought approximately a dozen different brands & styles. I am going to keep at it until I find ones that fit 'teenage' legs. I have an APPLE SHAPE BODY, meaning same size legs & butt I had in my 20's, but all the weight I've gained over the years going to my middle. Ugh! That's why I still wear bikini undies. They fit below the belly fat role. But I still need to cover privates. These do not work on my body type. I suspect they'd be great on pear shape beautiful women. So far the ONLY undies I've found that fit (some work when you put them on but stretch out during the day), are 'Barely There Women's Flex To Fit Bikini Panty' (you may want to buy one size larger than your size if you are on the upper side of your size). I hope this helps others. Extra note, I loved the fabric & feel on my body. If the elastic had been tighter, I'd have kept them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.085285455", "1": "0.26227883", "2": "0.15899962", "3": "0.3148932", "4": "0.14681406", "6": "0.029301306"}}
