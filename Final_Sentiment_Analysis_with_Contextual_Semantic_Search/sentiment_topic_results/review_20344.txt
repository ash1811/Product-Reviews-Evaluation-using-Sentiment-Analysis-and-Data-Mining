{"text": "The camisole fits rather nice. I just can't sleep in it because by the end of the day the inner layer holding you up starts to feel a little tight.  It's not as comfortable as the bravado basics to sleep in, but that's due to the bra support layer inside.  Also, its nice that the clip attachment is flat, but i have to say it takes a little getting used to since it opens in the opposite direction every other nursing product I've worn does.  As a result, I find myself fumbling around with it trying to open/close it with one hand and honestly isn't as easy as the standard ones in other nursing brands. I wish they would have just used the old fashioned clip-over rather than clip-under design. Overall, good product.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08781968", "1": "0.21596958", "3": "0.17224571", "4": "0.12529352", "5": "0.14873745", "6": "0.24765378"}}
