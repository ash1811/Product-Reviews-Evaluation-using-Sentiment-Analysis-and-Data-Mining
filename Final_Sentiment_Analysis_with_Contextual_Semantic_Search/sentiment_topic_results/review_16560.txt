{"text": "I love the color of this wallet, but the quality is not great. I always buy leather, which this is, but the edge of the window compartment has had a small tear in the leather since I bought it. There is lots of room for credit cards, but the snap coin purse is somewhat hard to open and there's not much room for photos. I am and will continue to use this for a while, so at least I got my money's worth.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14337471", "1": "0.3431095", "2": "0.23765357", "5": "0.1736866", "6": "0.09499017"}}
