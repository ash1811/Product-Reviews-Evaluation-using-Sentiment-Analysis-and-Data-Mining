{"text": "Jacket is definitely the best part of the costume. I'm 6'1&#34;, 170lbs and it fit great (see my attached customer pic). I have somewhat skinny arms and the jacket was fairly form fit there. Rest hung loose but as a pirate that's fine. If you have larger arms it might be really tight on you. Bandana has the dreads attached, shirt and sash were cool. Boot covers were the lowest point of the ensemble but you can find better ones for about $15 here on Amazon.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06766566", "1": "0.3033133", "2": "0.1535721", "3": "0.13572702", "4": "0.29872432", "6": "0.038185854"}}
