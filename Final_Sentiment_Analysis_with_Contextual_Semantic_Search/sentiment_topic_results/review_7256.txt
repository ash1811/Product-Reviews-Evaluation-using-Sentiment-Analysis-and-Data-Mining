{"text": "I just got these Indigo RIGGS jeans based on the reviews...and I am glad I did!They are excellent quality [made in Mexico with US components], lots of extra details, like protective edging on the front right pocket [for tape measure clip] and rear pockets, hammer loop, deep reinforced pockets, heavy 100% cotton...and they are loose where they need to be when you need to be active. They tend to be a touch larger in the waist [for me, at least: I got the 31Wx32L and 30Wx32L might have been a better fit] so if you are on the fence, I suggest you go for the smaller size.Edit: After about a month of wear...and especially after working on my leaking water heater...these pants really hold up! The extra gusseting in the crotch, the lined & reinforced back pockets, and the tape measure clip guard on the right-side front pocket all spell q-u-a-l-i-t-y!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.076276146", "1": "0.21621217", "2": "0.23825365", "4": "0.16298655", "5": "0.052581754", "6": "0.2515126"}}
