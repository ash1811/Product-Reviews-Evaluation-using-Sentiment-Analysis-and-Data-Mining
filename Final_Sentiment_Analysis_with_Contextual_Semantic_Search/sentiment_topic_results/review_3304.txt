{"text": "Unless you are a kid and just gotta to have the clown-style baggy pants, these are the ones to buy. Even with large legs, these fit awesome. The black color holds for a long time if you wash them in &#34;cold water&#34; and &#34;turn them inside-out, and leave them inside out in a cool/low temp dryer.&#34; Trust me, you'll be quite happy. I recommend this style...especially for us guys with larger thighs, but won't make us look sloppy and childish. These are made for mature, level-headed men. Remember...they are the &#34;550s.&#34; NOT the 505s.
