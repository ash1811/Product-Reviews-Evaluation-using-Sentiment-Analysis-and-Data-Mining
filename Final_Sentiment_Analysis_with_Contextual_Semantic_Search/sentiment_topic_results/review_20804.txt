{"text": "Nowadays, you can't go into a sporting event without being searched from head-to-toe.  These transparent backpacks work perfect for security to check, particularly at football games.  With them being made from PVC, you have some protection against the elements - rain, snow, and spilled drinks.  The pockets are useful and very functional.  The padded shoulder straps are much better than some of the simple straps that cut into you if you are carrying any weight in these things.  Cold can wreck havoc with any plastic based backpack, so allow them to warm up before expanding them (they come pretty compressed from shipping) and handle with care when temperatures drop while in use.  The orange color is great.  Especially if it's your team's color.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09071345", "1": "0.22476853", "2": "0.14969903", "3": "0.08668159", "4": "0.18657759", "5": "0.15089762", "6": "0.110662155"}}
