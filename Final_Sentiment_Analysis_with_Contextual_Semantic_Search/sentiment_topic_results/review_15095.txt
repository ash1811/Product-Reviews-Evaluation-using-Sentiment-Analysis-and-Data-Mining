{"text": "This is my first time trying Easy Spirit Shoes and after a couple months of wearing them I've found them no better than any other shoe I've tried.  They are just okay.  I have plantar fasciitis and these haven't helped any with that at all. They do hold up well and look nice, but as for how they wear I'd just say average.  I don't think they have much support or cushion to them at all and my feet hurt if I wear them more than a 1/2 hour.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09597939", "1": "0.2352577", "2": "0.110307686", "3": "0.33027667", "4": "0.118099414", "6": "0.10630815"}}
