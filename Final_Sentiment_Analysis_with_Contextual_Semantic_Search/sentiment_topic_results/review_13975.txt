{"text": "Love the watch, the strap is identical to the other Citizen chronograph canvas strap model. For the me the strap is too short on both models for my wrist. The strap looks \"silly\" with the metal eyelets in the strap. That being said the watch is masculine and functional. An excellent value for an eco-drive model. The case is a polished stainless steel which is the opposite of what a military outdoor watch should be. The case would be better served with a non-reflective matte finish. I believe this was a compromise by citizen to make it appeal to those looking for a fashion dress watch. Bottom line great watch, great value, a steal at this price given the eco-drive and quality of a citizen watch.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1469379", "1": "0.043370295", "2": "0.3195997", "3": "0.24478845", "4": "0.05171894", "5": "0.07941778", "6": "0.11416694"}}
