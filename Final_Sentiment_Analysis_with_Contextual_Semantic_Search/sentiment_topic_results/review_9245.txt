{"text": "Most comfortable house slipper I've owned.  These are quite true to size.  I am a 10.5.  They are sold only in whole sizes.  I got a 10 initially because I don't like my foot rattling around in an oversized shoe.  It was too small.  Amazon's return policy on these was easy and I had size 11 within about four days.  They fit great and are marvelously comfortable.  They are also very well made.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07930827", "1": "0.24429534", "2": "0.06527301", "3": "0.08955892", "4": "0.21151437", "6": "0.30637488"}}
