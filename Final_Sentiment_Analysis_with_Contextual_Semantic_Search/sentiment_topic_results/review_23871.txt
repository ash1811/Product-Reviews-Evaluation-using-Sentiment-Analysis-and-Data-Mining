{"text": "I normally wear a 9m but after reading reviews, I ordered 91/2w. I am very glad I did because they fit just right. Not sure about the stretch factor, or I guess I should say, don't know if I will like them to stretch since they fit right now. Also wondering about the material the shoe is made of, looks kind of rubbery, kind of a cheap appearance, not much like leather. I bought these for work, and comfort, not really for looks or style, so I am happy with them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.49991754", "2": "0.27534914", "4": "0.09556594", "6": "0.11980883"}}
