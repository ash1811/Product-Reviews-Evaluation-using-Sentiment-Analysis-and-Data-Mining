{"text": "UGG Ascot slippers are really great looking leather Venetian style driving loafers with a full, thick  shearling lining. They definitely kept my feet warm on a recent 8 degree morning. I typically wear an 11 1/2 or 12, so went with a 12. They are a little cramped at the toe end, due to the wool lining, but I think 13 would be too big.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.18718182", "1": "0.344703", "2": "0.04815483", "3": "0.18383145", "4": "0.08315065", "5": "0.1002434", "6": "0.052734822"}}
