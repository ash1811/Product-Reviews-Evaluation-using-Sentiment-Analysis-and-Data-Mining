{"text": "LOVE this car seat bag!Fits Britax Marathon convertible seat (which we love) perfectly, plus I can fit a few other items on the seat and still zips up without any problems, which is great for airline travel!Before, I used it for a rear facing infant seat (baby trend flex-loc) plus the base when traveling by air, and that worked wonderfully as well!  With the smaller infant seat, I could actually fit about 60 diapers, plus a small bag for all my baby's clothes for the trip, some toys, blankies AND still had room!  I didn't even really need an additional bag for her!  I think I may have packed some items in my own suitcase that were hers, but I always pack way more than I ever need.Also great because airlines do not charge luggage fees for baby items such as car seats or play yards!!  Woohoo!  A way to beat the system and save some cash while on vaca, folks!Love that this bag is padded - you spend a lot of money on a good car seat and you want it protected while in the care of luggage handlers.Straps are easily adjustable.Never had a problem with the zipper, which surprised me, but it is actually quite sturdy.Has been through many trips and has zero wear!  Tough fabric!Love the spot on top to put your information on it.It is a little awkward to have on your back and it does bump you in the back of the legs, but I am also short at 5 feet 2 inches, so maybe a taller person wouldn't have that problem.  I thought about getting one with wheels, however, I would already be pushing a stroller with my daughter in it and wheeling a bag or two of my luggage so I didn't want yet another thing to roll around.It does get a little heavy on your back as well, but once again, I'm short and a very petite weakling so for an average person, I think it'd be fine!  Also, keep in mind that you probably won't have it on your back for long if you're checking it with your other luggage.  If you plan on gate checking it...Well, I think I would just recommend checking it with your other luggage!!  If you're set on carrying the seat on, I recommend getting one of the attachments to turn the convertible carseats into a stroller so you don't have to carry it on your back while carrying your baby/toddler eht entire time, or for an infant seat just bring your stroller system or a stroller that the carseat plops on top of like the Baby Trend Snap N Go since it's lightweight, easy to use, and has decent room for storage underneath.  I still highly recommend just checking the carseat and if your child is 1 and up, get the CARES Harness for the airplane ride.  It rocks and makes traveling so much easier, more relaxing, than lugging all kinds of stuff around on top of chasing a toddler or hauling all their stuff like a pack mule.Would be great if it came in a few other colors, but black is fine, and it doesn't show dirt so that works for me.  I just put a bright colored ribbon, bandanna, or unique luggage tag somewhere for easy identification.  (Of all luggage, I do not want my child's carseat to be accidentally grabbed by someone else!)When I'm not traveling, I use it to store our infant car seat and base, keeping it looking great and protecting it for future use.Take it from a frequent traveler, the bottom line is this bag is awesome!*******UPDATE********We've had this car seat bag for over 2 years now and it's still doing a great job!Most recently, on a trip to Phoenix from St. Louis, the zipper did pop open very slightly, however no items came out.  I was concerned about it for the flight back home, but the zipper stayed shut, so I'm assuming it was an airline personnel grab that popped the zipper.I'm still amazed at the durability of the fabric and padded sections.  Very easy to get seat in and out.  My only issue with it is it's very large and since it's padded (which I love), it's hard to get it to a more compact size while on vacation.  Usually just leave it in the trunk or stash it in a closet so it's not a huge deal, but just kinda bugs me.Still HIGHLY RECOMMEND this!  LOVE IT!******  ANOTHER UPDATE!! 12/2012 ********We've had the bag for a loooong time now.  Have used it from the infant seat to the Britax Marathon and now she is 5 years old and we just bought the Britax Frontier 85 - FITS PERFECTLY in this bag!  I am thrilled!!!!  (If you have a Britax Frontier 85 Sict, however, I do not believe it would fit in this bag, but the original Frontier 85 fits great!)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08965896", "1": "0.2744546", "2": "0.15778564", "3": "0.11038315", "4": "0.043060023", "5": "0.1412659", "6": "0.18339169"}}
