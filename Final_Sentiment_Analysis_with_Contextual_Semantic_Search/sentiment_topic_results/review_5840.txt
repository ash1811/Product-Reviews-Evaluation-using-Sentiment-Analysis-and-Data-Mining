{"text": "I have been looking for casual tee's to replace my old ones. MOST tees out there are either too small OR too low cut!  These tee's are absolutely awesome!  I am so jazzed to have some tee's to bang around in and know the shirt will hold it's shape and look good! THX for this!Addition 3/1/13:  I purchased several more of these shirts from the same company. They are great shirts as stated however, there are two different types of cottom used.  One is very stretchy and the other is only slightly stretchy.  A little frustrating if you buy with the expectation of receiving the SAME product. Otherwise, BOTH types are well worth purchasing.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.33335608", "2": "0.10427122", "3": "0.07164945", "4": "0.07403372", "5": "0.22679916", "6": "0.18732986"}}
