I guess you just have to enjoy knowing that they're there. ..2.  The clasp is very tiny and cheap.3.  The loop that the chain passes through is ..  in a very odd place . on the BACK side of the pendant, so it's just oddly lumpy and hangs awkwardly .  .  . I don't quite understand why it was designed this way.Not something I enjoy wearing, except that my dear daughter got it for me ..I can fix that clasp problem .and I guess a jewelry could redesign the loop a bit, for me . but . .you still couldnt see the stones .. .a lot of fixing to do here, such a shame.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06274652", "1": "0.3070526", "2": "0.1423531", "3": "0.09035287", "4": "0.32377142", "5": "0.071186155"}}
