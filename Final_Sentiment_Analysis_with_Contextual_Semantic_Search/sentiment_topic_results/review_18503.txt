{"text": "I've had my Victorinox Swiss Army Renegade watch since 1999 or 2000. Mine originally had a nylon strap, but it is essentially the same watch. it's been great over the years and I still include it in my watch rotation. Other than a single band replacement, and some new batteries, it has been a flawless, trusty companion. The design is timeless, and it's not a hefty as some newer watches, but that's part of its charm. The case is a tough back plastic; mine has developed some \"personality\" over the years, yet still looks great. This is a great choice if you're looking for an affordable Swiss-made timepiece.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03292141", "1": "0.21392208", "2": "0.23083854", "3": "0.1906684", "4": "0.098742984", "5": "0.14633915", "6": "0.086567454"}}
