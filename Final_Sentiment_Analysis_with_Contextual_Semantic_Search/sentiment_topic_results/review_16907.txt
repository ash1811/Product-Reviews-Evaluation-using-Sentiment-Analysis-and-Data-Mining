{"text": "All Carhartt's fit differently, always have. This is a style that we know exactly what size to buy.  Each style fits very differently.  Other than that, these are the best work pants, and most durable of any other brand.  We are Carhartt fans.  My friend ordered the wrong pair, and they were too long (he ordered the size he would wear for normal jeans, but didn't know his &#34;Carhartt style size&#34;.)  You can RETURN them ONLY IF it's amazon's fault (i.e. they sent the wrong size, color).  You cannot return them if you got the size you ordered, and you can not return them.  I don't know if that's an amazon thing or a Carhartt thing.  Just make sure you are certain you know what size you want first.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.060831852", "1": "0.3202096", "2": "0.07166742", "3": "0.2754598", "4": "0.07554702", "5": "0.09507818", "6": "0.101206124"}}
