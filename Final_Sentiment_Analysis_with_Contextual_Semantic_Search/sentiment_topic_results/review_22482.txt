{"text": "I was quite disappointed in Hanes brand of panties. They show color, but when you order you get 6 pair of white only and a product that isn't true to size. I ordered a size 7 in these and a pack of Fruit of the Loom. Well, the Fruit of the Loom fit perfectly and came as described in a 6 pk of multiple colors and patterns. I love them!But, the Hanes came in white only. No way would I pay $10 for a 6pk of white panties when I can get them from my local Walmart for around $8.00. Had the photo shown white only, I'd have purchased 2 pks of Fruit of the Loom and been highly satisfied.Never again will I buy Hanes panties. The description says clearly, &#34;Multi&#34; which means a variety of colors and further says 'solids' when you read the description. No where does it say white only. I didn't even want solids, but I'd have been fine with an assortment of solid colors vs the beautiful patterns Fruit of the Loom offered.Again, never again will I buy Hanes panties. Hope this helps other shoppers and ensures they get exactly what they want and not what the stores want to send you.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10690134", "1": "0.31505048", "2": "0.112895526", "3": "0.16814071", "4": "0.050686654", "5": "0.2440838"}}
