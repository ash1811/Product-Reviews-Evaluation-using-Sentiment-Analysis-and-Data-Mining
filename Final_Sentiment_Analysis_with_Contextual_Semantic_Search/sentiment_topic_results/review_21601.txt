{"text": "It a good price and it's a large cloth, but it really is only good for larger plain pieces. If you have silver that has intricate details and designs in the jewelry, this cloth is not going to do a good cleaning job. Sunshine Polishing Cloth is the absolute best I have ever used. That cloth cleans all in the beadwork, milgrain, and crevices of your jewelry. After cleaning, some of my silver looked better than it did when I purchased it. Sunshine is better than any liquid cleaner or cloth I have ever used. It even cleans when it's \"dirty\".", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.5645261", "2": "0.15402725", "4": "0.07320224", "5": "0.09815709", "6": "0.104237534"}}
