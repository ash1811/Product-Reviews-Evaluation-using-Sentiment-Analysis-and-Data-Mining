{"text": "Wow, did not expect such a well made, sturdy wooden toy. The skull latch turns so it is very easy for my 4 yr old granddaughter to open. Flag is a nice weight of fabric, almost like canvas. The coins are large, the bag is well made. The eye patch is a little tight for her, so plan on adding a little bit of Velcro to the ends. The box is a perfect size and she can carry it around with her. Actually bought a second one, because the first one went home with her! Note: bought the toysmith pirate telescope which fits into the pirate chest.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14850178", "1": "0.26170403", "2": "0.08208957", "3": "0.250351", "4": "0.0772849", "5": "0.11861304", "6": "0.061455652"}}
