{"text": "I have been looking for a comfortable gardening shoe that I could just slip on and off easily, and one that would be solid and well-made.  This shoe is it!  Very comfortable, well-made and I finally feel like I can go out into our damp yard without getting my feet all wet.  I can't wait to use them all summer in our garden.  I did find they run a bit small though.  I usually wear a size 9, but the 9s were too short, so I had to exchange them for a 10, and they are perfect.  If you want to wear these shoes with socks, definitely go for the larger size!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17016989", "1": "0.300462", "2": "0.09594497", "3": "0.11062262", "4": "0.18251483", "5": "0.056788925", "6": "0.08349677"}}
