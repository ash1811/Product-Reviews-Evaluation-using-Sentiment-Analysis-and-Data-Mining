{"text": "My moyher love vest, but in my country (Venezuela) is not easy to find vests, so as neither coffee, sugar, milk or toilett paper (although believe it or not). It is a nice best, warm, the fabric is great as the zipper, well constructed, Compared to the Columbia Women's Benton Springs Vest, the Port Authority vest is a little heavier and warmer, and has a better zipper. The brown is kind of greenish. It fit as expected. My mother loved it. I definitely recommend it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.21978706", "1": "0.2627406", "2": "0.047154427", "3": "0.06932427", "4": "0.07519206", "5": "0.17560816", "6": "0.15019345"}}
