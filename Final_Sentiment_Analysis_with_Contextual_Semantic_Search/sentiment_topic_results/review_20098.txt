{"text": "I would actually give this backpack 5 stars if the zipper hadn't fallen off (on two of their backpacks). I love High Sierra's backpacks and feel they offer an excellent price/quality ratio, in most respects. However, QC seems to have &#34;dropped the ball&#34; on their zipper checks.  This is a problem because an otherwise good backpack can become quite useless if the zippers fall off (rendering a portion of the backpack nonfunctional). In my experience, this was not due to weak or broken metal, it was merely due to the zipper attachment piece not being &#34;clamped&#34; down securely enough around the zipper, allowing a gap in the metal, large enough that the original zipper can easily &#34;fall off&#34; the backpack (never to be seen again). I was able to attach another zipper...using a pair of pliers to clamp it to the attachment piece to render the backpack functional again. However, the zipper does not match the backpack and I should not have needed to do this. :( If you purchase one of these backpacks, be sure to check all zippers for these gaps (and clamp them down securely) before using.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.097883865", "1": "0.079622425", "2": "0.32302347", "3": "0.031834427", "4": "0.2050288", "5": "0.16383682", "6": "0.09877022"}}
