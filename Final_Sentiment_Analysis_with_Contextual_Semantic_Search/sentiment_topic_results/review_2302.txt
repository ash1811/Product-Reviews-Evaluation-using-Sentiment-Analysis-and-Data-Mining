{"text": "My husband is really picky about shoes, and more so when it comes to work. He has weirdly arched feet and not all shoes fit right. He loved these, which was surprising since he didn't even try them one. The are true to the size, he is a 10.5 and they fit just right. They are not confining and the gel pad adds some comfort. He wears these everyday to work and loves them, they even helped with some hip pain from his older shoes. I will keep buying these.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17746998", "1": "0.20714699", "2": "0.32151708", "4": "0.13909934", "6": "0.14824383"}}
