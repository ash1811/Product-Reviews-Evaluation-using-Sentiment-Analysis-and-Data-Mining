{"text": "As other's have mentioned the fit is a little narrow at first, but keep in mind, the uppers will stretch out with wearing, so I planned accordingly. (I'm normally a size 9 because I have wide feet, even though my length is an 8.5 fit. So I ordered the 8.5 knowing the uppers will stretch. A 9 would have been too big.) I wore them without socks my first day. No blisters or ouchy spots after being in them all day. Fake fur is soft and warm. The sole is very heavy and clunky, which I was expecting, but make sure you know these are not delicate slipper-like shoes before ordering- they are very thick and sturdy. Good traction on the soles.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.037451115", "1": "0.3030145", "2": "0.13301145", "3": "0.13189425", "4": "0.11589193", "5": "0.17526989", "6": "0.10346688"}}
