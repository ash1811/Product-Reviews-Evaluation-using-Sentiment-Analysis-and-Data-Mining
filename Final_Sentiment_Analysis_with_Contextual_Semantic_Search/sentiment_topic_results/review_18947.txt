{"text": "Good watch...My 7 year old boy needed a new watch and even though it is sold as a \"chick\" watch [don't tell my son] it is masculine looking and fits a youth wrist well.  So far durable for school/every day wear.  We will see how long it lasts him.  Best price here...even better than Wally-Mart!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.24634537", "2": "0.18418366", "3": "0.17076261", "4": "0.15331975", "5": "0.17398944", "6": "0.067616954"}}
