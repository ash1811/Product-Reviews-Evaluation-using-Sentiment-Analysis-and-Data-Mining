{"text": "Not mentioned in the headline, is this a Flanel-lined jean. From the authentic description picture i saw the fit before , and confirm that's true. Within it's a well warm and heavy feeling, wind does'nt matter. Quality fabric , its easy to like this jean.The color is nice- if you own fleece-lineds too , without tags or wearing you can't differentiate between, cause every surface has the same blue. I'd clicked on the alternative:  the nearly sold-out color ``Blue`` was'nt available in my size so i asked Carhartt. They sayd ``we'd made a special production, only for amazon, they can order a new contingent.  `` Well folks, please use under description the button for -suggestions to amazon-... .  Thanks !", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.27127695", "1": "0.31044856", "3": "0.107588805", "4": "0.112086125", "5": "0.079210244", "6": "0.117306985"}}
