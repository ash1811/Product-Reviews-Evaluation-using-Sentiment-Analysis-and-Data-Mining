{"text": "Okay, I'm a large-chested gal (38DD) but I haaaate underwire. I accept it as a necessary evil, but if I can get a bra that has decent support without wires, I'm on that in a flash.I love this bra. It is SO comfortable, but offers way better support (and therefore aesthetics/look) than other wire-free \"comfort\" bras I've tried, and I've tried a lot of them.My one complaint is that the closure does NOT hold up. The hooks come out pretty quickly, in my experience. But, because it's not expensive and pretty easy to find, I just buy another one every couple of months and don't feel the least bit bad about it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.200411", "1": "0.23174463", "2": "0.11989999", "3": "0.27660182", "5": "0.038099594", "6": "0.13099995"}}
