{"text": "When I got these boots, it was only my 2nd pair of docs.  I didn't realize how sturdy the leather would be, so I did not wear the &#34;right&#34; kind of socks the 1st few time I wore these boots.  Word to the wise- until these boots are broken in, be sure to wear thick enough socks or band aids on your heels..... Now that I have fully broken in my boots, they are much more comfortable.  I wear them with jeans, cords, or shorts.  They are very sturdy & supportive.  Great Boots!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.036275104", "1": "0.21661472", "2": "0.12841661", "4": "0.22738582", "5": "0.35021868", "6": "0.037902042"}}
