{"text": "I purchased this in (3) colors and I love all of them. I do not think you need to &#34;size up&#34; like most reviews said to.I am a 38-C, and a large would have been fine. I can wear the extra large, because I do not want to pay shipping to return all three. These run true to size, you do not have to go bigger.These are great under sweaters or even under some cute summer tops as a layer! I am so glad I found these.You will not be disappointed in the quality at all.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.109229766", "1": "0.20477962", "3": "0.45962322", "4": "0.12917024", "6": "0.09065523"}}
