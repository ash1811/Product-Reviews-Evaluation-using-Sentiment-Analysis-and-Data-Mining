{"text": "Depending on the season, I can easily fluctuate 10 pounds above my max weight (by Army standards). I have pretty much worn a 34&#34; waist since high school, but I can easily put on a pair of 36&#34; jeans depending on the manufacturer.These jeans fit me perfectly, and although I'm probably more of a 36&#34; than a 34&#34; most days, ordering a 34&#34; is perfect because of the loose fit. Not so with other Levis I've purchased. The legs are uber comfortable and they have held up really well in the stitching in the crotch and the corners of the back pockets (historically the worst places my jeans wear). As I've dropped back down to my summer weight, I can usually wear these without a belt, so it's not that they are too wide.Bottom line: These fit really well when I'm at 34&#34; or 36&#34;, so if you're looking for a pair with some wiggle room, order them for your smaller size.They just fit really well and they're VERY comfortable. I have become pretty loyal to Levis in recent years, and these jeans are why I am (although it would be great if they stopped jacking up the price of the jeans).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.054455075", "1": "0.45552707", "2": "0.16839196", "3": "0.15342472", "4": "0.058716133", "6": "0.107274465"}}
