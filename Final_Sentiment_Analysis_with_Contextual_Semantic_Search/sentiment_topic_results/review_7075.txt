{"text": "I find this a comfortable bra to wear all day. It does not ride up, nothing pokes me and it seems sufficiently supportive. The taupe color is perfect. I have a few thin white blouses and nothing shows through. The only thing I would change is the design. I am not a fan of this granny lace pattern, especially not in that taupe color. Something about the combination of lace and shiny that I do not like. Other than that - like it and will buy again because it is so comfortable.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03924063", "1": "0.41794947", "2": "0.12449878", "3": "0.120667815", "4": "0.06427439", "5": "0.1137455", "6": "0.11962343"}}
