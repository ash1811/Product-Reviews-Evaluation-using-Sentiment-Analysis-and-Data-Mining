{"text": "It's been a little over a year since I purchased a pair of these shoes in the brown color option in my usual size.  I don't wear them on a regular basis--I am generally in skirts and dressier shoes if I am out of the house--but when I travel they are excellent to wear, and they are also fine for trips to the supermarket in colder weather.  I wore these shoes almost non-stop when I visited my parents recently and stayed for a few days; they were great for walking around town and window shopping as well as traipsing across fields in the mountains.  My left shoe gives me some pain across the top of my foot, I am unsure as to why this is the case, but I laced my shoes up in a 'hackey-sack' configuration so there is less pressure there, and the left shoe is almost comfortable now.  During longer treks I still feel some discomfort but I do not blame that on either the shoe or my foot, they just probably are not the best match for each other.  But my right foot feels perfectly fine in its Eastland shoe, nice and snug and solid.  My grandmother, when she saw me during my trip, asked me if I've grown (I'm in my thirties so that is highly unlikely!), and I said it was the shoes!  From looking at them casually on someone's feet you would probably would not notice the height in the sole and heel, as it is not obtrusive, but it is there.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1274163", "1": "0.26114136", "2": "0.2057984", "3": "0.16018255", "4": "0.10758134", "5": "0.088091835", "6": "0.04978825"}}
