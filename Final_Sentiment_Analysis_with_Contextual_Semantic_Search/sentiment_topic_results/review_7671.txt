{"text": "I love Glamorise bras. I bought a front-closure bra previously and wanted to try this back closure which is great too. Supposedly I've been measured as a 38C but I cannot find a bra that covers everything that needs to be covered; you know what I mean, ladies. So a 38D with Glamorise is perfect. I plan on purchasing another front-closure bra because then you don't see anything under your blouses and sweaters but a smooth back. I like that.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04525075", "1": "0.11137578", "2": "0.14330274", "3": "0.24573135", "4": "0.18823506", "5": "0.13347758", "6": "0.13262671"}}
