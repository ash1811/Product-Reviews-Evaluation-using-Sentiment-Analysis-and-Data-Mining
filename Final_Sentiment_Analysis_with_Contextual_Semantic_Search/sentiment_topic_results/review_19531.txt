{"text": "I generally love Skechers sandals; I have a pair from 3 years ago that are still one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I own.  It's a shame that they don't sell them anymore.  In fact, Skechers seems to be focusing on flip flops which are terrible for your feet.I was hoping these sandals would be comfortable, but they aren't at all.  there is no support near the ball of the foot.  I think these would be okay for running errands or for bicycling, but not for hiking/walking.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.3338882", "2": "0.20376804", "3": "0.19373798", "4": "0.10465036", "5": "0.031908937", "6": "0.12864153"}}
