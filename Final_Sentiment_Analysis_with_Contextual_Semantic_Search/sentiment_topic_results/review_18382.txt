{"text": "This is a plain but elegant looking watch, and it charges from sun (or room) light, keeps time very well and is also pretty visible with large 12, 6 and 9 numerals that are luminous for easy night use. The crystal is mineral, so no scratches I can see; the quartz movement is extremely accurate; the titanium case means it is very light on the wrist; the 100 m / 330 ft rating means it is truly water resistant. It looks good - I have worn it to formal and business occasions. The price is amazing, and the warranty is five years out of the box.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09282169", "1": "0.17489082", "2": "0.074657954", "3": "0.22174042", "4": "0.20001262", "5": "0.05971152", "6": "0.17616494"}}
