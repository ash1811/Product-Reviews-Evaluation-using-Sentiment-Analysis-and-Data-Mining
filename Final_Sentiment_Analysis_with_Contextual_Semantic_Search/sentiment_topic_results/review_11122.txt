{"text": "The medium is perfect for a 5'4\" 126 pound female.  It allows room to really stuff the pockets.  I used it as my carry on for a 15 hour flight and it held everything I needed; snacks, books, tissues, hand wipes etc.It does get warm as the fabric doesn't breathe so consider this if going to hot climate.The vest is great to use instead of carrying a day bag while on tour, too.I recommend it as a useful addition for travel.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05947744", "1": "0.36884084", "2": "0.15691574", "4": "0.23262405", "6": "0.17602259"}}
