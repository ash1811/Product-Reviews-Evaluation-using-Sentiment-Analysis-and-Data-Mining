{"text": "I have bought thorlo socks for hiking before, so I knew they were well made, but they seemed too pricey for regular everyday socks.  But after wearing through the heel of every regular sock I buy in no time (other than athletic low-ankle ones, I walk a couple miles every day on average) I decided to try these.  They're great.  Lots of padding where you want it and very comfortable.  The price may be high, but I expect them to last a lot longer than all my other socks, so it's worth it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09367105", "1": "0.30572358", "2": "0.08734122", "3": "0.08340587", "5": "0.32061917", "6": "0.10635651"}}
