{"text": "Haven't had them too long but the quality seems great for the price.  The grip on the bottom is really good, but its a hard material so they seem like they wont wear out fast or hurt your feet when you step on a sharp rock.  The stitching, velcro and straps all seem very good. Most comfortable sandals Ive had yet, the rubber you step on is squishy. They also have a lip in the front which helps protect your toes and keep them planted in the sandal. I ordered a 13 and they seem very true to size. hope they last!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15741074", "1": "0.31025252", "2": "0.07629893", "3": "0.06606211", "4": "0.17582403", "5": "0.08787333", "6": "0.12627831"}}
