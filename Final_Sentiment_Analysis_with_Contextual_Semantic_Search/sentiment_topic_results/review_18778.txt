{"text": "As everyone has said, the costume runs bigger so I ordered a medium for my husband who normally wears a bigger medium to a large. The pants are kind of short but the boot covers make up for that by covering the bottom of the pants and over your shoe. The shirt looks great, the bandana is nice, and the wrist strappy things were a nice touch. The belt is a little flimsy but whatever. It's a thin costume but not so thin that you can't party and move around as you please. My husband wore a t-shirt and normal black pants underneath just to be safe. He wore it all day and it's ready for another wear next year, it held up well. I just hung it up a few days before to let some of the wrinkles fall out. This is a pretty complete costume for a fantastic price. Highly recommended.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15075183", "1": "0.27571797", "2": "0.032369096", "3": "0.18317094", "4": "0.065738775", "5": "0.14178088", "6": "0.1504705"}}
