{"text": "These are nice slippers, I like them, but they're not what I was expecting. The size runs a bit short and narrow--not a lot, but not true to size. The thickness of the shoe liner between the pile and the rubber sole is a little thin. Sometimes I actually feel a ridge of the waffle shape inside the rubber sole poking into the bottom of my foot through the lining of the moccasin. The synthetic pile makes my feet sweat and then they feel cold. Guess I should have bought the moccasins that are true, breathable sheepskin. The materials seem to be of good quality, and I like the leather ties. The ties are actually threaded through the collar of the shoe so that you can tighten or loosen the fit. Yes, I will buy again, but I will go with the soft-sole, sheepskin moccasin one size larger.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.081034675", "1": "0.13409893", "2": "0.20964943", "3": "0.18140614", "4": "0.16348651", "5": "0.07246991", "6": "0.15785442"}}
