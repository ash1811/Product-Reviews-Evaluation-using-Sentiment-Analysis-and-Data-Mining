{"text": "I bought a few pairs of these for a trip overseas and after a year away, I am happy to report that these socks have been absolutely delightful in terms of quality, feel, and reliability.Also, it's a bit on the rank side, but a side benefit I discovered was that these socks never stink! There were a few times I was out in the middle of nowhere, far away from anywhere to wash my stuff, so I had to use them a few days in a row. Even after hiking for miles, day after day, these socks never got funky like cotton socks do. Quite a bonus! And with washing in mind, always be sure to hand wash these or, if you need to use a machine, remember to use the delicate wash. I accidentally threw a pair in a normal wash and they took quite a beating.In the end...one of the best pairs of socks out there. Highly recommended!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1402896", "1": "0.20570606", "2": "0.19045721", "3": "0.07483494", "4": "0.03437119", "5": "0.26675937", "6": "0.08758164"}}
