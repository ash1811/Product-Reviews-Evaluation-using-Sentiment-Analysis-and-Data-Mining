{"text": "This is just a standard cheap shirt.  I paid $5 for it so I wasn't expecting much.  It's about the quality you would expect from a giveaway polo shirt.  It looks nice enough to wear to work but you'd want an undershirt as it's a little scratchy.  Not sure how it will hold up as I've only worn and washed it once, but you can't really go wrong for such a cheap purchase price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06751049", "1": "0.44166055", "2": "0.15575163", "3": "0.20961265", "6": "0.11748561"}}
