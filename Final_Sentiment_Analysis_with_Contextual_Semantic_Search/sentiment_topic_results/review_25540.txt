{"text": "I own quite a few watches that range in price and quality, but this may be one of the best values in a Swiss made watch on the market today.  It is a handsome, well-made watch.  If you're looking for a really nice quartz watch at this price point, and with a chrono to boot, you cannot go wrong!  I get as many nice remarks about this watch as I do my very pricey Swiss automatics.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07602474", "1": "0.17542501", "2": "0.32078514", "3": "0.086590186", "4": "0.12955782", "5": "0.20782787"}}
