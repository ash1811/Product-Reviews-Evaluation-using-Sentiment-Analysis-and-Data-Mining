{"text": "I purchased a pair of these after being fitted at REI for high arches, plantar fasciitis and pronation... after wearing them in my hikers for a month, I bought four more pairs!  They say it takes a bit to get used to them, but for me they helped immediately and my feet were no longer sore after my hikes.  Wonderful product - but be sure you're getting the proper ones, blue versus green, etc.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08435957", "1": "0.31951407", "2": "0.11408148", "3": "0.10933922", "4": "0.17817801", "5": "0.07062461", "6": "0.12390307"}}
