{"text": "I bought this sock to wear with my rain boots in the winter. It has lots of cushion and I have had no blisters after wearing them long hours. This sock fits my foot well, but is not as binding as other Experian type Thorlos I have worn. The extra cushion on the bottom is really nice, and I have been wearing them around my house as a slipper sock. Only buy them if you have extra room in your shoe.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09530769", "1": "0.25878865", "2": "0.16538393", "3": "0.082369156", "4": "0.032775685", "5": "0.27556756", "6": "0.0898073"}}
