{"text": "Somehow with all the reviews I read I missed the detail that this diaper has snaps on one side. This is an unexpected bonus! The material, especially the gathered elastic leg holes, is so much softer than I expected. This will not leave crinkly elastic imprints on her thighs like I feared. Ordered a size large for my 20lb 14 month old who wears size 4 diapers and it fits great.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now it is one year later, my two year old wears a size 3t-4t pull-up, and this swim diaper still fits her perfectly!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.045106743", "1": "0.22812256", "2": "0.09974007", "3": "0.3208317", "4": "0.07176512", "5": "0.11942191", "6": "0.11501192"}}
