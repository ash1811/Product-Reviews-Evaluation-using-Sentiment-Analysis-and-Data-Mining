{"text": "It had been quite a time since having any type of hat that could be used in winter.  This has taken care of that issue though!Purchased two of these, one in black and one in grey and I love both colors - although it is pretty straight forward.  Guess sometimes one orders something and the color isn't quite the same as what you see in the picture.In any case, at first the initial few times I wore the item a 'long time', approximately an hour or so it felt like it might be too hot for my head.  However, that quickly subsided and now they fit and feel very comfortable.All in all, we would purchase these again and might even buy a couple more.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.103196", "1": "0.34409183", "2": "0.23467359", "4": "0.14057633", "5": "0.080582395", "6": "0.09448688"}}
