{"text": "The quality of these sandals are absolutely amazing. I wore them almost every day in the spring, summer, and fall for 3 years in all kinds of environments from the mall to the trails. During the winter, I wore them around the house and even occasionally outside on a quick run to the mailbox. About 10 months ago, I deployed to Iraq for 6-months and took them with me for going between my living quarters to the shower (everyday) over dusty, rocky, dirt areas... and they held up perfectly. After I returned, I kept on wearing them. I cannot express in words how good these Sandals are.They did eventually breakdown some (but no where near as fast as other sandals) and I ordered a second pair of these sandals from Amazon, which were just like my first.Other nice touches to this product include: the beer bottle opener built into the sole and the air cushion support which really helped my feet (I have high arches).This is a GOOD investment in footwear and I'd highly recommend these sandals to anyone who doesn't want to buy new sandals every year. I hope you buy them and enjoy... note that they will have a small break-in period.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04693846", "1": "0.24513714", "2": "0.20398702", "3": "0.087126136", "4": "0.10170297", "5": "0.15674078", "6": "0.1583675"}}
