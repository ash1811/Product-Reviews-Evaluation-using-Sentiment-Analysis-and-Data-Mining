{"text": "This backpack is great! It is better than any Jansport that i've had. It is super durable and comes in many colors. I put 5 one inch binder, new balance gym shoes, three textbooks, two books, and a pencil case. This thing is a trooper. Don't hesitate buying it. It has so many pockets that I get them confused. BTW, i am in high school and we get 6 hours of homework daily!!! This backpack will last forever!I have the Plum, Whimsy Plaid and it is really nice. It could be cute and girly or evil and goth (for a girl). I would reccommend this to you for sure. This backpack is great. I will update in a year to show how it has been holding up.No cons:Pros: everything from pockets to looks and durability.DO NOT LISTEN TO ANY OTHER REVIEWS LESS THAN 5 STARS!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14011346", "1": "0.1585898", "2": "0.2770304", "3": "0.2092517", "4": "0.08720685", "5": "0.058932364", "6": "0.06887541"}}
