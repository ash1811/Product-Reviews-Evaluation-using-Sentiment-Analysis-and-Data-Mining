{"text": "They probably fit the way they should. Most gloves I buy are large and they fit fine. The ones I bought are large and fit just a little big. Not a problem as I use them while hunting and like most of my fingers inside the glove except when I need to use them. While the wool goes up my fingers a little bit more than some of my other gloves it is not so much that it prevents you from working.  I will keep these and also buy a medium to see if maybe they are more appropriate for the size of my hands.  The material is thick enough to work in all but the worst cold weather.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.34185225", "2": "0.15091246", "3": "0.31713516", "4": "0.119219065", "6": "0.065377794"}}
