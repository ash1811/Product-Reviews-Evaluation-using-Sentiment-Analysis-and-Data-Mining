{"text": "I was very disappointed when I received this watch.  The picture of the watch looks much better than the watch that I received looks, the band and case are dull and the blue face is not nearly are bright or reflective as shown in the picture.  Also, the clasp on the watch band seems to be poorly designed as it comes off or opens quite easily and unexpectedly.  It is a very thin and very light watch, but I am almost afraid to wear it for fear that the clasp will open and the watch will fall off.  The crown also feels very rough and flimsy.  Not impressed with this watch at all and would definitely would not have purchased it had I seen in person first.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.091095544", "1": "0.22242157", "2": "0.2894108", "3": "0.17026865", "4": "0.16362578", "5": "0.06066602"}}
