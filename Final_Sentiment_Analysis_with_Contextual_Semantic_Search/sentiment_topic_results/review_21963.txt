{"text": "These are decent quality shirts - I bought a couple of them - but the sizing is way off.  Ordinarily, I wear an unusually large XL, or an average size 2XL, but in this shirt, a 4XL is needed.  You have to wonder what Americans are thinking when they have clothing made in China.

Order two sizes up.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08209195", "1": "0.21348943", "2": "0.14891331", "3": "0.18528031", "4": "0.039036606", "5": "0.080596134", "6": "0.2505923"}}
