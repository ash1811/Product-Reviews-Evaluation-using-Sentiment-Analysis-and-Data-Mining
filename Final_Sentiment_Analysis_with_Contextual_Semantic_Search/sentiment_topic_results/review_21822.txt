{"text": "I specifically ordered TWO packages (3) each of boys boxer briefs for my son, these people send  ONE package of FIVE!!!  I would think that if a seller doesn't have EXACTLY what a customer orders as advertised they would at least show the courtesy of informing you, and allowing you to decide, not take it upon themselves and send an alternative, that's also SHORT of what you originally ordered, and PAID for.  Additionally, had I known it would take almost two weeks to ship a couple of pair of boys underwear I would have simply gone to Walmart, as much as I hate that idea, at least I would have gotten what my money paid for.  I'll forever avoid these people like the plague from here on.  UPDATE, these folks promptly contacted me to make things right, which is fair and just, but...I'm now wondering if it will take ten day's to receive the one pair of makeup boxers, being a single dad is no joke, any time I can save by ordering his school clothes here is greatly appreciated.  No more mail order under garments that's for sure.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21149841", "1": "0.26144564", "2": "0.07200397", "3": "0.15348034", "4": "0.12275565", "5": "0.06951203", "6": "0.10930398"}}
