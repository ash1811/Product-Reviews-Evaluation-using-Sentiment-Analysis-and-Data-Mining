{"text": "My favorite boyshort panties so far.  It fits super well right out of the wash, but as you wear it during the day, it gets looser around the crotch and sometimes rides up.  But every piece of clothing is that way - tighter when you first put it on.  I'm a M pant size 8 underwear size 6, and I would say I probably can't go a size down on this.Overall it's soft and comfortable.  No panty lines.
