{"text": "I like these shoes. I bought them because I work in  a school and I am on my feet all day. I was trying to wear high heels daily as I love how they look. After days of coming home with terribly sore feet I &#34;gave in&#34;. My only complaint is that I think the leather looks cheap. The stitching on the leather is really large and far apart making it look like the type of stitching on cheaper shoes. The leather does not look like leather to me either, as it has rubbery look. All in all I like these shoes though. They are very comfortable and stylish. If I can't wear heels, these are for sure just as hip but in a different way.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04349108", "1": "0.3700369", "2": "0.26174784", "4": "0.08290571", "5": "0.14463618", "6": "0.094667375"}}
