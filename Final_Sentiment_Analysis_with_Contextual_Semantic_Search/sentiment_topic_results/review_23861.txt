{"text": "I've just ordered my third pair of these.  My only complaint about them is they could last a little longer, but if accomplishing that makes them less comfortable don't do it. So, I'm going to say don't even try, because I don't want the screwed up.  Don't mistake these shoes for the Grasshoppers Ashland shoe.  My foot measures to fit a 9W, a 9W in the Stretch Plus fits perfectly, is comfortable.  The Ashland needs a 10W and it doesn't feel right.  The Ashland was narrower and the sole is stiffer, didn't lace up as far on your foot, one less set of holes, so they look a little odd.  If you have a wide foot the Stretch Plus is better, a better fit, a much more comfortable shoe.  Other shoes I wear and my feet and ankles start hurting.  When I wear the Stretch Plus, they stop hurting.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.30584198", "2": "0.109093584", "3": "0.101313844", "4": "0.22408774", "5": "0.06703636", "6": "0.19034919"}}
