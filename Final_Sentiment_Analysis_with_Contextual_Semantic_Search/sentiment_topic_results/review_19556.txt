{"text": "My feet are n heaven!  Super soft lining, and they fit like a dream!  I wear a size 8, but I usually wear 8 1/2 because I like the room.  Where this comes in whole sizes only, I ordered a 9, figuring with socks, it would be perfect.  Nope.  They were a bit too big.  Returned and ordered an 8, they fit like a dream!  Super cute, too.  There's straps all over the place to adjust the calves perfectly.  It comes laced, with a spare set of laces.  The treads are perfect for an icy sidewalk, nice and thick with plenty of grip.  Perfect!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.048490893", "1": "0.48130718", "2": "0.13750376", "3": "0.18563184", "4": "0.058147285", "5": "0.050454285", "6": "0.038464777"}}
