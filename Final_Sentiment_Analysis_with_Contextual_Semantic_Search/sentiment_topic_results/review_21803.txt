{"text": "I don't know how many travel bags I've gone through over the years, but this one is by far the best! It holds EVERYTHING I need with me in the bathroom when traveling, closes securely, takes up minimal space in my bag and has a sturdy hook for hanging once you're there. Unlike some other people who have left reviews, I never had a problem closing it up after it's filled. It can hold:-All my makeup (the bottom clear spot is perfect for makeup brushes & tweezers)-Shampoo/conditioner/hairspray (travel size)-Hairbrush-Full size toothbrush & toothpaste-deodorant/swabs/body wash & sponge-Lotion/creamsThere's nothing I need that doesn't fit in this baby. I bought one for each member of my family and will likely buy more for holiday gifts.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.055642292", "1": "0.2066055", "2": "0.3246923", "3": "0.11257021", "4": "0.057986893", "5": "0.07521187", "6": "0.16729093"}}
