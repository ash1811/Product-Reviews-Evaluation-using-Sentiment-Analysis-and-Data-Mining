{"text": "I bought this to wear with a formal dress during a cruise I will be taking in August. I haven't had a chance to wear it for any real length of time but I tried it on and it seems to work great and  appears very well made. I even sat down in it to see what would happen and it held well and didn't curl up or anything. I plan on trying to wear it backwards if it doesn't look right with a formal gown while facing forwards. The seam isn't large though, so I don't think it will be noticable if left facing forward. I don't have any problems with a muffin top but I do have a little pooch that is noticeable when I wear tight fitting clothes. From what I can tell so far, this will perfect for flattening out my pooch. The only small problem I have noticed so far is I believe due to my hour glass shape accompanied by my large bottom. When I have the waistnipper on so that it is covering my pooch, it bulges slightly in the back and sides where it meets my bottom. I think this might be because I have a larger bottom then my stomach and waist, I bought a small and it might be just right for my waist but a little too small for my bottom. I have a few pounds to lose before the cruise so I hope it will help to clear up the little bulge, if not I pan on using some white duct tape to see if that will do the trick. So far this product is amazing though, I also received it well packaged and faster then the delivery time indicated. I would recommend this item and seller.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.0779128", "1": "0.37361556", "2": "0.10939659", "3": "0.23559076", "4": "0.095593184", "6": "0.105021775"}}
