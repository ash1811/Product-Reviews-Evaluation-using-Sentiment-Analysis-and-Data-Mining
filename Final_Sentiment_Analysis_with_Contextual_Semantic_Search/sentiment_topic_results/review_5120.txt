{"text": "I bought this on sale from EMS to use during the winter with myMerrell Men's Chameleon 4 Ventilator Gore-Texand The North Face Snowsquall Mid Boot. Here is why I like them.1. These socks are extremely comfortable to wear and also very warm.2. My feet don't sweat because the socks breathe very well since they consist of about 76% merino wool, which has the added benefit of not smelling after heavy use.3. These are also perfect to keep your feet warm at night under the covers.So why only 4 stars? Because these are described as a \"light\" hiking sock yet are just as thick as \"heavy duty\" socks from other companies. Fortunately I size up one full size in hiking and winter footwear because these socks cause at least a half size increase. No way can I wear them in my regular shoes where I have not sized up.Bottom line: Quality product but much thicker than expected. This should not be advertised as a \"light\" sock.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.18444124", "1": "0.10089233", "2": "0.113194026", "3": "0.07272236", "4": "0.19936137", "5": "0.1361223", "6": "0.1932663"}}
