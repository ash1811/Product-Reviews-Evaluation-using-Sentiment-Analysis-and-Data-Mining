{"text": "Received the watch today feels cheap but it's ok, basically for the price of lunch you get something that should serve you for 2 to 3 years , I give it 4 stars out of 5.  You'll never have to worry about how expensive a watch you are wearing whether you'll damage it or get mugged that's for sure.  A good product.  This is a good watch to wear in a third world country or in an urban environment.  I've noticed in the past when I'm wearing a much much more expensive watch people check it out with ths watch they won't take a second look at it which is what I want.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03502278", "1": "0.41026536", "2": "0.22943121", "3": "0.041475084", "4": "0.11657631", "5": "0.16475222"}}
