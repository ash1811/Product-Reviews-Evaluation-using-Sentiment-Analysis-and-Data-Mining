{"text": "I purchased these insoles to replace the standard ones that come with shoes. The other reviews I read on Amazon and on running pages recommended these insoles as being very supportive. I am not the one wearing them so I can't say whether this is true. However, my teen son seems very happy with the way the material supports his feet. There is a nice heel cup and arch support. They feel a bit hard. However, this firmness is what makes the insole great for supporting your foot.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05186906", "1": "0.16280639", "2": "0.3009257", "3": "0.21053652", "4": "0.13585116", "5": "0.0764503", "6": "0.061560817"}}
