{"text": "I have been waiting for 6 weeks for the credit of the red patent 3012 thigh high boot from Pleasers and the red high heel pump from pleasers!  The pleasers 3000 I received a credit for already.  The red patent slim from I love Sexy I kept but the 3rd pair I ordered the Pleasers 3012 and red highest heel have yet to credit my account back!  I took it to ups myself and paid the return with $100.00 insurance secured for what look like are boots worth $20.  I'm sorry I have not had any issues ever with Amazon cause your stuff is great and I'm always happy with my purchases but since I kept my receipts on the returns of these items please ask your 3rd party seller what happen!  Because they didn't include paper work inside I just mailed them back to the place that shipped them!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13893247", "1": "0.27462557", "2": "0.10605182", "3": "0.16373584", "4": "0.14984718", "5": "0.07907693", "6": "0.08773021"}}
