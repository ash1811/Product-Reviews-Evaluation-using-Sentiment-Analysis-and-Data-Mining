{"text": "I was looking for burnt orange polo with an even bottom that wasn't too expensive.  I found it.  However, my options were very limited but this one wasn't expensive so I figured I could gamble.  It's an ok polo, but like all 100% cotton polos there will be issues.  The collar tends to roll a bit.  The seams of the sleeves(inside) are a bit too noticeable (but not irritating to the skin) even though I wear an undershirt.  Will shrink a bit, as expected but the sizing is very accurate afterward.  For the price it's a decent all cotton polo.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.095231146", "1": "0.43120995", "2": "0.22363429", "3": "0.12126497", "5": "0.07487233", "6": "0.050912756"}}
