{"text": "With two slots on each side for credit cards and/or ID and a center slot in the middle for folded bills, this is a fairly handy little \"wallet\". I'm not your average purse-toting type gal, but I also don't like the butch feeling that comes with carrying a big wallet. This is a perfect solution - it is very thin, comfortable, and attractive for the price. I ordered two (black and brown) and the brown one started to split down the center seam after a little use, so I'll have to baby it some, but for the price this is still a steal.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.4612344", "2": "0.16250728", "3": "0.1269328", "4": "0.030474452", "5": "0.043992992", "6": "0.1722079"}}
