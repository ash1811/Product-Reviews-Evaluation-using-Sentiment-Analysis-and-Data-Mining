{"text": "These slippers arrived as expected. They were the correct size, fit comfortably & were rather good looking for slippers. They are holding up well so far. I am a large person, over 6 ft tall & weigh well over 250 lbs & find the slippers comfortable. They seem to be well made & as I stated above they are pleasant to look at. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of slippers to wear around the house.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3454651", "2": "0.03508787", "3": "0.09616558", "4": "0.15970595", "5": "0.21892978", "6": "0.14136674"}}
