{"text": "These things feel great. Replaced a pair of Redwing Irish Setters that I wore for 2 weeks and never broke in and hurt my feet. I wore these the first day I got them for 8 hours for work and they felt great. Now that they are more broken in they feel amazing. Best fit I have ever had.Made in America! A bit expensive, but way better fit and quality than RW for $40 more.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12699564", "1": "0.36825863", "3": "0.131366", "4": "0.17702575", "6": "0.18952167"}}
