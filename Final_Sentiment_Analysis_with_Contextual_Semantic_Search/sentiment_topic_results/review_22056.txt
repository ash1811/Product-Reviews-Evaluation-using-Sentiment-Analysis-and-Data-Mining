{"text": "Super high quality gloves. The product description, oddly gives you their company history and then talks about socks. I don't want to know about any of this. So here's what I think should have been written. Super thick, super warm wind proof gloves are true to size. I wear medium and they fit perfectly. The content label states \"%85 wool %15 nylon with deerskin palm. Thinsulate liner Hand wash Dry flat Made in Haiti\". The cuffs are extra extra long so they will keep out wind. These gloves look like they'll last forever. Nice.Edit: after a few weeks of wear, here's some additional comments. These are warm but bulky, puffy gloves. I have short fingers so sometimes glove fingers are too long. Not these gloves, the fit is perfect.  The leather palms are soft and nice but slightly stained, slightly pock marked and even has a superficial cut on one finger. None of this bothers me in the least. They are meant for palms. I mention this only because it might be a problem for some.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.062021688", "1": "0.28182", "2": "0.19200526", "3": "0.19963817", "4": "0.11938088", "5": "0.1273195", "6": "0.01781455"}}
