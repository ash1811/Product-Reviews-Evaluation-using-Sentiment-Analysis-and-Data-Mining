{"text": "I ordered this, and the sports version which I got at an amazing selling price of 19 buckeroos.I had never seen nor worn a contour bra before.This thing is like a &#34;falsie&#34; bra with the falsies built in!  You could be totally flat chested, and wha laaaa!  The le mystere to the rescue.!!!!!!!!!!!Well, I am anything but flat chested.  These bras I will keep, since I got both at good prices and perhaps I will get used to them.They seem bulky under my clothes, but I am used to Wacoal which is simply fabric supporting my breasts.  (by the way, I hate the term &#34;girls&#34;....)Anyway. what more can I say.....I can't believe that people actually like these bras.....they are not really bras, in my opinion, but rather like I say:  falsies built in to a bra.I suppose, if you were someone with uneven breasts, or someone who needed a prosthesis, these bras would be good....for the everyday person tho, I'm skeptical.  They do make you feel very large breasted....you are aware of your large breasts when wearing the bra....whether this is good or bad we'll have to see.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.2424159", "2": "0.18911882", "3": "0.07251311", "4": "0.24506426", "5": "0.08357364", "6": "0.16517158"}}
