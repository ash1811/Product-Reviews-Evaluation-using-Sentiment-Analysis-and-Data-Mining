{"text": "This is the second of these jackets I have owned, the first lasted me several years, but eventually the waterproofing gave up the ghost due to some really bad laundry practices - the person doing the laundry didn't realize that hot water and hot dry cycles were a bad thing (repeatedly).This newer jacket is cut a little different, most notably at the cuffs.  These cuffs are cut longer over the backs of your hands, to allow more protection from the weather.  In heavy weather, or with gloves on I would really appreciate this, when it isn't super nasty out or I don't have gloves on I find it mildly annoying.  Not a huge deal, but something to be aware of.Otherwise a great coat in all respects and one of my favorite pieces from Carhartt.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.035513617", "1": "0.24611583", "2": "0.14466786", "3": "0.17734475", "4": "0.038779486", "5": "0.29041886", "6": "0.067159586"}}
