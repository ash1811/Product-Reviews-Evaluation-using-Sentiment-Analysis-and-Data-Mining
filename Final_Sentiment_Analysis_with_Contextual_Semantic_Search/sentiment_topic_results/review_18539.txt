{"text": "This shoe is great looking! I bought these thinking that I would use them for work, but after wearing them a couple of times, I decided that I can actually also use them with khaki's for casual wear. The shine is great and as expected from a pair of Rockport's - they are very comfortable. I highly recommend this pair. Just take note that they were just slightly longer than my other pairs of Rockport's with the same shoe and width size. Also the brown color is closer to cordovan or burgundy but they still fit the bill.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.48398772", "2": "0.09087096", "3": "0.052744046", "4": "0.17205514", "5": "0.19410901"}}
