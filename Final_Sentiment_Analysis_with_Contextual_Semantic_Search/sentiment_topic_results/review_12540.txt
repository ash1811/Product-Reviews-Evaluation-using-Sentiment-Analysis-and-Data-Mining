{"text": "I have owned these flip flops for 8 months now. They are comfortable, sturdy, and still look good, but I do believe that Nike makes a better flip flop. I have owned several Nikes over the years and they are superior. My MAJOR complaint about these Sanuk flip flops is what happens to them when you walk in very hot sand! Within 5 feet, the straps completely stretch and no longer hold the sole close to your foot. This allows an abundance of hot sand to come onto the sole in direct contact with the bottom of my foot; additionally the sole shifts sideways so you foot is in direct contact with the hot sand. I was better off taking them off and running! Weird thing: once they cool, they go back to their original shape. I will never bring these flip flops to the river in Laughlin, NV. I never had this problem even with cheap flip flops.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07599428", "1": "0.2350895", "2": "0.14367357", "3": "0.30259383", "4": "0.10637846", "5": "0.0785232", "6": "0.057747155"}}
