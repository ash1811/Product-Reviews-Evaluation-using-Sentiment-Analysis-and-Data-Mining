{"text": "I ordered the navy backpack and can say that it looks nothing like the picture, to me the pictured navy backpack is simply blue. I can confirm that the backpack is actually a navy color if anyone was curious. Now onto the backpack, it is simply great for what I bought it for, carry my binder and books and still have room for other stuff. Straps could be beefed up a bit but its still a great backpack for school.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12609611", "1": "0.20826572", "2": "0.24079211", "3": "0.15040168", "4": "0.035798162", "6": "0.2351457"}}
