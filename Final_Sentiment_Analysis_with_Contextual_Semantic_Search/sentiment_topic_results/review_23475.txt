{"text": "This is a great watch considering what you pay for it. It's a little small for my taste, but you can read the hour easily. The specs says it's 43mm, but mine is 39mm. It runs a little fast, like a couple of minutes a week. The bright hands lasts at least two hours in the dark (they last more, but with much less bright).The packaging is awesome.The transparent back is great.The self winding system works great.Finally, I'm happy with this watch.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.2305358", "1": "0.15295894", "2": "0.13936368", "3": "0.121971", "4": "0.10046786", "5": "0.0934959", "6": "0.16120683"}}
