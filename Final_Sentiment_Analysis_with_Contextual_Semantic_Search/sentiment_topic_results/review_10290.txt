{"text": "I'm not sure what others see in this pant. It is not women's sizing like the caption says. I ordered an XL which is the size I wear, and no part of it fit me. The waist was the right size, but the hips were too big and the inseam too long.  And the leg length! I could have cut off 10 inches and it still would have been long enough.  I was going to return it but had my husband try them on and they fit him!  He is 6'2\" and 240 lbs and they were too long on him!  They are definitely cut for a man's shape.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.37870598", "2": "0.046528764", "3": "0.28530568", "4": "0.14129592", "5": "0.034198776", "6": "0.11110087"}}
