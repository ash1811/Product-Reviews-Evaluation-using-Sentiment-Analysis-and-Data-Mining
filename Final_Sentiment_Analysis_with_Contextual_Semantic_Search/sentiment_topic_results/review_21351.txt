{"text": "I broke down and bought this finally. I was having bad hip pain that was keeping me up at night, my stomach muscles felt like they were going to give up, and it was hard to just walk from the bus to my office. This thing is wonderful. I put it on and was able to stand on hardwood floors an bake a cake the night I got it. Just the day before that would have been impossible.I am 35 weeks pregnant and getting to be a good size. I am 5'4&#34; and weigh 164 right now. I read the reviews that said it runs small, and the reviews that said it runs big...I followed the size chart and bought a small. It fits fine. I put it on the 2nd loops when I'm standing and walking, and on the first loops when I'm sitting. I've also measured around my bump and hips and hopefully that is helpful to some in choosing a size. My bump (where this belt lies, like in the product photo) is 38 inches. My hips are 39.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10492773", "1": "0.21673572", "2": "0.14275943", "3": "0.286716", "4": "0.11942377", "5": "0.12700476"}}
