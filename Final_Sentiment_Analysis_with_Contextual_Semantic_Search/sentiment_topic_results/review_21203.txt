{"text": "After struggling for years to find a V-neck undershirt that actually was low enough to fall below my outer garments, I spotted this shirt on Amazon and read the reviews.  It is just what I was looking for.  I can't believe how so many manufacturers produce v-necks that are so shallow that they show through.  This shirt not only has a great &#34;V,&#34; but it's comfortable, is long enough to stay tucked in (even after repeated washings), and is a nice weight.  The price is a bit higher than I like to pay for undershirts, but the shirt is so good that I'm willing to pay more.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.083186254", "1": "0.323783", "2": "0.03145384", "3": "0.13164213", "4": "0.17629783", "5": "0.17370294", "6": "0.07993396"}}
