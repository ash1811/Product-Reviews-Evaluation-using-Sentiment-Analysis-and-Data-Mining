{"text": "I purchased this watch after wanting a G-Shock. Well, it just so happened that time changed back an hour right after I purchased the watch. No problem, right? I try to change the time... and the upper left button no longer works. So as long as I wear the watch during the summer, I'll have the right time. The rubber strap is not very comfortable either. It should be more flexible.Very frustrated. I'm still just sitting on the watch because I'm too aggravated to take the time to actually send the stupid thing in. I won't be purchasing another G-Shock for a while. I'll stick with Suunto.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10300993", "1": "0.3031306", "2": "0.24749304", "3": "0.10164344", "4": "0.04071175", "5": "0.1694156", "6": "0.034595612"}}
