{"text": "This is a good all-purpose hoodie that is comfortable and warm, but not too warm. It's sized for men, so the shoulders are huge and the bottom band is tight, but I should've thought of that before I bought it. The royal blue is not 100% cotton, but it's still mostly cotton and it didn't fade in the washer or shrink in the dryer. It's good for working in the yard on cool days and it was a decent price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.5053314", "3": "0.3123622", "5": "0.16592658"}}
