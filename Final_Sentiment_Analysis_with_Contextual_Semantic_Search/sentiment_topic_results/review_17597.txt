{"text": "This watch is your typical Casio watch.  It works well and lasts forever, or until the color all wears off and it looks like it's been through the war.  What I want in a watch isn't much, to be water resistant for swimming and showering and such, for the band and watch to last a long time,  to be accurate, to have a light that makes it easy to see in the dark, and to have all the information I need at a glance such as the date, day of the week, and digital time.  This watch fits the bill, as do many, many others on the market.  This watchband is comfortable in that it's fabric, but I like my bands loose, and this watch always slides around to underneath my wrist and I'm always putting it back on top of my wrist, which is a bit annoying.  Other than that it's a typical inexpensive Casio watch with good crisp digital lettering that is easy to see, and a light button that is easy to light up and see.  However, Casio should put a delay on the light so that it stays on for a few seconds after you press the button.  But it only stays on as long as you hold the button down.They've tried to put just about everything on a watch, but all I've ever really used were the basics.  A watch that gets the basics right is what impresses me.  I assume in the future the Pebble type watch will be all the rage, but will they hold up to abuse?
