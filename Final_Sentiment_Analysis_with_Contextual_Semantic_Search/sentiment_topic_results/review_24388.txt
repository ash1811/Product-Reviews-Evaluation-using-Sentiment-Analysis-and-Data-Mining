{"text": "I just moved to the upper Midwest and had to invest in winter clothing, stat! Because I run outside, and will likely have to shovel snow in below-zero temperatures, I needed a no-nonsense warm hat. The Carhartt watch cap fits the bill perfectly.My head is size 7 1/4 to 7 1/2, and the watch cap is just slightly big. What that means is a little bit of an air pocket at the top of my head, even when the cap is pulled down over the ears. Not a problem--still looks like it fits well to others. Also, you can pull it down to your eyebrows in front and the base of your neck in back (for maximum coverage and warmth).The weave is dense enough to keep out wind, but the acrylic material is not itchy or constricting. It doesn't feel heavy on the head like wool, either--I forget I'm wearing it when I put it on, and that's rare because I'm not a hat person.Overall, this cap is warmer and more wind-resistant than my military-issue fleece beanie, and much more comfortable than any wool watch-cap I've had. It was an excellent purchase and I expect it will become a winter friend of mine for many years to come.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10144064", "1": "0.1985847", "2": "0.14206076", "3": "0.22860037", "4": "0.09198256", "5": "0.10997636", "6": "0.1273546"}}
