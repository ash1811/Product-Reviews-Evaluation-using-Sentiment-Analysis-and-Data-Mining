{"text": "Too small, like a few sizes off too small. I am an XXl size. I ordered a XXXL size as this is to be an outdoor shirt thus roomy. The shirt is tagged &#34;XXXL&#34; but the sleeves were too short, The cuffs would not button around my wrists, nor the neck line would button around my neck. Mis-tagged? I don't know as the shoulders fit good and the length is about right. It's like they mixed parts.Originally (though I see it now in the ad) the shirt is not advertised as a Rothco brand - which I would not have ordered it if I'd known that.Returned.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1084689", "1": "0.16855495", "2": "0.03571925", "3": "0.2875324", "4": "0.14183648", "5": "0.0862242", "6": "0.1716638"}}
