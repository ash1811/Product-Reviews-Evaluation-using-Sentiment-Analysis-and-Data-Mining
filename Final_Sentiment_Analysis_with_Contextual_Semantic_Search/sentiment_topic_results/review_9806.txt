{"text": "Onitsuka is in european sizes, but on the listing they show an inaccurate conversation into American sizes. A women's 8.5 is a 39EU. I order a women's 8.5 and they sent me a size 40, which was way too large. This is why all the reviewers have sizing issues. It's listed incorrectly and there's no way to get a replacement in the correct size, because it the shoes are too big they consider it your mistake, and they only offer a refund. I own the Mexico 66 in 3 other colors all size 8.5 or 39 EU and they fit like a glove.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10062857", "1": "0.2038584", "2": "0.2064093", "4": "0.06915977", "5": "0.14838158", "6": "0.26863512"}}
