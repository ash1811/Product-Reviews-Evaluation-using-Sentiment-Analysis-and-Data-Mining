{"text": "My husband, for Christmas, asked for a &#34;Dressier Sweatshirt&#34;.  He wears plain old sweatshirts around the house in the winter.  They're comfy and warm.  But if we're going to visit the grandkids and he's going to be outside, a &#34;dressier&#34; sweatshirt looks better.

After washing, it looks good as new.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08385635", "1": "0.25553486", "3": "0.107973844", "4": "0.19832511", "5": "0.20705938", "6": "0.14398669"}}
