{"text": "This shoe is to replace my ASICS and the reviews brought me to this shoe.I walk 4-5 miles each day. These are comfortable, sturdy, and well-structured. The wide heel offers great stability. There is cushioning above the heel which at first I thought may cause a blister, but eventually softened up.The arch support is good, not excellent.I got an 8.5 wide, which works for me. I usually order B widths with my ASICS, but with this one, I'm glad for the extra room.One issue I have is that this shoe feels a bit stiff compared to my favorite all leather walking shoe, ASICS Gel Foundation Walking shoe with the softest, cushy leather and arch support....but, sold out in my size, most places.Overall, a good shoe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.108289", "1": "0.10600958", "2": "0.29696548", "3": "0.1902227", "4": "0.05036194", "5": "0.16753732", "6": "0.08061398"}}
