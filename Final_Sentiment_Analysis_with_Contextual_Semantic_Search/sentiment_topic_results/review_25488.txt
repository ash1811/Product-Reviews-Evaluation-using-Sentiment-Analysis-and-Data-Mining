{"text": "This &#34;Ammo&#34; pouch is much larger than I expected. I ordered it not for ammo but to attach to my back pack and put a CB radio and batteries in the front pouch. I still have extra room and my CB is &#34;Old School&#34; large. I've learneds from the past to not leave batteries in the CB. Also I tape the batteries together with the polarity the same to prevent corrosion.As soon as it arrived(Early) I ordered another one for my Scanner,Portable Radio,and NOAA weather radio. And there's still room for a flashlight,compass,and Cell phone. With the exception of the CB all of these items are miniature and work like a charm out in the desert. I would highly recommend this item.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15819058", "1": "0.2220378", "2": "0.048848383", "3": "0.123245575", "4": "0.34026873", "5": "0.034366783", "6": "0.073042184"}}
