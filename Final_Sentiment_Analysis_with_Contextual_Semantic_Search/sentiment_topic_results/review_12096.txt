{"text": "I'm a Wacoal girl, and I found this Lunaire bra just way too stretchy and big. Comfortable, but it looked sloppy on me because the straps couldn't be shortened enough (so I was droopy) and the sides had very little support, so I bulged out over the top of the sides. And the cups seemed to be quite far apart. I am a petite woman, a 34DD, and I think this would be a nice bra on a tall, slim woman. But not on someone like me who needs some shaping and support.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.056432042", "1": "0.2009479", "2": "0.053583447", "3": "0.20284022", "4": "0.1999738", "5": "0.09678421", "6": "0.18943836"}}
