{"text": "I bought this polish to try to get a better shine then using Kiwi polish.  I have been using Kiwi polish for years, but wanted a nicer shine without the work.  I hate spit shining boots.  I can say that after a few polishes the Lincoln wax gave me a deeper shine, but nothing amazing.  I will still have to spit shine if I want the high gloss (which isn't happening so I don't know if that is easier).  If the leather seems to hold up as well with this wax as with the Kiwi I will stick to it.  If not I will switch back as treatment and preservation of the leather is more important then the shine.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14504722", "2": "0.15741761", "3": "0.10996062", "4": "0.119468205", "5": "0.2859032", "6": "0.17968987"}}
