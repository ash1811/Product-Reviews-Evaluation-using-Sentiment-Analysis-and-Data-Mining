{"text": "Im not gonna lie, Ive got what you would call a big \"man can\" and the extra room in the butt and legs make these fit great. I dont have to buy jeans too big in the waste just to make room for the junk in the trunk. Also they look great. I have a perfect fit AND it looks cool. I no longer have to buy jeans that are too baggy, which make me look like an old man trying to be a gangsta.The price is a bit high, but then again I like the fit, the look, and they are super durable. Gonna buy 2 more when I get paid. If you have a normal waste but your legs and butt are big buy these jeans. They fit your actual waste AND they fit every where else as if they were made just for you.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07438731", "1": "0.3922808", "2": "0.040817786", "3": "0.26659992", "4": "0.08827641", "5": "0.046332918", "6": "0.0913049"}}
