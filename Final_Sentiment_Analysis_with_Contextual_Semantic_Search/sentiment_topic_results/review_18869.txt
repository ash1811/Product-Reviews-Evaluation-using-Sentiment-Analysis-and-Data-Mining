{"text": "i am completely surprised how good the quality of this jeans are!the craftmaship is very good... something rare in levis, as you can find some defect on the garment they make. this jeans were made in colombia. the people in charge of inspecting the garment did their job!the material is soft and the cut/ style is pretty good, i have a few 501 and i definitely will buy more of this 514 style. maybe some people that like their jeans  rough might not like this one as they feel soft, if you have armani exchange jeans that's like the soft they feel. i had the black color, for sure not all the colors are made of the same material.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.36377153", "2": "0.111539386", "3": "0.20307955", "4": "0.10661027", "5": "0.10722542", "6": "0.10530313"}}
