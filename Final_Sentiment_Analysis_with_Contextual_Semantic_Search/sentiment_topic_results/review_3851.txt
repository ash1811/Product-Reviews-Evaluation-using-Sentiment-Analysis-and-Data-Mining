{"text": "I have been wearing Spanx Higher Power for years and I love them. They tuck the tummy, lift the booty, and smooth the thighs. I am seriously disappointed, however, that they no longer have the silicone strip around the top band. Because that is no longer there, it slides down and makes a gross bunching of fat on my back. If I wear my hair down or wear a jacket, it's ok...but I have to keep yanking it up. BRING BACK THE SILICONE STRIP!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.22239918", "1": "0.20300074", "2": "0.11618314", "3": "0.27308553", "6": "0.17867382"}}
