{"text": "During my wife's pregnancy, she was diagnosed not only with borderline pre-eclampsia but polyhydramnios (excessive amniotic fluid) as well.  Both of these on top of a pregnancy made her VERY uncomfortable and she complained of aching all over.  I looked far and wide for anything to help relieve her pain during her pregnancy and stumbled across this item.  After reading about it, I decided ~$15 was a small price to pay to help alleviate her discomforts.After wearing it almost everyday for her pregnancy, she liked it but has mixed feelings.  She says it does help with her back and abdominal pain because it lifts her baby bump.  However, she says it only really helps when she's standing up.  When she sits down, the cradle band is uncomfortable to wear.  She claims not only does it come loose (requiring her to re-adjust it) when she sits down, but the material folds and puts pressure on her as well.  This is a catch-22 in her situation, as she was put on bedrest and was told not to be on her feet by her doctor due to the pre-eclamptic symptoms.I assume that had she not been borderline pre-eclamptic, this band would have been more enjoyable for her since she would have been on her feet a lot more.  Regardless, it does work and $15 was a small price to pay.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06812403", "1": "0.26850274", "2": "0.073192015", "3": "0.13783215", "4": "0.15440413", "5": "0.07117231", "6": "0.22677262"}}
