{"text": "My husband has superfeet orange, green and blue in all his shoes. He always insisted I tried them but I never did. It just so happens I went spring skiing and kinda overdid it ( 8hours a day, seven days a week) so it wasn't to my surprise I \"overused\"  my right knee especially.  I then decided to try superfeet. I started with the copper one, since I have low arch feet. Put that on a hiking pair of boots and went test it out. It did it's job, especially because my left leg is a tad longer than the right one meaning I apply much more pressure on the left insole and copper superfeet molded to my needs immediately.  It was a comfortable hike but with knee support  on my right knee, just in case. Then based on the large amount of reviews on the green one I took the plunge and bought it. Even with low arch feet I felt the comfort of the arch support that is not in the middle of the arch of your feet, but slightly back. Still, the front part of the insoles wasn't comfortable for me. I felt I needed a more cushy forefront. That's how the orange superfeet came to my life. It's got the arch support of the green superfeet but the forefront is very soft too. I have it in all my hiking boots (that's what you wear the most when you live in the mountains like me). I have finished long hikes, climbing steep mountains and then coming back down (which is the toughest part on my knees) with my feet much more rested than before and my knee doesn't bother me anymore. Orange superfeet fixed it! It was all about bad posture!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12642917", "1": "0.13036457", "2": "0.121132195", "3": "0.19098587", "4": "0.09615236", "5": "0.1864399", "6": "0.14849596"}}
