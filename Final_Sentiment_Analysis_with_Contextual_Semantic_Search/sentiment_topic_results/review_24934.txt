{"text": "I have been hiking 15-30 miles per weekend and my feet were sore after every hike, so I decided to purchase these. This version helped my feet, but all the pain was transferred to my big toes instead. Around mile 11 on 2 hikes, the pain was unbearable. I believe it is just because of how rigid the insole is at the forefoot area, and the constant pressure on the forefoot during ascents/descents. I've switched to the oranges, which have worked much better.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18697749", "1": "0.24411097", "2": "0.19048655", "3": "0.06270152", "4": "0.089078225", "5": "0.06939477", "6": "0.1572505"}}
