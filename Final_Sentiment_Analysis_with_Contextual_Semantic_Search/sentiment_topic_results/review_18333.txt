{"text": "Bought these to compliment my grandson's kindergarten graduation suit. They fit and worked out quite well. In fact he called them his &#34;awesome&#34; shoes! He wouldn't take off his suit or these shoes until bedtime! The shoes are slip-ons (easy for him to put on by himself) and very stylish. That's why I got them. I like that he likes them. Pricing was right, packaging was secure, and delivery was timely.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.15514356", "2": "0.27463025", "3": "0.11812411", "4": "0.13309303", "5": "0.06670753", "6": "0.24840249"}}
