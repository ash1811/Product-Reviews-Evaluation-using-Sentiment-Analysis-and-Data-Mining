{"text": "This dip polish is fabulous and easy. Even very tarnished pieces of silver jewelry gleam in no time.Paste polish is best for silver flatware because dip polish can completely remove patina, but this product, labeled for jewelry, works great for that purpose. One older bracelet has some patina that I prefer to preserve, so I didn't dip it for long, and it looks terrific, a bit of the patina intact. I wouldn't guarantee that patina on jewelry would be preserved, but, on this bracelet, it was fine after dipping it very briefly with a watchful eye.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.23445883", "1": "0.20656595", "2": "0.18120112", "3": "0.04350715", "5": "0.06341722", "6": "0.26809675"}}
