{"text": "I bought this product for my 84 year old mother who had shoulder replacement surgery. She wanted to try a front close bra after her shoulder healed completely, and she had always worn Playtex. They fit perfectly, but they were hard for her to put on. I had to help her and then with her arthritic hands she had a hard time hooking the hooks on the bra. For a younger person that needed a front close bra, these bras would be wonderful. I would recomment them for most women, but not for most senior citizens.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14985158", "1": "0.16358761", "2": "0.073337264", "3": "0.28334725", "4": "0.05664045", "5": "0.16014104", "6": "0.11309481"}}
