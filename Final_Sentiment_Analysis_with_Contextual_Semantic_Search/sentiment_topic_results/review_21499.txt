{"text": "This is a stylish watch that was perfect for my girlfriend (very thin wrists). The leather seems of decent quality, and the styling is great. It is not a precision time piece, but the timekeeping is good enough for every day use and definitely within the norm when compared to other watches in the same price range.The sizing seems to be able to accomidate a wide range of wrist sizes, but it is definitely better suited for smaller wrists. The face is a lot smaller than it may look in the picture.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.035991304", "1": "0.11197328", "2": "0.16436929", "3": "0.3104068", "4": "0.10104265", "5": "0.2000438", "6": "0.076172866"}}
