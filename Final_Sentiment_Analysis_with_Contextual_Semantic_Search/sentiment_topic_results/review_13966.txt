{"text": "This is a beautiful, simple watch. It does nothing special. However, it is the right size (not too big); it is very easy to read with great contrast between the black face and white numerals and hands; it is also nicely luminescent so I have no trouble reading it in the dark. I happened to have an 18mm leather watch strap from the Timex that broke, so I switched that strap onto this Citizen. That makes it look like an understated elegant day-to-day watch, rather than a quasi-military watch with the cloth strap. What I appreciate most, though, is the exactness ... the second hand always exactly aligns with one of the 60 indicators around the dial; the day and date are perfectly aligned within their respective window. It provides a sense of being well crafted.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09814773", "1": "0.10522253", "2": "0.25193992", "3": "0.21087204", "4": "0.12425689", "5": "0.051514793", "6": "0.15804607"}}
