{"text": "I wear a toe ring 24/7, 365 days out of the year, but after a year I like to change my toe-ring to something new, usually changing it around my birthday (May 1st). I went in search on Amazon.com as usual and came across this one which reminded me of my mom's wedding ring. I bought it and it arrived within the same week.First thing I noticed is that it is easy to put on and bend into the correct tightness for my toe. I've had toe-rings be VERY hard to shape, and some that are TOO weak and break the same day, this one is a perfect medium. Next thing is it is very comfortable; My last toe-ring would snag and twist around my toe and I could feel it, so annoying I'd have to take my shoes off to correct it. This toe-ring is very comfortable, I can't even feel it even if it's turned around! Lastly, the SPARKLE! The first time I stepped into some light the top would actually sparkle, it's very beautiful, especially for the great price!If you're the type that wears toe-rings all the time like I do (even when swimming) I recommend this one!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18370071", "1": "0.30963066", "2": "0.09389601", "3": "0.10346765", "4": "0.19512488", "5": "0.045711823", "6": "0.06846824"}}
