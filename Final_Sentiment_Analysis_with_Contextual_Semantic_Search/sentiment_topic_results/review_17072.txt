{"text": "Got this for a wedding to replace an old tuxedo shirt.  I had read other reviews and I thought based on them that this would be a nice permanent replacement for my tuxedo shirt.  Well, unfortunately, the old adage is true here - you get what you pay for.  This review is based on the fit.  I'm 6'1&#34;, 190 lbs, athletic buildPros:-Its a formal shirt-Its a nice white, not off-white-It comes with free, horrible plastic black buttons (worthless, but unexpected)Cons:-Horrid Fit - very loose in the body and the arms were a bit wanky-Stray string hanging on a few buttonsUnfortunately, Fit is everything for me when it comes to fashion.  This shirt did not fit me well but I imagine it may work out better for someone who has a beer belly and some fat arms.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16410601", "1": "0.21106467", "2": "0.12917642", "3": "0.13636117", "4": "0.052519593", "5": "0.14660436", "6": "0.16016777"}}
