{"text": "My biggest concern when buying this watch was band size.  I am 6'1 and 200 pounds, so after reading many reviews, I was a bit worried that it would not fit or strangle my arm.  I got the watch, and put it on and had 3 spare loops for adjustment.  I believe you would have to have a very large are for the size of the band to be an issue.There hasnt been much sun around the past 7 days or so and that made me a bit nervous as to how well the watch would run out of the box, but it seems that light from in the house is plenty sufficient.Very nice looking watch that goes well in all settings.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.28805944", "2": "0.14018333", "3": "0.20611255", "4": "0.06938049", "5": "0.048766676", "6": "0.244981"}}
