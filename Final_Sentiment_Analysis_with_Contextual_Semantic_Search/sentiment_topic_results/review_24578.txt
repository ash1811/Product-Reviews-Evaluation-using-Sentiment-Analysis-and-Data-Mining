{"text": "This is a nice leotard - soft acrylic fabric, very smooth.  I ordered a size larger based on other reviews - that was a good decision.  Works great as a layering piece.  I took one star away because the fabric has a flowery odor (something like a dryer sheet) that has not washed off after two washings.  the good news:  it washes great.  The not-so-good is that the smell of the fabric hasn't faded yet.  Also, the adjustable straps adjust in the FRONT, not the back.  so the hardware is visible in the front.  Convenient, but not as aethetically pleasing.  Overall, good value for the money, with just two minor flaws.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.053419832", "1": "0.19559413", "2": "0.20042047", "3": "0.04525717", "4": "0.16923386", "5": "0.15243281", "6": "0.1836417"}}
