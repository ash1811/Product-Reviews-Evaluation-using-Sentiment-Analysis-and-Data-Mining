{"text": "I love these! I'm self conscious about the lace tops squeezing my legs and creating a leg muffin top. But I finally found these which provide a larger size, eliminating the 'super squeeze'. They stay up ok, sometimes they roll over, only a bit. They're not too thick or thin, and the material is nice quality.
