{"text": "My Mom gave me some 3/4 superfeet insoles a few years back and they were awesome.  These were not even close to being the same thing.  What I received was longer, thinner and less supportive than the 3/4 superfeet I'd known and loved.  These were also more narrow.  I don't have a narrow foot but it's not crazy wide.  My heels come over the edge in these.  Tried wearing them for a day and the didn't help at all.  In the end they were no better than the cheapo inserts from the grocery store.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09770035", "1": "0.40407923", "4": "0.11165095", "5": "0.13065629", "6": "0.24924451"}}
