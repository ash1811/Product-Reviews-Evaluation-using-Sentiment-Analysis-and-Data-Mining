{"text": "While I understand that a sleep bra is not expected to give a lot of support, this bra was amazingly cheaply made.  The cotton used for the bra is very thin and scratchy and the elastic feels very thin.  Even the elastic on the bustline was thin- which meant that even for the 2 minutes I tried the bra on, the back of the bra was already creeping up.  That could also be an issue with the length of the arm straps, but in all, this bra is my least favorite (Lamaze, La Leche League) and will be returned.  Honestly, to look at it, the bra looks like it is something you pick up at the dollar store.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.0714194", "1": "0.27853882", "2": "0.12571746", "3": "0.3332316", "4": "0.061192203", "6": "0.12754127"}}
