{"text": "My title simply expressed my joy in purchasing this pair of Desert Boot. They are well-made (leather top + crepe sole) and beautifully designed. Considered a steal at the price! To add icing to the cake, they are also comfortable to wear. As a result, I bought another pair for my dad, who liked the comfort and design when he tried out mine.They fit true to size!However, I wanted to purchase the Beeswax version previously. Sadly, there was a significant price increase (which subsequently reverted to the first pricing). Remind me of the fluctuation of the stock market. It would be good that Amazon keep prices stable such that consumers can always get the best deals at all time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.026560439", "1": "0.27858913", "2": "0.09093088", "3": "0.11803091", "4": "0.18101828", "5": "0.30276173"}}
