{"text": "The shoes look great with business suits. They are very comfortable with adequate height and arch support. Reason for four stars: in four different pairs of Ros Hommerson shoes, the soles and heels are slippery on hard wood floors and tiles. Non slip sole guards should help. Otherwise the quality, look, and comfort of those shoes are great. I will continue to buy this brand.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.20960733", "1": "0.23767723", "2": "0.16356453", "3": "0.2435948", "4": "0.03497009", "6": "0.107079275"}}
