{"text": "Its good that its made in Canada rather than China. Though i'd still prefer US. It is also warm. It comes in a plastic bag and as soon as you take it out it begins to deteriorate almost instantly. You see it develops lots of fuzz. It works perfectly fine but fuzz is unacceptable to me. I bought a similar hat from Kohls 6 years ago. The fabric still looks as good as new. In that hat I think the material is cotton. In this hat it is acrylic. My dad also has another noname brand acrylic hat and it also has fuzz and pilling. Lesson learned don't buy acrylic if you care how it looks.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06599316", "1": "0.27490747", "2": "0.11080793", "3": "0.22871423", "4": "0.12653056", "5": "0.05518614", "6": "0.13786054"}}
