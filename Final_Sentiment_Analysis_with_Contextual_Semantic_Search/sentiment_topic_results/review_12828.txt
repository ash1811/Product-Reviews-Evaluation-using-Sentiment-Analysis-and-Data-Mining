{"text": "After trying several types of large bags for travelling I think I have actually found the perfect bag for me. It is lightweight to start with, other bags are heavy even when empty. I do carry alot of things with me all the time & this bag has so much room which allows for small items I buy to be  easily be carried in the bag. I purchased the Baggallini Tote Bag first & thought that was very good but this one is much better, due to the lightness & easy care fabric with three compartments.I like the middle compartment of this bag, wasn't too sure at first when I saw it as thought with two zips that completely open the middle section right up things would fall out but it has side sections to prevent this from happening, hence it holds so much. This style of bag suits all my needs better than a tote bag where everything is in the main compartment of the bag. I do like the range of bags that Baggallini make. I purchased this bag in the Leopard print & have also purchased exactly the same in the Bronze colour which I really love. Another great Amazon purchase with an affordable price tag. Very impressed with how quickly the two bags arrived here in Australia, one week ahead of the scheduled date, BRILLIANT.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12248933", "1": "0.32868797", "2": "0.1675803", "3": "0.12691465", "4": "0.028836654", "5": "0.13353367", "6": "0.091957405"}}
