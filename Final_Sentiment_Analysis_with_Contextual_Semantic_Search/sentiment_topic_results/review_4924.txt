{"text": "The ONLY watch I will buy. Easy to use and understand. It fits close to my wrist and doesn't move. I hate it when I turn my wrist to see what time it is and have to adjust the face to read it! This watch is always where it is supposed to be. The alarm is loud and insistent. I just love it! I swim in it, ride my horse in it, shower and bathe with it. I even often sleep in it. Best watch ever.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.19416545", "2": "0.3500759", "3": "0.054010972", "4": "0.14425446", "5": "0.10419548", "6": "0.14995976"}}
