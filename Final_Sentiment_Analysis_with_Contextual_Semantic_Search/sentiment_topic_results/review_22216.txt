{"text": "I wore steel toe work boots for several years for my job. This was hard on my toes, they were starting to clump together in an odd fashion, even barefoot. I wanted something to separate and cushion my toes and these work. My knees and back are better for it and my posture too I think. I knew it was very good or bad when I first put them on. The feeling was almost pain, a constant itching and discomfort for about 10 hours. This was my nerve endings getting used to a different input I think. I would think corns and the like might benefit from these too.Expensive for one pair but these are worth it. You really should try this kind of sock if not this brand. My feet feel much better even though I did not know I had such issues. Looking at the shoes now but I think around the house only. The teasing at work would be too much lol.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14328699", "1": "0.4027931", "2": "0.06226716", "3": "0.06587643", "4": "0.13735153", "5": "0.12293328", "6": "0.06549149"}}
