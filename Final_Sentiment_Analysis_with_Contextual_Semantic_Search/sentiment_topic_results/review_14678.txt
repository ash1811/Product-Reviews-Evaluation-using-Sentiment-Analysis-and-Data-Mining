{"text": "This is a well-crafted basic nude pump. (I bought the Sandstone color.) The leather appears to be of a good quality and arrived with no marks or imperfections. The fit was true to size; I am an exact 9.5 and these fit well with no gaps in the back or pinching in the toe box. I felt as though the outer side could have been made to go a bit higher on the side of the foot as it almost wasn't deep enough for mine, right at the widest part of my foot right before toes begin? It feels as though a centimeter or two higher would keep my foot more secure, so I deducted one star from an otherwise-stellar product. I also have extremely high arches which lead to my foot being \"thicker\" overall than probably a normal-arched foot. Just keep in mind that every foot is different, so my experience may not be the same as yours. I loved the heel height. I'm 5'10\" and while I don't mind a heel, I don't want/need to wear the platforms and 4\" heels that are so popular today.  This heel height is perfect for both business and evening for taller ladies. The Nike air technology did make these so much more comfortable than the average heel. I wore them all over a cruise ship two evenings in very rough seas and the traction on the soles was much appreciated.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15512094", "1": "0.35912496", "2": "0.10328205", "3": "0.13268167", "4": "0.10161272", "5": "0.04211439", "6": "0.1060633"}}
