{"text": "I bougfht these for my granddaughter because I bought her pink glitter flats that her parents didn't exactly appreciate.  How was I supposed to know that glitter comes off - everywhere - all the time - even when you think it's done shedding?  Anyway, the flats were pink, and these were pink, and they were just like Mommy's, so I got her these and some Jibbitz and made a promise that i wouldn't buy her glitter anything anymore.  Everyone is happy now.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.40860915", "2": "0.2157003", "4": "0.109356135", "6": "0.2546837"}}
