{"text": "I have the genuine leather ones, and I see that these say they're faux leather..apart from that,they look identical to mine, which I acquired when someone on a parent cyber forum decided to sell off some mint-condition Birkies in my size.Well, so I was pleased by the arch support etc and wore them home...but had to stop and take them off with big blisters.  After that, I was leery...but now i've gone back to them. Again, they are wonderfully supportive of your foot but SO painful on top where the uppers chafe against the skin, no matter what setting you have the buckle at, so you have to carry around boxes of bandaids, and even so my right foot is very red and tender a day later, and I am deliberating whether to give up on this 'breaking in' experiment/torture.i'm not sure why the uppers can't be made super-soft in some way, but it's a real shame because it lets the shoe down.  I should think the rigidity of the soles, and the weight they have, makes the problem worse.  I've now tried wearing them a number of times, and I don't see any improvement.  I may give up on these shoes now. I'm not one of those who walk around in socks and sandals...just looks awful.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07482818", "1": "0.2771839", "2": "0.060154326", "3": "0.14782257", "4": "0.20291269", "5": "0.109746955", "6": "0.12735139"}}
