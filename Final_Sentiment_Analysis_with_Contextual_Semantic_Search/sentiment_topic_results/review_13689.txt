{"text": "Very disappointed with these covers. They do not fit size 11 well. I previously purchased one pair of shoe covers at Lowes or Home Depot (can't recall) however they were a good fit especially for men with work boots. They lasted several months also until I decided to throw them out for looking really soiled. I'll keep these but will need to purchase a larger size elsewhere. 50 pair under $11.00 is good, however the one pair I bought previously was about $2.00 + tax and was reused for a few months.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11451014", "1": "0.30187792", "2": "0.14356272", "3": "0.1347611", "4": "0.18989484", "6": "0.11274379"}}
