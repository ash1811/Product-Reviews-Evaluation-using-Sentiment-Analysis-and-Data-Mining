{"text": "These shoe are holding up so much better than my 1st pair of Skechers...Have a look at the toe material on the front. No troubles with the sole peeling off the toe ever. I wear these 5 days a week 10-12hr days and no issue. Starting to flatten some and will replace the insoles..Just ordered 1 more pair that is similar with the same toe design. 300lb with flat feet and I like them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1622893", "1": "0.34122783", "2": "0.0627813", "3": "0.109976634", "4": "0.09226235", "5": "0.1651296", "6": "0.06633302"}}
