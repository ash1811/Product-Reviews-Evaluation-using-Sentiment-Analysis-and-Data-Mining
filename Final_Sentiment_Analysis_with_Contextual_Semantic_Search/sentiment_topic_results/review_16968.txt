{"text": "This is a great shirt from Carhartt. It is warm in winter. It requires periodic ironing especially after it is washed and tumble dried.The material is soft and warm. The long sleeves cover your arms and the fabric in the main part of the shirt doesn't come out of your britches when you bend over. (I bought the tall size - because I 'm tall of course).The buttons work well and most of the time they don't need to be resewn on like most of the crappy clothes imported from overseas or Mexico.Pocket flaps keep your junk from falling out of the pockets when you bend over to tie your work boots. The collar can be folded up to cover your neck when the cold wind of winter blows or when you come out of a scary movie at the theater and you don't want the monsters to grab your neck. Oh my, Am I projecting? SIlly me. Great Shirt. Carhartt is the best for work clothes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1259774", "1": "0.4574912", "2": "0.062427707", "4": "0.087638415", "6": "0.26159644"}}
