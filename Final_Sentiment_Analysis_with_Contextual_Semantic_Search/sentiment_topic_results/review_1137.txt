{"text": "The Jockey Elance Bikini is closer to a low-waisted brief than what I think of when I hear the word \"bikini\". The leg openings are low and the back has full coverage. I think they're a nice compromise between a brief and a skimpy bikini.These panties are cool, comfortable, and long-wearing. They hold up well to machine washing. I should note the Elance line runs large on me. You may need to order one size smaller than you would for other brands.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.23542649", "1": "0.19936128", "2": "0.07429637", "3": "0.2656954", "4": "0.11893808", "6": "0.10316656"}}
