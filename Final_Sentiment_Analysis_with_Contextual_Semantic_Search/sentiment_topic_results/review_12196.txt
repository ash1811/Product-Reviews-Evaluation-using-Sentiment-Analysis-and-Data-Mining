{"text": "I *loved* the LeMystere Techfit bra model.  It was very supportive, fit very well, and stood up to long wear.  However, I have gone from a 42 band to a 38 band (Yay!), and I need new support systems.  The Techfit model has apparently been discontinued (the only one available is a 36B-- not going to work), the Tisha bra does not work for me (cup sizes are strange-- too small or too big).  I found my size at a good price for the Dream Tisha and decided to give this model a try.  They are wonderful!!  The tension between the updated/older version seems to have been resolved, I read the advice women are giving about the fit, and am very happy with this bra.  Because LeMystere seems to have given the size DD cup a miss and just calls it an F cup.  Fine, it fits!  LeMystere bras are very well-made, and last years with proper care.  Which can actually be a problem, as it seems whenever I find a bra model I love, when I am ready for new ones, the model is always discontinued.  Guess I'll need to get a couple more of these....", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1135437", "1": "0.26174504", "2": "0.086942166", "3": "0.19895431", "4": "0.12792659", "5": "0.04272116", "6": "0.16816704"}}
