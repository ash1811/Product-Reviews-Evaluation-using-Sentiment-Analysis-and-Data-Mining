{"text": "I have been on an unsuccessful hunt for a black satin house slipper with a leather or leather-like sole in size 5 with a small opening.  I ended up making a choice to buy these knowing that I was going to have to pay S&H.;They came on the last day of the delivery window.  They were in a plastic pouch that was sealed very well.  Inside was another plastic pouch with the slippers.  Before I removed the inside pouch one slipper slid out. Not good.I had decided to take a chance on these solely because the opening shown in the picture was smaller.  The bow was closer to the ankle and not the toes.  I need that due to surgery on one ankle bone changing the shape of it.  The opening on these turned out to be the same as all the others on Amazon and the Internet.They were too small.  I have a size 5 foot. I am an adult.  I ordered size S.  They were so tight that the elastic hurt my feet.  My foot went over the sole on the side and my toes were pushing the material.BRIGHT SPOT!  I complained to National and they emailed a postage free label and I have been promised a refund.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.059228264", "1": "0.27870002", "2": "0.06161275", "3": "0.11983439", "4": "0.17837602", "5": "0.041426793", "6": "0.2608218"}}
