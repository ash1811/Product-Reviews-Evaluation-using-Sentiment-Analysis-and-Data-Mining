{"text": "My son is performing outdoor work in the mountains in France so I purchased polypropylene items to keep him warm.  This was a great price and does the job keeping the ears and neck warm without the fuss and workplace dangers of scarves, earmuffs etc.  I don't know about static electricity.  I have long hair and seldom wear hats scarves due to the static, however, my son wears his hair military short, so it is not a problem.  Highly recommended!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14801508", "1": "0.3634725", "2": "0.07355221", "3": "0.17034212", "5": "0.18253258", "6": "0.058967818"}}
