{"text": "Would not do for serious walking or any rough terrain walking as the soles are soft - you really feel the rocks. But very comfortable, non-slip sole, and inner fleece on first pair I bought (still wearing after 6 months or so) has yet to pack down badly - bought a second pair a couple of weeks after the first to be sure to have a spare.Only problem is leather thong laces won't stay tied, even when double knotted - but tht is normal for mocassins.Sizing tends a bit small - I got 1 full size larger and they are good but on looser side, so about 1/2 size smaller than they state.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.28629696", "1": "0.24331394", "2": "0.14557472", "3": "0.22787906", "4": "0.035196885", "5": "0.059446897"}}
