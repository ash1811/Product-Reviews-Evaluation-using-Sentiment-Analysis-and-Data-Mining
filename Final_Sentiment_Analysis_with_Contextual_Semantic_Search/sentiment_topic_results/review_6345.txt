{"text": "Trying to pull costumes together for &#34;Pirate Night&#34; on a Disney Cruise, I was shopping for a family of 6! I paid anywhere from $35 - $85 per outfit. This was the least expensive outfit I bought for my youngest swashbuckler and it was made as well as the other costumes that were twice the price. I'm hoping to get a Halloween wear out of it as well as next year's cruise - fingers crossed!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13100547", "1": "0.3230522", "2": "0.21750434", "3": "0.13465586", "4": "0.07013178", "5": "0.049653463", "6": "0.07399694"}}
