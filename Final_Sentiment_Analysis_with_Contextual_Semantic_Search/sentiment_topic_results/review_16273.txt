{"text": "Without a doubt the best house slippers I have ever purchased in my 85 plus years.  They are a great fit and even greater quality.  I would heartily endorse this product and will buy again and again.  They feel really great and look great!  These are the first mail order slippers that have been so great right out of the box.  After wearing for a few hours, they get more and more comfortable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07859118", "1": "0.5036327", "2": "0.10103967", "4": "0.055533208", "5": "0.08322524", "6": "0.17420541"}}
