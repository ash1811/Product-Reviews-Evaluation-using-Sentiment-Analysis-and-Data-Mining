{"text": "I purchased this backpack to use for a beach bag, one less thing I have to carry in my hands to haul stuff to the beach.  While I haven't used it yet I do have it packed and ready and here's what's in it--large beach towel, 40 oz. thermos, 2 bottles of sunscreen, umbrella sand anchor, sunglasses, book, hat.  There's still plenty of room for my keys, wallet and phone too.  I am looking forward to an easier walk to the beach in just a few weeks!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19380182", "1": "0.26679218", "2": "0.26266667", "3": "0.15698966", "4": "0.083303586", "6": "0.033524305"}}
