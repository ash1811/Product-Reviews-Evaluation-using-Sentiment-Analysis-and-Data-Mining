{"text": "We ordered the medium for my 5.5 year old- it is definitely a little big, but I was glad because I thought she would be able to play in it for quite a long time and grow into it. (She is about 44\" tall and 40lbs). However, after wearing it a total of 20 minutes- once to simply try it on when it arrived, and once to show off to her grandfather when he visited - it began to fall apart! She and her sister each wanted to try on the headband and switched it between them a couple of times, literally just putting in on their heads as headbands are meant to. Within minutes, the entire black outline on the headband star had flaked off completely. Then, walking towards me, I suddenly noticed the hem between the skirt and bodice had a huge 8\" rip where it had separated. This is after, like I said, only about 20 minutes of wear during which time my daughter ran back and forth a few times. I couldn't believe it! Upon inspection, also, the stitches were all solidly intact, which means the red fabric of the top piece itself actually had ripped apart. In the past I have bought costumes for my kids at various toy stores for MUCH less money, all of which the girls have been able to wear for years, sharing between them. This year I splurge on a more expensive costume because my daughter loves WonderWoman, and I end up with this sorry piece of junk. I would not recomend this costume to anyone!! I now have to keep her from wearing it (since I have re-sewn it and redrawn the star) until Halloween so nothing else falls apart before the holiday! The makers of this costume should be ashamed.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.20308906", "1": "0.17340742", "2": "0.19178267", "3": "0.17044921", "5": "0.14438212", "6": "0.114275105"}}
