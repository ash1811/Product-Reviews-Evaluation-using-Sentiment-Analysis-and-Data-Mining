{"text": "I really like these socks. I used these socks during a rainy trail run. I knew my feet would be wet running through the creeks but it was also going to raining during the run.  I was looking for something to prevent blisters on my toes from all the moisture. I didn't get any blisters on my toes during the race. I ended up buying 4 more pairs. I love them for running. I have small feet so I had to get used to putting them on; I have plenty of extra room at the little toes in the socks but I have never had a problem with my toes slipping out or becoming uncomfortable. I would recommend these socks. They are not thick so I just wear another sock over them for the cold months.I used the free super saver shipping, and they still arrived with a week.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1882722", "1": "0.37226146", "2": "0.08356989", "4": "0.088238694", "5": "0.26253322"}}
