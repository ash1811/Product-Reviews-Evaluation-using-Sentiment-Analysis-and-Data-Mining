{"text": "I dont know what is going on, but i bought a few size 36 and they all differ from sizing, i mean even though they say size 36, they are like 1-4 cm bigger or smaller.So its like a \"37\" and the other is like 35. Its really weird i dont get it why is there such a huge error in sizing, if there is one, been thinking and talking of this for days and cant find a reason or something...They are all made in mexico, not made in colombia, i find this on my country for half price, same quality. i thought the ones found here were bad quality because of the price and this would be better, but aparently they're not or are the same exact pant. the ones sold here are also made in mexico. Another thing i noticed is the seal on the inner bag was decolorated for 1 or 2 pants and the ones i found here some where like this too, so what im trying to say is the same pant. Im kind of dissapointed, not really the quality i was expecting for a $50 pant.Im not returning these, already washed them and took all the layers off, not worth the time, etc.... =/.Your choice &lt; > Buyer beware!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2658782", "1": "0.1482916", "2": "0.20310724", "3": "0.16876638", "4": "0.07551148", "6": "0.13593213"}}
