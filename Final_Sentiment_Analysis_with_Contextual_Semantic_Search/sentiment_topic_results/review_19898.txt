{"text": "Every foot is different but from my experience with this shoe --its well made and quite good looking from a casual shoe. The foot bed is very firm (bordering on hard). It takes quite awhile before these feel comfortable for long periods of time. Your foot has to adjust to them --no &#34;gel&#34; or &#34;rubber&#34; cushioning. There is definitely a break in period. Once broken in they definitely can take a beating and you keep on going.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1788764", "1": "0.299762", "2": "0.16431993", "3": "0.16860797", "4": "0.13489807", "5": "0.05012523"}}
