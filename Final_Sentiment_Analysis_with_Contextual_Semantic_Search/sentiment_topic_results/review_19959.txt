{"text": "This backpack is big, durable, and comes in a great variety of colors.  It fits very comfortably on my back.  The only problem I really have with it is that a couple of the openings that you unzip have a lining that partially blocks that side.  So even if you unzip it all the way, you have to reach up and around the lining to get into that pocket.  Not a big deal, but can be annoying.  Among other very minor annoyances is the existence of a tiny and very unnecessary pocket at the top of the bag, that just serves to confuse which zipper you are suppose to be using.  Along the same lines, the back opening has two separate zippers for the same opening which seems very redundant and just adds to the zippers you have keep figuring out until you get used to it.But like I said these are very minor grievances and it is all in all a very good product.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16604401", "1": "0.3284357", "2": "0.18965486", "3": "0.07047901", "4": "0.06284868", "6": "0.17966008"}}
