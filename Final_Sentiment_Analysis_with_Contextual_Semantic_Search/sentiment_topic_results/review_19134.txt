{"text": "Been using my pair for 2 years now.  They are durable and quite comfortable.  What I love about New Balance is that they are available in many widths, mine is 4E. It is almost impossible for me to find a pair in shopping malls.  This one fits perfectly. I think the price is not too steep compared to other brands.It is my everyday shoes for work and recreation.  It is described as walking shoes but I also use it for some light jogging & tennis.  Nice minimalistic simple design.  Leather is supple...and yes, the biggest reason I bought it is velcro.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.048397597", "1": "0.31132686", "2": "0.10691898", "3": "0.13762036", "4": "0.14000976", "5": "0.087886624", "6": "0.1678398"}}
