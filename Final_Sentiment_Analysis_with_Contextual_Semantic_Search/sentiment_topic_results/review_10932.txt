{"text": "I read a lot of reviews of a lot of strapless bras before I settled on this one -- and I'm glad I got this one. It fits me just fine -- I'm a 34B. You should definitely follow the directions and NOT put anything on your body (lotion, powder, etc.) before you apply it...it WILL still work, but then you degrade the stickiness of it. I have used it with dresses that have VERY low backs and it was perfect. I have used it when I've gone dancing (so I've been sweaty) or just for normal daily use when going to work if I wear a halter top sweater or something. It holds up (literally) in both situations. I tried the Victoria Secret strapless bra and was so disappointed after having this one...it just felt cheaper and didn't last NEARLY as long. What's more, with the VS strapless I feel like I get ONE WEAR out of the adhesive, whereas I've been using these one for months. I don't wear it everyday, of course, but the times I've used it it's practically like new. I was going to buy the *wash* for it, but I just decided to wipe it down with a baby wipe instead, that seemed to &#34;clean&#34; it enough to where the adhesive sort of &#34;bounced back.&#34; I didn't buy the case for this, I just keep it in the box it came with. I have even taken the box in a suitcase and it's held up fine. It is a *little* big, but if don't mind that it travels just fine. I really, truly recommend this product if you're looking for a strapless bra of good/high quality. I haven't been disappointed at all, and for the price, you really can't beat it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12597643", "1": "0.2011642", "2": "0.07116073", "3": "0.3121328", "4": "0.11775672", "5": "0.09192523", "6": "0.079883896"}}
