{"text": "I wanted a stainless steel watch with a black face, and this one looked lovely for the price. My husband had a Casio many years ago that lasted just about forever, so I decided to give it a try. The watch is beautiful, and I'm glad I decided to buy it. It's lovely and understated and is very attractive. I do have to get used to reading it where there are no numbers on the rectangular dial, but I'm sure I'll be just fine! I would definitely recommend this watch at this price, although the band on mine seems to be shorter than other reviewers reported. Additional links for the band on this watch are NOT available from Casio.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.18135953", "2": "0.23785196", "3": "0.22159629", "4": "0.17983857", "5": "0.045365006", "6": "0.13156028"}}
