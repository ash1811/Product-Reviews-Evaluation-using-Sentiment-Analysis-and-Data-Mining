{"text": "Yep, they are crocsI I have twin boys. The green and blue were both the cheapest Amazon had, so I told them they could choose blue or green. One got blue and one got green, and today they decided to each wear one of each color. Super cute! They do run a bit big, but I discovered that with our size 4-5. My guys can still wear their 8/9 although their shoe size is really 10 now. These tend to fall off, but they can wear them somewhat. You have to expect that sort of issue when a single shoe is covering 2 sizes. I mean usually they have HALF sizes, these cover 2 sizes. If you buy a 10/11 for a boy with a size 10 foot it isn't going to be a bit too big. Their others are getting a little too small, but as a Stride Rite size 10 the 8/9 Croc fits better than the 10/11.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0481406", "1": "0.23359412", "2": "0.210351", "3": "0.11944139", "4": "0.14040478", "5": "0.10064356", "6": "0.14742453"}}
