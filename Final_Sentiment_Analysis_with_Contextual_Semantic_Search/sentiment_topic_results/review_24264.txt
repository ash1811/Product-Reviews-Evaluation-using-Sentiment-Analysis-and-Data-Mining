{"text": "Not as described at all. The \"flannel\" is a very thin cotton and can't be described as flannel. I sew and know what flannel is. The denim is heavy and good quality. I've purchased real flannel lined from LL Bean in the past and itis nice thick flannel that is beautifully warm. I'm returning these and cannot give higher than 1 star. If you lookat my other reviews I've nothing but praise for almost every item I buy through Amazon. This is a big disappointment.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06385029", "1": "0.2975113", "2": "0.1519024", "3": "0.17070852", "4": "0.033759773", "5": "0.05260941", "6": "0.22965828"}}
