{"text": "I like how this fits my 2 year old and I like how it feels like it is very well made!The color could have been a little better so to match the ballet shoes but it is hard enough to find a leotard for a 2 year old let alone the type of pink you might expect!  The price was right and my youngest daughter loves it as well as she wants to be like her big sister and dance like her, even tho she is not enrolled in dance just yet but at least she will have the right attire for the class when she is ready!I would definitely buy this again and I recommend this to everyone!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.19808239", "1": "0.15475166", "2": "0.07008864", "3": "0.2066118", "4": "0.10483686", "5": "0.09966592", "6": "0.16596276"}}
