{"text": "Oh god. I guess my review for this never went through, but honestly I think it's been a couple years since I bought it and it still holds up like a charm. Back in the day I was obsessed with the Swedish version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo movie, and Lisbeth has a bag almost exactly like this. I don't regret buying this at all; before I bought it some reviewers were complaining about the Velcro being of bad quality, but the Velcro on this works just fine and I've never had a problem with it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07473899", "1": "0.2235154", "2": "0.22262141", "3": "0.17633522", "4": "0.079479314", "5": "0.118542925", "6": "0.10476677"}}
