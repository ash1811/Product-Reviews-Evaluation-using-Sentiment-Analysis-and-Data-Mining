{"text": "First let me say that I absolutely LOVE this bra and recommend it. However, BUY IT TWO SIZES LARGER THAN YOU WEAR. I normally wear a 36KK per professional measurements. I don't care to spend $60-$80 on a single bra though so I usually just buy a 38-40DDD in a specific Bali minimizer and it's fine. My boobs seep out the bottom a bit but that's kind of how minimizers work anyway. I'm getting older and the wiring has begun to bother me so I've been trying out different wireless bras. This one is the best I've experienced so far. I ordered a 40F/G/H and it fits nicely, but a bit snug. I don't like a tight band so in the future I will buy a 42F/G/H. I found the fabric to be soft and comfortable but not at all flimsy. The front hooks are a bit cumbersome but I believe that's what makes it as stabilizing as it is...plus it's been nice to  be able to undo the bottom few hooks to make it more comfortable for me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03915276", "1": "0.26671863", "2": "0.16547856", "3": "0.34153968", "5": "0.03330611", "6": "0.1516973"}}
