{"text": "I like these a lot! We followed the suggestion to get them 1 size larger but I am going to suggest 2 sizes larger. If you plan on wearing them as a shirt by itself, no under shirt then 1 size larger may work OK. I'm 6'3 215 and got the 1X. I normally wear an XL. I have some hips and found the narrow cut of these to be tight in the hips. especially after wash and drying. I also have a 2 X that I was planning on using as a light coat but the narrow cut prevents that except when unbuttoned. Regardless I am quite happy with them, They are very thick and well made and very warm.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.19092657", "1": "0.32963073", "2": "0.09291488", "3": "0.1181436", "4": "0.10039462", "6": "0.16563693"}}
