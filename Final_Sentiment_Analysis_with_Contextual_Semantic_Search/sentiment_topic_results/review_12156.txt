{"text": "I don't know about other reviews but, I found these to be toasty warm wearing around the house like slippers. They are very soft and thick, I just love them!Do Not wear to bed!! My poor feet roasted so bad I had to take them off to sleep! I also keep the heat down in the house, and these worked out great for me. They also fit into my snowmobile boots and work just fine, no complaints here. I have ordered all different kinds and brands of wool socks and Wigwam and Smartwool are at the top of my list for me and as gifts. They last a long time and stay nice and warm. I was not a big fan of wool, remember the itchy stuff?? No more, super soft and worth the money when you catch them on sale!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06772212", "1": "0.32386115", "3": "0.1802681", "4": "0.18384823", "5": "0.12885572", "6": "0.11291649"}}
