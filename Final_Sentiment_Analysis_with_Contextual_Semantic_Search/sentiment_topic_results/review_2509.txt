{"text": "Dickies reputation is not in question with these regular fit five pocket jeans.  I bought five pair and wear one each workday and they hold up well.  My movement is not restricted.  In the wash they didn't shrink and the sizing was fitted well with the waist fitting snug (might want one size up on the waist if you want a little space but keep your regular size on the length).  They're tough and I like that the pockets are deep.  So many brands now short change you on pockets for some reason!  They fit over my work boots and they look sharp.  I'll buy again when this current batch runs a little ragged.  The last round lasted me over a year.
