{"text": "I like this watch and the way it looks.  It is lightweight and I don't have to worry about it breaking when it gets wet once in a while.  It is smaller than the average men's watch but that's a plus for me because I have thin wrists.  The only negative I found is that it isn't scratch resistent, so I did end up with a few minor scratches.  But for ten bucks, it's worth its money and I am left quite satisfied.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11502271", "1": "0.09035223", "2": "0.26145956", "4": "0.25343138", "5": "0.03674382", "6": "0.23862998"}}
