{"text": "One started feeling way flatter than the other within a few weeks. I had two pairs i bought in a top rated running store in my city so i turned them all over side by side and sure enough the pair i bought here look way different from the other two and are cut weird and crooked. The fonts on the logo and size markings are different as well. I have squashed the heck out of the older pairs on elliptical machines and 5k runs and they feel way better than the shifty shady pair bought here..Worst part...I missed the darn return window.ARRRGGG!... I edited  my review to correct some spelling errors only", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05849259", "2": "0.10890996", "3": "0.2743056", "4": "0.12192709", "5": "0.23673785", "6": "0.19731101"}}
