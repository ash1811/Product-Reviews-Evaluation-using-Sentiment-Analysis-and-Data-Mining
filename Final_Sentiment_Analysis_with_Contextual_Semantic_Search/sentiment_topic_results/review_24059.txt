{"text": "I don't believe they carry this color any more as was hard to find when I ordered it, got 1 of the last ones.  This is an awesome shoe & I use for hiking as well as every day use, & vacations where I do a lot of walking. My husband has a similar shoe by the same maker & is the one who recommended it to me & I'm happy he did. I am usually an 8, & these do run small so needed a 8 1/2. Price on Amazon was comparable to the store, but I hate shopping so like the convenience of having it delivered to my door.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12498026", "1": "0.19898398", "2": "0.12974446", "3": "0.06755319", "4": "0.2230044", "5": "0.25280878"}}
