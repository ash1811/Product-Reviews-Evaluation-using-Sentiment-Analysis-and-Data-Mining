{"text": "I currently have 8 G Shocks in my collection. This one is cool just because it's simple. The classic 6900 has no solar, no atomic, no 5 alarm settings, alti-thermo & no baro either. It's just a cool tough watch. Big, bold & straight to the point. Some claim that this is a mall type fake G. Do some research & you will find that this is 100% real. Awesome value.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.055715676", "1": "0.26603046", "2": "0.11041724", "3": "0.07325594", "4": "0.25737438", "6": "0.23332722"}}
