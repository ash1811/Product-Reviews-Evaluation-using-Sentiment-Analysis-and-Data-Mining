{"text": "I've hear so much about Smartwool socks and I was excited to get these. These socks look great - exactly as pictured. Unfortunately, they are tight around my leg (leave marks) if I pull them up all of the way and I do not have especially large legs (slim but muscular). I also didn't feel that they kept my feet any warmer than some high quality cotton socks that I usually wear. I won't be purchasing anymore given their price point.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.22020768", "1": "0.17324857", "2": "0.060416006", "3": "0.2588152", "4": "0.10383494", "5": "0.13204521", "6": "0.051432427"}}
