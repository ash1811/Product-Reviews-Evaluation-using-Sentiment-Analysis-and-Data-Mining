{"text": "I have extremely high arches and also terrible pain from plantar fasciitis and other inflammatory problems with my feet. I needed full insoles with a super good arch support, but I also needed a little cushioning on my metatarsal area. This pair of insoles are doing the job. They're not perfect, but they are good enough that they are making it possible for me to wear a cute pair of ankle boots that I thought I'd never be able to wear. I am happy I got them. I have a big boxful of old insoles I have tried over the years, and most all the insoles I've purchased ended up in that box. My Superfeet insoles are actually being worn frequently, and they really help support my high arches.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.060710885", "1": "0.20960109", "3": "0.21245918", "4": "0.32544982", "5": "0.07346936", "6": "0.11599617"}}
