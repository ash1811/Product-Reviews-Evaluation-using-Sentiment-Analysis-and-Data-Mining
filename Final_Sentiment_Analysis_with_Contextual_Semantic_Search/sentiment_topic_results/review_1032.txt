{"text": "I have worn these shoes only a handful of times, so at best they are only starting to get broken in.First off, out of the box the leather is stiff, and you may want to think about adding insoles since the arch support is laughable.The first few time I wore them, it was a pain trying to get the laces tightened up, but they have become easier to tie with repeated use.I have yet to shine them, because I use an express shine sponge and they are good to go.Since they are leather-soled, you should not expect great traction, so keep this in mind if it is wet out.Overall, these are great shoes at this price level, and they should only get better when broken in.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13746364", "1": "0.23956509", "2": "0.14407633", "3": "0.19365335", "4": "0.102891386", "5": "0.15695503", "6": "0.025395175"}}
