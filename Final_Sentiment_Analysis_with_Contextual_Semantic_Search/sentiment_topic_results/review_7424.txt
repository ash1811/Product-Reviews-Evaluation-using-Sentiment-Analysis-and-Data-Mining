{"text": "I wanted a specific color and size of this which I initially saw at a local sporting goods store.  The best price I found was at Amazon.  They were about $2 cheaper than the store.  I noted that Carhartt T's tend to run a little large.  I wear a large in most all types of shirts, but wear a medium Carhartt.  I stayed pretty true to size after washing and drying.  I'm a Carhartt fan!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.105629735", "1": "0.44058293", "3": "0.18705839", "4": "0.1230058", "5": "0.054918997", "6": "0.08531206"}}
