{"text": "This is a decent watch, it's got Atomic Timekeeping (in the US) and it is also solar powered, so you can pretty much buy it and not have to set the time ever, all you do is wear it! It also has a cool party trick in that the watch illuminates when you move your arm to look at the time - but only when the watch senses that the ambient light is not good enough, in sunlight and good indoor lighting the watch illumination does not come on, pretty neat! The only bad thing about this watch is that the digital readout is rather small and not too practical. This keeps the watch from getting a 5 star rating from me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.046127856", "1": "0.23717408", "2": "0.19982854", "3": "0.14423782", "4": "0.16156489", "5": "0.1363633", "6": "0.074703544"}}
