{"text": "The pendant measures a hair over 1.5 inches from tip of petal to tip of  opposite petal in each direction (not counting bale).  The bale is pretty big to accomodate a different chain (and the clasp), not big enough for an omega, though (almost 1/4 inch). I liked the chain that came with it and left it on.  The photo is very accuate, but I like to have a real measurment! The chain is decent, not one of those stock chains you sometimes get that inevitably ends up in knots (you know the type!)  It has larger links on the end to make it adjustable in length.It is very lovely on your neck or with a turtleneck sweater.  It is almost modern in its simplicity, but feminine, too.  It is slightly convex, not completely flat, which makes it look more like a flower.  I bought it because I wanted it for the holidays (thought it looked like a pointsettia) but I think it will look nice all year long (even in summer since it also looks a little like a hibiscus!)  I would have put a little crystal in the middle, but I tend to like sparkly things :)  Thinking about the earrings to match, but haven't decided yet...it might be too much...maybe something smaller.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09387946", "1": "0.24156873", "2": "0.13473584", "3": "0.09830812", "4": "0.23325221", "5": "0.11189923", "6": "0.086356394"}}
