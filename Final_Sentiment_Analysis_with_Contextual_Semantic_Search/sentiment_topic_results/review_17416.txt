{"text": "It is not super, but they are not thin like some people claim.  Normally I review the reviews in coming to a decision.  Little did I think that the definition of the sock would be the issue.  When I think of \"crew\" socks, short, ribbed socks come to mind.  Now while I don't have long legs, only a 32 inseam, I still did not think these things would come all the way up to an inch below my knee when pulled completely up.  I just wanted a sock I could wear trail gaiters with.  While they fit my feet, I wear a 12.5 running shoe and bought the 12-14 size...the length of the upper is hard to hide.  Now, if you want that Pete Maravich look, dating myself, these are for you.  I do have to agree that when Champion goes to mass produce a product for the big box stores the quality can slip.  Oh well...most people seem to love them...but to me...the visible pills and knitting errors on brand new socks means pretty crappy quality control.  I guess it is hit or miss.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15487763", "1": "0.3869598", "2": "0.11870752", "5": "0.28703576", "6": "0.047718115"}}
