{"text": "I actually bought two of these and both are very pretty and are well worth the price tag if....you are feeling lucky.  Both were delivered seperatly and were cramed into the cardboard boxes with little care.  The first one was visibly damaged on the side which given the packing, it did not suprise me.  The second one still had a jewlers ball-bearing stuck in the hook end of the clasp which keeps the silver from crimping when the jewler presses the thin metal together over the end.  That was repairable as not only did the ball-bearing need to be removed but also the metal needed to be closed correctly. The width is wider than some are giving credit.  I am not sure you would want anything larger?I will give Amazon 5 stars as usual for the ease of dealing with an issue. Even though it will take 3-5 weeks for a replacement (they are awaiting more stock from Italy and you can not hold that against them) it was my choice to take the replacement over a quick refund.  As I said, they are certainly worth the price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20035556", "1": "0.25092384", "2": "0.1611737", "3": "0.056189176", "4": "0.16436635", "5": "0.04351687", "6": "0.12347452"}}
