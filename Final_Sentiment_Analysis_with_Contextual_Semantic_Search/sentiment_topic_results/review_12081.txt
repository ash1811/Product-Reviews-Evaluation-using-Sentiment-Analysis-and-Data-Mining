{"text": "That's the thing about jeans, when you find some that really fit you should go all in!  I'm getting on the hard side of my 60's and things don't fit like they used to.  These are very well made and give more fabric to the seat and thighs.  I'm very happy with this style of Wrangler Jeans because they look like jeans not clown pants.  The color is spot on for my lifestyle.  They look good going in to town or just walking the south 40 with my dog.  When it comes to care, I turn them inside out to wash and dry.  I'm very happy to recommend them.  Five Stars", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.099057965", "1": "0.39963636", "2": "0.09939475", "3": "0.06042042", "5": "0.2208195", "6": "0.11819933"}}
