{"text": "I love this watch!  Its perfect for a small wrist. Easy to read numbers. It shows you the day of the week and month and its comfortable. I love the blue because it goes with pretty much everything. The other colors they have are really nice as well. ( I wear a lot of blue) . Its lightweight and supposedly waterproof. I like it too much to find out. Also normally rubber bands become uncomfortable when you start to sweat nope not this one. Overall for a cheap watch its the best. It has more features and comfort than my $100 watch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.35319322", "2": "0.17642857", "3": "0.11690982", "4": "0.17053637", "5": "0.075394146", "6": "0.104780756"}}
