{"text": "I was pretty skeptical about this bra, especially since I am a C cup.  It stayed put all night and looked great under my dress that had a little opening in the back that prevented me from wearing a traditional bra.  I was afraid it would hurt to remove, but it wasn't bad at all.  I suggest you try it out prior to the day you plan on wearing it, because it took a few tries to get the position right.  I even managed to have a little lift.  Pretty impressive for a bra that doesn't have straps or a band!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17941482", "1": "0.29402152", "2": "0.09611725", "3": "0.2494139", "5": "0.099679805", "6": "0.07836559"}}
