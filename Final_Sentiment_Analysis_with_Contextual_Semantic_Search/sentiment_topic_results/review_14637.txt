{"text": "I will most certainly buy more of these sandals in different colors.  I have a very wide foot, size 7 in an EEE to EEEE (mostly EEEE) and these shoes meet my needs.  They are pretty and well made with excellent materials - I would recommend to anyone with similar wide feet as mine.  I love these shoes! One of the things I especially love is that they have no heels, just not even surface which is such a relief on my back - I have spinal stenosis and any kind of lift in the heel is torture... thank you for a wonderful pair of sandals...", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.24559107", "1": "0.36465606", "2": "0.21008974", "3": "0.13075721", "6": "0.043159917"}}
