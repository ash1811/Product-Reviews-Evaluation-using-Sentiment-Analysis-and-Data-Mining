{"text": "Very attractive watch.  Basic features but that's about all you'd want in a dress watch.  Face is dark blue.  Easy to adjust the date, but adjusting the watchband length was not particularly easy, even having worked on my other 5 Casio metal banded watches.  Youtube videos were some help but the link locks were just difficult to remove for some reason.  Still 5 stars because it is a very nice looking watch.  10 year battery ought to have it running down about the time I decide to buy another.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09295335", "1": "0.1461374", "2": "0.2689249", "3": "0.056084383", "4": "0.08122154", "5": "0.070293166", "6": "0.2843853"}}
