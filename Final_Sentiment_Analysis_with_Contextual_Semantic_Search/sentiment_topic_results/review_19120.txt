{"text": "This is my forth pair of new balance 574s and I love them. They are very comfortable and well made. so far each time I've had to get a new pair it was from my wearing the soles down, not from falling apart. One of the things I really like about the shoes too is that aside from looking nice and being well made, they are relatively cheap. I wear a size 15 so it normally cost me a decent amount of money to get shoes. These are generally between $30-$45 when I buy them on Amazon. If you are looking for a comfortable everyday-shoe then these are a great option especially if you wear larger sizes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.031428378", "1": "0.36815807", "2": "0.14606151", "3": "0.2897136", "4": "0.06758973", "5": "0.044103023", "6": "0.0529457"}}
