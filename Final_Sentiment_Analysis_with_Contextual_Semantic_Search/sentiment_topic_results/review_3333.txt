{"text": "I purchased this to take on our first cruise and was waiting to review until we used it.  We returned home from a 7 night trip a few days ago. This piece was the lightest, easiest to move, and I was surprised at how much I could fit into it.  Love the red color and all the compartments.  The only slightly irritating thing was the handle doesn't lock in place when extended.  I wish it had a locking button like the other two pieces of luggage I recently purchased (Travel Pro).  I would still highly recommend this garment bag; for the price, I think it's a great deal.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09729441", "1": "0.38075942", "2": "0.14912558", "3": "0.16697125", "5": "0.07039529", "6": "0.132938"}}
