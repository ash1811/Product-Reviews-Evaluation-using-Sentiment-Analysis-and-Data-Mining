{"text": "Having a large foot its hard to find a good fit. These Keens have a very ample volume capability for your foot. Large roomy toe box and very stable sole. The ones I got are definitely old school Keen. Quality leather, supple rubber, etc. Unfortunately something has happened to KEEN and a lot of their newer products look like Chinese imitations.
