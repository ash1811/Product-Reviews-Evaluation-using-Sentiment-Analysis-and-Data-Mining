{"text": "I ordered these based on the size of my old Dockers, but these are a little different.1. Either my old pants have been altered, doesn't look it but is a possibility, or Dockers have gone with the minimum amount that can be considered a 54.  Either way these fit in the waist ok, but the seat is too small.2. Old Dockers came with an inner hook or button for more strength and security in their fastening.Color (Black) good, material good...but Today is their first day.  My old Dockers are 6+ yrs old and still look fine (Blue).  We'll see if these hold up over time.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13259281", "1": "0.24583963", "2": "0.15461776", "3": "0.14282975", "4": "0.14780433", "5": "0.09971607", "6": "0.076599665"}}
