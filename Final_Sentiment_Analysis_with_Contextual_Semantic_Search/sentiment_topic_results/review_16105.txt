{"text": "I bought a bunch of these helmets for a viking/opera skit for my sister's birthday.  They look great, with some awesome detail.  They were pretty easy to assemble, although the horns can rotate some in their holes.  The helmets are a good size, able to fit medium sized heads well.  Those of us with smaller heads needed to add some padding, and those of us with larger heads just wore it a little high.  I gave it only fours stars because the edges on the bottom are rough and my brother complained that it hurt his ears.  This hat would be perfect if they lined the inside with rubber or soft material.  Other than that, it was the most perfect Viking hat I could find.On a note about the company I ordered from, Fox Martin Corp., they responded promptly and professionally to me about my concern regarding shipment time.  The hats (6 adult Viking Helmets and 1 child Viking helmet) did arrive on time and in great condition.  Thank you to the company for responding personally to me, that was great customer service. :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2691119", "2": "0.21675405", "3": "0.1857381", "4": "0.075300775", "5": "0.12766725", "6": "0.123040184"}}
