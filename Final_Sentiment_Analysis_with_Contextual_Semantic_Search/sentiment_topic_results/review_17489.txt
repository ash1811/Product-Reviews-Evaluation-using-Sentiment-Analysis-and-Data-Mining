{"text": "It arrived in perfect condition, very quickly.  It looks even nicer in person than in the pictures.  I got the black suede.  It runs true to size, and the zipper doesn't cause any discomfort.  I sometimes have issues with boot zippers if I don't have a knee-length sock underneath protecting my skin, but these don't cause any irritation.  No blisters or rough spots, no break-in period needed, and very comfortable, even with a lot of walking.  Great boots!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13621657", "1": "0.19656667", "2": "0.32103443", "3": "0.10507003", "4": "0.08518888", "5": "0.10015592", "6": "0.05576749"}}
