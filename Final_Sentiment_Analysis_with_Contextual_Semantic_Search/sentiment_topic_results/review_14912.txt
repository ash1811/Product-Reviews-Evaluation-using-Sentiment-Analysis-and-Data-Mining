{"text": "I liked the slim profile and light weight, but the pink one I got is now stained and faded from the sun and its zipper is constantly snagging. I'm not a person who tosses around their bags, I try to care for my things and I'm frustrated by the color being ruined so quickly. If you go with this bag, I suggest a dark color since it doesn't clean up well.I'm a fan of Baggallini and own several wonderful bags by them. This backpack doesn't seem nearly up to the standard of practical design, organization, or quality that I usually associate with the brand.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13549982", "1": "0.2633832", "2": "0.14040338", "3": "0.202533", "4": "0.09455832", "5": "0.049457856", "6": "0.11416439"}}
