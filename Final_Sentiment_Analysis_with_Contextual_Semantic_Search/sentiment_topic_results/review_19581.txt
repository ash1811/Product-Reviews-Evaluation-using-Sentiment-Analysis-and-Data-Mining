{"text": "This is a good looking bra and very well constructed. In fact the cup sizes are good and the angles of support are well done (often one of my pet peeves with bras). But I wear a 36, which is what I ordered, and this thing on its very last hooks is still extremely tight. My size hasn't changed. Ideally the size should match the measurements on the middle hooks, in my opinion. Then you could go up one set if it was a bit loose or down one if its a bit tight. If I ordered a size larger the cup positions in the front would have been wrong. I will keep it, but be forewarned. I will just wear it when I only need to wear it for a few hours. An all-day bra it won't be for me unless it stretches out, and I think it's probably too well constructed for that (which normally would be a GOOD thing).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.111287974", "1": "0.27800387", "2": "0.19214849", "3": "0.28932577", "5": "0.1022071", "6": "0.024512477"}}
