{"text": "This is Heavy Duty.  My husband wears it under his (civilian job) uniform during the winter in freezing weather, and he says it is almost as warm as a coat while still allowing him to be able to move around and do his job.  It is also durable.  He got some cheaper sweatshirts a while back, and it turns out that it is cheaper to buy these in the long run because they last so long.  He also likes them because they don't have any designs, so he can wear them at work (the small &#34;C&#34; for Carhartt logo on the pocket is hidden by his uniform, but is sewn on and can easily be removed).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.097770035", "1": "0.45233676", "2": "0.07935751", "3": "0.097193584", "4": "0.11653325", "5": "0.092762835", "6": "0.06404603"}}
