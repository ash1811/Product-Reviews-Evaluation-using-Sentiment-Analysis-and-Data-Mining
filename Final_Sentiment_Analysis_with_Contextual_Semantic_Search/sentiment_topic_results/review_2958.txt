{"text": "Love these boots.  Have this style in about 7 colors.  These are my favorite for work as the grey is a beautiful color and goes with my black work cargo pants.  I brush them clean when they get dusty and they still look good as new.  Very comfortable for all day on my feet and I have a high arch.  Good support.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.3463104", "2": "0.1158923", "3": "0.21121944", "4": "0.13925093", "5": "0.10197631", "6": "0.080713496"}}
