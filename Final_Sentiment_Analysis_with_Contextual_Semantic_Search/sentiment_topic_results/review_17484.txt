{"text": "PROs* I can put these shoes on brand new and wear them all day with discomfort.* They look smart.CONs* The first two times I bought this shoe they lasted many months.  The last two lasted a few months, and less than a month, respectively (in both cases the bottom of the heel fell off).  I got a full refund but will not buy this style again.  The salesperson in the Aerosoles store said that when the heels fall off her shoes she just glues them back on again.  That is hardly an endorsement of the product. In any case my heel fell off and was lost before I noticed.  Maybe they should attach them a bit more securely?", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.061570607", "1": "0.13233246", "2": "0.19253708", "3": "0.23131227", "4": "0.10669971", "5": "0.17510001", "6": "0.100447856"}}
