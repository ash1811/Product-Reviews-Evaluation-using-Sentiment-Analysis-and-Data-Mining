{"text": "Immediately after receiving these slippers I put them on. Then I went out into the back yard to play with our two Great Pyr pups (100 lb & 130 lbs). They heard a dog bark on the next property and went tearing off, with me in hot pursuit in my new slippers. I probably ran about 6 acres through Canada Thistle, sage brush, AND CACTI GALORE. My point in telling all of this is that these slippers held up great. After getting home 45 minutes later I pounded them together to get all the various pointy/sharp plant matter off and put them back on. Ahhh, comfort.UPDATE:6 months later and the left toe has ripped out. After my first \"run through the sagebrush\" I have largely worn these shoes inside, with brief trips out to the trash can, et cetera. I would not buy them again, as I expect a bit more than 6 months of life, even out of slippers.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.158217", "1": "0.2818348", "2": "0.10098579", "3": "0.066273384", "4": "0.03660304", "5": "0.22093476", "6": "0.13515116"}}
