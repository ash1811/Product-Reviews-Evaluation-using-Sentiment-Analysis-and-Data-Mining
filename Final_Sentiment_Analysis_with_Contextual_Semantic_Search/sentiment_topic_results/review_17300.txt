{"text": "The only problem I've got is with the way these boots are advertised and posted. After looking at dozens of styles it gets confusing as to which features come on which boots. As for the boot itself, marvelous. NOT steel toe, so be careful, because they look JUST like the ones with. Excellent in every other aspect. Water proof, comfortable out of the box. After 6 months of wear, still fit great and haven't lost their shape or comfort. (this is a second pair which shows how much they're liked).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0942981", "1": "0.30993268", "2": "0.13316153", "3": "0.1122207", "4": "0.23447642", "6": "0.112986624"}}
