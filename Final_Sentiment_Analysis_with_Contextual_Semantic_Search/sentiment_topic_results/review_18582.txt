{"text": "I was surprised how comfortable these are. The color is the same as the photo, which I am seeing is rare on Amazon clothing. It isn't really a charcoal color as you can see by the photo, but that is fine with me. The &#34;cell phone pockets&#34; are kind of useless with any newer phone, but I like the look anyway. They mean flip phones and whatnot, it won't fit an iphone or samsung galaxy. I ordered my normal length with 1 size up waist, and it fits perfectly. My normal waist size would have been too tight. Glad I bought these.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1304136", "1": "0.30065122", "2": "0.21616021", "3": "0.07919266", "4": "0.039858684", "5": "0.059648864", "6": "0.17407477"}}
