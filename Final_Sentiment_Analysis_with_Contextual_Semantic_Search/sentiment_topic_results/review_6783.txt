{"text": "Our family recently traveled on a two week cruise through Europe and I LOVED this neck wallet.  Ports have become wonky about returning to the ship (some ports have no check at all, some require photo ID, and some require passports).  Since our kids only photo ID is their passport we ended up having to carry passports almost everywhere.This silk wallet is soft, lightweight, and was comfortable even in the 100 degree heat of Malta.  Since in hot weather the wallet sits next to your skin having the wallet be silk instead of some other fabric (or worse plastic) is crucial.  The wallet has four pockets - a big zippered passport pocket, two smaller pockets - one for credit cards and one for cash - covered by another zipper, and an open pocket that faces in toward the body.  I wore the wallet on my chest and my wife wore hers (the natural one) slung under one arm - both ways worked well.We had no problems with the strap - either with it breaking or with the adjustable knob failing.  Perhaps they've improved the product as newer reviews mention these problems less frequently.  As for other complaints...I don't really know what to say.  It is a neck wallet...don't buy it if you don't want one.  And yes, in 100 degree heat people will see you're wearing one under your lightweight shirt/blouse...but I've yet to see anything that offers better security/comfort for carrying a passport.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11809601", "1": "0.31676456", "2": "0.116604164", "3": "0.15776539", "4": "0.1097572", "5": "0.06606363", "6": "0.114949055"}}
