{"text": "Bought these as a gift for a friend's 16 yr old daughter. She just loves them, says they are a perfect fit and her mother says she practically sleeps in them. So refreshing to see a teen wearing Keds instead of some $100+ celebrity name tennis shoe ! Her mother has a matching pair and loves hers graphite Keds as well. Highly recommend !", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2238703", "1": "0.09633479", "2": "0.20568644", "3": "0.31447667", "4": "0.051703967", "5": "0.053308267", "6": "0.0546196"}}
