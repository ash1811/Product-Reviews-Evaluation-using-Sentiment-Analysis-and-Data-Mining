{"text": "I love the looks of this watch, but it's a terrible design.The wrist band did fit my large arm.Timex makes a watch I love - the Expedition Indigo with a alarm that has two stems and it's all analog.It is also discontinued, so I bought the last one I could find.This watch was supposed to replace my favorite, but it's a poor alternative, despite the title.This watch glows, but it's hard to find the right button (there are 5 to fumble with).The indigo lighted dial is much dimmer and nearly useless to me.The digital part of this watch is hard to program and not very useful for it's stated purpose.I hate what you have to do to set an alarm or to monitor it.The date display is hard to read and poorly designed.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.080627054", "1": "0.17548658", "2": "0.21434774", "3": "0.08789619", "4": "0.16917402", "5": "0.15384941", "6": "0.118619055"}}
