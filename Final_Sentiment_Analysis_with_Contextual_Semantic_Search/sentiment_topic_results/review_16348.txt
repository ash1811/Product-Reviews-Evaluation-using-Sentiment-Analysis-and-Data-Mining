{"text": "At first I was very displeased with these Reef Sandals....they seemed too tight and wraps wore painfully on the top of my feet. I thought to myself how is this possible, all the flip-flops I have ever had were too lose, now this!!! But I gave them a few days and things changed. As my feet began to mold to the sole of the Sandal they became more and more comfortable. Now I can wear them all day with comfort. Not only that but they hold snug and don't feel like they are always about to fall off. I highly recommend them...after you break them in:)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15328255", "1": "0.14283088", "2": "0.15071689", "3": "0.13989371", "5": "0.26864716", "6": "0.14136478"}}
