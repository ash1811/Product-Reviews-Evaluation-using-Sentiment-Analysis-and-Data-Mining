{"text": "This is the same hat to what I've been checking in stores around my area, but this one has a better price from Amazon! Very good quality and a very good tailoring, not like what I saw in some stores that the sewing was so crooked that it looked cheap!For me, the size I ordered Large seems has an unnoticeable fit compared with Medium (I bought two but in different colors). It feels comfortable wearing it whole day here in Miami. I wear it almost everyday except when I'm at work.Easy to wash and I prefer by hand. All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase. No complaint with delivery, packaging or handling. I recommend it to people and friends who love this kind of hat(s).", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17712049", "1": "0.43280745", "2": "0.030410402", "3": "0.122703455", "4": "0.084952876", "5": "0.08128913", "6": "0.07071618"}}
