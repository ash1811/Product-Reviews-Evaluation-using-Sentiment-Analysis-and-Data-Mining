{"text": "I've been buying these jeans for several years now. While I agree they are not a very heavy denim, the price is right. I use these as work jeans and compared to a brand like Carhartt, they are 1/3 the price. Some may say they are 1/3 the quality as well. I wear them out pretty quickly and don't feel bad about tossing them in a month or so when they get stained or torn. I don't feel as good about tossing a pair of thirty dollar jeans when they get stained. I buy these at WalMart and pay between fourteen & seventeen dollars. I recall one time last year WalMart had then for nine ninety nine. The price here is way too high.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08515582", "1": "0.20863591", "2": "0.14838313", "3": "0.0871533", "4": "0.14081916", "5": "0.21549588", "6": "0.11435677"}}
