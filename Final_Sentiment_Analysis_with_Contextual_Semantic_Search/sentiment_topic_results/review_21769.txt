{"text": "Decent fit,  I have a large head, so buying &#34;One Size Fits All&#34; can be tricky.  Now, with that being said, I do recommend this hat for anyone with a head smaller than 24 1/4 sized head.  It will fit you just fine, this fits better than one from &#34;BlackHawk&#34;, so I do like the cap, but it could be a tad larger.  It does cover the tops of my ears, and I believe more wear it will eventually fit better, it seems to have some give, at least more than the &#34;BlackHawk&#34;.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1131314", "1": "0.19293179", "2": "0.15617219", "3": "0.31602576", "5": "0.06396493", "6": "0.15458891"}}
