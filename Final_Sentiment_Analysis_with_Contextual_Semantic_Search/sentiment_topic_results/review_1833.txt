{"text": "Last summer, I bought my first pair of Minnetonkas, and they were beigey softsoles. I was absolutely in love--the shoe is comfortable and surprisingly gives a lot of support, even though there is no sole. I wore them nearly every day to work, just because they were so comfortable, and even would take walks in them.Needless to say, they began to look dirty pretty fast, so I recently bought a pair of black softsoles, hoping the black wouldn't look as worn so fast.Those these are a little bit bigger than I remember, they still fit pretty well, and are so comfortable, it doesn't even matter.I HIGHLY recommend these, or any Minnetonka brand shoes.Buy buy buy!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09634348", "1": "0.46469072", "2": "0.12281535", "3": "0.25786352", "6": "0.05393837"}}
