{"text": "I ordered this because of the 100% cotton material. I don't really like synthetic fibers since it doesn't feel comfortable during my workouts. When I opened the box and got the shorts out, I was pleased with the quality of the material.After a wearing it for my jog, I was overall pleased with the way it felt. The material felt nice and the pockets and drawstrings were a useful addition. My only small gripe is that the shape of the shorts wasn't as comfortable as I would have liked. Still, it is a quality pair of shorts that should provide good support for your work outs.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.20895654", "1": "0.45169747", "2": "0.06495299", "3": "0.04544948", "4": "0.102988906", "6": "0.123083666"}}
