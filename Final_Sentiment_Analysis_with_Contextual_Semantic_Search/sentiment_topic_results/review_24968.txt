{"text": "This is my 3rd pair of these inserts and I can't run without them since being fitted with these at my local running store.  What's interesting is that I had developed a plantar fascitis problem after wearing a new and different brand of shoes (w/o these inserts), and these inserts are the answer for me on that too!  I do recommend that you consult with your local running store before just trying these, they will help you determine which insert you need.  Happy running!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.092129454", "1": "0.14319454", "2": "0.13390116", "3": "0.18435773", "4": "0.067699954", "5": "0.2331239", "6": "0.14559323"}}
