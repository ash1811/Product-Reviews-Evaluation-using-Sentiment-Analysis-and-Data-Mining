{"text": "The shoe is great.  Well made.  Stylish.  BUT.  Like other reviewers noted, the shoe is much too narrow and is not true to size.  Plus, Amazon charged $4.98 to return it rather than their usual free return-shipping.  The product was actually defective in that the size is not true; so the return-shipping should have been free.  But one cannot keep shoes that don't fit.  So, I'm returning them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.13889284", "2": "0.21330641", "3": "0.23453908", "4": "0.09501591", "5": "0.11789267", "6": "0.19677684"}}
