{"text": "I had been wearing the Lunaire underwire sports bra (Model 1111) for decades. But I lost more than 70 pounds on Weight Watchers and, subsequently, went down about seven or eight bra sizes. I have been looking for a good non-underwire support bra for about a year without any luck. But, I finally found it! And, quite by accident. A local bra store just happened to be located right next door to where I was having lunch, so I went in. I had never heard of the Anita brand before, but I tried on a couple of bras. I bought a light-support model, 5521, and then discovered the Momentum, which I special-ordered from the store and picked up yesterday. This absolutely has to be the best bra I have ever worn. I like my bras to be slightly snug and provide a lot of support for walking, bicycling, and every-day wear. The Momentum has these features, along with padded shoulder straps. Wow! I couldn't be happier. I just ordered three more through Amazon, and another two elsewhere. A bit more expensive than I'm used to, but certainly worth every extra penny!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11609734", "1": "0.0996086", "2": "0.11183756", "3": "0.257396", "4": "0.06559781", "5": "0.13840406", "6": "0.21105866"}}
