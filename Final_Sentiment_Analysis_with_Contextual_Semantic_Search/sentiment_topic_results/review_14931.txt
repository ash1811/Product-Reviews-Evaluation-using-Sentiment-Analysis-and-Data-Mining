{"text": "I purchased this bag for traveling and it didn't disappoint.  There are many pockets to accommodate your kindle/ipad, ipod, water bottle and all the other things you would like to carry with you when traveling.  The bag is small enough that you don't feel like you are carrying a small suitcase on your shoulder, and is lightweight so you can carry a lot of \"stuff\" without being weighed down.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2523602", "1": "0.09449501", "2": "0.22602773", "3": "0.08701931", "4": "0.20424448", "6": "0.13151343"}}
