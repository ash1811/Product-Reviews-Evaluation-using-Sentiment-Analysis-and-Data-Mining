{"text": "I have some serious pain in my right foot, on the bottom. Saw my doctor. He said it is probably caused by a muscle that extends downward from the area of the calf, past the ankle and attaches to the bottom of the foot. He recommended getting a high-top boot or shoe and using that to keep the ankle from moving laterally. Looked at a lot of options, as I wanted something that looked decent and was not too heavy. Finally after a couple days of reading reviews and specs, I settled on the Bates 5&#34; sport boot. They came from Amazon and I immediately tried them on to see what they could do. I was impressed from the get-go. They fit just right, and best of all when laced up properly, practically eliminated the pain in my foot. I've worn them for about ten days, and no complaints.  I just put old SAS insoles into them for extra comfort, and I can wear them all day and be happy. Well worth the money.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11653996", "1": "0.19690536", "2": "0.12664898", "4": "0.3261177", "5": "0.19519797", "6": "0.036153365"}}
