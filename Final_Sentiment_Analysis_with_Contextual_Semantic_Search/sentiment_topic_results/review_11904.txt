{"text": "I bought two of these. One for Black and one for Brown. I use them both every weekend. I can't really compare them as prior to buying these brushes, I went to Nordstrom every week for shoe shines.I can't think of much to say about a shoe brush but I will say this. This appears to be of fine, durable quality and it doesn't scratch the shoes. Every Monday, when I start my workweek, I feel well-groomed and well-dressed, thanks, in part, to these brushes and top quality Allen Edmonds Shoe Cream type polish.I'm only giving 4 stars because I haven't compared to any others.You can buy this brush with confidence.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16319907", "1": "0.22875819", "2": "0.21597232", "3": "0.11192658", "4": "0.047271695", "6": "0.23058976"}}
