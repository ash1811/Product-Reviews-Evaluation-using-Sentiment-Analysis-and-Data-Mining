{"text": "I have a worn Airzuit model JanSport backpack, which is no longer made.  It is more than 15 years old. I went all over the US, Europe, Mexico and Turkey using it as my carry on luggage and day pack. The big Student Classic Series Backpack has flimsy zippers, zipper pulls, and fabric. The shoulder straps had thin, poorly padded straps. I read a review that was critical of this product, but thought that the reviewer was just a complainer. My mistake. I sent it back, and will get a minor repair done my backpack at a luggage repair shop. The Big Student backpack qualifies as a medium grade toy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07482068", "1": "0.17606075", "2": "0.3964288", "3": "0.058447987", "4": "0.15425898", "5": "0.05521662", "6": "0.08476619"}}
