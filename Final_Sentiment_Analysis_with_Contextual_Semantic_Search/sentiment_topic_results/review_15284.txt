{"text": "This fit surprised me because I thought I was purchasing a unisex top; if I would have read the description clearly I would have definitely ordered a large. I am somewhat busty & of course prefer to downplay my assets at work; any t-shirt or button-down top I absolutely have to order a &#34;large&#34;. This top is much bigger than I expected, so much so that I feel a little &#34;fluffy&#34; when wearing it, which isn't the worst thing but a surprise nonetheless. Other than that my only other complaint is that the fabric collects lint like crazy.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.2516652", "1": "0.16043472", "2": "0.09996415", "3": "0.36963984", "4": "0.050362196", "5": "0.04627906", "6": "0.021654792"}}
