{"text": "Seems like a well-made bra but the style is not comfortable for me. But it may be just the thing for you.  Playtex is a good brand.  I usually use JMS bras and this is sized differently.  The cup size is much larger than the JMS brand. I'll need to return this one.  I'll be staying with JMS because I find them comfortable and since I'm familiar with the sizing, ordering is not a guess (I hope).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03505564", "1": "0.19746245", "3": "0.39540854", "4": "0.2644639", "6": "0.10093467"}}
