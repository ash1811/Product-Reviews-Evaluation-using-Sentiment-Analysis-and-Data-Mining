{"text": "This was my first time wearing an adhesive bra and it was great.  I read the previous reviews about how to put it on (bending forward) and managed to get a great look under a stappy silk jersey dress-- no lumps or bumps!  It isn't fun taking it off but it's not painful, either.  I can't imagine that wearing one of these all the time would be good for your girls in terms of gravity and the necessary pulling required to take it off, but it's great for special occasions.  Like previous reviewers, I bought a size up (I'm borderline B-C and bought the C).  There is no way I could have fit the B so be sure to size up!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10617382", "1": "0.3701297", "2": "0.12181893", "3": "0.14776586", "4": "0.10276444", "5": "0.110410474", "6": "0.040936798"}}
