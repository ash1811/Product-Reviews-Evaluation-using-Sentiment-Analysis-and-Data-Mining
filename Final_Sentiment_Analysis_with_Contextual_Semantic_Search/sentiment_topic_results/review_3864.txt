{"text": "As suggested, I rounded up rather than down on the sizing chart. Perfect fit, not too difficult to get into (no worse than putting on pantyhose), non-binding leg openings. I haven't worn them out yet, but it seems like they will stay up pretty well. However, there isn't a silicone band around the top to help keep the band from slipping, unlike similar products I've worn. I may use some double sided fashion tape for some added assurance. I have big hips and an ample rear, so I felt that the fabric pulled a little too tight in that area, and flattened rather than enhancing my rear. My only real negative is the &#34;double&#34; gusset. I think it's more of a liability than a selling point. The opening is really not big enough that I'm confident that I wouldn't make a mess of myself trying to pee through it. Also, the two sides don't really overlap enough for me to feel comfortable without underwear.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1762422", "1": "0.20792586", "2": "0.12975413", "3": "0.17703448", "4": "0.12380332", "5": "0.047094703", "6": "0.13814537"}}
