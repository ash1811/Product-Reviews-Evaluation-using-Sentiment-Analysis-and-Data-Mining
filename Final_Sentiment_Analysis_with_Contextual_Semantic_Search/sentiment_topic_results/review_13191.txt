{"text": "This is what happens when you move a quality product from the US to a foreign country for manufacture.  I've worn Levi's 501's since before they were even called 501's (over 60 years) and this product is not a Levi 501.  It is pure garbage and I've ordered my last pair.  It really is a bummer to see what is happening to so many \"American\" products that are shipped overseas to cheap labor manufacturers.  I would even advocate a boycott of Levi until they return to the quality that made them famous...Now I have to search for a replacement...Maybe I'll try Wranglers.....", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.030124443", "1": "0.08379135", "2": "0.15043023", "3": "0.1849267", "4": "0.1388344", "5": "0.20684066", "6": "0.20505223"}}
