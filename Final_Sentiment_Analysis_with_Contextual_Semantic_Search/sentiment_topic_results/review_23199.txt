{"text": "As expected, this bag is a great buy! I had ordered an Olive Green but had a Black one delivered instead. It was a gift for my son and he was so excited that the color mishap didnt even matter. And on a better note, it will match with everything. We got him this bag so he can carry his handheld games, some story books and his short trip needs.. a water bottle, snacks and such. The outer flap has a zippered pocket. The inside is spacious enough for story books, his 8&#34;tablet, snacks, etc. and also has a smaller zippered pocket for his money.  the 2 front Velcro pockets fit his chargers neatly. The shoulder strap is great bc fits him now at 6 and the great quality of the bag will carry on for years, im sure, and will grow with him. I ordered another for my nephew's b day and im thinking of getting one for my hubby as well. love this bag!!  i will be ordering many more for all the male gifts this year coming up lol.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1975261", "1": "0.2720056", "2": "0.17969275", "3": "0.11887913", "4": "0.1210093", "5": "0.06276927", "6": "0.04811784"}}
