{"text": "These are comfortable from day 1.  Slip-ons are a nice convenience because they also slip off.  You can kick them on and off at work.  (I keep heels under my desk and slip these off and the heels on whenever I get up to go to a meeting or walk somewhere.)They fit securely on your feet when you slide your foot in them.  You can wear them all day long.  They wear well and they look nice.  The many color and fabric configurations available give you some nifty choices for attention getters to plain and simple.  I need a comfortable shoe and this is it.  I am not someone who can walk into a Payless store and find something.If you have access to an Easy Spirit outlet, you can often find this style there at a good price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13973671", "1": "0.37599418", "2": "0.12174176", "3": "0.07061187", "4": "0.07465141", "5": "0.14082712", "6": "0.076436944"}}
