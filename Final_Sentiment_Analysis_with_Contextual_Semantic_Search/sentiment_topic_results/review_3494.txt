{"text": "This bra gives better support and overall shape than many name-brand wireless bras that I've tried on in stores.  There is one aspect that could be improved, however.First, I'll give the positive features.  The panel under the breasts gives good support, especially when standing.  The straps are smoothly connected to the cup area, as opposed to being tacked on.  This connection provides better support.  There is enough coverage in the cleavage area so that you don't \"spill out\" of the cups when bending or twisting.  This has been a problem for me with some other bras.Second, there is one thing that could be improved.  The cup area has 2 rather thin layers of soft fabric.  Although it is comfortable, I expected more firmness.  It looks that way in the picture to me.  Some bras have a thicker fabric in the cup area, without being thickly padded.  I would have preferred this.  Also, because it lacks this, the nipples can show through (to be direct about it).  I wear \"nippies\" nipple covers which I purchased here on Amazon.  They are very comfortable and work great.  However, it's not as convenient.  There is sometimes slight puckering of the fabric at the top of the cup area because of the lack of the thicker fabric.  For me, it's not a major problem.I liked the bra enough to order 2 more, but I'm interested in looking at others.  Overall, I recommend it as a good, wireless bra.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12059013", "1": "0.31247258", "2": "0.0907569", "3": "0.22121", "4": "0.21186103", "6": "0.04096738"}}
