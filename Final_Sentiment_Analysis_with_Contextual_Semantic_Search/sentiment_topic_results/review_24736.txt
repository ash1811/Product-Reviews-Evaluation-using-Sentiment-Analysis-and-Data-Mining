{"text": "I've been buying this bra for many years,  however it was about 4  years ago when I bought the last one.  This new one just doesn't seem like the same quality that it used to be.  I ordered two Wacoal bras,  they are both made in two different places.  This one is made in Dominican Republic,  the other one in China.  The one from China seems like the old  Wacoal quality and worth the money.  This one does not,  and it certainly in my opinion isn't worth what it cost.  The cup fabric looks as if it would wear out quickly to me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.036071494", "1": "0.34973323", "2": "0.12817648", "3": "0.1329258", "4": "0.13083383", "5": "0.15671086", "6": "0.06554831"}}
