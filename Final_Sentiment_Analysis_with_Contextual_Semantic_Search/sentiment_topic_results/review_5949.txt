{"text": "I wish I had read the previous review before I ordered this bra.  It doesn't just run on the small side, the sizes are completely off.  Believe us, the cup size is about 2 sizes smaller than should be.  If you order a \"D\" cup in this bra, you will get the equivalent of a \"B\" cup, I went so far as to measure it against a \"B\" cup and they were approximately the same size.  Save you money, time, and return postage.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12662062", "1": "0.097771", "2": "0.129408", "3": "0.37535545", "4": "0.19503774", "6": "0.07230924"}}
