{"text": "Good boot, hard rigid sole that will not compress and deform.  will need a few break in wear events, leather a bit stiff.  A sewn edge on the bottom of the tongue where it joins the boot has a tendency to roll under and create a pressure point on the top of the foot.  I hope it will stay &#34;up&#34; after a few wears, if not a drop of glue might be required.  Good looking black boot overall.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09261413", "2": "0.16234265", "3": "0.2748475", "4": "0.1899041", "5": "0.23805676", "6": "0.03873707"}}
