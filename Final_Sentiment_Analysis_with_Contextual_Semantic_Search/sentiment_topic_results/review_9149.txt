{"text": "I bought these for my fiance for his birthday a week ago. And so far he really loves them. They are comfortable, true to size (he's a 15!) and warm. May be a bit too warm for summer, but for winter use, these are great. I've seen him get the paper out in the rain, run to the store, and most all household tasks with no problem and he says they are great. I'll update if they start to fall apart or if we run into any problems with them, since they are still pretty new.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.031549297", "1": "0.32985678", "3": "0.3851975", "4": "0.036146566", "5": "0.10507866", "6": "0.10911758"}}
