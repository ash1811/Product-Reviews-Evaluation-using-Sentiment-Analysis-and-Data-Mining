{"text": "I've read many reviews of both Lee and Levi jeans regarding the inconsistency of fit.  I've purchased many Lee jeans in this style, mostly on-line at Amazon and I've found a very consistent fit giving me the confidence to buy it on-line without first trying it on.  This jean may be a bit thinner than previously purchased jeans but on the other hand, the jeans also appear softer, especially after hanging them to line dry which makes them feel much stiffer when you put them on.  This particular color (Battleship) is very nice and the picture is a &#34;true&#34; color of the actual jean.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.032206368", "1": "0.25917062", "3": "0.20155647", "4": "0.24773248", "5": "0.10917639", "6": "0.14787622"}}
