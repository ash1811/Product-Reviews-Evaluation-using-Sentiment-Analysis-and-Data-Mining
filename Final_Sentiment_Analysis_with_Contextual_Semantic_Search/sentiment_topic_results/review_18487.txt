{"text": "OK, I bought this bag to use as a bug out bag for one of my cars. I wanted a sturdy bag that can hold extra cloths, medical supplies, some food and water, etc... It will work for its intended purpose. I would not use this bag for every day use, however because it seems that it would wear out fairly quickly. For sitting in the car 99.9% of the time, however, it fits the bill, especially for the price. The zippers could be stronger I guess, but overall it would be a fine bag for EDC for a child, but I would get something better for heavy packing or hiking.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08831291", "1": "0.2629944", "2": "0.20894033", "3": "0.20891355", "4": "0.044531792", "5": "0.12952793", "6": "0.056779034"}}
