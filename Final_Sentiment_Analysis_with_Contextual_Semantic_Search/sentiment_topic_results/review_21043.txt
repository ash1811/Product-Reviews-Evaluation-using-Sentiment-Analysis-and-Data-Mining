{"text": "weight legging with no skin showing through which I love. I'm 5' 4&#34; tall and 127 pounds and the small fits perfectly. Very happy with these leggings. I have about 5 pair and wear them at night after I get home and take off my uniform. Very comfy and good even if I want to run out to the store I can do so with a pair of boots and my coat. Highly recommend them to all!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15272516", "1": "0.46304977", "4": "0.3687232"}}
