{"text": "I've had the Casio DW9052 G-shock watch for a couple of months now. So far its held up very well.There is nothing real fancy about it. It shows the time/ date, illuminates and has a stop watch. Not much else but for around $50 what do expect.Now, I haven't pounded on the thing with a sledge hammer but it seems like it could take a beating.Its a comfortable watch being not too big or small. It is a little thick so if you have little girly wrists it may look a little funny.For the price tag I would recommend it if you are looking a nice, sporty watch that won't break the bank.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.052252226", "1": "0.4078542", "2": "0.23863755", "3": "0.08565918", "4": "0.04974836", "5": "0.07868055", "6": "0.08716793"}}
