{"text": "I knew this watch was small before I even placed the order. When I received it, I regretted it a little and was almost embarrassed to wear it. But after wearing it around for a few hours I started admiring the lightness. I almost forgot I had it on. I started wearing this watch daily. I wear this watch when I work out or when Im working in the shop (construction and fabricating). The best part is that its actually pretty rugged. Ive had dirt, grease, saw dust etc. all over my watch and all it took was a rinse under the faucet and it was back to normal.The dinky LED on the left of the screen really doesnt illuminate much. But for the most part, its better than nothing. Overall, I highly recommend it for its durability and value.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2284709", "1": "0.15038626", "2": "0.2831919", "3": "0.12642407", "4": "0.038315356", "5": "0.115116745", "6": "0.058094762"}}
