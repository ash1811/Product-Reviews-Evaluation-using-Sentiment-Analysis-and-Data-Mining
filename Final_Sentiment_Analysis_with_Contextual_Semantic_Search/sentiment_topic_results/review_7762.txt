{"text": "Levi's jeans has needed to spend some time and money on quality checks/assurance.  It usually takes a couple orders/returns to get the right fit.  The ones I settled on still have a problem where the outside seam on the right leg runs down the right side of my right knee and not on the outside of my leg where is should be.  The price has always been between $40-$60 and the quality of manufacture has gone way down hill.  This is as if they want to give us a reason to spend $100-$200 for the other jeans that are out there.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.046638582", "1": "0.40737164", "2": "0.20830198", "3": "0.16261424", "4": "0.104864985", "6": "0.067213774"}}
