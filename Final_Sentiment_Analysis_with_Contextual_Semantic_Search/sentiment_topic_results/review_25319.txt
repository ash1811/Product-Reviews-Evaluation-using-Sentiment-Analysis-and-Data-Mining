{"text": "I'm an avid sportsman, hiker, and I spent 6 years in the Army Infantry, which included 3 combat tours. I know a little bit about \"hiking\" and walking ;) Do I know more than you guys? No; certainly not. I just wanted to explain my relevant experience and how it relates to the shoes.They are comfortable, semi-rugged, and a decent shoe all around. I usually wear them for basic day-to-day use except for running and hiking. Why not running or hiking? For me, personally, the sole is too hard and immobile to run in. I don't feel the ground as much as I prefer to (I am NOT a minimalist runner, it's like running flat-footed because the sole isn't flexible, and they seem to give a jolt to my knees when I run in them.My biggest complaint is about the hiking. Merrel prides, markets, and sells themselves on the outdoors and all that good stuff. To me, these shoes do not live up to that reputation. Sure, they survived Afghanistan with me, and they survive the few hikes I used them for around where I live. But they are extremely poor at traction. On flat, dry, land, these shoes are fine. On steep, rocky, and especially wet ground, these shoes are extremely lacking. I wore these for the first time in the fall while making some ascents for fun in Germany and almost \"ate it\" many times. I ended up taking them off and walking barefoot. Surprisingly, my $40 running shoes get more traction on wet surfaces than these shoes; they just don't hold up as well.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15483281", "1": "0.1422527", "2": "0.06819371", "3": "0.17362559", "4": "0.16382569", "5": "0.17530976", "6": "0.121959746"}}
