{"text": "Over the years I have tried different models of Levis and prefer the relaxed fit of the 550 over the rest. Of course this is simply a matter of personal preference on how you want your jeans to fit.I agree with other reviewers in that the material has gotten thinner. In my opinion this is not necessarily a bad thing. The thinner material makes for a lighter weight and even more comfortable jean. It will just take time and many washings to see if these jeans hold up and last as long as the older and thicker Levis.Overall I am happy with these jeans. Although, if I want a heavy and warmer jean then I buy LL Bean.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14917867", "1": "0.21216792", "2": "0.08040638", "3": "0.16022758", "4": "0.1941255", "5": "0.067450635", "6": "0.13644332"}}
