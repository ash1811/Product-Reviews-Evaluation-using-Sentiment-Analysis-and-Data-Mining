{"text": "I've owned three of these watches, they aren't pretty, but darn they work well.A number of years ago, I decided to upgrade from this watch, and buy a Victronix Swiss Army watches that was a bit nicer looking. After going through four bands on that watch and the bands no longer available, I needed a new watch. Well, here you go, back to the old standby. In fact today, it's less expensive than what I paid many years ago.The watch face is large and easy to read. I like the ivory color and the large analog hands. One requirement for me was two times on my watch. I travel a lot and I always set the analog hands to where I am and leave the digital time with home time. This watch works perfectly for that purpose. The band is nothing special to look at, it is functional. Both the analog and digital time is very accurate.The packaging is super nice. Timex has done away with all the fancy plastic landfill packages and gone with a very simple red cardboard box. I like that a lot. No waste, no landfill garbage, just a well protected watch.It's wonderful to be back with my old friend the Timex Expedition watch.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.20012075", "2": "0.29762232", "3": "0.26985624", "4": "0.102828614", "5": "0.034465138", "6": "0.09299893"}}
