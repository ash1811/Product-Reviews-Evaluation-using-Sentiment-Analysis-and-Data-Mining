{"text": "Ordered this for my husband who needed to replace an old worn-out rain jacket.  This Carhartt is heavy enough for ANY outdoor job...It's also a \"hanger bender\"....so you might want to store it folded.  It most certainly will take a rugged guy to carry this jacket around on his back.  As a gal who buys men's jeans and boots on a regular basis for all the barn and garden work I do, this is one \"men's\" jacket JUST for men.  GO FOR IT GUYS!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2525766", "2": "0.28575054", "3": "0.040676896", "4": "0.33996773", "6": "0.07478619"}}
