{"text": "Ok I bought 2 Le Mystere bras and I loved them both, then I wanted to get another one and decided to try this one with the lace.  I thought it would be nice with lower cut shirt or if the strap were showing it would look pretty.  The bra fit good 34E (34dd) But it was very itchy, the back and the arm straps.  It also seemed to rub in the armpit area.  I loved the tisha and the techfit so much better #1 techfit!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.034366075", "1": "0.42529893", "2": "0.094556496", "3": "0.12862487", "4": "0.14970647", "6": "0.16452089"}}
