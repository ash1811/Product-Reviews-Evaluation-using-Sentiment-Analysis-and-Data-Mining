{"text": "I was looking for a watch for working out.  This has a very low profile for a digital, is very light with an easy to read display.  I have had it for 3 months and it's doing fine.  The bands on digital watches are always the first thing to go, so many of the stories in other reviews regarding this do not surprise me.  This band is a bit delicate compared to a hefty dive watch.  Also the connection of the band to the face is not standard- you can't by a generic 20mm band to replace a broken one.  But at 16 bucks, its not like you're losing much when it goes.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.094201036", "1": "0.19419818", "2": "0.2659464", "3": "0.13146722", "4": "0.16227682", "5": "0.060700506", "6": "0.091209844"}}
