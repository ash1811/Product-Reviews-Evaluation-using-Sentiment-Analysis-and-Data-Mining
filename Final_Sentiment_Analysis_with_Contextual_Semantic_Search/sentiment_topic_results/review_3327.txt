{"text": "I just used this bag to go to Vegas.  Really nice bag.  It held 3 sports coats, 3 pairs of jeans, and 3 shirts on the hanger.  I did not use any of the other compartments to keep the weight down.  My only complaint was the handle not having a push button.  It got quite annoying it falling down when I let go or tried to push it backwards.  If it had a button handle I would have given it 5 stars.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.054753173", "1": "0.42134276", "2": "0.23069432", "3": "0.12838896", "4": "0.051408388", "6": "0.10999264"}}
