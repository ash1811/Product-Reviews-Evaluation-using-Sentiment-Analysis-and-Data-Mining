{"text": "This beautiful bracelet arrived, packaged like a treasure. And a treasure it is. At 10 mm thick and 7 1/2 inches long, I suppose it might be either a women's or men's bracelet. I'm not sure what length that men wear their bracelets at. The Byzantine linkage is intricate and fascinating. This chunky bracelet goes well with theCarolyn Pollack Sterling Silver Multi-Gemstone Bouquet Cuff Bracelet.It is high grade silver, untarnished, and polished to a high degree of shine, so that it is very bright. The only thing that I have a problem with is that it comes with a C closure, and so far the closure is quite stiff. When it loosens up, hopefully it will loosen up, it would be easier on old fingers to open and close them a lobster clasp. At least I think that this would be the case, because the tab that you manipulate on the C is much bigger than what you would get on a lobster clasp.At the price, I think this is a real steal. It is chunky enough to wear by itself, but it does do well with other bracelets. And it matches up well with theSterling Silver Italian Round BOX Necklace Chain 4mm (1/8 in.) Medium Heavy weight Smooth Finish Nickel Free, size 16 inch long.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15410647", "1": "0.13814814", "2": "0.13671419", "3": "0.24841005", "4": "0.20753534", "5": "0.06047378", "6": "0.054612063"}}
