{"text": "This fits so nicely and is thin!  I didn't itch at all wearing this, and it really helped my trouble spots.I have tried a lot of shapers over the past few years, from Spanx, Hanes, Curvi and more.  I am very happy with this cincher!  Very comfortable and I can wear it all day!Neither the top, nor the bottom creep, it really stays in place.  I even went so far as to wearing a shaper OVER this cincher, which smoothed out the edges of the cincher!I will be wearing the waist cincher under the shaper for my wedding in a couple weeks - in 85 degrees - and I have total confidence that I will look AWESOME rockin' my hourglass shape!(here is the shaper I bought too:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007QMK8M/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_40)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19083957", "1": "0.30502227", "2": "0.17210874", "3": "0.17881258", "4": "0.043579184", "5": "0.061235312", "6": "0.048402354"}}
