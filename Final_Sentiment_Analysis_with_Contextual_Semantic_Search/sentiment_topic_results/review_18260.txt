{"text": "The watch looks nice and unlike some I got an accurate temp reading.  The digital information is too little and the light is too late.  The size of the info is small and not clear for old eyes.  The lighted version of the display is only on for a very short time making viewing difficult.  Some (with young vision) should love this watch, however be cautious if you have difficulty reading small displays.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.27791426", "1": "0.2625854", "2": "0.17236741", "3": "0.09986531", "6": "0.17992404"}}
