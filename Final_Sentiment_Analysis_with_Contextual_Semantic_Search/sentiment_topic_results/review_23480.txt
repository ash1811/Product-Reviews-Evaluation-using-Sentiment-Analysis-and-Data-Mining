{"text": "I have had 15 or so Invicta's over the years and have had to send some back for service. Just pray that nothing ever goes wrong with your watch!!! I Love these watches and have turned people on to them. They are awesome looking, cheap, and keep great time. The watches I am referring to are the automatic pro diver with screw down crown. I have had problems with the thread on the screw down crown and the auto movement. I have sent these back to have the problems fixed and have gotten the watch back with nothing at all done!!! As I am writing this I am waiting for a response from Invicta, whom I emailed four days ago about a womans watch that stopped working. With previous experience, I am not holding my breath. With this &#34;Throw Away society&#34; we live in, maybe they are just ignoring me and hoping I just buy a new watch", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11817215", "1": "0.13321571", "2": "0.24751294", "3": "0.06586322", "4": "0.112219855", "5": "0.20432654", "6": "0.11868955"}}
