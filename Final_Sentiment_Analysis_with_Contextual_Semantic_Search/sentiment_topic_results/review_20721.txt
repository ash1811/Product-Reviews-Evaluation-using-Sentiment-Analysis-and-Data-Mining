{"text": "This seems like an all right product for the price. Not stellar, but fairly durable (bear in mind these are intended for use as liners, not for heavy direct exterior wear). The one-size-fits-all idea is a problem for these, however. If you have large or very large hands, the fit will probably be good. These gloves will stretch comfortably. I have medium hands, and there is just way too much extra fingertip space going on. This really doesn't work well, as it makes ordinary handling tasks more difficult than they already should be with a glove and liner on. I keep trying to shrink these buggers in the laundry, but that is barely happening, if at all (another plus if you have big hands, I guess). I'd like these a lot better if they came in sizes...", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.052161627", "1": "0.25592452", "2": "0.14517298", "3": "0.24869208", "4": "0.062111955", "5": "0.13569218", "6": "0.10024464"}}
