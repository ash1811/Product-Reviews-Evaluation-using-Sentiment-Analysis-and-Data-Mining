{"text": "I'm rough on my running watches, which I generally never take off, so I don't blame the manufacturer when they only last a couple of years.  I have had a number of Timex running watches since my first \"Timex Marathon\" [the \"Mary Decker\"] in 1984, and have found them to be accurate, durable, and the stopwatch function easy to use.I especially like that Timex makes sports watches in a \"medium\" size--they don't call them \"women's\", but that's what they are.This watch was easy to set upon its arrival, and can be looked at in the dark because of the \"indiglo\" feature which is now apparently standard on Timex sports watches.Sports watches don't change much from year to year anymore, so it's great to get one which may be last year's model and save some money.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12276731", "1": "0.11856662", "2": "0.23492028", "3": "0.15542", "4": "0.15017723", "5": "0.08862093", "6": "0.12952764"}}
