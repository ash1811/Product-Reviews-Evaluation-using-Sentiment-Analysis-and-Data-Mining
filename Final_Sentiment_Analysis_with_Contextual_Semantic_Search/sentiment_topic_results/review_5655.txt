{"text": "I bought a bunch of these tops in white and different colors. I can wear them as undershirt in Winter and layer it with a shirt in Summer. I need XL (I wear 16 average) and they fit right on the top and are nice and long to tuck in with out pulling out. The straps are wide enough to hide bra straps and don't gap under the arms. I would definitely buy these again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3531695", "2": "0.078957", "3": "0.2897981", "5": "0.12690865", "6": "0.14378414"}}
