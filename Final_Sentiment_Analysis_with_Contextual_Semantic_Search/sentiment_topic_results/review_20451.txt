{"text": "They apparently run at-least a size too big, but there was no warning from manufacturer/seller on Amazon about that.  I ordered the size of shoes I typically wear, & my feet popped out of the back during each step.  I have big feet & typically wear 13W.  These slippers in XXL 13-14 pop out, but they also list a size (I didn't buy) named XXL-US men, without explaining the difference between their two listed size &#34;XXL&#34;s!  wtf, I would never buy from such an advertiser again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18305792", "1": "0.17903334", "2": "0.112395965", "3": "0.13014103", "4": "0.19223805", "5": "0.098576345", "6": "0.10455732"}}
