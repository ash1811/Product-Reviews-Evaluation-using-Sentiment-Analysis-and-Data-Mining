{"text": "I have ordered this same style shoe, same maker in Black. I ordered my normal size of 12 1/5 wide. They were uncomfortable so I had them stretched and they are wearable. This brown pair I ordered a 13 medium and it is much to small. I am returning it for a 14 1/2 wide.The sizes are inconsistent as described. I hope that the 14 in 1/5 is not too large as the 12 1/5 wide was wearable only  after I had them stretched.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10127162", "1": "0.3299946", "2": "0.03609017", "3": "0.32922697", "4": "0.14194359", "5": "0.039092388", "6": "0.022380715"}}
