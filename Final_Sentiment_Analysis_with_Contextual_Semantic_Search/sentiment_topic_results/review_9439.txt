{"text": "Beware - Fake Fur - As many reviewers wrote they run small.  i order a size up and they were still tight for a day or two.  They are good quality and look better than most and definitely more comfortable than most but they should be for the price.  I almost returned them because the fur is fake.  I was really looking forward to the sheepskin so i was disappointed but i gave them a try and like them and kept them.  I didn't know UGG made fake fur so if that's the only reason you are getting them look elsewhere.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.106938235", "1": "0.29138947", "2": "0.07565681", "3": "0.34341624", "4": "0.13681437", "6": "0.042670526"}}
