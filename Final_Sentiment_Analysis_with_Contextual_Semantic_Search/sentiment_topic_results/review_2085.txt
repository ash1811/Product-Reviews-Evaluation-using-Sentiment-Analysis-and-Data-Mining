{"text": "My brother has a pair of these shoes and loves them. I had my eye on them for awhile, and finally bought them on cyber Monday. I got them for $75 which is a steal. They were not as comfortable as I would have thought out of the box, but now after wearing them for several days they feel amazing. The leather and stitching looks great. I can wear them with a variety of clothes. They almost feel like I am wearing slippers now. I love these shoes and would buy them again!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.083212", "1": "0.33920762", "2": "0.18994366", "4": "0.21921894", "6": "0.1615876"}}
