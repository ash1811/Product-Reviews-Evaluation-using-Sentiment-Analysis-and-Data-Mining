{"text": "This is a high quality watch for a very reasonable price on Amazon. The back light is so strong you can even use it in the dark as a mini flashlight! This G-Shock watch is also not too heavy nor bulky, and looks great with its' countdown graphic on the left side. Even though the red buttons are a little hard to press down (they are supposed to be-this watch is mud resistant), with a little effort they move just fine. I have no power in my fingers, and I can adjust the settings and alarm just fine!  This is a very durable, yet relatively lightweight digital watch (it weighs about the same as my much smaller Timex Ironman watch). This watch's wristband is also fairly flexible, and the Mudman is great for mountain biking, hiking, or any activity where you need G shock protection and dirt is involved.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.18066846", "1": "0.090467244", "2": "0.27371517", "3": "0.08444036", "4": "0.12803859", "5": "0.115587234", "6": "0.12708294"}}
