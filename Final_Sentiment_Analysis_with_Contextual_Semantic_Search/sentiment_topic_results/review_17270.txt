{"text": "I wear a size 10.5&#34; shoe, ordered these in 10.5&#34;, and they fit perfectly.Nike makes their insoles a bit different than other companies though, the arch support is more in the outside of the arch rather than in the middle, which works fine for me, but some people might need a more centered arch support. I run with a heel-to-toe stride and these absorb impact, and rolls nicely off the ball of my foot. These aren't life changing shoes or anything, but they work great for casual runners such as myself. I've already put 27 miles on them and they are holding well.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.032816567", "1": "0.22239156", "2": "0.1188578", "3": "0.29379818", "4": "0.1367174", "5": "0.121016346", "6": "0.07440213"}}
