{"text": "I bought these leggings in a size medium after reading all the reviews and looking at several other choices.  I wanted them to work out in at my gym.  I was concerned about the waist because someone said they were tight, so I ordered the medium and they are big in the waist!  I usually wear a size 6 in jeans, sometimes a 4 in stretchy paints, so a small would probably fit me better in the waist, but they are tight in the legs, which is fine, because they stretch a little bit, and the fabric is of medium weight--not too thin or see through.  The length is on the short side for me--I would have liked them longer because they hit me at the top of my ankle.  My inseam is 32 or 33 in jeans, usually a regular length. The waistband hits below the belly button, so they are considered low rise, I guess.  Hope this helps you!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1550632", "1": "0.45033932", "2": "0.13520649", "3": "0.176679", "4": "0.05634337", "6": "0.02380075"}}
