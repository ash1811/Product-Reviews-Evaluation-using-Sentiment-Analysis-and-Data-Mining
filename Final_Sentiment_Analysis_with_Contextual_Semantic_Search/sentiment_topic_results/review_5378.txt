{"text": "This is a nice heavy henley shirt, an excellent value for the price.  They hold up well in washing -- no frayed seams, no lost buttons.  As someone else mentioned, they run a *little* large, but I prefer a loose fit anyway.  (Yeah, I'm a female, but I like to wear these as nightshirts ... )  You can find tee shirts cheaper than this, but they'll be made of much thinner material.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12108127", "1": "0.31715813", "2": "0.1994223", "3": "0.10057922", "4": "0.06401599", "5": "0.12408086", "6": "0.07366222"}}
