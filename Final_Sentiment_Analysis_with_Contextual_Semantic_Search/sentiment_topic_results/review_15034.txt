{"text": "So i got these to compliment my black cowboy boots; however they will not work with hightop/calf boots. They are designed to work with a dress shoe or something similar.So in round two of testing i said \"i will put these on first, and then put my boot/shoe on\" then i found where my problem was. they fit very snug on me.... on my BARE SKIN. my calf (which is all muscle, i might add) is 20.5/21\" just below the knee (3-4\" below) and these things were skin tight. which presents a small problem since i need to tuck my pant into them. so measure your calves to see if these will even fit on you! anything below 18\" these should work for you.So why still 4 stars? easy. i wear my cowboy boots, and slide them down inside (so that the cuff/top cover my boots giving the illusion of my original boots being pirate boots. work for me just fine! gonna wear these with my Pirate costume for both Halloween and the Alestorm concert next month!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07836661", "1": "0.3008578", "2": "0.09419686", "3": "0.20444229", "4": "0.22764102", "5": "0.027003078", "6": "0.06749232"}}
