{"text": "If you have high arched feet, you'll want to try a pair of these inserts.  My wife had problems with her knees for years to the point to where she went into the doctor and they couldn't find anything wrong.  She went to a foot doctor who had some custom inserts made for her at the tune of about $600.  They did help quite a bit, but when they were wearing out my wife found these inserts and ordered them on Amazon.  To her amazement, these actually did a better job than the custom made inserts for relieving her knee pain.There are different types of inserts for different conditions, so please make sure you're ordering the correct ones of you may make any situation worse.  For my wife, these have been a miracle worker and they hold up amazingly well as they've outlasted a pair of shoes already with no real signs of wear.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24115458", "1": "0.17096779", "2": "0.19975674", "3": "0.06817585", "4": "0.044477437", "5": "0.20520881", "6": "0.07025875"}}
