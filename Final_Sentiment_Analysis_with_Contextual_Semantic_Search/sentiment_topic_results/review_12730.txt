{"text": "Love these pants and was surprised in a good way at the cut and quality.  Material is a nice hefty cotton canvas, sturdy and well-made. Washes well, too. The fit seems to be the usual S-M-L that we're all familiar with, but be aware these are the modern low-rise cut and fit, as in barely above the line for indecent exposure in back. That said, these are fun and comfortable to wear and the draw string makes it easy to get a snug fit for those of us with a larger derriere but a smaller waist.  I also really like that I can turn them into capris by tying the long cuff strings around my calves and tucking under the cuff.  Not sure if that is an intended feature, but it works!  Will buy from Rothco again...", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.116638966", "1": "0.31534413", "2": "0.23518252", "3": "0.1521129", "4": "0.0274957", "5": "0.0551577", "6": "0.0980681"}}
