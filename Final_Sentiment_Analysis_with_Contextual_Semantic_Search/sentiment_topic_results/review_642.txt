{"text": "My inseam is 31 inches. Since I prefer my jeans to cover my ankles completely, I usually order 32 inch inseam. However this actual pair of jeans received has an inseam of 33.25 inches to be exact. This is a bit too much to tolerate. So I had to return it and ordered another pair with 30 inch inseam.The pros: 1. Excellent color; 2. Good material quality and texture; 3. Good style.The cons: 1. Too long for its sizes; 2. A little bit too tight for the so-called \"classic fit\"; 3. The back seat is a bit too high.Update: I bought another pair with 30-inch inseam and waist one size bigger. Now it fits me much better. So the problem is really with the sizing of this particular brand of jeans. I have measured the actual length of the inseam again for this 30-inch inseam jeans. It is a full 32 inches! Glad that Amazon makes it easy to return and re-order. I therefore add one star to my review. Hope this provides a reference for potential buyers of this particular jeans.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11122031", "1": "0.25952366", "2": "0.090938635", "3": "0.3503339", "5": "0.07875527", "6": "0.10731053"}}
