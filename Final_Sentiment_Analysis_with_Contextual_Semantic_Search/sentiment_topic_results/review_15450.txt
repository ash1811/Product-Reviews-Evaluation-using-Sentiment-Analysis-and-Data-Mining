{"text": "I know there is a lot of question as to whether or not these are real or not. I can't comment on every pair but I can comment on mine. For 55mm Ray Ban New Wayfarer Polarized the price I paid is very low so I was a bit sceptical. Right out of the packaging I was dissapointed. The silver Ray Ban box they came in was obviuosly used before. The sticker everyone says to look for was pealed off and replaced with a sticker that looked like it came from a home printer. This caused me to run it through every test I could find. After doing that, I have to say I feel they are 100% genuine. ALL the logos are in the right places, the quality is excellent, did the polarization test and they are polarized. Did the sunlight/camera test and saw the metal rod running through the arms. The actual Ray Ban case, book and cleaning cloth passed all quality tests. This review loses one star because the box should have been new with an original Ray Ban sticker and another star because there is a small scratch on the top of the sunglasses. It's not a large enough scratch for me to go through the trouble of returning and getting another but, come on, right out of the box they should be flawless. Not sure why they weren't.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11984548", "1": "0.17332238", "2": "0.082463846", "3": "0.22585297", "4": "0.23888767", "6": "0.15715243"}}
