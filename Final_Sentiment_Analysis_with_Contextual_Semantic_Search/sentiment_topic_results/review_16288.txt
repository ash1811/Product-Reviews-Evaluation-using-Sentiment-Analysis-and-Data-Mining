{"text": "These slippers are warm, comfortable, and sturdy.  You can walk around your yard in them.  They do not scuff easily.  They look nice.  They do not get stinky if you happen to sweat in them (so far).  You will not notice you have them on.  They fit well--not tight or too loose, but just snug enough to slip them on and off easily.  I bought a size .5 up from what I would in sneakers.  They feel perfect with a good thick sock.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10365063", "1": "0.43656382", "2": "0.08688712", "4": "0.07369957", "5": "0.13286656", "6": "0.1626529"}}
