{"text": "These are the best, most comfy after-work/gym slippers ever.  They conform to your feet and feel sooooooooooooooo good after a hard day.  I like that they have an open toe for the summer.  I have medium-to-narrow feet and these fit perfectly b/c of the adjustable velcro strap.  They adjust to much bigger, but if you have big/wide/water-retention feet, I imagine these might not fit.  They're really light on your feet - not heavy AT ALL.  I wish I could wear them 24/7!!  They feel THAT good!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1405773", "1": "0.21897794", "2": "0.11709874", "4": "0.2826322", "5": "0.13278565", "6": "0.10474061"}}
