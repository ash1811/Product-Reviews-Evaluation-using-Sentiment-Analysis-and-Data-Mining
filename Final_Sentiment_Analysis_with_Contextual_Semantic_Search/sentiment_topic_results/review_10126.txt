{"text": "I bought this pendant to match a yellow dress for formal night on a cruise. I'm glad I did because it is beautiful. It was also very affordable, and it arrived well packaged and fast.  The pendent is fairly large. It also has a fairly large silver ring for threading through a necklace. The ring is large but part of the space is taken up by the pendent. The ring goes through a hole in the pendent, just in case someone doesn't notice that in the product picture. The pendent has a type of metalish, colorful material on the back. Probably to help the pendent capture color. This isn't a problem for me but if the pendent flips over then it would be noticeable so the pendent can only be worn one direction. The pendent also appears more yellow then anything else, I haven't worn it yet so I don't know if this will change or not but I read reviews that says it changes to match  the colors reflected by the outfit it is worn with. All in all this is a great deal and I would recommend this item and seller.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1145228", "1": "0.3093134", "2": "0.06427881", "3": "0.09264304", "4": "0.23866111", "5": "0.1071922", "6": "0.07338861"}}
