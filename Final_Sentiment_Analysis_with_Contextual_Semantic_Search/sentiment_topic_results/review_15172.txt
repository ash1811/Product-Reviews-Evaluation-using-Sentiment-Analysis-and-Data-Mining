{"text": "I got it in the Banana Bread Leather (light brown) color. I have medium-to-wide feet, mostly being able to get away with an 8M. After reading all the reviews, I ordered the 8W, and they fit like regular 8Ms. I could imagine how tight they would be if you were a true wide. Even though they fit me, I'm still returning them, because I didn't realize the toes were so pointy. Otherwise, it's a good shoe, solid for its height with good traction.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.34703296", "2": "0.1352174", "3": "0.22589965", "4": "0.039682154", "5": "0.13551281", "6": "0.11360881"}}
