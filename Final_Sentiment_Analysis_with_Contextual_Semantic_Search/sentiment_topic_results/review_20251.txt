{"text": ". . . the answer is 'To Tree'!If you purchase good quality shoes then using shoe trees should be a priority. Even bargain shoes will look better if you use shoe trees. They keep the shape of the shoe intact while the cedar wicks out the moisture that is left in the shoes after you have worn them. The Allen Edmonds Cedar Shoe Trees have always been an excellent quality item. I use them for my MEZLAN Redford Dress Shoes, Mezlan Carmichael Oxfords, Mezlan Spyder Slip-Ons and Hummer Sneakers, as well as, myBite Golf Shoesto name just a few. The A-E shoe trees are all great. Much better than using the plastic handle/wooden shoe trees. I bought a pair from a chain store for my sneakers and after using them twice the handle broke off. That will not happen with these. Try them. You'll see the difference using these shoe trees makes. ~ The Boss", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12383324", "1": "0.16857906", "2": "0.29979166", "3": "0.049878377", "4": "0.042476825", "5": "0.06775716", "6": "0.24768369"}}
