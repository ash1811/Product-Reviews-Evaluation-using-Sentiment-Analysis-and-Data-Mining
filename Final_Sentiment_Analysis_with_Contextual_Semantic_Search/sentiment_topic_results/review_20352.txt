{"text": "I wear these as a PJ top or in summertime when I'm hanging out around the house. At my size, I can't get away with wearing it braless in public but at home, it provides enough support as is.  And with slightly thicker straps & a higher stance than some of the other tanks I've used, I can wear it in public with a bra underneath w/o the bra being really obvious.  In our 120* heat, I can throw on a button front lightweight blouse and be covered & cool.  I like that I can buy them in band/cup sizes as I have a smaller band/larger cup and sm/med/lg sized tanks don't always fit me properly.  I have about 6 of these.  I routinely wear them underneath my workout tank at the fitness club because I have baby with me and he often wants to nurse when I pick him up from the child-care.  I can pull up my workout tank and be fully covered with the nursing tank underneath.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22526036", "1": "0.14508326", "2": "0.069910035", "3": "0.19489166", "4": "0.06588516", "5": "0.14040078", "6": "0.15856874"}}
