{"text": "These are my favourite, most comfy flip flops. I wear these around the house, running errands on weekends or on the beach. I've got size 14 feet, and the slippers fit perfect - true to size! No complaints and will buy another pair as soon as these wear out (which doesn't look like it will happen soon, as they are built solid). Very happy with this purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.31181458", "2": "0.04657154", "3": "0.15498316", "4": "0.07353691", "5": "0.12960452", "6": "0.27959847"}}
