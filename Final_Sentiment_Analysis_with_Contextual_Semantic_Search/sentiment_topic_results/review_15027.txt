{"text": "So happy.  I had two days notice to put together a pirate costume for a member of my family.  One trip to the goodwill to buy over-sized black pants and a billowy shirt was all it took - locally.  However, these boot tops, and the eye patch that I bought on Amazon really made the outfit look authentic.
