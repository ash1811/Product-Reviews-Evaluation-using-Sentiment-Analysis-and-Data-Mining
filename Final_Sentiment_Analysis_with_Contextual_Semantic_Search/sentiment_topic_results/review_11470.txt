{"text": "I purchased these on a gold box whim.  They are larger than I expected, and the rose color is not really discernible.  They look yellow gold to me.Yes, I'll probably keep them and no, I wouldn't recommend them to others.  They are much too large for second ear piercings.  They aren't the style I usually wear.  So far, the backs have securely held them in each ear and the posts are reasonable diameter.  They appear to be adequately made, but don't really look like high quality earrings.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.069426775", "1": "0.42043057", "3": "0.12430973", "4": "0.0793303", "5": "0.12820515", "6": "0.175185"}}
