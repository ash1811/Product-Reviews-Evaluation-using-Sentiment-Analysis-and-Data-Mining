{"text": "I used this amazing cloth on some of my old silver jewelry that I haven't worn in years. The silver was black with tarnish.A few minutes with this cloth and I was wearing my sparkling jewelry again. I cleaned some petite dolphin post earrings first. They have some tiny fins and I was wondering how the cloth would clean delicate hard to reach places. Perfect! that's how.I can't recommend this cloth enough. Worked well on my gem stones set in silver  as well.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1659221", "1": "0.4070048", "2": "0.06393116", "4": "0.07938898", "5": "0.12545873", "6": "0.15529935"}}
