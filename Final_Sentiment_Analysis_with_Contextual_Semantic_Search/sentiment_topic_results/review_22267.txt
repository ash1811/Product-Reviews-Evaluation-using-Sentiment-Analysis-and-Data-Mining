{"text": "These socks are perfect. They fit great and are really comfortable.The quality is good. Nothing special, but definitely not bad at all!They take some time to get used to putting them on, but I don't think it's too much of a hassle. I've read some reviews that make it seem like putting on toesocks is rocket science. But they're just probably impatient, spoiled idiots.This is my third pair. I still have the other two. I liked them so much I wanted more. I agree the price is a bit hot for socks, but what people don't realise is, individual toes are not as easy to make as a regular sock. All in all I'm very satisfied.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.49102148", "3": "0.23406175", "4": "0.068373166", "5": "0.11742926", "6": "0.08449601"}}
