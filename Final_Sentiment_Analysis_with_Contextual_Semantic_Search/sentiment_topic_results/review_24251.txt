{"text": "I am sure that is what Duofold had in mind is a baselayer.I bought two of these based on other reviews,but these are not what I expected.First they run small.Normally I wear a medium,so I bought a large and it is still very tight.So buy accordingly.Second,I bought these to wear under my work shirts as I am in and out all day long...make note,if the fabric gets cold,so do you.It is early fall here and the lowest temp I have encountered is 40 degrees.I went outside wearing this under my work shirt,the fabric got cold,so naturally so did I.Obviously I did not use the product correctly,as I believe under other layers and a winter jacket,it would probably help a great deal.For my needs,I'll just head back to the old fashioned waffle type long undershirt.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21812572", "1": "0.2171257", "2": "0.22650215", "3": "0.14011398", "5": "0.14327197", "6": "0.052424844"}}
