{"text": "I purchased these slippers based on all the rave reviews.  Also, I checked the UGG website to confirm that Orva Stores was an authorized retailer.  When I opened the box, they seemed fine.  They are comfy and cozy.  However, when I saw the box insert about how to check authenticity of the shoe, of course I had to check.  There is a QR code tag sewn into the left shoe.  It also has a line of stars that are suppose to turn from black to white when you turn the tag 90 degrees.  There is also a QR code tag on the outside of the box.  I scanned the code on the \"box\" and it took me directly to the UGG website saying it was authentic.  I then checked the tag inside the shoe, and noticed that the numbers/letters beside the QR code did not coincide with the numbers beside the code on the box.  This made me a little suspicious.  I then scanned the code inside the shoe...and it came up as an invalid scan.  I thought maybe it was a fluke, so not only did I scan it again...but tried 3 different QR code scan apps and they all came out the same.  Invalid.  I have a problem with paying full price for a product that isn't authentic.  If they had been priced at say even $50, I would have been fine.  However, I contacted Amazon.com and they are issuing me a full refund based on my description of the problem.  All I can say is...buyer beware.  If you want authenticity...it's usually best to go straight to the source...or a well known retailer such as Belk, Dillards, REI, etc.PLEASE NOTE:  According to the purchase process, it says that it is sold by Orva Stores, but shipped from Amazon...so there is not way to know exactly where the unauthentic product came from.  It could have come from the Amazon Warehouse...unknowingly to either party.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13606529", "1": "0.19097508", "2": "0.153093", "3": "0.09044134", "4": "0.22083028", "5": "0.11782403", "6": "0.09077097"}}
