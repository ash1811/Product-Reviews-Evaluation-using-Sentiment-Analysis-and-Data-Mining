{"text": "I am a 44DDD, i did buy a 46 DD and this bra fits perfect! I havent been able to run on a treadmil in years due to my large size and with this bra I can. It is a lil scratchy with the first wear but does get softer as you wash it. This is by far the best sports bra I have ever had. It does not give you the 'uni' boob look! I love it and will be buying more!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16086699", "1": "0.2869417", "3": "0.29184505", "4": "0.04089564", "5": "0.062290456", "6": "0.15348992"}}
