{"text": "These socks are great. They're are very comfortable. I know these are advertised for hiking, but I have worn them with 2 inch heeled boots before and they're great. My feet would normally start hurting after walking for a long time in those boots, but with these socks on, my feet don't hurt at all. It's amazing. These socks really do what they say they do. I would order another pair.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19564961", "1": "0.14718533", "4": "0.30320802", "5": "0.15222347", "6": "0.1941917"}}
