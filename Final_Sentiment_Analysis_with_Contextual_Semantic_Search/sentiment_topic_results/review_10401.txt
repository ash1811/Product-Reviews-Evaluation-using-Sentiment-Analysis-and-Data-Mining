{"text": "I ordered this short boot to keep my feet and ankles warm in the house this winter. They are wonderfully comfortable and warm, and I wear them all day and evening if I'm home, and never get cold feet. I wear a size 7 shoe, but I have discovered that it is important to order down one or two sizes with UGGs.  So this pair is size 6, and I wear them with socks.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22388785", "1": "0.22478053", "2": "0.056700476", "3": "0.3069783", "4": "0.09202196", "5": "0.09185729"}}
