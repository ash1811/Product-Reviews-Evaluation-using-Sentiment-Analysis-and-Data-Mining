{"text": "This is my first pair of Izod jeans. The sizing was perfect and the quality seems good. I wish they were a little tighter in the legs, but I am skinny. I tried washing them in hot water and then tried them on high heat, but they didn't shrink a bit, so I would say they are preshrunk. I will be buying more of these jeans.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.32509944", "2": "0.2093911", "3": "0.27350453", "4": "0.09776379", "6": "0.08434059"}}
