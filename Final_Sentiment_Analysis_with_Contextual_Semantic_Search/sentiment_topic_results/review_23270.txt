{"text": "This bra does not hold its shape and becomes fairly uncomfortable after only a few washes, with the racerback pulling your shoulders in.  Perhaps buying a size up would fix the problem, but that means having to purchase two bras for the use of one, which as far as I'm concerned is not worth it.  If you're looking for a great nursing sleep bra, splurge a little and get something like the Belabumbum, which is much better quality and fit.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.33022112", "2": "0.0960093", "3": "0.28916022", "5": "0.0644511", "6": "0.21362275"}}
