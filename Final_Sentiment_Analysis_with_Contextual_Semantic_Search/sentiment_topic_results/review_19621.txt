{"text": "This is a pretty good costume for the price. The coat was actually surprisingly sturdy. The only problem I had with the costume is that through the course of the night, I had a few of the dreadlocks fall off of the bandana, but that's not that big of a deal (in DC, we have plenty of &#34;tumble-weaves&#34; anyway). The boot coverings didn't fit the very best, but I still rocked a great Jack Sparrow look all night.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11976895", "1": "0.43785155", "2": "0.08769416", "3": "0.19142713", "4": "0.06963279", "5": "0.08954019"}}
