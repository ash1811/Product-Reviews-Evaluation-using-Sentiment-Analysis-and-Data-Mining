{"text": "I could not believe how many people rated this item favorably.  I was shocked when I opened it.  It is such poor quality that I can't even believe they are charging fifteen bucks for it.  It's worth about three, and I bet you could find it in any Chinatown for that.  Probably even better for three bucks!It is extremely small too.  The zippers are poor quality, and the stitching that holds the ring guard and button on look like they are about to fall off...very poorly made.  Even the embroidery is horrendous.My mom gave me one of these years ago that puts this one to shame.  I saw one in The Met catalog, I think I'll head over to their site and see if it's on sale.At any rate, I am gonna keep looking, and return this junk.  A pillowcase would be better than this!EDIT:  looked online at The Met in NYC, and they had one on a post-holiday sale.  It was twice as much money as this one, but a thousand times nicer.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11767146", "1": "0.3290222", "2": "0.20373006", "3": "0.10719098", "4": "0.0933303", "5": "0.03323796", "6": "0.11581704"}}
