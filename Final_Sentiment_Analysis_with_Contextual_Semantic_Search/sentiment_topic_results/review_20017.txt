{"text": "I'm on the small (but not petite) side & have had trouble finding a backpack that fits AND provides the kind of storage I'm looking for.  Love the side pockets for bottles.  Small top pocket for ear phones, iPod, etc.  A main compartment that is large and expandable (to a degree).  A fantastic fit -- the shoulder straps are comfortable and strong. VERY well made.  Highly recommend.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.033946887", "1": "0.35143828", "2": "0.21756218", "3": "0.07462433", "4": "0.097106054", "5": "0.10881681", "6": "0.11650544"}}
