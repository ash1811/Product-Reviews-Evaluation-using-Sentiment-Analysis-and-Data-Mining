{"text": "We ordered several different colors and patterns, all by Rothco. The others were thin but serviceable, and we should have expected that the low price would reflect the quality; but the black one is worthless. After being worn once, and washed once, the edges began to unravel. I suppose it is better than using, say, a paper towel or maybe a brown paper sack but never again will we order anything like this from Rothco.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2746444", "1": "0.26969132", "2": "0.3053069", "6": "0.13985516"}}
