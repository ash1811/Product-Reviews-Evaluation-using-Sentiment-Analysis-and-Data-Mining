{"text": "My teen kids have been Chaco nuts for years....and I stayed with my exisiting choices.  I had a foot surgery from a stupid accident last year and the Dr. recommended Crocs.  They were wonderful and really helped my healing...but spoiled me so I couldn't go back to my old favorite line of sandal/shoe things.  Crocs are great...but the family really hated it when I wore them past the driveway, ha!This year the kids and wfie decided I needed to try the Chacos.  I finally gave in and did a LOT of reading online about these.  The passion and loyalty were impressive...and the benefits to the feet seemed like a given considering the great arch and overall design.  An added plus was the fact I could wear them doing any of my favorite outdoor activities - hiking, biking, fishing, canoeing, kayaking, or even wet wading.  I was sorta hoping they would feel &#34;ok&#34; and I could have a shoe/sandal cross that I liked and my family liked.I have to say....they FAR surpassed any hopes that I had!  They are simply amazing.  I stand corrected....I will have to sell off my spare boxes of K**n's....I think my feet have found their perfect match!  Heck, I am many times found asleep in my chair with them still on!  I literally forget they are there.My feet are happy and my legs, knees, and small of my back feel great again - even after a long day of standing on concrete or tiled floors.  They are great in the woods....amazing in the canoe/kayak and I am going to have that reverse Z &#34;Chaco Tan&#34; I am sure before long.I'm way late (20 years?) to this Chaco party...but I get it.  Finally.  the great news is that I have many decades more to enjoy them.oh yes...this &#34;shoal&#34; color....it looks a lot more brown on the web...it's actually more of a green stripe....I wish they were more muted...but they aren't garish at all - the family wouldn't let me send them back, they like the color.  Besides....like they said...after awhile of me getting them muddy and time in the sun...they will fade more anyway. lol.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21508242", "1": "0.110457115", "2": "0.028390136", "3": "0.264759", "4": "0.051738147", "5": "0.32743263"}}
