{"text": "At the time of this review, I am active duty army.  I bought these to replace some of my FRACU and regular issue ACUs.  The fit is similar if not the same as standard issue.  The color and material are exactly the same as standard issue ACUs.  These fit well and feel that they may even wear better than the standard issue ACUs or the ACUs you can purchase at clothing and sales.  These do have the buttons on the larger pockets.  The velcro on the pockets was a pretty bad idea to start.All in all these are a great replacement for ACUs if you happen to be looking for a similar price or cheaper ACU replacement.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2971919", "1": "0.23932467", "2": "0.07449624", "3": "0.027748033", "4": "0.07245391", "5": "0.11276562", "6": "0.17601967"}}
