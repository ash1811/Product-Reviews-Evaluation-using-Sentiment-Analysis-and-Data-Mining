{"text": "I was looking for some cute little stud earrings and I came across these.  They had good reviews and the price was pretty good too.  The only thing I was worried about was how they looked in the picture and a lot of people were saying they were extremely tiny.  I was very pleased once I got them; they look a lot better in person and aren't as small as I thought which is good but still tiny which is also good :) They are adorable and I love them!  Not to mention I received these extremely fast! Thumbs up, I recommend these.  I am not considering piercings my ears a second time because these would like great in the second hole.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20378771", "1": "0.29593766", "2": "0.1177676", "3": "0.2104247", "4": "0.10542411", "6": "0.06414092"}}
