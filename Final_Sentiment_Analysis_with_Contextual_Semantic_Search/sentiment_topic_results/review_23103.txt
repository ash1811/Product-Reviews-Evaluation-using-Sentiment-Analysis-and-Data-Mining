{"text": "If you are looking at these boots, you probably did what I was doing....drooling!  I bought the chocolate brown ones about two months ago after a lot of research and reading everything I could from current owners.  Everything you read about these boots are right on the money.  I do suggest getting your normal size....I just got lucky because my size is the smallest that they carried.  I love these boots so much that on my amazon wish list is a pair of black ones.  Hopefully my wife is paying attention!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.043810237", "1": "0.23760948", "2": "0.19172564", "3": "0.052227747", "4": "0.26308042", "5": "0.088918544", "6": "0.122627966"}}
