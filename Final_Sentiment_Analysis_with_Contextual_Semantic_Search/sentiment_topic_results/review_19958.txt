{"text": "I am not a student. I have four children, but don't need a diaper bag anymore. I just wanted a cute backpack to travel overseas with, and also to use in my daily life as a file cabinet as we plan a move to Japan. I have use it for travel as well as daily so far. I landed on this pack after a whole bunch of gandering on the Internet. It is such a low price at Amazon, I was a tad concerned it might be a weak product, or not well made. I am glad to report I was wrong in those concerns. It, well...rocks & could hold rocks!It is very well made, has a bunch of compartments to include a padded laptop section, and the zippers are QUALITY! I was so happy with this I bought my daughter one also. I am considering purchasing more for my other daughters as well.The super fun patterns just add to the charm of this, and will help distinguish my pack on a plane or in the library from all the bland solid neutral toned ones. Don't hesitate to purchase, fantastic product.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.094564095", "1": "0.3124706", "2": "0.12106318", "3": "0.09548834", "4": "0.15797624", "5": "0.15314811", "6": "0.06528942"}}
