{"text": "bought for a 6 yr old based on the reviews on how small this bag is. It is not very small and too large (wide and long) for a large 6 yr old. The bag does seem a bit flimsy (esp. the organizer pocket material) and does not hold its shape that well. Good straps, vibrant colors, zippers zip all the way down so you can access the bottom of the bag easily and the reflective tape is a nice safety feature. Many pockets and pockets in pockets, which my child loves...I personally don't care for that many pockets.OVERALL: A good bag for the price, but you could probably get something similar at a discount box store at the same price point or less.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07170457", "1": "0.48893362", "2": "0.04679278", "3": "0.16791587", "4": "0.13723244", "5": "0.060308646", "6": "0.027112087"}}
