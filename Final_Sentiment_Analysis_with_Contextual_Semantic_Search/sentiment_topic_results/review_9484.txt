{"text": "The costume is great,ESPECIALLY for the price and WITH prime shipping I was amazed. I was skeptical initially thinking that the price was too good to be true and the costume would be garbage when I got it. Not so! I was pleasantly surprised. The costume comes as shown with all of the ties,mask,hood,tunic and pants.The ONLY reason it gets 4 stars is because I don't feel the design of the product was considered by the manufacturer. The fabric is the issue with this costume. Firstly,Halloween costumes are made and sold with the intention that they will be worn in late October,yet the fabric is light and thin a polyester or a nylon. Why do costume manufacturers want our kids to freeze?! Sure,they can layer but kids growl about that as it takes away from the costume and often even forces a parent to cover the costume. Thicker fabric or a lining should be used. Now the second issue which is a bit more situational but an issue all the same...I don't know how to word this in a way that comes across informative instead of inappropriate so here it goes..my 6 year old son tried the costume on as soon as we received it because I was concerned about fit and wanted to allow time to exchange sizes if we needed to before Halloween. As it stood I was already ordering a size up as Halloween costumes usually fit small due to cheap fabric and country of origin. There was a VERY large,noticeable bulge in the pants. This fabric clings and can be obscene. Fortunately for us the tunic is almost to the knees so my son can wear it. Parents concerned about this should definitely grab a larger size even if that means the pants will need hemming ( an alterations place can do it for less than $10) you NEED to allow room in the tunic otherwise it can be &#34;too much&#34;.Hope this helps.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.28819132", "1": "0.12429682", "2": "0.22798188", "3": "0.07691273", "4": "0.08499157", "5": "0.11752952", "6": "0.0800962"}}
