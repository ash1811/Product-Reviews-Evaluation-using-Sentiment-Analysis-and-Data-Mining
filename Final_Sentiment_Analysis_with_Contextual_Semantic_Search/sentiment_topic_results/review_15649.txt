{"text": "At first I was going to get a size small for my 5 year old cause she wears size 6 clothes but realized the size chart that it wouldn't probably fit her. So went with a medium (size 8-10) and it fits just right. So make sure you look at the size chart before you get a size that you think would fit your little one! It isn't sized the same way regular clothes do for kids! I wish it was a little bit bigger for my daughter so she can fit it a long time and play dress up with it after halloween but it looks like she will grow out of it fast since it just fits her now. Usually halloween costumes do end up a little bigger but not this one! In all though the material is great and it could fit over my daughters clothes if it is cold for halloween by us. And yes I also can see the boots end up sliding down a lot but I could deal with that! She is very happy with it and excited to wear it! She even wants me to get the adult costume like this so we can match lol! But we will see if I even have any money by then for it!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07671638", "1": "0.34866259", "2": "0.103514984", "3": "0.42998776", "5": "0.036340345"}}
