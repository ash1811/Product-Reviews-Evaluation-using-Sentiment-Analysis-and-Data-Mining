{"text": "I wear a 10.5 in most of my shoes and I bought the same for this product 10.5 D US size.  The shoes fit very well and are of nice quality. This is my first pare of Merrell's brand and so far I'm impressed. I like the design and utility of these shoes and they come in a color and design that is not scarey to the eyes like many of today's shoe products. Well made, good design and good product. I will buy again without hesitation. I don't much care for the little loops at the rear of the shoe, but that's just my personal preference, one can simply cut them off.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.101561606", "1": "0.31989592", "2": "0.23793083", "3": "0.14785649", "4": "0.099999964", "5": "0.09024308"}}
