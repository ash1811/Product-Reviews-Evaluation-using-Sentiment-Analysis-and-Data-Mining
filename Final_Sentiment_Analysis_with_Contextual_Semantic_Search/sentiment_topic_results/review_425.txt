{"text": "Sizing runs a bit small, unlike the hi-cut version with thin waistband that I just love. The lavender like violet color is very nice. Wish it was availiable in the hi-cut, slightly sheerer version. The leg elastic was a bit tight at first, but loosened up after a couple of wear/wash cycles. I like nylon briefs the best, as long as they have a cotton crotch. Will order more in the next size up when these wear out.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.066770375", "1": "0.4942447", "3": "0.13379356", "4": "0.041685287", "5": "0.050930046", "6": "0.20921367"}}
