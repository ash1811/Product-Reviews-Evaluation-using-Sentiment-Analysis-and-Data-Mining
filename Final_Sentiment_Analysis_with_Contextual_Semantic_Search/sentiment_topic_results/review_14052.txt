{"text": "Despite being affectionately known by it's owners as 'the tuna can', this watch is awesome -- easy to read dial, the dial glows quite brightly in the dark, the crystal has a magnifier effect to make dial readings even easier, the weight is substantial but not overbearing, and the size is also substantial but classy in design. The watch keeps great time, has a screw-down crown for water tightness, and has a uni-rotating bezel as any proper diving watch should. I am not a fan of resin bands, so after doing a little homework I stumbled upon this site -- do a search for suppa parts -- the URL got removed by Amazon. They make and sell watch-case attachments for using normal 24 mm watch bands with this model, as well as some nicely made leather bands. Their stuff isn't cheap, but it is very nicely made. I purchased a dark brown leather band for mine, and I have to say the look is killer. Of course I will need to change the band back to the resin one prior to taking it in the water, but I'll deal with it. The Eco-Drive works very well -- I had the watch stored in a watch case for 3 months at one point, and it held a charge with no problems. In fact, it may have been able to charge itself off of room light to some degree since my watch case has a glass top. The watch is masculine, but understated in it's styling, which is what I like. It appears to be extremely well made, and should last a long time of real-world use. I also own some high-quality watches (Heuer, Omega, Longenes), so I feel qualified to make this statement. Go ahead -- treat yourself. Highly recommended.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1655493", "1": "0.07370766", "2": "0.14305168", "3": "0.16888107", "4": "0.14289571", "5": "0.14515853", "6": "0.16075608"}}
