{"text": "I would quickly and honestly recommend these pants for quality- yet economically-minded shoppers. The price was great and the jeans are not cheaply made. I was pleasantly surprised at the fit as well. They are not too baggy or tight, and the length is right...they seem to be true-fit to size. The color was a deep, smooth and even black as well....not that cheap flimsy greyish black dye job you often see on lesser quality pants. I was happy with this purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06693547", "1": "0.48060095", "2": "0.18095002", "3": "0.10653162", "4": "0.09489827", "5": "0.033421583", "6": "0.036662105"}}
