{"text": "This backpack has its share of annoyances, but it's pretty sturdy.On the plus side:- It's durable. It never frayed after bringing it back and forth on the subway to work every day, and now my son uses it for school.- It holds a lot. It has four pockets and you can really stuff a lot into each one.On the minus side:- The side strap blocks the zipper. This sounds minor, but when you're opening it a lot, it's annoying. The side strap gets in your way and you have to maneuver around it every time you open the thing.- The straps don't quite adjust right. I could never get it to the point where the thing felt fully comfortable on my back. It would rest against my lower back too much. I finally just adjusted the straps to be very tight, which made it a pain to take off and put on.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09632404", "1": "0.14345612", "2": "0.2933274", "3": "0.060207333", "5": "0.223615", "6": "0.18075015"}}
