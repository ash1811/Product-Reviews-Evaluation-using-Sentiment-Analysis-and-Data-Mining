{"text": "I have had 5-6 casio dive and g shock watches since 83, I fell in love with the G shocks, but when my last one died ( DW 6600) Casio discontinued it, and I wanted something the same but lighter, and the DW 290 fits my needs, and the price was great. I would recommend this watch for anyone who wants something sporty,waterproof, durable, dependable, and wont get knicked up. I know this one is not quite as tough as my Gshocks, so as a result I always keep that in mind as to how I treat it. But I dont baby it either. For $26 and free shipping, you cant go wrong. I have had it 9 months so far and it works excellent. When I need a battery, Walmart has them for $3 , including changing it for me (no charge).  Casio makes alot fancier ones than this, but I bought this one on purpose, because it has exactly what I need and no more. I am very happy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.20280202", "2": "0.22866127", "3": "0.030495886", "4": "0.18694693", "5": "0.1153321", "6": "0.2335572"}}
