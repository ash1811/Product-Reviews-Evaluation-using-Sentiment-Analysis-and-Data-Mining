{"text": "Gave these as a gift and the recipient was surprised at how \"dainty\" they were.  More importantly, they arrived broken, so she returned them and received credit because they were no longer in stock.  I see that they are now available, but would not order them again because of the description I received from the recipient.  She did love my 5x7mm swiss blue topaz earrings in white gold so I thought these would be an even more beautiful and elegant gift.  I was wrong and wish I'd sent her the same as mine.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.41956174", "1": "0.19987972", "2": "0.04366461", "4": "0.10140761", "5": "0.123790175", "6": "0.10819492"}}
