{"text": "First of all, I have to say that in general I LOVE THE DREAM TISHA.I'm a chesty 34 DD/E.  Trying to find a bra at a dept. store/Kohls when you're larger than a C cup is an exercise in futility, Platex type bras are waaay to flimsy.Le Mystere is the first brand I've found that will do the job - and normally does it well.  Holds me up, holds me in place.  I don't feel like I'm bouncing all over the place when I move and my breasts are not hanging towards my knees!Why 3 stars?I just had to return my last bra because the cups were a funny shape.  They're molded, so your chest takes on the shape of the bra;  normally a nice rounded look.  These cups were pointed much like the styles from the 50s or 60s.  I put it on and looked like \"Pandora Peaks\", definitely NOT cool under a tee-shirt.  I'm glad it wasn't my first Le Mystere or I would never order another.  I'll return this one (sigh) and hope for better luck on the next.(smaller chested ladies -- A or B cup, may not like the Le Mystere as much, it's pretty hefty.  Some of the other styles might be better suited to larger cup sizes.)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04117876", "1": "0.18308589", "2": "0.08677801", "3": "0.31776705", "4": "0.14200073", "5": "0.099921905", "6": "0.12926763"}}
