{"text": "Works fine, keeps great time but wish it ran longer overnight as sometimes it does not make it through the night without stopping(if I get up late). Looks and feel great. I polished it up with a jeweler's cloth  and it looks as shiny as a new Rolex. Took me a while to get the packing and plastic off it as it was very well protected in shipping. Totally pleased.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17633365", "1": "0.25002536", "2": "0.22841495", "3": "0.108943254", "4": "0.1348199", "6": "0.097484276"}}
