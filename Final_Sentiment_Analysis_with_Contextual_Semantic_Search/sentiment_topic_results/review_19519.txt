{"text": "First of all, there is zero flexibility when walking. Secondly, they are too heavy to not have flexibility. Finally, there is zero cushioning. I can't see what anyone likes about this shoe except its looks (which is why I gave it 2 stars). I would definitely buy this shoe in the future if Skechers made them more comfortable and flexible. I hope to see this change as I really think they are cute. Please, Skechers!
