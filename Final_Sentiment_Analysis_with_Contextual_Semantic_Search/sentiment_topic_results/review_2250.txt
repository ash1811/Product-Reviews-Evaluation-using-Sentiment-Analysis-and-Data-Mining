{"text": "My shoes arrived yesterday, and there were some scuffs on the toes and a gouge on the back of one. The right shoe had a mark in it that looked like a wide felt tip pen had glanced across it, and upon further inspection was likely to be an area of excess dye. I requested a return.So why four stars a out of five for a returned item? The shoes look very well made, as were the pair I had several years ago. This model feels like they were made for my feet, and nothing else has ever come close. All in all they are great shoes.I suppose these had been on display somewhere for a while, and that might explain the relatively low price. The size was good, the feel was incredible. The issue doesn't seem to be a Mephisto problem, so I am not going to dock but one star.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12248735", "1": "0.24434663", "2": "0.32753664", "3": "0.039820217", "4": "0.1159065", "5": "0.05969362", "6": "0.09020902"}}
