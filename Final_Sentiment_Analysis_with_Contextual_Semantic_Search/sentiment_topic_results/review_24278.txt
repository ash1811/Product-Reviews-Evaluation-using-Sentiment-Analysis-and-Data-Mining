{"text": "i always read a fair amount of the reviews before i buy an item like this, and the majority of them said that the sizing was too small. i did not have that issue. i generally wear a XXL, sometimes a XXXL. i was a little nervouse when i ordered this in a XXL tall because a lot of people said its fitted small. not the case at all. it fits perfect and maybe even a little big, which will be nice for layering. it might be the smaller sized jackets are smaller then usual, but it seems the bigger sized ones are fine.its nice and warm, but i have not yet had the chance to put it fully to the test", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13956137", "1": "0.27946866", "2": "0.14495778", "3": "0.23733766", "5": "0.068644255", "6": "0.12751657"}}
