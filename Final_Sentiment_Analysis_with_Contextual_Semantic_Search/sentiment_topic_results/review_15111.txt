{"text": "I love the initial comfort of these shoes when I first put my feet in them. They feel like the most cushiony pair of slippers. However, when I stand in them or walk, my ankles pronate inward. There is absolutely no support for someone who has this problem. I have very high arches and this is probably why my feet pronate. Beware of this shoe if you have this problem. My feet ache bad after walking in these for a while.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.10314312", "2": "0.24786328", "3": "0.17399785", "4": "0.23076555", "5": "0.13348708", "6": "0.10687244"}}
