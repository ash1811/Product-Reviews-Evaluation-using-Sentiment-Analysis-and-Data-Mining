{"text": "Casio F-91W. Easy and intuitive to set up, has stopwatch, light, 24hr and 12hr time, month, date, day, alarm, it's light, it's inexpensive (got mine for ten bones)... but not a cheap piece of cr@p.It doesn't have year or daylight savings time or time zone or calc or games and the band is simple plastic, not particularly comfortable or uncomfortable. It is what it is and it's pretty nice for what it is. Stainless steel back. If CVS or Longs even bothered to sell stuff like this anymore it would probably be about thirty bucks.

No problem, watch is fine.Made in Thailand.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15333581", "1": "0.19031356", "2": "0.08857298", "3": "0.11904084", "4": "0.2722859", "5": "0.0277436", "6": "0.14870727"}}
