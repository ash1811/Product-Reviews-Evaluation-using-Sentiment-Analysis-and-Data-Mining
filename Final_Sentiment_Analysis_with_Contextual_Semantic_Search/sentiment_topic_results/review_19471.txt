{"text": "I used to have a pair of Naturalizer mules like this, the previous model. I wore them until they basically fell apart and was hoping that this pair would replace them. These are beautiful shoes that seem really comfy, but unfortunately I had to return them because they are not as wide as the previous model and thus were too narrow for my foot. If you have a narrow foot, these make a great buy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10181319", "1": "0.35300648", "2": "0.1660951", "4": "0.12533489", "5": "0.1067117", "6": "0.14303736"}}
