{"text": "I've bought and had several watched but this one ads nice function and style. its a little bit weird how the strap won't fold flat but the watch is amazing. ok so temperature seems a little off but i cant be for sure because i don't have a thermometer just a thermostat. world time zones works great for me and the text can be difficult to read but it works fine for me. the auto illuminator is a nice feature as well. be sure to buy a watch link remover to size it just right for yourself.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.02486877", "1": "0.30343637", "2": "0.27232397", "3": "0.19231047", "4": "0.15016286", "6": "0.05401009"}}
