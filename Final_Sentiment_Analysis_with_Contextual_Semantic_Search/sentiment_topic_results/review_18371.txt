{"text": "This is the second of this model watch that I've had. The first was stolen. Anyway these are extremely reliable and they look great.  The only maintenance you need to worry about is adjusting the date every month. You never need to worry about batteries because ANY light source powers it.If you are in a heavy duty job (like construction) I would recommend stainless steel over titanium. You cannot beat this watch for the money.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.16304502", "2": "0.13205577", "3": "0.19682698", "4": "0.14343347", "5": "0.09700337", "6": "0.26422232"}}
