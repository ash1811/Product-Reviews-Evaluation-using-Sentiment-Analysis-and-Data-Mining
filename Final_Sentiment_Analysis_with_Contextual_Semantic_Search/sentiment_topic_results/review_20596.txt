{"text": "If I were a watch repairman or a jeweler I'd get a better built tool but for home use and at such a low price I'd say this works just fine. It's metal and adjusts easily. For the price of the tool and one battery you actually save money over going to a jeweler and having them change the battery once. It comes in a cheap wooden box with four optional size bits to fit different watch covers.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10771244", "1": "0.27897197", "2": "0.3014629", "4": "0.08505898", "5": "0.14104165", "6": "0.08249005"}}
