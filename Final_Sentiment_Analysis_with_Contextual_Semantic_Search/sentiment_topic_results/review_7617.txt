{"text": "These panties are very comfortable and fit well.  They have that \"barely there\" feeling.  I'm 7 months pregnant and bought these to wear during the last trimester and also post-partum.  My only issue is they are indeed thin, which makes them more comfortable, but I would like the crotch and stitching in the crotch area to be a little thicker.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19194381", "1": "0.54624605", "2": "0.05553596", "3": "0.07692662", "4": "0.05359517", "5": "0.07113553"}}
