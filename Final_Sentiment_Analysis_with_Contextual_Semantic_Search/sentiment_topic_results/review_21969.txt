{"text": "I was very disappointed with this item. I was expecting some overly rugged work flannel but what I received was a very low quality product. I doubt the shirt is made from 9 ounce cotton as advertised. It doesn't feel the least bit rugged nor is the durability to be taken seriously....more like flannels you see in walmart for a lot less.Made in china.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04345114", "1": "0.10245931", "2": "0.20504871", "3": "0.22945772", "4": "0.108798936", "5": "0.12375758", "6": "0.18702662"}}
