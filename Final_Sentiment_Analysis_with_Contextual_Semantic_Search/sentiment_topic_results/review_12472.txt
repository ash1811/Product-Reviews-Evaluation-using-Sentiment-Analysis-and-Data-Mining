{"text": "I found these shoes to be comfortable enough to wear outside of my Yoga class. The material is just like wearing your yoga mat and I almost forgot I was wearing them (well, not really). The price was right and the quality was better than I expected. The orange color (which I purchased) is a bit bright, so I will keep to wearing these in the summer and spring only.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.058409806", "1": "0.62699556", "2": "0.15126514", "3": "0.09192956", "5": "0.063222475"}}
