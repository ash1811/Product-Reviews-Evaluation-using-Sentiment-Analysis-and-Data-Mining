{"text": "This is a bra that every girl should at least have own one at some point of time.  It's extremely sexy because it's a sheer bra without any padding.  Yet, I think it provides adequate support because the material is not stretchy and does indeed \"holds up\".The lace is extremely cute, though it's probably best fitted for girls 30 and younger.  And because of that, I actually would advice younger girls to own a bra like this just for the experience.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08968767", "1": "0.23310089", "2": "0.05189101", "3": "0.19323486", "4": "0.18227865", "5": "0.19728146", "6": "0.052525494"}}
