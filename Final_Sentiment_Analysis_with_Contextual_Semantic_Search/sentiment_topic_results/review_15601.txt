{"text": "I bought this sandal for my active 4 year old with the hopes it will be less smelly than a similar pair I bought from Oshkosh.  I bought a size larger first, but they were too baggy/large. There is no toggle/bungee adjust for this pair, unlike the h2 model.  I was very satisfied for the price- buying in February meant they were about 60% less than retail! We ordered both the black and the tan, and both are slick &#34;leatherish&#34; and more attractive than the cloth/canvas of Keen h2s. Both look like they can be hosed off as easily as crocs. They also look tidy enough to wear with his Easter outfit. I am very pleased with this purchase and I will stalk this model in future for clearance/secret sales!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2611032", "1": "0.09873495", "2": "0.0829861", "3": "0.1325055", "4": "0.07846969", "5": "0.08429416", "6": "0.2619064"}}
