{"text": "This is a very attractive ,thin, and lightweight  watch with an unusual fold-over clasp that holds the metal mesh braclet together. I have worn the watch four times. Each time the clasp has opened up and the watch has fallen to the ground. I have had the watch longer than 30 days so Amazon will not give me a full refund.One of these days it will fall off and disappear.02 02 2011*************UPDATE************Since I am stuck with this watch, I worked harder to see if I could get the clasp to work better. I did.The main issue seems to be getting the inner clasp locked properly. Unfortuneately, every thing is the same color ( black) and it is difficult to see the prongs and the small bar that they fit over. My new process is to lay my arm on a desk under a strong light so that I can see the prongs and the bar and then seat them correctly. After that, close the outer clasp. A bit of a nusance and impossible without the strong light.Nice looking watch though.03/09/2011************ another update***********watch fell off again. This time inside my sleeve. Be careful with the clasp !05/10/2011", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17010911", "1": "0.11824178", "2": "0.2424382", "3": "0.05440263", "4": "0.18766071", "5": "0.13349776", "6": "0.09364983"}}
