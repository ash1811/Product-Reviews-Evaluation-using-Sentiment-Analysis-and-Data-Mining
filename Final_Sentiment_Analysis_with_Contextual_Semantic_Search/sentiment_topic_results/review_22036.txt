{"text": "I just received my gascans yesterday, and they are great. The fit and finish are excellent, and if you have a medium to large noggin, this style is for you. The lenses are crisp and clear, and I like how the arms \"lock\" in place. The glasses come with the standard pouch for storage. I highly recommend this style for lounging by the pool, or to look good out on the town. The gascans are not made for sports, and will not stay on your face for any sort of workout. There are other styles for sports.I have the polished black with grey lenses, and they are awesome. I got mine for $55 w/free shipping. These same glasses are $140 in the malls. A+ all the way. I can't comment on durability yet, but I will come back in a few months to update on how they hold up.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20926116", "1": "0.30938038", "2": "0.17694388", "4": "0.06692627", "5": "0.18380724", "6": "0.05102423"}}
