{"text": "I bought this in January of 08 and the face glass is very badly scratched up from careful wearing. Just a slight brushing on a door, table or any object puts scratches on it and after a while it gets where you can't see the time without the scratches getting in the way. The little strap piece that you slide the extra end of the band into broke off too. Other then that the watch is great and works well. I decided to replace it with a G-Shock because of the inset face design to prevent scratches.
