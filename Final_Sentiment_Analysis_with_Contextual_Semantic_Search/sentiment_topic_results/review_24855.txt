{"text": "I just got my slippers.  They are running a bit small for me because I like to wear socks with them.  I will keep this pair and use them for summer and spring when I don't wear socks.  I just ordered another pair a size larger which will work great with socks.  I like these slippers because of the hard sole.  My foot has been broken 3 times and requires hard soles for walking.  The insides are soft and cozy and feel really good on bare feet.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12643558", "1": "0.23820291", "3": "0.16781846", "4": "0.11086509", "5": "0.24974637", "6": "0.10374927"}}
