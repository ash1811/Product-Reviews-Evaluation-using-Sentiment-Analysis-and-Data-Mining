{"text": "I have 2 pairs now. Your only question: is it worth the money? No, probably not. From what I can tell, the folks who need and enjoy these are people who hike or do construction or who are outdoors types, or those who need some extra padding. I have Epidermolysis Bullosa, a blistering disease mostly affecting the hands and feet. I haven't done anything crazy like walk miles in them (I can't do that), but as far as casual wearing they are a real comfort and offer plenty of protection and padding. Also good to keep warm. Would the extra layers still allow your feet to breath in the summer? I'm not sure yet - we will have to wait and see (EB folks need padding but it also has to breath - heat and friction directly cause our blisters).", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.05542595", "1": "0.23080131", "2": "0.10542194", "3": "0.12449497", "4": "0.144266", "5": "0.21219335", "6": "0.12739651"}}
