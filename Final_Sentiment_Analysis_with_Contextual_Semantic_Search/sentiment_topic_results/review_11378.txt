{"text": "I like this shirt a lot. I wear it over t-shirts as a shirt jacket. It's a nice weight and quality; not flimsy like some others I've seen. It was a nice soft fabric to begin with and has held up well after numerous washings. I'm short and heavy, 5'1&#34; so I ordered the X-large. Usually with X-large shirts the sleeves are way too long for me, but not with this shirt. So if you are tall, the sleeves may be too short for you. If you always wear the sleeves rolled up then that wouldn't be a problem.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11969305", "1": "0.4676119", "2": "0.052735068", "3": "0.055050094", "4": "0.07804141", "5": "0.113128595", "6": "0.11373991"}}
