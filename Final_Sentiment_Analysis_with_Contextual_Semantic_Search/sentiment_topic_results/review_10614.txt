{"text": "The price is reasonable and the pullover attractive.  I found the fabric rather stiff.  I interpreted the ad to mean a separate zip-lock sack was included for storage.  Actually it stores in the front pocket.  There were no instructions on how to fold and store. Charles River gave me more credit that I deserve as I tried briefly to store it and gave up.  I probably should have sat down and tried to figure it out, but I didn't.  I use a rain pullover to hike in the woods and to walk my dog at night.  Although the green color is attractive, I wanted yellow so I would be more visible.  It didn't come in yellow.  Also I take a size 10 or 12 and I found the medium not especially roomy.  As I often layer my clothes, I would have needed the next size up.  This pullover is fine for anyone who just wants something to wear in light rain.  For my purposes it doesn't work.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21934317", "1": "0.31335527", "2": "0.098373145", "3": "0.024209235", "4": "0.24331546", "6": "0.09900446"}}
