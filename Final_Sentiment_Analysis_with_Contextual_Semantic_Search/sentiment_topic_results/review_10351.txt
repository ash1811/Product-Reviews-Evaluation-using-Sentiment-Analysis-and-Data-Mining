{"text": "Bought to wear with halter dress.  Used the invisible straps as the halter straps made the bra fit funny with gaps.

All in all not a good purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.061303098", "1": "0.20103694", "2": "0.13529667", "3": "0.22827753", "4": "0.15404043", "5": "0.05036786", "6": "0.16967747"}}
