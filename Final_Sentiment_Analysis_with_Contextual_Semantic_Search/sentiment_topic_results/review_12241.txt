{"text": "I like the foot bed on these slippers because they are padded enough that they cushion my feet from the floor and anything on the floor and I can wear them out to get the news paper, but they are not so high I feel like I'm falling to one side or the other. The memory foam allows my feet to sink right in and give the feel as if I'd already broken them in to MY feet. They are snug enough that they don't fall off when I walk, easy to slide into and there are no seams to bother my feet (once I removed the annoying tag sewn in the heel, which wasn't easy). They are the same price as you would pay in the stores, but getting them shipped for free saves me a trip to the store. I'd recommend these slippers and purchase them for friends. The only reason I took off one star was because of how long it took me to get the tag out without harming the slippers. It was much harder than it use to be. I don't know why they don't just put a stamp on the bottom or something. I don't think anyone like these tags, we just put up with them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08311544", "1": "0.17973407", "2": "0.11557165", "3": "0.17968193", "4": "0.26526287", "6": "0.17387871"}}
