{"text": "I like the look of this watch very much, but 3 problems:  1) the band is relatively short, and 2) the straps to hold the band down (2) disintegrated after about 2 months, and 3) while the watch is waterproof, using it while swimming fewer than 6 times has resulted a faded and worn looking watch band. I'd buy it again if the band could be longer and there could be a more durable or perhaps a metal bracket to hold down the end of the band.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.31533134", "1": "0.2566743", "2": "0.20247105", "3": "0.15939783", "4": "0.02766618", "6": "0.035347823"}}
