{"text": "If you're reading this review chances are like me you have found great, well fitting T-Shirts near impossible to find and crazy expensive when you do come across them.On a lark I ordered two of these is black at a size 2X. The style, fit and quality are superb. Thick well dyed non clingy 100% cotton. The pocketless front and well crafted crew neck makes these ideal for tucked in under a jacket or sport coat. Worn on their own or under a vest, these are versatile wonderfully affordable well made garments.The cotton is extremely soft, not stiff at all and doesn't pill. Right of the package they are  completely comfortable. I'm a big guy and like my T-Shirts long - far to often I buy tall's and they're too short, not the case here.These are long enough without looking like night-shirts! Yet also nice to sleep in.I would highly recommend this brand for price, quality and value as you're sure to enjoy them. I'll be ordering more in different colors that's for sure.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04706213", "1": "0.4999685", "2": "0.036218982", "3": "0.14276747", "4": "0.07956548", "5": "0.028935967", "6": "0.16548151"}}
