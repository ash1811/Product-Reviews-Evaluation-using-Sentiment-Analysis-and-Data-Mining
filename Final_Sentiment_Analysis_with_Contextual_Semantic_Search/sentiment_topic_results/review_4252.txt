{"text": "The fabric itself is durable and comfortable. And the look is classic. I love it. This will definitely last a lonnnnnnnng time.  The only draw back is the sizing.  It is so big.  I bought a medium even though I usually wear a large but I think I should have bought a small.  Even with the liner (sold separately) it is still huge. I kept it because me and my husband can both share it.  But in the event he claims this one, I'm buying a small or maybe an extra small if they have it.So in case anyone reading this doesn't get the point, buy 2 sizes DOWN from what you normally wear!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11059255", "1": "0.34432435", "2": "0.09250675", "3": "0.16998264", "4": "0.10249339", "5": "0.15421912", "6": "0.025881201"}}
