{"text": "It is very difficult to find decent panties in a size 5.  These fit me beautifully and I love them, However they fit VERY well, Meaning, there is no excess fabric.  I mean, they are cut small.  Another 1/8 inch on my butt and they would not fit.  But, for me, they are great.  They wash and dry well--no shrinking--and so far the lace waist hasn't all waded up.  And there is very little panty line showing through.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16583984", "1": "0.269477", "2": "0.15956657", "3": "0.19896089", "4": "0.112513885", "6": "0.09029491"}}
