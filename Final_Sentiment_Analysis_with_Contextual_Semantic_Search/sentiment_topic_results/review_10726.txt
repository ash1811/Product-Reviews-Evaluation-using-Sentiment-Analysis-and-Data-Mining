{"text": "My son doesn't likes boots so much but this past winter was kind of harsh and I got him a pair of these boots and he actually wore them and they fit him comfortable enough to wear. He was glad to have them for the remainder of the winter weather we had left. I do recommend these boots because they are strong for winter weather, snow, slush and water you name it they can stand it. Very strong materials and very well made.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.36738563", "2": "0.21320102", "4": "0.11808148", "5": "0.20689762", "6": "0.08689743"}}
