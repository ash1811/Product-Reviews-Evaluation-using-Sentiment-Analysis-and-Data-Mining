{"text": "Contrary to other reviews, the jeans fit exactly as I needed them to.  I'm about 5'10\" / 5'11\" and 165 lbs.  I ordered a 33x32 and the waist was perfect.  The length does feel a little long, but I like my jeans like that so it works for me.  However, I wear suspenders rather then belts so if you wore a belt with these, the slightly long length wouldn't be an issue.  I've only had them a short while so I can't comment on durability, but given the price of other jeans, even if they only last me a year, they'll be totally worth the price.Worth trying, especially since they have free returns.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21944171", "1": "0.13215873", "2": "0.1485797", "3": "0.15021895", "4": "0.03694368", "5": "0.17076401", "6": "0.14189324"}}
