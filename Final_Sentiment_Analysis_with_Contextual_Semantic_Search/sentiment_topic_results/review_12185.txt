{"text": "First off, I think it is helpful to know the size of the reviewer, I am between a 36D and 38E. Before purchasing this bra online I measured myself at home, and had to make a guesstimate as to what size to go with. I ended up ordering the 38E, and the band size fits perfectly and the cup size is just a smidgen too big. I can't fault the product though for me purchasing it without trying it on.I find this to be an extremely supportive bra. I especially love the thickness of the shoulder strap, this is the only bra I've ever worn that doesn't leave me permanent indents! The band is comfortable for the most part, but I find that after a couple of hours the sides start digging into me. There are some rigid pieces on the side and I think they are to blame for this.Also, the shoulder straps are not super adjustable and I find that they get looser throughout the day, so I often feel like I want to try to re-adjust them.Another thing to keep in mind is that this is more of a tee shirt type of bra, you can't wear a lower cut shirt because the bra is very much full coverage. Don't expect to have any cleavage, because this bra separates and lifts the breasts.Like I said in the title, I have some mixed feelings about this bra. It is great for my work purposes, but there are just some minor issues I'm having.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06448762", "1": "0.23926239", "2": "0.107855566", "3": "0.3406251", "4": "0.06942846", "5": "0.11488817", "6": "0.06345269"}}
