{"text": "These are really nice shirts.  A little heavier than most T shirts (tight knit), they are richer looking than your standard T shirts.  Only drawback is they are not 100% cotton.  I live in the tropics and always buy all cotton.  My mistake, or maybe they did not list the fibers. If they do not list the fibers they really should. With all that said these are keepers, I use them in an Air conditioned office. Colors are true to pictures.  Sizing is accurate to a little on the larger size rather than smaller side.  Buy all the colors available, in Tank or this scooped neckline you will be happy with them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.029640988", "1": "0.22105873", "2": "0.03521503", "3": "0.19406153", "4": "0.1108776", "5": "0.22146724", "6": "0.18767887"}}
