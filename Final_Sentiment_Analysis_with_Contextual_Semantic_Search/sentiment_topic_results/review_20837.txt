{"text": "These fit me well in the waist and the rear.  I'm pretty curvy so this is good.  The rise is about an inch under my belly button, perfect, not too low or high.  I did order up a size as I always do in Levis.  They have a contoured fit, they are a little snug above the knee and then flare out a bit.  That I'm not real crazy about.  I probably will wear them out to hear a rockband and wear with black heeled boots.  Kind of rocker chic jeans.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.122548394", "1": "0.37056983", "2": "0.16562477", "4": "0.10300652", "5": "0.059356984", "6": "0.17555228"}}
