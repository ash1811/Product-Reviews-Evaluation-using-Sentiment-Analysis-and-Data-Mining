{"text": "Bought this backpack for my daughter to carry her Dora books in and it fits.  But the weight of the 2 books made the magnet snap pop off constantly.  I think it would be fine if you don't put anything inside the backpack, but if you want to put books in there like my daughter, then you would have to sew on your own snap or button.
