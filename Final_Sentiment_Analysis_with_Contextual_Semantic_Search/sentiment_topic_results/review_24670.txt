{"text": "I need a work bra for 12-13hour shifts that would stay in place under my scrubs.  When I get home from work and take my top off, my bra is usually sliding up my back and lurching forward making my breasts sag.  I am a 34D, 150 pounds.  My boobs are so round but don't stick out as far as they are round, that I actually get asked by other women if I have implants..LOL.  Thelma and Louise are real but such a pain in the arse to fit and have the bra stay put.  I loved this bra from the moment I put it on.  The back strap is all one piece and quite wide, eliminating the back fat and giving it that solid base to stay put.  I saw that another reviewer stated the bra seems to pull the breasts outward in an odd direction and make them pointed.  I have absolutely no cleavage and can actually ball up my fist and stick it between and not touch anything, so the way this separates and hold feels quite natural to me and I welcome anything that doesn't make me look soo round.  If you have breasts that are voluminous and close together this bra might feel kinda freakish and awkward.  I had to pull the staps to the highest point to feel uplifted.  I want this as a work bra for under scrubs but it looks equally great under a tank and I love the t-back feature so my straps won't show.  The T-back makes me feel like I am walking with my shoulders back more instead of rounded, like I'm hiding my boobs. I ordered the Wacoal 855192 and the Lunaire 18111 and hated them both.  This bra is a keeper for me :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07166647", "1": "0.31956273", "2": "0.07409863", "3": "0.28673652", "4": "0.16894646", "6": "0.07663552"}}
