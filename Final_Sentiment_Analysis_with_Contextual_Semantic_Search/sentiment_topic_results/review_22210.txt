{"text": "I work at a computer from my home every day -- teaching online courses. Around the house I wear casual clothes and slippers in winter -- sandals in summer. I was looking for comfortable slippers that would hold up to every day use and bought these because of the rave reviews. They are indeed a good, stout pair of slippers. The sheep wool lining is warm and cushiony and the sole is durable enough to run out for the mail or even drive to the local pizza shop for a dinner takeout. Four stars because they run a little small, at least while they're new and the fleece is still full. The result was pressure on the big toe that's creating a painful ingrown nail. Not a big problem, but with a little more room in the &#34;toe box&#34; this wouldn't have happened. I expect as the fleece becomes more compacted they will loosen up. The fleece lining is holding up very well. I wash my feet daily, use a foot and heel cream and wear the slippers with socks, and I've been wearing them almost every day for a couple of months for 15 - 18 hours and there's no trace of odor, so they are breathing well. At this point they still look new. The sole is a typical UGG product -- just a flat piece of plastic, so don't expect any kind of padding or arch supports that would help with long walks -- they are for sitting around, not for hiking. All in all, I really like these slippers -- great for sitting and lounging -- warm and soft. When they wear out, I'll buy the same thing to replace them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09409887", "1": "0.24914525", "2": "0.06339709", "3": "0.2876143", "4": "0.027953811", "5": "0.19267868", "6": "0.08511203"}}
