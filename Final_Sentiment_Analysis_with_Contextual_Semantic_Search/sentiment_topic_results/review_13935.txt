{"text": "After some research, I sort of switched from Seiko to Citizen --- better warranty, eco-drive better than kinetic (lasts longer, less \"temperamental\"), apparently cheaper servicing costs.  Very good looking and well made.  I prefer to the 8700 models just due to looks (although I would like a day of the week indicator).  Is perpetual (nice but not that big a deal), eco-drive (sweet --- 30 year life expected!!!), chronograph (probably will not be used), alarm (too low to really be any good).  Nice looks, good strap.
