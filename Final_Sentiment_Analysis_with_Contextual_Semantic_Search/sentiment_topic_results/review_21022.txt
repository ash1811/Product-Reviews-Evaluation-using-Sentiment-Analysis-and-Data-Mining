{"text": "I bought these to wear with a garter belt, did not want &#34;elastic&#34; around the top. The &#34;lace top&#34; should have been advertised as &#34;an elastic band covered with lace&#34;. Really Really uncomfortable, and useless with the garter belt. Also, if you wear these for more than five minutes you'll have a very unattractive red ring of compressed flesh all around your thighs. Also, I am 5'6'' and 130 pounds,with skinny thighs and I wear a C/D?
