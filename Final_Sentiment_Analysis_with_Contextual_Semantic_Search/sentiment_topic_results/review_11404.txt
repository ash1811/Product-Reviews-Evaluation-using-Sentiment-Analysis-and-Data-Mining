{"text": "I wear white shirts to work as part of my uniform.  I like many people like easy care so I use alot of the golf shirts.  I like sleeves that are a little longer and this one is just right.  It's a good fit, washes well and a great price, but does need a bit of ironing.  Other wise I would give it 5 stars.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.088750064", "1": "0.56516784", "4": "0.07710564", "5": "0.111113444", "6": "0.1501026"}}
