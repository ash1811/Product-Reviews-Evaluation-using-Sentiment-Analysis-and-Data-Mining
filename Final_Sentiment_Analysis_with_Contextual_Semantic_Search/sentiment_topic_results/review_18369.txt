{"text": "This watch has everything I was looking for.  It is clear and concise, has day/date feature and Indaglo so I can see it in the dark.  I travel a lot and don't have to turn on the light at night.  I have a collector watch I am retiring and have a band I wanted to transfer to the new one.  Fine.  I read a complaint from someone regarding setting the day.  To do this you wind the watch backwards and the day will change correctly.  Otherwise, you will mess everything up.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.050239317", "1": "0.045904953", "2": "0.31232113", "3": "0.14834674", "4": "0.16430295", "5": "0.14616768", "6": "0.13271722"}}
