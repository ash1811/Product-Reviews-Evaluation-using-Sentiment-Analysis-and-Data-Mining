{"text": "Its large, but not obnoxious big. It holds everything I need to carry to run to the store without a purse. Its nice quality, soft leather. I would buy this for a gift or again in a different color if needed. I have so much room in this wallet I now tend to misplace my things I tried stuffing in old wallet for years.
