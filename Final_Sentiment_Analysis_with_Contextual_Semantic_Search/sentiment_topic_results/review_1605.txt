{"text": "I bought this to wear with my bridesmaid dress for an upcoming wedding. I ordered a size 4 dress about four months ago, I have gained about ten pounds since then and now the dress is super tight and my stomach sticks out. So needless to say I needed something to slim my stomach and help with the love handles.Right now I weigh 132 lbs and am 5'3&#34;. I ordered a Medium slimmer, and fits good. It does not roll up while wearing (sitting or standing). It's not the most comfortable thing to wear for more than a couple hours but it is worth it because I can tell a huge difference when wearing this.You could not see the slimmer through my bridesmaid dress, but I am sure you could with thinner materials.My only complaint is that it comes too high up on my back. My bridesmaid dress is low in the back (comes lower than my bra) and you can see about an inch of the slimmer. I am going to trim the back of the slimmer so it is not noticeable in the dress.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.057638485", "1": "0.42907575", "3": "0.09398463", "4": "0.24447311", "5": "0.073698044", "6": "0.09874435"}}
