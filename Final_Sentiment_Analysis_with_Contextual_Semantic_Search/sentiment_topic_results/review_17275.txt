{"text": "I alredy had an idea of the type of athletic shoes I wanted,  I know what size Nikes fit me, so that is not a problem.I am constantly being Emailed by 3 shoe companys, but what is on deal to me price-wise, is no deal.On a whim, I went on-line to Amazon and found several styles I liked, at the prices I liked.The \"good\" pair I was wearing were white. (not good for winter mess.)  So I wanted black.I like this syle and the price that was offered, so I went ahead and ordered them.I was happy when they showed up a day before I was given as the delivery date!(Some how, I ripped the sole loose on my other's the day the new ones were delivered!These are not only comortable, thaey are light.  It's like wearing slippers.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08378591", "1": "0.22100356", "2": "0.17155072", "3": "0.08903547", "4": "0.19441117", "5": "0.101488076", "6": "0.13872512"}}
