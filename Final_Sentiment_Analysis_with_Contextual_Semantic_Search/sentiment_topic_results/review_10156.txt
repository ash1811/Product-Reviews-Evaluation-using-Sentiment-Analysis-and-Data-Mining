{"text": "These earrings are nicely made and sturdy for the price.  However, just as stated in previous reviews I've read, the color of the pearls is very light.  I also feel the earrings are a little too \"busy\" for lack of a better word; I would not have included the additional silver/beads on both the top and bottom of the pearl; overdone just a tad bit, but a nice pair of earrings nonetheless...especially for the price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11764894", "1": "0.34291306", "2": "0.04495458", "3": "0.13696864", "4": "0.072176576", "5": "0.14219798", "6": "0.14314026"}}
