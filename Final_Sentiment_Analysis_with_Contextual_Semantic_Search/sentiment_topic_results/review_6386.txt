{"text": "I've been searching for socks with a nice heavy padding to them as I go through socks pretty quickly.  These are one of the favorites I've found so far.  Durable, nice padding, comfortable, and launder well.  I have noticed lately that it seems most of the socks I've purchased say to launder WITHOUT BLEACH.
