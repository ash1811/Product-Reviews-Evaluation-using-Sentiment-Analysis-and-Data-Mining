{"text": "I bought this backpack for my 8th grader, who needed room to carry all of her books and school supplies. It has enough compartments for her to easily carry two 3in binders, four large textbooks, her pencil box, gym clothes & shoes, and even has space for her iPod. She previously had problems with other backpacks digging into her shoulders, but the contoured, padded straps have cut down on that problem significantly. It's also doubled as a weekend overnight bag that's large enough to hold clothes, books, Teddy bears, and makeup/haircare supplies for her and her sister. I chose this one for her because I have the same backpack in pink (hers is the white/black charming check), and I was easily able to store all of my college texts along with medical supplies, laptop, and instructor manuals with room left over for my bulky purse, without straining any zippers (or my back). Hers is still new, but mine is over a year old and has survived being tossed around in an ambulance, being dropped/dragged on asphalt, drink spills, etc., and with a little washing or spot scrubbing, it still looks new. I love these backpacks!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.062132444", "1": "0.07772277", "2": "0.4292118", "3": "0.180636", "4": "0.1623349", "5": "0.06154194", "6": "0.026420115"}}
