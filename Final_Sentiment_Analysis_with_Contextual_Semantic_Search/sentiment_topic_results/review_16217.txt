{"text": "These slippers have a long hard tag on the inside from the heel forward a couple of inches, I'd guess. Why do you make a comfy soft fleece-lined slipper and sew in a very large stiff label to stick the bottom of the wearer's feet? Not a comfy design. I had to very carefully pull the incredibly thick, tight stitching to pull the tag out of each slipper (they were VERY well attached) before my husband was happy with these. I wish the manufacturer would lose the tag. Great slippers otherwise though. Would probably purchase again despite the tag.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.062720604", "1": "0.32836956", "2": "0.20075242", "3": "0.11408162", "4": "0.117145225", "5": "0.05222376", "6": "0.1247068"}}
