{"text": "I love this watch. It's stylish and looks more expensive than it is. I have gotten many compliments on it. My only complaint is that even after a jeweler removed all of the links that he could, the watch is still a little big. My wrists are quite tiny though (not even 6\" around) so I am used to this in most watches. I guess I have to shop in the children's section next time :)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07105083", "1": "0.32833734", "2": "0.23987538", "4": "0.27431607", "6": "0.07866044"}}
