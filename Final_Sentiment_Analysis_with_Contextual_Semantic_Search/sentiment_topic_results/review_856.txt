{"text": "My journey for flip flops that actually worked for me was long. I always had a problem keeping them on my feet. After never having luck with el-cheapo flops, I tried some more expensive ones including Calvin Klein $60 flip flops. They were terrible. Now that I found Reef sandals I am very happy! They stay on really well, are the most comfortable scandals I've ever owned, and they seem to support my feet for comfort all day long. I'm a believer!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.4336591", "2": "0.13904849", "3": "0.08819912", "4": "0.13948175", "5": "0.11028765", "6": "0.08613977"}}
