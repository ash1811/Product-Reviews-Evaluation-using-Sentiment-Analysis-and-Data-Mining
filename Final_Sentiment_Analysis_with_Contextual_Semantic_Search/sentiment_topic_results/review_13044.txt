{"text": "I bought this to wear around my head while I'm cleaning, to keep sweat from rolling down my face & into my eyes. It's a nice large bandana- folded over, it fits around my head nicely for a double-layer piece of cotton to absorb moisture. No problems tying it in the back on my head, so I would say the size is ample, considering I use it folded in two. It's slim enough to fold in my cleaning tray & not cause me to lose any space for my cleaning products. The fabric is soft but feels durable & the stitching is great- no loose threads or frayed edges at all.I have no idea why anyone would say purchasing this is a scam (unless they themselves were a seller of the same type of product & wanted to undermine their competition...) I got my order in just a couple of days, over a week before the due date that it had to be here. The bandana came with a receipt & polite note (despite being such an inexpensive item), plus was packed folded & clean in it's own shrink-wrap. I am very pleased & would buy another one from this seller if it's ever needed.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0750727", "1": "0.22596382", "2": "0.20248061", "3": "0.12767822", "4": "0.07138574", "5": "0.11270641", "6": "0.1847125"}}
