{"text": "I highly recommend these.  When I bought mine (2009) I was working around houses, climbing onto roofs, and wanted exactly what these looked like: durable, sturdy, secure hold/fit on the foot, toe-cap for ladders, roofing, bushes, etc.  Yet, they're surprising light-weight material.  I've had other shoes come apart on me, but not these.  These are work horses and have protected my feet extremely well.  They look comfy, and feel even better.  Very good foot support, immediately comfortable with no break-in required, and have not given out or lost the shape or supporting quality; I weigh 260-ish lbs and am on my feet all day with no problems, and the sole has not compressed that I can tell. They are still like-new although looking a wee-bit worn and faded.I wear this pair 90% of the time unless I want a dressier sandal.  They wash easily and you can let them dry or not, whatever: they dry on your feet in summer.  I love them so much for fit and comfort that I bought the closed-shoe style they make for office & winter use, and just ordered my second pair of sandals in another color.  I ordered another pair to be dressier, but I have no reason to replace the first pair.  They are ingeniously designed and made, and I love them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11487793", "1": "0.31056103", "2": "0.07415685", "3": "0.24592155", "4": "0.10306278", "5": "0.05883933", "6": "0.09258056"}}
