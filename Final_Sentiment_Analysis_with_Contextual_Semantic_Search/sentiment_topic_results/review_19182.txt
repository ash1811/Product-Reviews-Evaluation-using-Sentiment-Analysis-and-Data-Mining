{"text": "These are the best sunglasses on the market.  I love my wayfarer ray-bans, but these are a cut above.  When you look through the lenses, it makes the world \"pop\" in terms of color. Even on a dull day, or if you're feeling down or blue, go outside and put these on, and they really lift your mood, just by making the world look a little brighter.  Not sure how they do it, but its for real.  The sides curve around a little, too, to offer sun protection on the sides, really great feature that I don't have on my beloved wayfarers!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1766497", "1": "0.23687258", "2": "0.10973487", "4": "0.19827706", "5": "0.13188602", "6": "0.1436998"}}
