{"text": "I always have problems finding a size 5 and I was thrilled to find these in my size.  I'm 52 years old and these shoes are great because they don't look like children's...they're comfortable, well made and shipped in a speedo shoebox.  I highly recommend this seller.  I actually bought 2 pairs!  Going to aruba and these are perfect!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18849958", "1": "0.20977429", "2": "0.12065687", "3": "0.23066346", "4": "0.12553054", "5": "0.12065808"}}
