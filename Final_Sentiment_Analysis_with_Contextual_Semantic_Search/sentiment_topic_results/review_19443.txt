{"text": "My boyfriend loved these, but they're more fun to look at than to wear. The sizing is right, it's just that they stretch out TOO MUCH and don't bounce back. I was hoping for springier netting that recoiled to shape. The feet and legs have a tendency to stretch out too big, and then not bounce back. They will if you wash them after wear, but will also stretch out really big again, too.Also, the netting fabric is pretty fragile...snags and tears easliy, and gets frayed and fuzzy after a couple of wearings.I love the look, style, and initial fit...but after you wear them 2 or 3 times they just aren't the same. You almost have to throw them out and get a new pair.I have a pair of dancer's fishnet panty hose that are very springy, and I've been able to wear those over and over with no damage or sagginess afterward.These are just made out of too cheap of a material for long-term wear.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11776352", "1": "0.31538945", "2": "0.071139105", "3": "0.060765892", "4": "0.15942065", "5": "0.27300847"}}
