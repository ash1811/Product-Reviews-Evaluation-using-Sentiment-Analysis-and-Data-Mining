{"text": "I bought my daughter 4 pairs of these little boots this winter. They're just so perfect. They are so warm and super comfy. She's excited to have boots just like mommy too!We went on a field trip with her preschool class to a farm today. It was VERY cold but she said her feet were toasty warm. She had enough traction walking around on uneven ground too.Love these little boots!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1008459", "1": "0.23326072", "3": "0.2629526", "4": "0.3383203", "6": "0.057267237"}}
