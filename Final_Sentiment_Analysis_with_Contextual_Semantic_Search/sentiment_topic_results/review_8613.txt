{"text": "While these jeans werent even close to their advertised length(I ordered a 28 length, it was closer to 32...), the quality was above the recent Wranglers I had gotten. Very heavy denim instills some confidence in their ability to last, and the colors are true to the pics here. I'll report back if they give me any trouble, but till then I will use and abuse them to the best of my ability(they are my work jeans).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.113242246", "1": "0.24386095", "2": "0.0827934", "3": "0.05601077", "4": "0.19202214", "5": "0.2133387", "6": "0.09873179"}}
