{"text": "I can't really give a review of these, because the ones I ordered didn't fit me. I am a size 10.5, and ordered the &#34;E&#34; size insole (which covers 9.5 - 11 men's shoes), but it was too narrow in the heel and the arch wasn't long enough. I probably need the &#34;F&#34; size, just for a wider heel cup and extended arch.Accordingly, don't think that you can just order your shoe size and be set - either try them on in a store first (recommended) or order TWO sizes at once. But, trying on in a store, you'll also be able to try all the different colors - they are very different from each other.One other note - I don't think Superfeet are right for all shoes. I was going to use these in some hiking boots, but the added height of the insole under my heel messed up the ankle support (my ankle was lifted above the boot's area of maximum support.)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.103590444", "1": "0.3448351", "2": "0.12367422", "3": "0.2298463", "4": "0.0786468", "5": "0.070251636", "6": "0.04915552"}}
