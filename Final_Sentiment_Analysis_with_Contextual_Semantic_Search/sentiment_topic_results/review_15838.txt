{"text": "After reading that the Bali Women's Live it Up bra is the best design for those of us who are no longer `perky' I immediately ordered one in the same size I used to wear in Bali.  I am round-busted, full in the middle as well as the sides, and clearly the new bra isn't designed for my shape.  It squeezes me to the middle and over the top, creating a too-small-cup-bulge. I highly recommend this bra for any woman who wants a little more cleavage, but it isn't for those of us who are already quite full in the middle.  The bra is very well made, the straps are comfortable, the lift it provides is great, and the push to the center creates a surprising amount of additional cleavage without the use of padding.  I gave this bra to my daughter who LOVES it and would award it 5 stars. She has asked me to order two more for her.  If you would like a little extra cleavage, then this would be a 5-star bra for you!AMENDMENT 8/28/2012: Ordered this bra for myself in 38DDD which is one cup-size larger than my previous order and now I see why it continues to be my daughter's favorite bra style.  The larger cup size eliminated my uni-boob problem mentioned above.  The lift is surprisingly good, yet comfortable.  The straps' wide \"comfort\" portion extends completely over the shoulder which makes it so much more comfortable for us heavy breasted women.  In most other bras, I have found the comfort part of the strap is too short. I highly recommend this bra with the caveat that, if you are packed into your current cup size, or if you are very round busted, order this bra one cup size larger.  My daughter knew from the get-go that this is a 5-star bra, now I know it, too!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.051626462", "1": "0.38884944", "2": "0.19277531", "3": "0.2663708", "4": "0.07153524", "6": "0.02619361"}}
