{"text": "From my past experience with Sebago boat shoes, I expected these to good. I wasn't disappointed. They are true to size and comfortable from day 1. I have since ordered additional pairs in black and tan. Only issue I have is I guess I just don't know how to properly tie a boat shoe. The laces are so long they look funny when I tie the shoes in a traditional way. That's not the shoe's fault. That's my fault. I'll figure it out. Can't go wrong with these shoes however.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.20935181", "2": "0.27759185", "3": "0.29140118", "4": "0.09573133", "5": "0.0909903", "6": "0.031948246"}}
