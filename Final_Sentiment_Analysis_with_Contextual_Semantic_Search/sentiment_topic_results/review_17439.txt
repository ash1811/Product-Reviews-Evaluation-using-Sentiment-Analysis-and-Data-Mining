{"text": "I bought these Champion cotton sweatpants for my husband. He is very happy with them. He wears a size L and that's what I bought from Amazon. They fit well and washed very well. Minimal shrinkage. Pants are always a little long on him so if there was length shrinkage it would be a good thing but there was not dramatic change. It took me some time scrolling through Amazon to find cotton sweats with pockets and these are just what I was looking for. Very happy with price and Amazon service.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05442506", "1": "0.32908484", "2": "0.05812881", "3": "0.18498074", "4": "0.32601702", "6": "0.044177186"}}
