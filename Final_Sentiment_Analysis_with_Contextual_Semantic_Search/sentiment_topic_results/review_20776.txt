{"text": "Bought this jacket for my son, because where we live it gets really, really windy and that brings the temperature down quick. He's an athlete so it gets thrown around and beaten up on a daily basis and a few months later its still in perfect condition. Its super warm but lightweight so you get to be comfortably cozy without the bulk. He wears it all the time and its holding up great. The only thing I don't like is that the lining isn't soft... but that doesn't seem to bother him, he just likes the warmth.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16525638", "1": "0.3452229", "2": "0.04279579", "4": "0.118667014", "5": "0.22146298", "6": "0.10347813"}}
