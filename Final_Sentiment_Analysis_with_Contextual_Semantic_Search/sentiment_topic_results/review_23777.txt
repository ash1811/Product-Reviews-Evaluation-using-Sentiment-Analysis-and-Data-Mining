{"text": "I have been wearing Vans for years and was pumped to find an affordable option online. If you have never worn or tried on a pair of Vans before I recommend doing that in person before ordering online. Once you figure out you perfect size in Vans then you can start ordering online because the sizing is very consistent. I have ordered several pairs off Amazon in different colors and have been very happy with every pair. Vans won't bring down your mile time or cure flat feet but they are a very affordable pair of shoes that allow you to build out your shoe collection with a variety of colors that look great in casual or semi-formal environments.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04882949", "1": "0.36030817", "2": "0.08736288", "3": "0.13048388", "4": "0.08823757", "5": "0.13048707", "6": "0.15429099"}}
