{"text": "Outstanding build quality and beauty.  Looks more expensive than the price that was paid.  A very good alternative to those folks who cannot afford or let alone wear larger watches like Invicta etc. although I do have a few of my own and really like them also.  Most difficult part was adjusting and resizing the watch band.  Casio build quality is so precise that it takes a lot of skill to remove the metal pins and remove 4 links.  Otherwise, took me 1/2 hour to resize the band since I have my own watchmaking tools I also purchased from Amazon. Back case cover is a screw on type which is preferable since it really keeps out moisture and is much easier to remove when replacing batteries although I think it will be about ten years before I would even consider doing so.  My last Casio Edifice purchased in Las Vegas was purchased when my son was five years old.  He just made 15 when the battery finally died and had to be replaced.  It just doesn't get any better.  Buy it. You won't regret this purchase since it is so elegantly styled and built like a tank.  Highly recommended.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14159971", "1": "0.24155833", "2": "0.10985444", "3": "0.06509591", "4": "0.17123346", "5": "0.1137636", "6": "0.15689456"}}
