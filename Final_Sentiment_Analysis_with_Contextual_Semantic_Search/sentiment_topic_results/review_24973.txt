{"text": "My husband had worn the insoles out in the Oboz boots he bought two years ago.  After trying repeatedly (without any replies) to contact Oboz about getting replacement insoles, I found these Superfeet insoles here on Amazon.  They arrived in two days, with Prime shipping, and my husband put them in his boots.They fit perfectly in his size 14 boots, and he immediately loved the arch support and feel of these insoles.  We thought we might have to cut them down because they fit boots up to size 15, but they fit without any adjustments.  He likes the way they cushion his steps, and that the fabric on the top doesn't allow his sock to slip inside the boot.They aren't cheap, but they are much better than the $8 Dr. Scholl's insoles we found in stores.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06874529", "1": "0.2350472", "2": "0.07520988", "3": "0.12706536", "4": "0.25453418", "5": "0.15791756", "6": "0.08148051"}}
