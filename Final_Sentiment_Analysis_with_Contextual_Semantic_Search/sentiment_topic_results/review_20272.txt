{"text": "I got this for my middle school son, two years ago.  I am shopping for backpacks for my other kids, because theirs (not High Sierra) are pretty beat up after only one school year.  I just inspected my son's High Sierra, and it is in great shape!  He is about to start his third school year with his High Sierra Loop, and I have no plans of replacing it.  I am very impressed with the durability of this model.I would get a High Sierra for my youngest child, but I don't think they have backpacks with cartoon characters printed on it.  That seems to be a higher priority for the little one.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18613862", "1": "0.066279605", "2": "0.26745912", "3": "0.20373835", "4": "0.035598338", "5": "0.11593132", "6": "0.12485464"}}
