{"text": "Rockport is supposed to be known for comfort, but these bad boys don't deliver.  I suppose since Rockport got taken over by New Balance and then Adidas, quality is being sacrificed to boost the bottom-line.If you lift up the insole you will feel underneath it is like a piece of steel.  There is literally no give to the shoe.  I bought them thinking they were Rockports--known for quality--however Rockport isn't the same compnay today.  I probably could get more comfort from a $30 pair of shoes in a baragin bin, then these overpriced clunkers!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13420886", "1": "0.19703577", "2": "0.10579421", "3": "0.12478884", "4": "0.15660155", "5": "0.17012852", "6": "0.11144226"}}
