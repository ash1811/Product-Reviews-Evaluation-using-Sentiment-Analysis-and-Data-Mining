{"text": "I feel as if enough has been said about the Invicta Diver, but after owning this item for over a year I decided to give my interpretation on the piece.First and foremost, this is by far one of the best look-a-like submariners on the market. I actually own a submariner and people who know that I own it rarely notice the difference. I've had people actually walk up to me wearing this and ask \"What store did you buy your submariner from?\" Now I'm not advocating that you buy this to impress people or wear as a Rolex. I'm simply saying that this watch has such a sturdy build quality that it can easily be mistaken for a $3000 watch.If you've owned Mechanical watches before and are used to the quality of a Tag, Omega, Rolex, or Panerai then I highly suggest you save your money and upgrade to the 9937 with the Swiss 26 jewel movement and sapphire crystal glass. Even if you're new to watches and considering this one, if you have the money the 9937 would be a great investment.Pros:-Design (Well I guess that doesn't count the diver style is a classic)-Screw down crown is sturdy, not cheap and flimsy. The winding motion has a very fluid tick to it.-Movement-Hour markers and hands illuminate very wellCons:-The 9937. As long as you own this it will always be inferior to its older brother-It's made by Invicta...Now I want to explain the last one. I'm not saying that Invicta is a bad company. I own about 5 or 6 of their pieces. Some in the $500+ range. However, they have been known to have very substandard quality control and their customer service ideology has some issues. I don't see why I should have to PAY to send something back to the factory when it was delivered with flaws. However my beef with Invicta shouldn't negate the fact that this IS a very good watch.*Side Note*Get a good dive strap for this watch and take it swimming. It does work as a diving watch (OH MY, think of that actually wearing a diving watch while diving!) I went scuba diving at about 180-220 ft. with this watch and had no problems so don't be afraid to get it wet!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08517051", "1": "0.43447593", "2": "0.23684646", "3": "0.084852286", "4": "0.037645806", "6": "0.11843876"}}
