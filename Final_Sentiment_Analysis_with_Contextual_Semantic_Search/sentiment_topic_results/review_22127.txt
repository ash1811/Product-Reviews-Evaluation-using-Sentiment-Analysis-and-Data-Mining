{"text": "I got these for walking my dog when it's not super cold but not warm enough to wear no gloves at all. I figured they'd be nice and light so I wouldn't get too warm in the spring/fall when the weather is 'In between.&#34; Well, I knew they'd be light, but they're basically sheer--almost like stockings/tights. It's that same kind of netting material. Kinda useless, plus I'm afraid that my engagement ring will poke a hole in them (it's almost a guarantee considering how thin they are). I guess these are better than nothing, but I expected at least a bit more fabric--albeit thin.Also, these were made in China, as in, manufactured and shipped from China. They took FOREVER to arrive. I'm sure Amazon told me that when I bought them, but I'm so spoiled by fast shipping that I think I tuned it out. It's fine that it takes longer than the 2-day shipping offered by Amazon, but this was ridiculous..I think about 3 weeks or more? And then I was disappointed with the product anyway.Bottom line--don't waste your money. Get really thin athletic/running gloves. These are basically tights for your hands, and are so thin that you'll easily snag them on things.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.035802875", "1": "0.23382713", "2": "0.16796823", "3": "0.122179225", "4": "0.13987455", "5": "0.2981029"}}
