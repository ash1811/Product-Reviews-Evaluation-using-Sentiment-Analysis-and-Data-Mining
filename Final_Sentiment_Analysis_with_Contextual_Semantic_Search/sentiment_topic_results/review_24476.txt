{"text": "Bought for my husband. I used to work in podiatry and we recommended this quite often for people with arch related feet issues that didn't want to spend the money on customs. As soon as my husband started to complain about the pain on his feet, we went to the store and tried these on. He loved them so much he made me get him another pair. It's definitely more cost effective on amazon, than at shoe stores, even with my industry discount at the retail stores!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04694433", "1": "0.3626169", "2": "0.16996257", "3": "0.12611763", "4": "0.16028956", "5": "0.13088764"}}
