{"text": "Ordered these for my fianc&eacute;, who is a fencing instructor. He wears them often but claims they are not his favorite Adidas pants, says they are a little lightweight.. I think if you're not too picky or workout in extreme cold... they're just fine . The price is better than a lot of adidas pants so add to that they didn't shrink and the fabric is durable... they are MY favorite addias pants, even if he prefers the \"firebird\" line.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12799126", "1": "0.36276272", "2": "0.08230796", "3": "0.046390127", "4": "0.08411845", "5": "0.26544768", "6": "0.03098185"}}
