{"text": "We didn't buy this outfit as a costume - we use it as an everyday toy and boy, does it get the use!  The imagination is just unbelievable as our little one runs around saving the world in this outfit.  It's just SOOOO cute seeing them out there running around with that cape flying in the back.  Plus, they LOVE swinging on a swingset in it to see the cape fly in the air just as if Batman was swinging from a building.  Great, great fun, they wear beautifully, wash well and just are a great addition for your playchest.  Highly, highly, highly recommend!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05980765", "1": "0.29662767", "2": "0.1484597", "3": "0.085897446", "4": "0.1540134", "5": "0.17673506", "6": "0.0784591"}}
