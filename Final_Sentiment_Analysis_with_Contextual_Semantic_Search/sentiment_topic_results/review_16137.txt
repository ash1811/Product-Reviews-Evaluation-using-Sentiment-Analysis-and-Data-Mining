{"text": "Hubby and I have been together for over 16 years. He used to work in construction, and has experienced some injuries that make comfortable shoes as necessary as they are hard to find. The ball of his foot is very wide, and his heel is fairly narrow. He wears a size 12 EEE. These are the first shoes he's been able to wear in complete comfort since we met! He's tried everything, and we were just about to resign ourselves to the fact that he would never find comfortable shoes.The toe-box has plenty of room in the extra-wide width, the heel doesn't slip, the reinforced toe isn't heavy like a steel-toe, and the shank in the arch is sufficient for all the shoveling he does. And he doesn't take them off as soon as we get home at the end of the day. He walks a LOT, several miles with the dogs twice a day, and the first couple of days he wore them, he came in looking for them, forgetting that he had them on. The fit is perfect and the boot is very light, compared to work-boots.I didn't know I was holding such feelings about his shoes, but when someone you love is never comfortable and not likely to be for a long time, I guess you just live with it. He was so happy and amazed by the comfort of these hikers, I nearly cried with relief. So, yes, we'd buy them again, and will get Wolverines for him from now on.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08727644", "1": "0.19523312", "2": "0.13548239", "3": "0.3121944", "4": "0.1372708", "5": "0.029016282", "6": "0.10352655"}}
