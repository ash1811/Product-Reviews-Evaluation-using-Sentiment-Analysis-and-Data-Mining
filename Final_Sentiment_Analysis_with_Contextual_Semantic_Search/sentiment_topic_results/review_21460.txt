{"text": "I bought these to replace an old pair of Acorn slippers that had lost the sole on one foot. These new slippers are better cushioned than the old pair, and are nice and warm.  My only complaint is that these slippers run small.  I was in footwear sales (Asst Mgr up to Regional V.P.) from 1982 to 2004, and know how to fit shoes.  I wear an 11D and these slippers are listed as fitting 10.5-11.5.  I have owned four other pairs of Acorn slippers and they all fit true to size. This pair fits like a 10.5; my toe is bumping the end of the shoe.  If I wore an 11.5, i would not be able to get these slippers on.  I had to check the sole just to make sure that the correct size had been sent.  It was, the sole is clearly marked 10.5-11.5.  Returning them and going up to the next size (11.5-12.5) would be pointless.  Even if the next size runs just as small as these do, they would still be a half size too large.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06810443", "1": "0.18210663", "2": "0.15086472", "3": "0.23557301", "4": "0.13150716", "6": "0.22949514"}}
