{"text": "Similar to the Duofold pants, these are the best long underwear I've ever worn.  They keep the heat in very well, fit me snugly and are comfortable.  I would recommend to any skier.  With this, a sweatshirt and my ski jacket I sweat all day long, but the moisture wicks and stays comfortable all day long.  I will always use these when skiing.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.058101926", "1": "0.33657134", "2": "0.1446424", "3": "0.22309756", "4": "0.18827303", "6": "0.04521816"}}
