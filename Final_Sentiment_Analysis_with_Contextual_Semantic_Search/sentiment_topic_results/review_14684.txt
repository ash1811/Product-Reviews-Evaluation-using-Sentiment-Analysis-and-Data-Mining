{"text": "This is a stunning shoe for plain patent leather.  I wear between an 81/2 and a 9.  I decided to go with a 9 and am very happy I did.  In the 9, this fit me well.  The nougat color is a pale tan with a little pink.  My skin is very fair, so for me, this looks nude.  The color is very pretty, particularly in patent leather.I love Cole Haan shoes.  They hold up well, and they are usually pretty comfortable.  I know I'm going to enjoy these for years and they are going to match everything.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08186471", "1": "0.33998516", "2": "0.09411847", "3": "0.18254751", "4": "0.0649394", "5": "0.05623343", "6": "0.18031129"}}
