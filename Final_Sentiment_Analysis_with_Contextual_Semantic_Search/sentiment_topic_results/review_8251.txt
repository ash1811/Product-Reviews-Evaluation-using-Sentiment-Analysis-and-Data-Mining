{"text": "like many of you this is not my first pair of levi Strauss jeans and this won't be my last. i bought this pair to replace my old pair of 569's that i have really seen better days. levi's are the only jean that i have worn that actually can last and make the high price worth the money. I'm not wearing my jeans so that i can just sit in my chair i work for a major hardware retailer and everyday I'm beating my jeans up. so quality to me is no.1. also the fit on the 569 loose straights are exactly as the sound their comfortable to wear all day long.  i would highly recommend that anyone where this or any other pair of levi's jeans.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.061744113", "1": "0.27373943", "4": "0.2415012", "5": "0.24607022", "6": "0.1721608"}}
