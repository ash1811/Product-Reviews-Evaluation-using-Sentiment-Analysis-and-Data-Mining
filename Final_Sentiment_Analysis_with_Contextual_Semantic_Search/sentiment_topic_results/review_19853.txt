{"text": "This is great for my wide band rings!  Outside is like a smooth grain black leather - not sure what material is but it looks like leather-ish material.  Inside lining is felt and the foam padded slots allow you to put really wide band rings.  I just bought my second one this company (Caddy Bay Collection) and am happy.  Only complaint is that I wish they gave the option to have delivered to a PO Box as it is very difficult to get my packages via ups.  The reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the quality is just fine but not expensive quality and I feel like it is just a bit over-priced.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20357037", "1": "0.409685", "2": "0.22440444", "4": "0.12301979", "6": "0.034601018"}}
