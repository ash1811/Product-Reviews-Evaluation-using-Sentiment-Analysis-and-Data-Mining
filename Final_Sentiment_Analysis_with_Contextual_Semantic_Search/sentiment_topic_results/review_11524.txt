{"text": "After reading all the reviews posted on Amazon about this and many other vests I bought this one in black in a medium.  I wear a size small to medium in tops, and medium in coats and vests, and a medium in this vest fit perfectly.  The fabric is of medium (not light and not heavy)  weight and is very warm.  The cut is trim, slimming, and not bulky, and the collar looks nice and lays down if you don't zip it up too far.  I will probably never dry it in the dryer in case of shrinkage, because it fits perfectly now.  The length is good--not too short--vests shouldn't be too short I think (the picture shows it as rather short).  I plan to buy it in a few other colors because the black doesn't look good with my blue jeans.Here is my update on the navy vest I ordered after I received the perfect black vest: I ordered the exact same vest in the same medium size from JOES USA here on Amazon, because a navy medium wasn't available from Amazon Prime in the 2 day shipping, etc, and it took about a week to receive and was WAY big on me...fit like an XXL, not a medium.  Very strange.  I am now trying to return it.  If I have any problems returning it I'll add that as well, and leave both the vest and the seller a 1 star.  Seriously, you may want to be aware that the sizing from this seller is totally different.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.124689765", "1": "0.42536664", "2": "0.15401754", "3": "0.10121739", "4": "0.058500025", "5": "0.051328573", "6": "0.08488009"}}
