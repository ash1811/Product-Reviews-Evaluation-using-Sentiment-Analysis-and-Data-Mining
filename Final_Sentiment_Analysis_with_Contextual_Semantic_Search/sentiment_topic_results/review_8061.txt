{"text": "I bought this as a replacement for my other order.My size is usually a 10.5 and i ordered such. When that arrived it was loose and uncomfortable. This made me order another pair half a size smaller. The second order arrived and it was great in terms of comfort and perceived quality.So if your going to get one, try a smaller size first to prevent hassles in returning.Since i live overseas i cant return this without taking a big hit on shipping thus the 4 stars instead of 5", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.33247727", "1": "0.2777805", "2": "0.057868145", "3": "0.16730022", "4": "0.06919318", "6": "0.09257107"}}
