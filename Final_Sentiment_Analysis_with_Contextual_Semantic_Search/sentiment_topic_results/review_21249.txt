{"text": "I have been searching for a shoe to help the arch pain I get from being on my feet at work.  I read the reviews on these and thought I would give them a try.  I have had Saucony shoes before and love them.  I did buy the Superfeet insoles to go in them but this is still a very well made shoe.  I noticed less pain from the moment I put them on.  I would highly recommend these to anyone needing a good walking shoe.  I will be buying this style from now on. I finally found a shoe that keeps my feet happy :)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.11318691", "2": "0.22990797", "3": "0.23804544", "4": "0.18023878", "5": "0.17800748", "6": "0.057741746"}}
