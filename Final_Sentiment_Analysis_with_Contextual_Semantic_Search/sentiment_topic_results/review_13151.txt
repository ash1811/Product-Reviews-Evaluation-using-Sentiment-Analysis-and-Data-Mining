{"text": "I was very pleased with these fingerless gloves.  They're not too thin, but not too thick.  At first glance, I was worried that they wouldn't fit on my larger hands, but they stretched easily and without creating gaps in the material.  You can't beat the price for these at Gravity Trader at $2.49/pr.  I bought 3 pairs.  Other sellers, some on Amazon.com, are asking $6.00+ for the same item.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14525993", "1": "0.22802493", "2": "0.09633481", "4": "0.21805273", "5": "0.22701964", "6": "0.08094609"}}
