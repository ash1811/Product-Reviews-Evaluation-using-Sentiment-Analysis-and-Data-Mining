{"text": "I like this shoe so much that this is my 2nd pair although I sold my boat years ago.  The first pair, 2 years old, is a bit beaten up but still worn for yard work and other household chores.These shoes are perfect for nice casual wear.  This color combination goes nicely with tan Dockers or jeans.  The fit is great, the support is good.  You can wear them all day in comfort.  This is my go-to shoe!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.039092913", "1": "0.41151458", "2": "0.11232259", "4": "0.1276337", "5": "0.186968", "6": "0.119277954"}}
