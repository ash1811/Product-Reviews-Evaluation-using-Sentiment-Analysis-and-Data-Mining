{"text": "I had never heard of this particular brand of shoe until I found them on Amazon.  I was in the market for a new pair of tennies and decided I'd give these a try (because of all the positive reviews I'd seen).  I love these shoes!  They are an awesome fit for me.  I never had to break them in as they were a perfect fit from the beginning.  They have great traction in wet conditions, are extremely flexible, and wash well.  I definitely recommend these shoes to those of you looking for a good hiking shoe especially, or just a good pair of all-purpose shoes.Update 12/3/11:  Still loving these shoes!  They came in handy during a vacation to coastal Maine a few weeks ago.  Great traction on wet rocks and snow covered trails.  Still just as comfortable (actually more so now that they're \"broken in\") as ever.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.105632275", "1": "0.28679895", "2": "0.19820696", "3": "0.31099832", "4": "0.09351045"}}
