{"text": "I have been a nurse for 30 years. My primary field has been ED. Until 4 months ago I wore the white Dickies painter pants. The fit my needs were comfortable and long lasting. Recently the new CNO decided that we should have a uniform appearance. I researched scrubs to find the ones that would fit my needs. These do. My walkie goes in the right leg pocket ( perfect fit) my trauma Fiskars go in the left top leg pocket leaving the lower pocket free for a shopping list when I go to Supply. The three belt loops allow me a belt for my multi tool and key clip.The zipper cuts down on time when the diuretic  kicks in. The fabric is heavier than some other scrubs I have seen and I had no shrinkage on the first wash and dry cycle. To top it all off they keep me looking like a professional. If you are and ED nurse or a hard working Nursing Supervisor I highly recommend these scrub pants.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08533986", "1": "0.18208136", "2": "0.133368", "3": "0.22733414", "4": "0.12384798", "5": "0.15401356", "6": "0.09401514"}}
