{"text": "These are classic fake black market CK underwear.  The label was really crude and they were incredibly small for a medium US size.  Very thin material as well.  Do not buy.  You will be disappointed. I will never buy clothing again on Amazon.  Plus 22 bucks for one pair!!!!  Zero stars!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2478276", "2": "0.26918274", "3": "0.2508861", "4": "0.05218403", "5": "0.17068471"}}
