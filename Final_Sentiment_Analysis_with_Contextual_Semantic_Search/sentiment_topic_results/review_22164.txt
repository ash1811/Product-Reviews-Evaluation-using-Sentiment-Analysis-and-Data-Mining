{"text": "This Tech Swiss aluminum storage box holds 8 of my watches very snugly.  I just put my watches around the black watch holders and place them back in one of the slots.  When all 8 are in there, they fit snugly - I'm not sure this would be the case if less than 8 were in the case; I don't think they would move that much, but having all 8 in there at once makes it much more secure.  The entire inside is made so that the watches can not get scratched in any manner - nice thick black felt.The lock is a positive and a negative.  First the positive - it has an unusual enough key that it wouldn't be too easy to try to get in the case.  Some keys, VAULTZ products come to mind, are so generic that almost anyone can get into their products.  That is not the situation of the keys to this case - it is unique.  The negative, if you want to travel with your watches on an airplane, this lock is not TSA Approved, so you would have to leave it unlocked, at least until you made it through the security check-point if you are carrying them on the airplane.Finally, I didn't give this item 5 stars because I believe it needs more padding to protect the watches.  There is just a thin layer of felt over cardboard over the inside of the case - certainly not enough to provide fall-proof protection for this watch box.  If the aluminum were to dent in a fall, this would surely go through to the watch contents inside.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.038082004", "1": "0.32451472", "2": "0.27359402", "3": "0.13746005", "4": "0.11982217", "5": "0.08376604", "6": "0.022760998"}}
