{"text": "I normally where slim fit 32 x 32 jeans, and these fit quite nice. My legs are more on the thinner side so I didn't have any problems of the legs feeling too tight as some other reviewers experienced. Material feels in between a jean and a chino which I don't mind. I got the red color and it is pretty true to what the photo represents. The color is more towards a darker red which I prefer, and not a bright fiesta kinda of red. Overall, I would probably buy another pair if I had to. Haven't washed them yet so I don't know how much they will shrink or fade in color, but for now they look and feel nice. I plan to wear the pants when I go golfing. Black shirt with the red pants seems like a great combo.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.093258634", "1": "0.49139675", "3": "0.08314241", "4": "0.052672096", "5": "0.059606433", "6": "0.21735276"}}
