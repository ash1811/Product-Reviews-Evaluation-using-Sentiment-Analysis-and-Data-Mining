{"text": "If you are one of those people that seems to have an ever increasing amount of items in your wallet no matter how much you throw out this your item.  Iy really hold a lot and is sectioned off nicely so you can get at those cards, lots of them, easily.  Has several windows for id's or pictures.  Only draw back is it made from something other that leather and has a limited life if you are using it all the time.  My first one lasted over a year and I really beat it up so it probably would hold up longer with slight care.  I have yet to find one that holds as many cardxs as this does or is as organized as well.  Amazon's price is fair andthis product is a good buy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3263825", "2": "0.14185542", "3": "0.31522426", "4": "0.15862647", "6": "0.052684925"}}
