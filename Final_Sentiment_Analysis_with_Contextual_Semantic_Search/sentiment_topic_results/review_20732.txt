{"text": "I was recently fitted at Nordstrom  and  Fantasie's bra size for me was 30G ( note that UK cup sizing, such as is Fantasie's, is different than US sizing).  I ordered up in band size to a 32, and down one cup size to a FF in this bra, knowing that because I won't wear it that often, the band won't stretch out with frequent wearings as all good fitting bras do.  FYI, going up one band size and down one cup size is a technique bra fitters often use; called \"sister sizing\".  Anyway...the band size was perfect but the cup size was still too large.  I returned the 32FF and ordered a 32F, and it is perfect!So, if you are a Fantasie (or even  Panache or Freya) wearer who's been professionally fitted, consider going up a band size and down at least one cup size.  This is a dream strapless bra for \"big girls\" on a small frame by the way!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.055071875", "1": "0.20340432", "2": "0.08514699", "3": "0.34935337", "4": "0.17771207", "5": "0.02416473", "6": "0.10514661"}}
