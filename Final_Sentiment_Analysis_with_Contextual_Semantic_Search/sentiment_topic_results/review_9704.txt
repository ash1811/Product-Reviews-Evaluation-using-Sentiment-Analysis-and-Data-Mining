{"text": "The straps are not only too wide to be stylish (imagine being a young person on a date and having THAT bra strap peek out...ugh), but the coverage of the bra encroaches far too inward toward the neckline, making it impossible to wear a tank top or low-cut shirt. The lace isn't sexy, it's just grandmotherly. And somehow, all the fabrics the whole bra is made of PILLS like mad. It's cheap and ugly, and offers no more comfort than a more attractive bra.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09042189", "1": "0.04027281", "2": "0.24445084", "3": "0.23356457", "5": "0.15256396", "6": "0.23539856"}}
