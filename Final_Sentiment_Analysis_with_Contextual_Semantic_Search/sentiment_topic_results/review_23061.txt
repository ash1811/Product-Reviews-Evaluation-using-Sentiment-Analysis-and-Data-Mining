{"text": "I ordered a pair of these to replace my 5 year old Reef Smoothy sandals, which are supportive and ridiculously comfortable.Unfortunately, the 2013 batch of sandals is very different from years past.  The new sandals are made with a flimsy strap, thinner and overly squishy foot bed, and plastic-y tread that damages easily.  You can spot the new ones because they have a fabric tag instead of a rubber tag.After 2 days of use I sent them back, as they were nothing like the Reefs I've enjoyed for the last 15 years.I called Reef and sent pictures, they verified them as authentic.  It's misleading that the pictures on amazon here are of the old models, and the price is the same, but you get the new lower-quality version instead.Hopefully they bring back the classic Reefs for 2014.  For now I'm buying up 2012 models on ebay and at local surf shops.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.086125605", "1": "0.27078572", "2": "0.20726536", "3": "0.1628655", "4": "0.1336188", "5": "0.1097821", "6": "0.029556895"}}
