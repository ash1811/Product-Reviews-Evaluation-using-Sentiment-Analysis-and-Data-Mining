{"text": "I really like this shoe, it's so comfortable.  The color (I ordered the red) is really rich and bright.  The pictures show the red as more raspberry, but in reality it's more crimson/cherry.  Which is fine, as it was what I was hoping for.The color is so strong, in fact, that it's rubbing off on my socks and feet!  But that's no problem, it'll wash out and the excess dye will eventually rub out of the shoe.The leather is genuine and soft, and the sole is durable.  Hopefully, these shoes will last me!  If they don't, I'll update my review.Overall, I recommend this shoe!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.030542513", "1": "0.16286077", "2": "0.29849398", "3": "0.23626603", "4": "0.12180078", "5": "0.097487524", "6": "0.0525484"}}
