{"text": "I ordered the black leather jungle moc and received a suede pair.  I called customer service and they said they would send  the black leather pair overnight.  When I opened the box, the shoes were BLACK SUEDE AGAIN.  I called customer service and the woman did not know the difference between suede and leather.  I am a server in a fine dining restaurant.  I cannot wear suede shoes.  I am returning these again.  A total waste of my time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13971058", "1": "0.066677116", "2": "0.24240181", "3": "0.43557158", "4": "0.1094113"}}
