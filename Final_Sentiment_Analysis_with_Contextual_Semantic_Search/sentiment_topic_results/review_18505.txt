{"text": "I have had this watch for about 10 years now and was just checking around to see if it is still made, and to my surprise it still is, which is good.  I have worn this watch to work almost everyday on from when I got to about 2006.  I stopped wearing it because my cell phone has a clock and was using that.  My wife took over the watch and started wearing it to work.  Her job involved putting her hands in water and chicken fat daily throughout the day.  I thought well that's it for my Swiss Army watch.  Needless to say about 6 months ago I took on a job where I needed a wrist watch.  I found my old watch, the leather band I had put on it was destroyed and the watch was not working.  I brought to my local watch guy and told him to replace the battery.  At first with the new battery nothing happened, watch didn't work.  I told him, the contacts are probably dirty, the watch has been through hell. He took the battery out cleaned the contacts and put the battery back in. Voila, the watch is keeping perfect time!  While I was there I purchased a new band and he cleaned the watch up for me with whatever they use.  With the new band and the cleanup, the watch looks brand new again.  He only charged for the battery, $5, and a new black leather band, $18.  You cannot kill this watch. If this one every really broke, I would not hesitate to buy another in a heartbeat.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11834308", "1": "0.17247523", "2": "0.18259323", "3": "0.15977465", "4": "0.122537725", "5": "0.08664949", "6": "0.1576266"}}
