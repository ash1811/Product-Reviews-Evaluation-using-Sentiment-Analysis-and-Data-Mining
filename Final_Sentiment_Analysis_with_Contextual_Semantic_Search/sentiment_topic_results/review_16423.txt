{"text": "Don't leave home without it.Of all the pieces of U.S. military kit I've ever seen (through 20+ years of miltiary service), none equal the Wubbie for value for money, utility, and comfort.The original idea was a quilted, water resistant blanket that could be attached to a poncho (hence the bits of string on the corners and edges) to make a warm weather sleeping bag. Yes, I've actually heard of people doing this, but this is such a limited vision of what the Wubbie is capable of.Picnic blanket, quilt, bedspread, couch cover, used by itself as a sleeping back, in survival kits, for air travel, pet beds (with or without human consent) etc. I used to keep mine by the couch for siesta time, but it kept getting stolen. In Germany, soldiers would take an unlined rainjacket and a poncho liner to the tailor and get the best cold-wet weather jacket in the world back.If the camo is an issue, it is available in solid black and olive green, but I don't care about the appearance.My Wubbie is not for sale or trade. Get your own and keep your paws off mine!E. M.
