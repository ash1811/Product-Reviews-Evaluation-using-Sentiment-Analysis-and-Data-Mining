{"text": "** PLEASE NOTE **  I was new to amazon at the time I posted this review, and was angry about the shipping time (and still am).  My previous low rating of the product should not have been influenced by the seller/shipper's ineptness.  Please accept my apology.  The product is of very high quality, and the fit is great.  It's a little stiff because it's very thick and warm--so I've opted to wear PolarTec thermals underneath my motorcycle rain suit (motorcycle rain suits are one-piece, and have a high collar at the neck--so there is nowhere for cold air, rain, or snow to penetrate) although I don't only wear my foul weather gear on the bike.  I also enjoy hiking in the mountains in very foul weather, and the Carhartt biberalls are a little restrictive for that.  The PolarTec thermals under the motorcycle rain suit provide great mobility.  The Carhartt biberalls would be best suited to riding an outdoor tractor, ATV, or working outside when walking many miles up and down hills isn't part of the job.  Merry Christmas to all, and a Happy New Year.  Below is my original post:The product is of very high quality.  The problem is that I ordered it when the weather was very cold.  It took so long to ship that the weather was warm by the time the biberall came.  I should have ordered a bathing suit!  I'm sorry for not being able to try it out before writing this review, but I haven't been able to use it.  I should have purchased it from cabellas.  They get things to me very quickly.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12781134", "1": "0.15466547", "2": "0.16205576", "3": "0.13506214", "4": "0.08978933", "5": "0.18935324", "6": "0.14126271"}}
