{"text": "Slipper was too big, but due to sizing of 12-13, and I wear a 12, that was understandable.  However, the inside of the slipper felt weird.  Not like the fleece it appeared to be, but very synthetic and ultra smooth, like I was walking on sliding fabric.  Hard to describe but that with the too big feeling and the all synthetic fabric added up to &#34;no better than a cheap department store slipper.&#34;Amazon is very easy for returns though.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06854266", "1": "0.18218225", "2": "0.11711994", "3": "0.09177864", "4": "0.11709787", "5": "0.25781593", "6": "0.1654627"}}
