{"text": "When it comes to technology, I am a utilitarian.  In other words, I don't want to spend money on a bunch of features that I don't really need.  I remember wearing a watch just like this as a kid during the 1980s, and it served its purpose just fine.  It also lasted a long, long time.  So when I needed a cheap watch to wear while exercising, I decided to buy the same kind that worked for me all those years ago.What you get here is a durable and tough watch that will tell you what time it is and beep when it's time to wake up.  It'll also work underwater.  That's about all it does.  If this set of features is what you want, this watch is probably the absolute best value available.If you like no-frills, plain-and-simple-tried-and-true products, sporting a watch like this is a good way to show it!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03254015", "1": "0.22053678", "2": "0.20964995", "3": "0.07538115", "4": "0.16391541", "5": "0.18395902", "6": "0.1140175"}}
