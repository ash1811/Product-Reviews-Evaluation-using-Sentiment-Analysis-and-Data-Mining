{"text": "This is a very nice tote bag but only had \"1\" large zipper pocket inside the large main compartment instead of \"2\" zipper pockets as advertized. It does have a cell phone pocket, another smaller pocket and key fob on the inside.  The picture of the inside looked like it included a mesh zipped pocket, which it does not.  I guess this is the older bag instead of the updated one which is disappointing as things will fall out of the two small pockets easily when the top is turned down.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12677222", "1": "0.34275383", "2": "0.18576716", "3": "0.10260605", "4": "0.1382306", "6": "0.101064384"}}
