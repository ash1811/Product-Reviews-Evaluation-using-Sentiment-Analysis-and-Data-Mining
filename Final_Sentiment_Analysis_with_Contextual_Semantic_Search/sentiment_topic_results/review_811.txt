{"text": "I ordered a black shaper tank from self expressions in a med (from amazon) and it was less expensive than THIS one.  It fits perfects..no see through, flawless, no need to wear a bra.  They didn't have white available in self expressions,  so I tried this, expecting better quality than the cheaper black one? nope. A med was to large..the material that is supposed to smooth your tummy at the bottom is actually quite see through.  If this does not bother you, atleast order a size down for extra smoothing.  Also the top is completely see through so a bra must be worn.  Defeats the purpose for a shaper. I returned and hope for white to come along from other seller", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.019408118", "1": "0.1787812", "2": "0.11723619", "3": "0.37399897", "4": "0.11955385", "5": "0.09639079", "6": "0.094630875"}}
