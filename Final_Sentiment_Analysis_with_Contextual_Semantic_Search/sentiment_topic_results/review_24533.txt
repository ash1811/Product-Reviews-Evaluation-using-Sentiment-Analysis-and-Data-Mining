{"text": "I bought this to layer under high-waisted skirts or pants and lace tops. I ordered a medium that fits well - I probably could have gone with a small, but I didn't want to risk awkward underwear lines. I'm 5'3&#34; 130lbs and the length of the medium is good and the waist is tight enough to layer well. I only wish that this had a shelf bra - since I like to layer it, wearing a bra is just kind of inconvenient.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.44080943", "2": "0.16285881", "3": "0.27256763", "4": "0.04708917", "5": "0.07000172"}}
