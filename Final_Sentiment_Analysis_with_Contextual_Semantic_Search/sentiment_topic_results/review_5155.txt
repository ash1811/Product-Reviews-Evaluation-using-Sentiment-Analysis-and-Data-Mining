{"text": "Love the color and feel.  It is my fault for picking the wrong size. I had been buying boots and found that I really needed an 8 to get in and feel comfortable. So ...I can't recall if this came in 1/2 size??  but ... I went for the 8.  My usual shoe size is a 7 1/2.It is gradually conforming to my feet and maybe? if I pull the string??  it will fit a bit better?.  I really love the suede Mocassin. . I had a pair when I was younger and lived in them. ( I go barefoot a lot.)... and my husband dislikes this for safety sake... this is safer, and still feels much like going barefoot! So we both win.  Get your regular size if it comes in 1/2 sizes. if not go bigger and hope it conforms more to  your foot? I am hoping........", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18735522", "1": "0.20846616", "2": "0.09634901", "3": "0.24191827", "4": "0.08364979", "5": "0.094134696", "6": "0.08812684"}}
