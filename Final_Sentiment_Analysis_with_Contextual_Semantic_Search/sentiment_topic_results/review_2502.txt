{"text": "I ordered a pair for my spouse in his normal size and they were a tad bit to small.  so, I went back and ordered the next size up in waist.  When they came they were the same waist size as the previous pair but longer.  Both pants have the same size for length, so this isn't my ordering mistake.  Rather they are several sizes to small!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.3289295", "1": "0.19510832", "3": "0.16117841", "4": "0.04716781", "6": "0.25837103"}}
