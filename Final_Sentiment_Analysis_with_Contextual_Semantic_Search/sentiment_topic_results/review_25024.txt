{"text": "I just purchased these sandals but I wanted to get a review out there for others considering this style.I  generally wear a size 6 in most types of footwear.My feet basically look just like Fred Flintstones feet.They are short,wide and stubby! I ordered my Coconuts in a size 6 nude beige. I feel they run a little short.I am going too keep them but I wish that I had went for a 6 1/2. The color is tan-ish beige.It matches my skin tone exactly, not really the look I was going for.Quality wise my initial impression finds them a bit over priced. The leather is thin.I'm not sure how they will hold up to daily wear. They are super comfy out of the box.The sandals also have some small details that are interesting...The innersoles are dark so they don't show dirt or get that dark imprint light colored sandals get.The outer soles have a really pretty floral print on them. Also the packaging is unique and upscale. The sandals are individually bagged in bags made from corn ( they look like plastic bags  )Overall here are my pros and cons :CONS* Expensive* Sizing runs small* Color is odd* Leather is thinPros* Super comfy innersoles* Innersoles are dark* Closed toe hides unsightly toenails* A few cute extra details", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21565129", "1": "0.15830563", "2": "0.079548284", "3": "0.16630988", "5": "0.22839804", "6": "0.14958137"}}
