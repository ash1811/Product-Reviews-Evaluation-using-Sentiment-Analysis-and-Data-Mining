{"text": "This Timex \"Classic Camper Watch\" is about a basic as a watch gets these days and that is exactly what I wanted for knocking around the workshop or hiking in the woods. Here are my observations:Pros -+ Good Quality; looks and feels solid+ Low Profile; very thin band (but see \"Cons\" below) and body so it does not tend to catch on things+ Lightweight; east to forget that it is even on your wrist+ Accurate; keeps good time+ Glow in the Dark Hands; a useful feature in a watchCons -- Flimsy Band; the material is very thin and flops around when trying to put it on, but works well once clasped- Small Face; while like good for teens or smaller framed men, it is a little lost on my \"beefy\" wristsMisc -* Battery is preinstalledRecommended!CFH", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.22084296", "1": "0.17395146", "2": "0.2037583", "3": "0.09482497", "4": "0.14981952", "5": "0.049336355", "6": "0.10746647"}}
