{"text": "Wanting something to slip on when I have to take the trash out, or go outside for the mail, or water garden, I wanted a sturdy shoe that can get dirty and clean easily.  These fit that bill.  They are also a prime choice for my &#34;utilitarian&#34; [read:wide] feet.  The foot bed has the nubs, which are a little odd on the bottom on my feet, but I find if I wear a pair of socks with these, then the nubs are quite cozy.  Without the socks, the nubs feel good in some places and too much in other parts of my feet.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18373089", "1": "0.40691534", "2": "0.07317992", "4": "0.17657138", "5": "0.12785994", "6": "0.028934473"}}
