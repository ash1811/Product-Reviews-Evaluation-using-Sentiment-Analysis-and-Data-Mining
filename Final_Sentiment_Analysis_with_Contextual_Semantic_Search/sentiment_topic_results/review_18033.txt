{"text": "I bought this for my 13-year-old son.  He has a small wrist, but I'm sure he will be growing.  This fully velcroed band is perfect!  The directions are written very small, and are thus difficult to read, but I was able to figure it out and set this watch.  He loves that it tells time in different zones, though you have to push a button to get to this feature.  He would have liked to have the European time zone displayed continually.  You can only display the day and date or the digital time continually.  This watch also has a timer and can store phone numbers.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05929735", "1": "0.096948296", "2": "0.24489832", "3": "0.08461268", "4": "0.2731199", "5": "0.07128526", "6": "0.1698382"}}
