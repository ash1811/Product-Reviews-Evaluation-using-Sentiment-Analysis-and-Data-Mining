{"text": "I love these, because I can discreetly breastfeed ANYWHERE. I put on a t-shirt and always know that only about 1/2&#34; of my skin will be showing. It's fantastic. But, they are SNUG. I bought them to my measurements and when baby was first born, I found them WAY too tight for my very full breasts. They were hard to get on and off. Luckily a friend gave me hers, 2 sizes larger, which were more comfortable when I needed the extra room. Now, baby is 3 months old and I find the ones that &#34;fit&#34; more comfortable.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21834761", "1": "0.27394888", "3": "0.051875822", "4": "0.06850811", "5": "0.2606187", "6": "0.123774625"}}
