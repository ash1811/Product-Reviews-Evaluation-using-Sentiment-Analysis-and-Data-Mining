{"text": "The Invicta Grand Diver 3045 is a very large, solid watch.  I think they made them specifically for football players and Navy Seals.  You'll see what I mean if you take a look at the picture I've attached of my husband wearing it - he's 6'3\" and 185 pounds.  He put it on and mentioned the need to start weight lifting.The silvery blue of the watch face is brilliant and very eye-catching. This is definitely a sporty watch, and you wouldn't wear it with any kind of business or formal clothing. I look at this watch and the feel is one of wearing it out on a boat with blue waters and bright sunlight and...the person wearing it is Alex O'Loughlin of Hawaii Five-O.  The funny thing is that Daniel Dae Kim wears one that is more in line with this watch.  See pics on imdb from Hawaii Five-O.The luminous phosphorescent glow on this watch is wonderful.  It does run a few seconds fast in a day.All in all, a beefy watch!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15678346", "1": "0.061429303", "2": "0.18878669", "3": "0.113377586", "4": "0.1602848", "5": "0.19378501", "6": "0.12555318"}}
