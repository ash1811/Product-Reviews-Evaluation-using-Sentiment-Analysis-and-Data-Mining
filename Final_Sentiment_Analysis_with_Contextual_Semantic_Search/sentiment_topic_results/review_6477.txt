{"text": "I bought a pair of these and their tennis socks just a couple months back and paid a whopping $15 each. Now these are $11 and the tennis socks are $10. I will say these are very good socks, very soft and comfortable after a few washings. The tennis socks are crap though. The balled up with lint and are falling apart. I can't wear them with shorts because they look s__ty and feel as bad.I would recommend these at the now $11 price. They are very comfortable for walking or hiking.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11796894", "1": "0.3571694", "2": "0.08847071", "4": "0.13987628", "5": "0.20015883", "6": "0.09309304"}}
