{"text": "I had ordered another brand of wool socks for winter time over seas but after a few wearings I couldn't wear them anymore.  I have small feet (5.5 shoe size) an the other socks had started bunching up every time I walked.  Very annoying.  Most places didn't offer a smaller sock so I took a chance when I found these.  They're not super heavy but they fit and I find them warm and comfortable.  great for people who don't want a super heavy sock and who have a smaller foot size.  I'd get these again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10412683", "1": "0.30008665", "2": "0.06026448", "3": "0.19553688", "5": "0.25761902", "6": "0.079546854"}}
