{"text": "An expensive lesson.  I ordered an 11 in white to fit my womans 8 shoe.  After they were washed I could not get them on.  They are way too small and I thought they were left here by our grandson.  I just now realized they must be the Thorlo I had ordered.I received the wrong sock.  The ones I have are all white and seem to be the woman's sock that has cotton in it, which might explain why it shrank.  I will contact Amazon to see if anything can be done.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03665734", "1": "0.2563899", "2": "0.1588225", "3": "0.16454633", "4": "0.15546608", "5": "0.16511002", "6": "0.06300784"}}
