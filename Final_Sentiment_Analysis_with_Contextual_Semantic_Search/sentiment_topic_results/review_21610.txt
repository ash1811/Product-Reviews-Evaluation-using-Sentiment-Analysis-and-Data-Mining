{"text": "I got this jacket for myself. I felt it was a little overpriced, considering others that had different color schemes were less expensive. This jacket does just what I want - it really keeps me warm! It gets cold in Colorado in winter, and this jacket is perfect for those really biting cold days. It doesn't have a hat, but I didn't want one, so that works well for me. I really like this color, and it doesn't get dirty easily, which was a concern of mine. I can't think of any negatives, except possibly the price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09068196", "1": "0.48902833", "2": "0.17468128", "3": "0.19632427", "6": "0.043434266"}}
