{"text": "I am so disappointed, this bra is way too small for me and there is no way that I can comfortably wear it.I ordered it in the same exact size as my other bras that I wear everyday - (44DD) - and it is so tight around my shouldersand my back that it practically cuts off my circulation! Now I have to go through the hassle of sending it back. *SIGH*Bra's might be one thing that I am going to have to actually try on before I make a purchase; this is a lot of money tospend (for me!) on a bra that I have to send back!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.027593713", "1": "0.32233042", "2": "0.05510412", "3": "0.35919988", "5": "0.1701245", "6": "0.062365558"}}
