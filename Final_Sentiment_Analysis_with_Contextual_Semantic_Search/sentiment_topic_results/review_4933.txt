{"text": "I needed a pair of shoes for a trip to China. Shoes that would be good for extensive walking, but also dressy enough to wear with khakis and a nice shirt, too. A coworker recommended Ecco shoes, and I looked at the various offerings at Amazon.The Seawalker oxford met my qualifications. However, I have had mixed experiences with buying shoes online. I like to try them on first, to check for comfort and fit. My foot size is around a 12 (US), but different brands and models sometimes require a half-size up or down.After selecting this model, I went to several local stores in Nashville, TN, and found two that carried the Ecco Seawalker. One store also had the color I wanted.The size that fit me is a European 45, which is cross-referenced as a 11 to 11-1/2 in US sizes.I noticed that the quality of construction is quite good. Since the clerk was so helpful in finding the right size and fit, I purchased them at the store rather than online. Yeah, I paid almost $200 for them retail, but I feel a responsibility to pay for services rendered. (My next pair will be an online purchase, probably, now that I know my size.)After I got the shoes home, I replaced the insoles with a pair from some New Balance sneakers, size 12. These insoles were an almost perfect match with the Seawalker insoles. Note that the Seawalker insoles are pretty good on their own, but the sneaker insoles are more cushioned.My trip to China included maybe two miles of walking a day, and the Seawalkers were totally up to the task. The rubber soles gripped even wet glossy (and slippery) surfaces, and they were comfortable all day. They climbed the Great Wall just fine, too.I can highly recommend these shoes for multipurpose use, and expect to get a great deal of use out of them. Now back in the States, I wear them almost daily, and this is a change for a guy who has historically worn New Balance running shoes daily.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.02299458", "1": "0.10560197", "2": "0.2654847", "3": "0.048306163", "4": "0.1405346", "5": "0.16600223", "6": "0.25107574"}}
