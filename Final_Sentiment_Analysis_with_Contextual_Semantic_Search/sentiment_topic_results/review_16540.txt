{"text": "I am beyond disappointed by this wallet.  I specifically looked for one that held a checkbook.  This one has a checkbook holder, but it doesn't fit in the wallet once you actually put the checkbook in.  Also, there is no plastic film, how in gods name should I write my checks?  Once the checkbook is added, you can't close the wallet.In addition, the credit card slots - aren't even and not all hold the credit cards.  REALLY?!What a waste of money, I'm sorry I ever bought it", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13890082", "1": "0.07745816", "2": "0.24642979", "3": "0.15260696", "4": "0.13969302", "5": "0.12205431", "6": "0.122856945"}}
