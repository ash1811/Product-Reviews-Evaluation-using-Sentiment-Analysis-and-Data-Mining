{"text": "Regular fit, straight leg, zipper jeans is about all I wear. I usually wear Wrangler & I usually get them at Wal-Mart. That's about the cheapest place to get them. HOWEVER, lately Wal-Mart seems to only carry jeans for only very tall, skinney guys, or very short huge wasted guys. I take 36-29. I could go to Boot Barn & get what I need but their price is way more than I can afford. I ordered these Lee jeans from Amazon for convenience & I'm very happy with them. The fit & sizing is just about the same as Wrangler. So is the fabric. The front pockets are a little bit bigger which is a plus for me. I spent my whole life in Levi's until a few years ago when they changed something in the way they're cut in the seat. My wife said I always looked like I had a load in my pants with Levi's.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is due to the positioning of the belt loops in front. I wear Perry suspenders. The kind that clip to the belt. The front loops are too close together to fit both suspender clips & a belt buckle. So, the right clip I have to put to the right of the belt loop & it causes a tendancy for the suspender strap to work off my shoulder. So if you don't need to wear suspenders, call this a 5 star rating. Quality of materials, stitching, etc. is as good as any.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06685887", "1": "0.27569187", "2": "0.042573314", "3": "0.2017179", "4": "0.19547974", "5": "0.11168624", "6": "0.10599208"}}
