{"text": "This is a well designed bag. I particularly like the \"D\" SHAPED ZIPPER on the top that allows better access to the contents than a straight zipper would. The end compartments are nice and the pull handles on the ends also come in handy. It is generously sized. Since others have reported the dimensions I will not comment further than saying the \"med\" is more than I need. The fabric seems fairly durable; but the zippers are somewhat light weight.. This bag should hold up well for caring clothing.If you need a bag that is heavier weight (as I do for caring equipment) I suggest you check out the Mountainsmith Travel Trunk line. The have heavier material and zippers. They also have compression straps to back up the main zipper. They do not have The \"D\" zipper or end pockets however, and they cost more.http://www.amazon.com/Mountainsmith-Travel-Trunk-Red-Medium/dp/B0037WLEDK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s;=sporting-goods&qid;=1279651810&sr;=8-2-spellI rate the Outdoor Products bag 5 stars for its combination of utility, construction and price point ($26 for medium), even though for what I need the Mountainsmith turns out to be a more appropriate choice.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.059119016", "1": "0.2585407", "2": "0.13644214", "3": "0.15056895", "4": "0.11927249", "5": "0.17953469", "6": "0.096522056"}}
