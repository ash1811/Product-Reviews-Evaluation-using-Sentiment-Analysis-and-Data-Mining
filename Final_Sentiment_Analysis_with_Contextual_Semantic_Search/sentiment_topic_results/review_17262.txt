{"text": "I first saw this shoe in the store while looking for something to wear to work. It is impressive in it's support of the foot but also in comfort. Those two don't often go together. With slacks, this shoe looks sleek and neat-almost like a boot.I like the soft collar around the opening; it makes the shoe really easy to put on and keeps it in place as well. They are strong but not stiff. Good arch support and plenty of room in the toe box. Especially good for cold weather. The sole has good tread so I feel safe in rain or even when it's icy. I wear these for dress wear with black slacks and can go anywhere.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.037963767", "1": "0.31269652", "2": "0.08005925", "3": "0.28129917", "4": "0.09430328", "5": "0.057775375", "6": "0.13590264"}}
