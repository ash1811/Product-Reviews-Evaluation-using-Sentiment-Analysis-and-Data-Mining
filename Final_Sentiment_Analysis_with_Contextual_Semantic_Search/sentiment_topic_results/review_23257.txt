{"text": "I've owned many of these through three pregnancies. I do think it runs a bit small, so I wear mediums. It's a very light support bra...if you are bigger busted or looking for some staying-power, this is probably not for you.  But, for those of us that just need a little support or need something to hold nursing pads in place at night, this is comfy and works well.  I will say, whatever supplied provided the Amazon items for this particular order, the packaging was in a foreign language. I couldn't read it to double check the sizing guide on the back of the package before opening it.  Not a huge deal, but annoying.  I also think at least one of the two was opened and re-closed with packing tape.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07960006", "1": "0.10360631", "2": "0.07630496", "3": "0.40169325", "4": "0.0991898", "5": "0.050014812", "6": "0.18959083"}}
