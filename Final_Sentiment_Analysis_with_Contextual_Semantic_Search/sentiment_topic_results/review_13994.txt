{"text": "I love this watch.  I bought it based on internet research only, never saw one in person before.  It looks a lot better live than in the pictures.  It's got a great weight and feel to it, even if the crown is a tad bit protruding, although the fine polish makes it seem less so than the pictures.  Adjusting the time, day & date is very straight forward.  The band is darker than all the pictures I saw, for which I'm glad, and it's comfortable and tough looking.  So far no mechanical defaults whatsoever.  My only real complaint about this sharp, well-made watch is that the seconds hand does not align with the minute markers on the face.  Even so, I'm very satisfied with this watch.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15814899", "1": "0.35524926", "2": "0.14948249", "3": "0.0656188", "4": "0.098450705", "6": "0.1709046"}}
