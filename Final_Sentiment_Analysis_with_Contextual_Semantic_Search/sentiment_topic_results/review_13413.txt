{"text": "I love these shoes, however, Easy Spirit needs to do something about the sizing. I have tried on many of these shoes in stores. Every color had a different feel in the SAME Size. I bought the black ones a few years back because they felt good, and I sized down to a 9. They were a little roomy so I put an insert from a sneaker I wasn't using inside the shoe and it was like walking on air.Now I bought a pair from Amazon, also a 9 in black. These fit more snugly and I definitely cannot add another insert to them.  They are comfortable, but not &#34;cloud 9.&#34;  I do not know why Easy Spirit cannot have uniform sizing.Amazon's price is great, as is their service. I will keep these.  Just wanted to tell others to watch their sizing.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.094563656", "1": "0.20377766", "2": "0.13636267", "3": "0.16095617", "4": "0.20769872", "5": "0.057992954", "6": "0.13864818"}}
