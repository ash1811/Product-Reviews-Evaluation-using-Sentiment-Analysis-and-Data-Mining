{"text": "I don't wear watches much but I needed to know what time it was at my previous job.  I just bought the cheapest watch I could find, but it actually turned out to be really nice.  At least 3 random customers said, &#34;Oh I like your watch&#34; and were surprised when I told them that it was just $9.  It's been soaked and submerged in water and is still going strong.  It's super slim and comfortable, I hardly even notice that I'm wearing a watch (those massive $200 watches look ridiculous anyway).  If you just need a simple watch to keep track of time, this is perfect.  Even if it breaks, you smash it, etc.  You can just replace it for another $9.  I would definitely buy it again.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03879601", "1": "0.30614516", "2": "0.3490067", "4": "0.06672961", "5": "0.059142265", "6": "0.17793404"}}
