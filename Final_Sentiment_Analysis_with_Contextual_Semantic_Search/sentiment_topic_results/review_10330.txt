{"text": "I walk everyday for several hours in a wooded state park. Since I have various problems with my feet, I've always had trouble finding shoes that aren't painful after a few hours of walking. I've only had these for a few weeks but they have really pleased my feet. Really comfy with plenty of support. A real improvement. I like them so much I've ordered another pair to keep clean and wear other places besides the woods. I normally wear a 9M. I wouldn't order up. I got a 9M and they fit fine. The waterproofing works. I've been in a few inches of snow, mud, soggy leaves, and a pretty good rain. Feet stayed dry and I kept my traction. I can't speak to how fast they wear out yet.  I'll try to remember to update this in a few months. If I don't get lost in the woods.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.046966296", "1": "0.26611528", "2": "0.1446969", "3": "0.24816085", "4": "0.09563541", "5": "0.17820483", "6": "0.02022038"}}
