{"text": "When it has came down to what Invicta has made in watches, they definitely have stayed ahead of the pack. Not just in class, but in design for the young and the old as well. That has shown more with anyone who wants the over-sized watches, like their Subaqua series, but their classics work very well in that write with their Pro Diver series in automatic watches. This delightful two-tone automatic works well not just in class, but by design in the heart of the matter. It is a very classy watch that works well from the heart. It is very easy to setup, and fits comfortably around the wrist, and is easy to wind. What I don't like though about the timepiece is that the unidirectional bezel can sometimes stick, but the illuminant hands and display works brilliantly on the wrist. If you want to go ahead and step into a Invicta watch, this is a great beginners piece to go to.Price: BSetup & Comfort: B 1/2-Overall: B 1/2-", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16807085", "1": "0.15348166", "2": "0.18469754", "3": "0.14473678", "4": "0.03630052", "5": "0.1646005", "6": "0.14811212"}}
