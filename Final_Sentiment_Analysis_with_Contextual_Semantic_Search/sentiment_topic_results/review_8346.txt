{"text": "Got this in a lovely hot fuschia color (much brighter IRL, which I love) on sale! So pleased with it. Fits true to size, and feels so soft and comfortable. Would love to get in every color if I could afford it...Edit - Got my second pair in white pearl and the leather is a bit scaly, feels like it would flake off easily. Color is more of a cream/beige than pure white. But still a lovely shoe and for the price ($35) for SE I won't complain.Edit - Got horrible color runs on the hot fuschia pair! But I guess I should have known better than to wear them out on a rainy day.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06046915", "1": "0.21373248", "2": "0.12001887", "3": "0.1078231", "4": "0.13765442", "5": "0.3580594"}}
