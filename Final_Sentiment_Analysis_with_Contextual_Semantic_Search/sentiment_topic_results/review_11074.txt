{"text": "Wonder why Acorn cannot make their products more accurate.  I have worn these more than half my life, but now they come in confusing sizing and since I wear a small or X small I am out of luck.  These were XXS and they fit my husband, man's size 8.5-9!!  Shoot and I was looking forward to them!  Thus the 3 stars - great product, but clearly meant for bigfoot and his family :)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.051213045", "1": "0.21510915", "2": "0.1574918", "3": "0.22879526", "4": "0.119605444", "5": "0.12016004", "6": "0.10762524"}}
