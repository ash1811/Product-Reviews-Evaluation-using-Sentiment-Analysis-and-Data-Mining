{"text": "Edited review:I've noticed that with consistent use of this bra that the lace and stuff edges of the bottom of band get somewhat scratchy and irritating after awhile. I'm hoping that laundering the product may help the fabric relax a bit. The top lace edge of the cups can also show up some under some fabrics so it is not a perfect t-shirt bra.Original review:Fits well. Seems to be seamless. The lace at the top edge helps prevent gapping and visible seams at the top edge of the cup. I'm noticing that the straps seem not to lie completely flat at the inner scalloped edges but will update if this becomes a bigger problem. Overall, very pleased and would try other bras by this manufacturer too. During the first hour of consistent use of this bra, I became concerned that the straps would dig into the sides near my underarm. They did for about half an hour but seemed to relax after that. The straps are somewhat wide-set so if you have narrow or curved (bad posture) shoulders, they could be problematic.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.063732006", "1": "0.15960607", "2": "0.09542867", "3": "0.25700682", "4": "0.09194616", "5": "0.15559694", "6": "0.17668335"}}
