{"text": "fits perfectly even though I have slightly high arches and not exactly narrow feet. The materials are good quality and overall you hardly feel any weight on your feet. The heel part of the sole is designed interestingly, it accommodates a slightly angles heel stride which is great for running. Just feels a little odd when you first put them on. Maybe it's a standard thing with running shoes. I just wasn't used to it but it feel just right when you are out and running. Nothing pokes my foot inside in any way, nothing rubs uncomfortably. Perfect shoe for me.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06704301", "1": "0.20541812", "2": "0.08738893", "3": "0.106598765", "4": "0.1694299", "5": "0.19629407", "6": "0.16782723"}}
