{"text": "I know that picture shows the image how 'big' it is but it is way too small. I'm mid 20th and really not considered fat but this watch is soo small barely fit my wrist.

Cute watch for children and teenagers maybe", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.123322986", "1": "0.20085612", "2": "0.22572152", "3": "0.18896902", "4": "0.0489476", "5": "0.17200944", "6": "0.040173333"}}
