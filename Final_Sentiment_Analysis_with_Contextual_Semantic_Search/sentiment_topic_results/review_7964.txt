{"text": "I have been searching for a new slipper to where during the warmer, summer months and hadn't found anything I was willing to try until I ran across these.  I LOVE these slippers and have promptly thrown my old ones in the trash.Pros:1)  Try to size.  I wear a size 9 shoe and order the slipper in an 8-9 and they fit perfectly.2)  Contoured back means my heel doesn't slip around3)  Very comfortable, plush fabric covering the entire slipper4)  Love the rubber sole.  I have planters fasciitis and having the rubber sole gives enough support that it helps keep it under control5)  The piece that goes between the toes is very, very comfortable and non-irritating6)  Very reasonable priceCons:  None", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20782794", "1": "0.1553882", "2": "0.13080011", "3": "0.15577376", "4": "0.06416914", "5": "0.05887989", "6": "0.22716092"}}
