{"text": "I wanted a small black goldtone watch that is feminine, not too dressy and not too much goldtone. This one fits the bill. I do wish the strap was a bit wider, as it would sit better on my wrist. There are 3 loops to insert the strap into, which seems excessive. I will probably cut one off. Nice looking watch at a good value.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07208174", "1": "0.3187833", "2": "0.4109056", "5": "0.1207227", "6": "0.069761425"}}
