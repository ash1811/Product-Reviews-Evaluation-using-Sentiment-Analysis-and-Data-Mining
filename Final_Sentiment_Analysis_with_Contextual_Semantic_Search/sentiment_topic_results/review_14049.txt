{"text": "I've had this watch for a couple of days now. It arrived running and set to the correct time and date. It's a large watch and the face is very clear and easy to read.In spite of the size and weight it is one of the most comfortable watches I have ever worn. It is certainly the most comfortable big watch that I have ever worn. It seems very well balanced on the wrist and feels like a much smaller watch.The luminous markings are excellent and easy to see.I love this watch and have been wearing it to work. Really you can't go wrong if you like large, diver watches.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.083654515", "1": "0.21401607", "2": "0.28552705", "3": "0.15515767", "4": "0.031948976", "5": "0.08149004", "6": "0.14820567"}}
