{"text": "I purchased this cap with an sense of hesitance. Buying caps is a personal thing. Caps should be tried on at the store and quality inspected. All I could do was go off the description from the Port & Company name. The cap carried a reasonable price and the pictures looked nice. Why not. Speedy shipping and the item came as advertised. Neither small or large. A perfect fit and great quality cloth and bill. Will be purchasing more. What color next?", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11459234", "1": "0.3364381", "2": "0.12186249", "3": "0.20309491", "4": "0.12597777", "6": "0.09490999"}}
