{"text": "One of the last best casio's in the market,this watch is a workhorse,is extremly accurate and it give you a lot of extras like dual time,perpetual calendar,alarm and more.It will give better service than a Rolex and more accurate.The G Shock used to be great but now they have plastic cases,this one still have a stainless steel case,its incredible for the price.Probably Casio will stop production on this one soon,its too good to be around this days.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.034567896", "1": "0.21048403", "2": "0.059153996", "3": "0.30328408", "4": "0.17192475", "5": "0.057212103", "6": "0.16337311"}}
