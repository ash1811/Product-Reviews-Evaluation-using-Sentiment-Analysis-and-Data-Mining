{"text": "I bought this and as soon as I opened I used it to clean my very tarnished silver necklace and charm, wow!!!! it took about 3 seconds to remove all the black, ugly layer, then I polished with the soft side of the cloth and it was shinny as new. This is amazing, I always hated having to use those stinky, slimy and ugly cleaners before, so this is just perfect if you want a clean, quick, mess-free product to clean your jewelry. So far I have tried it only on silver and it has been amazing, but I haven't tried it on other materials yet. Once I'm done with this cloth I'll buy again and again, because it's exactly what I needed: a mess-free, efficient, quick cleaning product that gets rid of the ugliness in seconds. Yes, I love this!!!!.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.112350665", "1": "0.3072494", "2": "0.12500693", "3": "0.14495403", "4": "0.12560588", "5": "0.108880945", "6": "0.07595217"}}
