{"text": "This is the hands down best denim jacket I have ever owned.  The denim is heavy duty but, unlike other heavy denim jackets, which feel kind of stiff, this jacket is truly soft and comfortable.  What I especially like is the hand warmer pockets are nice and roomy enough to really put your hands in.  There are two inside pockets that are large enough to put a paperback novel or other things of similar size.  I also really like the look of this jacket.  It is classic.  I have grown to love Wrangler products.  They are durable and comfortable and rugged.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.31143412", "2": "0.19252996", "4": "0.25378194", "5": "0.106613606", "6": "0.13070008"}}
