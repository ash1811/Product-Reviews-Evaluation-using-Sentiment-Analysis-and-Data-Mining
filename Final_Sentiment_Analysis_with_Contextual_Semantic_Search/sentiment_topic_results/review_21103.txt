{"text": "First note, the conservative fit only applies to the lower part.  That part is great, covers everything, and doesn't ride up.  The top is not conservative, and is in fact fairly low cut, particularly if you happen to be well endowed.  Also, it might be a little too short of you have a longer torso.  That said, it provides a fair amount of support.  I started swimming just about every day, and the suit fabric holds up reasonably well, but the color fades after about a month.  As long as you are ok with a dark grey suit, this isn't really a problem.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.031424586", "1": "0.347594", "2": "0.09874798", "3": "0.16983284", "4": "0.09665964", "5": "0.175251", "6": "0.08048997"}}
