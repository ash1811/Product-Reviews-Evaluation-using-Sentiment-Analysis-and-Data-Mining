{"text": "AWFUL!!! I Purchased this in JAN/FEB2013, return date ends as of 05MAR2013 and the battery is already dead.  This watch lasted less than 6 weeks, I suggest you buy from someone else.  1) Why would a company have a return policy of less than 6 weeks if they were not selling faulty items? 2) It took darn near 4 weeks for me to receive the item to begin with.  I attempted to contact the company before placing a bad review, but their return policy prevented me from doing so, so here it is a bad review.  A great watch sold by a awful vendor.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.116601594", "1": "0.2782743", "2": "0.17825836", "3": "0.18434934", "6": "0.23756234"}}
