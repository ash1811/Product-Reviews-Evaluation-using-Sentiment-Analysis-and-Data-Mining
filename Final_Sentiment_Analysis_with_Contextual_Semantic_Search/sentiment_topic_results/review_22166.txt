{"text": "I can't believe I've been sleeping without this gown all this time! Its like having nothing on which is great. The fabric is soft and comfortable with no scratchy material on it and lightweight. The colors are true and the length reaches just a little past my knees since I'm a short girl. I love that it has no sleeves which allows me to turn at night and fling my arms in any direction I want. This is so much better than a cotton material sleep top I was sleeping with before which made me feel hot sometimes during the night. This gown doesn't do that to me. It covers but keeps me cool at night. Definitely recommend.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06104542", "1": "0.28777197", "2": "0.1435001", "3": "0.25733218", "4": "0.03468633", "6": "0.21314374"}}
