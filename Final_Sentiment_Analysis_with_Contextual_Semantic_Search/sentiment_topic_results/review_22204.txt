{"text": "Our son wore out his first pair after several years so purchased this pair for him for Christmas.  His wife is happy they are already &#34;dirt color&#34;.  Ha-ha.  He loves his so much that I purchased the women's version for me.  Now I'm in love with my UGG slippers too.  These are the real thing, not knock-offs and you pay for what you get.  If this is your first pair of UGGS, be prepared for them to feel slightly snug at first.  This is a good thing because the fluffy interior will compact some with wear and then they will fit perfectly.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17343605", "1": "0.3681723", "4": "0.08531632", "5": "0.30179384", "6": "0.06531208"}}
