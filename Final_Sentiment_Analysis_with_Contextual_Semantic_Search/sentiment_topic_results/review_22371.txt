{"text": "I use viabrom toe shoes for running but have to have the socks to help cushion my foot strike a little.  I hate having to take the time after work to put on the socks then shoes.  these socks eliminated that fact.  I put them on in the morning and just thow on my running shoes at a later time perfect.  the only complaint i got is the price is a little high.  Others said the fall apart.
