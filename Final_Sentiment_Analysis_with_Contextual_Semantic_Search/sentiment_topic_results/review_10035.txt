{"text": "Well, upon getting this watch in the mail, I was surprised to find that it's made of plastic, not metal.  That means it's light.  Like, you can barely feel it in your hand.The watchband is thin and cheap, and the buckle is cheap, stamped metal.  The watch face looks good, but also looks somewhat like it's made of cardboard if you really inspect it.Also, it's really more of a brown color than green or olive.  And you can't wear brown with black clothes unless you want to look like a goober.This is a great watch for a little kid.  It's got a small dial, easy-to-read numbers, it's light-weight, etc.  But for an adult?  Get a real watch!  I'm going to return mine.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24913713", "1": "0.21947603", "2": "0.23433155", "3": "0.029079784", "4": "0.06543813", "5": "0.07122079", "6": "0.13131659"}}
