{"text": "Having reached an age when my middle is expanding (slightly) despite all of the exercise and dieting I can do, it was great to be able to find jeans that fit on-line. The relaxed fit is just my style.For 40 years, I've been wearing a 34x34; lately, they're just a bit tight. Very few (if any) stores carry 35\" waist, and the 36\" are just too big.So I was pleased to find comfortable jeans in my size.  They look great, feel great, and were delivered as promised. (Extra bonus: a couple of stones from the stone-weashing process ended up in my pockets).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1747608", "1": "0.27970073", "3": "0.107223414", "4": "0.35810032", "5": "0.0476287", "6": "0.029973002"}}
