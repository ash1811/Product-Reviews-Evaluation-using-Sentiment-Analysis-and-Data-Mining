{"text": "We bought these for working around the house - both with machinery and landscaping and are truly loving them.  They fit very well, not too tight or too loose, and hubster has feet that run a bit towards the wide side of life.  They're extremely durable, very comfortable, and take a beating and still look new.  They're AMAZING in the snow too when you're blowing snow off your driveway.  They've been durable for us but again, we don't use them every day for work so I cannot attest to that, but from what we've seen so far, they are, hands down, the BEST pair of boots we've ever purchased.  We're back for pairs for the boys now.  HIGHLY recommend!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.32525998", "2": "0.08982115", "3": "0.150463", "4": "0.20072116", "5": "0.22944471"}}
