{"text": "Well, what can you say about these???  First of all, the girl in the photo is VERY small.  The panties are VERY small.  These did not look like the photo on me, but I wear the large sizes of 6-8.  I landscape quite a bit, however I am not really able to wear these as they do not contain me or my hair very much.I would say that the main patch here is about 3 inches long by 2 inches wide.  I have a narrow \"landing strip\" that these do not even begin to cover on top when properly arranged. Lips and hair, everywhere.  Can't exactly return these, but would only wear them under the very, very, skimpiest of lingerie.Best for the petites.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18480133", "1": "0.21935661", "2": "0.13859075", "3": "0.13695441", "4": "0.06263138", "5": "0.07913603", "6": "0.17852949"}}
