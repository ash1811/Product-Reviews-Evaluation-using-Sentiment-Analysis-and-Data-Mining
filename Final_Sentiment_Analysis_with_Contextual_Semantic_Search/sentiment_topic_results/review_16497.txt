{"text": "This is a good general use bag. The material is strong so it won't tear.The design is very basic. Has one main large compartment, two smaller ones on either side and one very small on the front.This bag won't win any good look awards at the airport luggage line, but I like it for the what it is. It is simple and I don't feel bad when I thrash on it.I think the price may be a bit lower because the product really is very basic.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.039926544", "1": "0.31022283", "2": "0.18123405", "3": "0.1499643", "4": "0.08215629", "5": "0.04029021", "6": "0.19620578"}}
