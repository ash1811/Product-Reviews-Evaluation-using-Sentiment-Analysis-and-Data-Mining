{"text": "I recently received a pair of Levi 514s for Christmas from a from a friend and I found the fit to be absolutely horrible.  As a preface, I've been wearing Levis jeans pretty much exclusively for over five years.  I own several pairs of 501s 514s 529 and 539. Until now I was 100% satisfied with the product which I was getting however Levis was sneaky and changed the cut and sizing of this 514.  I have always worn 32 waist on all of my Levis with room to spare.  I put on these new 514s and they were practically painted on, much to my suprise.  The cut is not a straight cut as you would expect but is a rather fitted tapered cut which is tapered in at the thigh and knee area.  If you plan on buying these you better expect that the sizing will not be as you expected.  I get adding new styles to the lineup of jeans but do that, add new styles, don't destroy the great styles that made people want to buy Levis in the first place.  So now I am stuck because I don't know what Levis I ll be able to get a propper fit with.  I may have to move on to something else entirely and cherish my now vintage Levis that I already have.  I am so dissapointed with the lack of consistency with the Levis product line now.
