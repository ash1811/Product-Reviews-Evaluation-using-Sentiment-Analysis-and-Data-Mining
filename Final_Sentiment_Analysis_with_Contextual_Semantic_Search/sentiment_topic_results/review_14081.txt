{"text": "My watch battery died and there was no way I was getting the back opened on my own.  The little watch stand in the mall was going to charge me over $20 just go take the back off and change the battery. I decided instead just to purchase this tool and a watch battery myself and how I can change the watch battery myself.  The tool comes in a little wooden box with multiple different attachments to adjust to opening different types of watches. I would recommend getting some sort of a watch holder to keep the watch in place when you are using the tool because it can take a little effort but my experience would have been easier if I had something to hold the watch still for me so that the watch itself as well as the little screws in the tool wouldn't slip off the watch.. All in all, if you want to be able to open your watch back yourself or change batteries I would say this will do the job.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15571891", "1": "0.25803524", "2": "0.37608778", "5": "0.11636543", "6": "0.089084774"}}
