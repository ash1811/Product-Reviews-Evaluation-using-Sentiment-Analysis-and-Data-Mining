{"text": "This hat has a slight shortcoming in that it doesn't have a true \"pouch\" effect in back or on top. The description says that it's supposed to have room for long hair or dreads, but mine won't fit unless put in one tight braid, and it's very jammed in. There's not enough fabric or gathering in the back/at the bottom to stuff it all up and in. My hair is past-my-waist long, but many people have bigger hair than I. Not a true dread hat.Besides that it's a great hat. I like it so much I've ordered it in other colors.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.028524993", "1": "0.316559", "2": "0.09679155", "3": "0.20103696", "4": "0.14245309", "5": "0.1432319", "6": "0.071402565"}}
