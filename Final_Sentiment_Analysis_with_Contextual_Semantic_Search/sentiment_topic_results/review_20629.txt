{"text": "What a saga this ended up being... I wanted to dye a pair of boots that had some bad stains on them.  Stains were light but so were the boots and it looked bad.  I ordered the dye and when it came, realized I really needed the deglazer too.  So, had to order that.  I really recommend finding a site that has the Fiebing's leather dye color chart before purchasing this dye.  This would have saved me money and aggravation.  First of all, light brown is more like a light red brown or even a dark orange.  It should have clued me in when I saw how red the dye was when I poured it into another container.  The first coat, my sand colored boots were a brilliant orange... two coats later and after drying, they are more like a medium ruddy brown but there is way too much red/orange in this dye for my taste.  When I found the color chart after, it was spot on the same color as my boots.  UGH! Anyway, I've reordered a chocolate brown which is what I should have gotten in the first place, but what an ordeal.  I can only hope that between another application of the deglazer and the new dye that it will cover the orangy-ness.  As far as application... I agree with earlier reviews, no matter how careful you are, this dye gets EVERYWHERE! Rubbing alcohol helps lighten it on your skin, but doesn't get rid of the stain completely.  I died my boots using a 1&#34; craft paint sponge and kiddie paint brushes on an old sheet in the garage.  I was successful in keeping my clothes unstained but not my fingers.  I did not wear gloves and regret that now, but I would use just the latex surgical gloves as kitchen gloves are kind of unwieldy.  Also, a little goes a long way.  I'll be able to dye another pair of boots and probably a jacket or two bright orange with what I have left.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1827622", "1": "0.3016757", "2": "0.30900416", "4": "0.06354359", "5": "0.088218585", "6": "0.052446917"}}
