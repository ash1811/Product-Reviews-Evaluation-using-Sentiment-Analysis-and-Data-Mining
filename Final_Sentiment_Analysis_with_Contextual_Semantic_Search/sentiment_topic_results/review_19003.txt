{"text": "I love this watch -- it is the perfect face size for my wrist and thus far has been extremely durable and reliable. I've had this watch and used it daily for several months now and it has surpassed my medium-low expectations. I've dropped it and knocked it around a bit, and it has held up great. Keeps good time, and the band is still going strong despite daily use and abuse. Worn this swimming a few times as well with no problems. Great watch, and looks a bit more classy in reality than it does in the picture.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20006202", "1": "0.16721307", "2": "0.13537964", "3": "0.24329357", "4": "0.12892388", "5": "0.06668035", "6": "0.05844742"}}
