{"text": "One good thing I can say, this bag inspired me to shop for a better made wheeled garment bag, it's a very practical luggage design for me.Better made bags have the zipper in the middle of the side. This one has it in a very exposed and vulnerable outer edge. Add to that how cheaply the zipper is made and you've got trouble in a vital function of the bag. Mine is broken on the corner making it much harder to use easily.Better made bags have folded-over top edges to protect the zipper and contents. This one has a bare zipper on the top corners. Do you think such a design will hold up to rough handling and bad weather? It probably won't.Better made bags have a better system of keeping hangers hooked in place at the top. Mine can't handle any shifting. It can't lock hanger hooks in. I have to make a giant twist tie to keep them in place but that still won't hold 20% of the time.Better made bags have an inner \"skin\" for pockets and divide the folded bag to help keep clothes in place. This bag has no such tidy feature. When you open the bag after a normal or rough usage you never know what is waiting for you, kempt clothes or chaos.Better made bags have a reliable extendable handle that stays up. This one's handle has poor engineering and cheap materials that inspire no confidence.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04095349", "1": "0.23411813", "2": "0.17492321", "3": "0.11846643", "4": "0.17435138", "5": "0.10837983", "6": "0.14880757"}}
