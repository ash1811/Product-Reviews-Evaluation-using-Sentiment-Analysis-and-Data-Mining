{"text": "I was a competitive runner for many years and had early versions of both the timex triathlon and ironman watches.  I took about 10 yrs off running and recently decided to try to get back into a little bit of shape.  I figured I needed a watch just because I won't be happy if I don't know how I'm progressing so I went to what I knew best.... the timex.  Both of the ones I had before had two buttons on the face, a start/stop and a lap button.  This watch has a start/lap button on the face and the stop button on the side.  I'm not sure I like this.  When timing yourself it can be a pain to hunt for that button on the side to stop the watch.  I know I can just take a split at the finish and use that... but that begs the question why not just make it convenient to hit the stop button when you want to stop the watch?I also notice that the band isn't better than the band on the one I had 15 yrs ago (the band ultimately led to the demise of that last ironman when I couldn't find a replacement).  So, why 4 stars if I'm that unhappy?  I've only had the watch for a few days and run with it twice... I'm thinking that the button configuration may grow on me.  Maybe I'm just getting a bit curmudgeonly in my old age and need to learn to go with the times...  we'll see.  I'll post an update in a few months and let you know how the button thing is going.  As for the band.... I believe that I paid less for this watch than for the ironman I bought 15 yrs ago... so I figure for the money, if I only get a few years out of this band I still only paid $35 for the watch.  Anyway... that's my thoughts, if you buy I hope you enjoy.-Update (A year and a half later) I've now owned this watch for a year and a half and the band has held up just fine.  It has not received extensive use, but I'm satisfied with the band.  The button configuration has not grown on me, I always liked the convenience of being able to read for the face of the watch rather than the side.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17020762", "1": "0.15533091", "2": "0.24075921", "3": "0.11419908", "4": "0.13888246", "5": "0.061945416", "6": "0.1186753"}}
