{"text": "These are super comfy socks for every day:  warm, hug your foot just right, don't fall down or slide into your boots, and don't make your foot sweaty.  I love Smartwool socks and I can tell you they stand behind their products.  My husband had some Smartwool socks that kept getting holes (he's on his feet a lot and at first I also accused him of not keeping his toenails clipped) - long story short, Smartwool replaced them.  We buy lots of Smartwool products. : )", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.136719", "1": "0.20577323", "2": "0.14851509", "3": "0.038011644", "4": "0.2486974", "5": "0.2193015"}}
