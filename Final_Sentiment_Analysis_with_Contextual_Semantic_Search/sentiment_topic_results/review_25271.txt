{"text": "From the trail to the street, these hiking boots are comfortable and worth their weight in gold.I used them a lot for trail hiking in the summer time.  They are very light weight and very comfortable.  Mix these with Wigwam hiking socks, heavy pack in rough terrain = no blisters after days of use.  I did a lot of hiking in these and never had blisters.  I can't say the same for other hiking boots.  A very comfortable boot.  When I got blisters from other shoes, I could wear these and they would not cause friction on the blistered areas due to the excessive cushioning factors and displacement of surface area.I bought a second pair to keep in reserve.  They are that good.Cons:  They eyelets could use some re-enforced stitching to make them more durable but that is the only issue after about a year of use, they have not failed me yet.Don't get these boots wet, they absorb water fast like a sponge.  Ford the creeks / streams in flip flops.  They dry out fast though if wet and keep their cushion effect and terrain gripping capability.The tread is a medium wear type, not too soft, not too hard so it will wear through in a season with heavy use but being under $100 that is not a problem for the comfort level it provides you on the trail and gripping capability.An outstanding hiking boot for it's price range.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.23936525", "1": "0.19714479", "2": "0.15121262", "3": "0.031212792", "4": "0.13098326", "5": "0.17074251", "6": "0.079338774"}}
