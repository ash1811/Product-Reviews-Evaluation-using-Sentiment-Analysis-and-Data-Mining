{"text": "UPDATE: Now ponder this...of the 353 reviews herein, a whopping 94% are 4 and 5 stars and they span a period from 1/25/05 to today, 9/6/12. How many CEOS can even dream of 353 reviews...plus 94% continuous excellent ratings, plus spread over nearly 8 years, talk about customer loyalty. GREAT JOB G-SHOCK DW5600E. Perfect value/loyalty/excellence lesson for parents to teach their kids, huh? And for business classes to teach students.UPDATE: Please see very favorble review of Speidel 5600E watch band mentioned below. Also excellent for other G-Shocks as I discovered!ADDENDUM: I recently learned of a related product that some may find useful.  It is on Amazon under \"Speidel 16mm Band Fits Casio GShock DW 5600E\". I ordered one but haven't received as yet; $10 including shipping. Advertised as black leather band combined with either yellow or red color material. Looks rugged enough and reviews have said it is but can't comment yet. Will report back in few weeks.Please do yourself a huge favor and read G. Webster's \"My personal perfect watch\" review of 5600E. There is not a single mistatement of fact, no fluff, no nonsense, nothing but 100% honest and accurate evaluation. Date of his review is 2/20/09 and here I am over three years later finding it to still be the most helpful review one could find. I have owned GShocks for past 20+ years in addition to my 15 year old Seiko that I treasure. Two of my three GShocks have been 5600E's, the most recent purchased earlier this month. The 5600E is the perfect basic blocking-and-tackling watch. Full of necessary and helpful features (like your most useful and relied upon multi-tool/army knife), but no frills or wasted features to complicate things. Why am I still buying new GShocks? One of treats is to pass a used but still perfect product like this on to another grateful owner...they never forget.And for those complaining about the size and small print instruction booklet from Casio, do yourself another huge favor...go to Amazon and look up Carson pocket-size, LED light, magnifier. Mine is a couple of years in service now and I couldn't live without it. Cost less than $15 (maybe less than $10). Too bad I didn't get a new module of memory along with my purchase!! Time to climb down from the podium. Remember 5600E GShock (and if you're ready for it, a Carson battery LED pocket/purse magnifier). Thank me and G. Webster later!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.18117668", "1": "0.13796866", "2": "0.114043936", "3": "0.045014825", "4": "0.16990696", "5": "0.21098635", "6": "0.14090264"}}
