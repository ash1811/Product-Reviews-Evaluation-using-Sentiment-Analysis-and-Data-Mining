{"text": "This is a nice totebag, perfect size for lugging lunch, folders, books, water bottle, extra shoes, etc. to work. I went with a very safe color (gray), but I love that it's available in so many. The side pockets are a nice bonus. I'm not sure I'd travel with it, since the top is completely open, but for hauling stuff to and from work, it's perfect. Great value!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13501431", "1": "0.2162272", "2": "0.2773527", "3": "0.28412062", "5": "0.08023547"}}
