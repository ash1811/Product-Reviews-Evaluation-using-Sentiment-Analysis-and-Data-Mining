{"text": "These along with the Thorlo Unisex Moderate Cushion Walking Mini Crew Sock in black are my first pair of Thorlo socks. I was skeptical of paying such an amount for 1 pair of socks however, comfort is key to me. I am traveling internationally and want to ensure comfort. These socks are so comfortable. My gosh, I never thought socks could feel like these. These are thinner than the other ones I bought as they are specifically made for those who feel little to no discomfort and/or pain after lots of walking and/or activity. You may have to buy your shoes a half to a whole size bigger for these socks. Highly recommended!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08119861", "1": "0.1904574", "2": "0.17750931", "3": "0.208582", "4": "0.04791347", "5": "0.17812888", "6": "0.11621033"}}
