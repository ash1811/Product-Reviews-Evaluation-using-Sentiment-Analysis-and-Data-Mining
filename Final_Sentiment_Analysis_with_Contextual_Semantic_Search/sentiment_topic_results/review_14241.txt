{"text": "Overall these tevas are very comfortable.  Tevas are always well made, and the sole is very cushy.  The only problem I had is with the straps when I first started wearing them.  After wearing all day, because the straps are made of a braided nylon/plastic fabric, the tops of my feet and around the tops of my big toes were a little sensitive, but I did not get blisters.  After wearing several times, it feels like I've broken them in and no longer run into this problem. Just as comfortable as reefs, and I think more so than havaianas.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.058356848", "1": "0.36932284", "2": "0.21825594", "3": "0.18397863", "5": "0.10726112", "6": "0.05977275"}}
