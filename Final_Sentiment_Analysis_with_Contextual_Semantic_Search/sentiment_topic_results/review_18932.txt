{"text": "I have had quite a history with wearing jeans - there was a phase when I could pass off as a bum, and then another phase when I could pass as a bloated stick figure - and sadly each of those phases (and others in between) have been immortalized in my family photographs.When I opened the box for these and put them on, however, it was like I had finally met my soulmate.The 514 has been variously labeled as a straight fit or a slim straight fit. I believe this should be correctly labeled as a slim straight fit. However it is nowhere close to being skinny. In my opinion these are best suited for my body type (I am 180cm and 178lbs - with relatively slimmer legs). They hug the thighs just so correctly and do not feel baggy.They look equally great with moccasins and sneakers - though hang a little loose at the end with my dress shoes. I haven't had a chance to wear them with boots - but I think they would do okay with boots as well (I do not like bootcuts).The Dirt Rush color is very neutral - a little bit lighter than it appears in the photograph (not necessarily a bad thing) - and looks more greenish in sunlight - however very subdued.Overall, a great purchase - and I will definitely buy more colors in the same 514 style.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.033057507", "1": "0.23679654", "2": "0.10268181", "3": "0.15438133", "4": "0.097457625", "5": "0.3074636", "6": "0.06816158"}}
