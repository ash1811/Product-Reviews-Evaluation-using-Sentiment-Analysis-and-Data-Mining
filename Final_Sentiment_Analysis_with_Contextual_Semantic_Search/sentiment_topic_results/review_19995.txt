{"text": "I have been looking for a bag for school for months. I am in college and needed something that could hold all my books 3 1' binders , laptop and all the other essentials for school and to make it through a 7 hour day at school. I looked at 100's of bags and either the price was too much or the design / pattern /color were more for men. I saw this bag, loved the price and the design was nice. I got this faster than expected and was very impressed, the design is so much nicer than online. I placed all my things in this bag right away, thinking I may have to return it. I could not ask for more, this held everything and I still have room . It seems to be made of great material and looks like it will last me through the rest of my educational journey.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.061408073", "1": "0.527278", "2": "0.25254598", "3": "0.04793065", "4": "0.08250175", "6": "0.02577321"}}
