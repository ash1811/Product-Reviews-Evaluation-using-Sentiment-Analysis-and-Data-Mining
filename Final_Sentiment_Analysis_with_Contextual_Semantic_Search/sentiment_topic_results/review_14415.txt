{"text": "I bought these shoes specifically for the yearly Expo our organization runs in huge convention halls.  Last year I thought I took a pair of fairly comformtable shoes with me, but my feet were killing me on the second day.  By day four I could barely walk and my feet were covered in blisters.  After learning my lesson I was looking specifically for black semi-dressy-looking walking shoes and this model with its DMX feature and host of positive reviews sounded fairly promising.  I am back from the Expo now and happy to say that I made the right choice.  Not only my feet did not turn into a bloody pulp by the end of the show, but I was able to explore the Orlando in the evenings and even walk entire Universal Studios the next day after the Expo was over.  Good work Rockport.  I know which shoes I am taking with me to the Expo next year!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.040882483", "1": "0.20715371", "2": "0.11414099", "3": "0.1797954", "4": "0.18165947", "5": "0.17127094", "6": "0.105097"}}
