{"text": "This is my 3rd pair of Skechers sandals.  The first pair disappeared with my lost luggage on a trip to Italy last year.  I was so upset, since they were my favorite \"casual\" shoes.  The 2nd pair I still use; but they are size 7 1/2 and just a bit too short for my toes (the original pair were open-toed).  I only use them now when I am kayaking, since I don't mind if they get wet.  For the latest pair, I went up a 1/2 size and the fit is perfect.  They have great arch support, which is important to me since I've had plantar faciitis in the past.  They are also very comfortable - I usually wear them on my days off when I'm running around.  I've worn them with jeans, capris and even skirts, and I've gotten alot of compliments on them.  I live in Florida, and find that they are much cooler than a sneaker; in fact, I think the Skecher sandals are even more comfortable than their sneakers.  I would definitely recommend them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0747012", "1": "0.22922184", "2": "0.12427923", "3": "0.33143556", "4": "0.14806923", "6": "0.089863606"}}
