{"text": "I have these in size medium.  My shoe size is 9 for dress shoes, 10 1/2 for Asics runners.  They work great, are good width to keep shoes formed, and smell good.  The mediums are a snug fit, but I prefer exactly that to keep them stretched out.  Can't say anything bad about them.  I will buy more if I ever need them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08237791", "1": "0.2797081", "2": "0.2529705", "3": "0.19449842", "4": "0.039160907", "6": "0.14750318"}}
