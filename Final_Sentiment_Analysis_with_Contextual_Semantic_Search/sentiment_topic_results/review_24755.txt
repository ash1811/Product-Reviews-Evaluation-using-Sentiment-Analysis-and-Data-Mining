{"text": "These are well constructed shorts. Nice heavy cotton, nice waist band. There was one fit issue for me (not the shorts fault) where I bought a XXX Large set of Russell shorts that ended up fitting a little too large so I got these in XX large thinking there would be good to go and found out that The Russell's actually are larger than advertised and these fit right which is of course a little too small for me. The only real issue I had with these is the draw string. It is a single closed loop that is not easy to tie so I will have to cut it to be able to get a normal bow tie I can adjust securely. I recommend this product.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21595356", "1": "0.25629705", "2": "0.16743164", "3": "0.18570016", "5": "0.0818286", "6": "0.090361685"}}
