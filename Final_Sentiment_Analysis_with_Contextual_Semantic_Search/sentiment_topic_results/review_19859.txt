{"text": "I wanted to get a case to keep all my bands in, especially my diamond bands. I was looking for something with individual compartments so the diamonds won't scratch each other. This is exactly what I needed. It's very lightweight and serves its purpose well, but it feels a bit on the flimsy side to me. There's also a nice latch to keep the case securely closed, also comes with a small (albeit flimsy) key to lock the latch. I played with the lock a little bit, but it seems awkward, and most likely I won't be using it too much.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.28151023", "1": "0.18563633", "2": "0.12969653", "3": "0.12178942", "4": "0.18366353", "5": "0.030135358", "6": "0.06756857"}}
