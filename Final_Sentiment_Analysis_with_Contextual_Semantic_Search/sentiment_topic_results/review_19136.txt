{"text": "This easy set alarm Timex is extremely functional for me. The ability to twirl the dial and set the alarm to beep is what I need in my work as a Physical Therapist. It reminds me to check back in a set period of time. Digital watches have too many buttons to push, taking way too long to set an alarm. This analog watch's ability to quickly set an alarm of varying time periods is marvelous. I can't believe Timex is the only manufacturer of this type. It has this model and one that is shinier/dressier. This is the one I wear every day. I hope Timex continues to make these into the far future. If there is one thing I wish Timex would improve on, it is the volume of the alarm. I'm now in my 60s, and of course, losing higher frequencies. The alarm can be difficult for my aging ears to hear if the ambient noise is great. I don't think that this is a defect in the watch. I think it's a defect in me...  :-)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.104201555", "1": "0.22022334", "2": "0.14200665", "3": "0.050274447", "4": "0.16175294", "5": "0.17415173", "6": "0.14738931"}}
