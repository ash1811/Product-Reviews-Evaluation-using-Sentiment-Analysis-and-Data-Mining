{"text": "Okay, I really love this sports bra. I was having trouble with my exercise DVDs doing jumping jacks and jump rope with my other sports bras- no support. This bra is great. I have been able to do jumping jacks and jump rope exercises with no bounce or pain in the breast area.  This bra is so great that I bought two more in beige for a great price. The price is highest for black, but great price for the beige color bra.update- I bought one and love it so much that I bought two more. These bras are not your typical sports bras. These are made for women that are top heavy and need heavy duty support when working out especially running or jumping. I got rid of all my other bras that I workout in because these are comfortable and very supportive for a top heavy woman.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09240277", "1": "0.2880083", "3": "0.3648959", "5": "0.115104176", "6": "0.13502532"}}
