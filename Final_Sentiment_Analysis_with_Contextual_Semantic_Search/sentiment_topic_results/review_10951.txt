{"text": "I love this bra as it is so versatile for wearing almost any outfit. It sticks well and even gives \"the girls\" a lift. I am 32 D so these usually do not work for me, but I keep buying these whenever they lose their stick. I have 4 friends who I also got to buy them and they love them too. The only thing I do not like is that when it's hot/humid outside these are not absorbent so sweat pools underneath your chest. Definitely learned my lesson not to wear this bra during the summer while wearing any grey or silky fabrics! Very embarassing, but overall a great product.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06181684", "1": "0.21174015", "2": "0.12153283", "3": "0.19949132", "4": "0.051411502", "5": "0.30857345", "6": "0.045433857"}}
