{"text": "I'm 5'10&#34; tall and have a size 12 med. shoe, so finding a shoe in my size is difficult enough and I always have to buy online or by catalogue which can be literally a pain.  I also have had several stress fractures, broken ankles, plantar fasciitis & rheumatoid arthritis.  Buying a comfortable sneaker/shoe that looks & feels good,doesn't make my feet look larger and is not $200 is a difficult task.  With that said &#34;BINGO&#34; I would recommend this sneaker above any I have ever had, even New Balance, Reebok or Nike.  What a comfortable, good looking, quality sneaker!!!  The price was definitely in my price range and Saucony now has a devoted customer.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.057888202", "1": "0.23997186", "2": "0.07240446", "3": "0.18111496", "4": "0.112585455", "5": "0.2065029", "6": "0.12953214"}}
