{"text": "I am extremely disappointed with this wallet. Yes, it's big. Yes, it's fat. But it doesn't take much of anything.If you put a checkbook into the checkbook slot, you can't close this wallet. No way, no how. Yes, it has room for eight credit cards, but can you close it with eight credit cards in it? Nope. Yes, it has a zippered compartment on the outside, but it's not big enough for keys or pretty much anything at all. The only useful section is the zippered one with the two pockets on the inside, so basically you have this one tiny useful section surrounded by a big, bulky, useless outer shell. Oh, and even with practically nothing in it, the flap in front (barely) snaps shut sideways. Sideways!Can you believe I have to have a separate purse in my bag just for my keys, key ring with all my store cards, and my cell phone? It's insane. And what's this &#34;w/ Calculator&#34; nonsense? There's no calculator! I'm really mad at myself for spending money on this useless piece of rubbish.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.112944365", "1": "0.23733091", "2": "0.35413954", "3": "0.122819364", "5": "0.16834058"}}
