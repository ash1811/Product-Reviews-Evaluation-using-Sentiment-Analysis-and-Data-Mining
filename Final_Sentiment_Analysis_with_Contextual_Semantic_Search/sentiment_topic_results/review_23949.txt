He's like a kid with socks, they get holes and get too dirty to wash clean - so I buy these, he likes how they feel better than the others, and when they get beyond repair, I toss them.  They don't hold their shape, they get sort of pilly after a few washes, but  they're dirt cheap, and like I said my husband is just too hard on socks to buy anything else.  The price is right, and the socks are worth the price - but no more.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07060333", "1": "0.15137263", "2": "0.25393447", "3": "0.15647937", "4": "0.12490909", "5": "0.24009578"}}
