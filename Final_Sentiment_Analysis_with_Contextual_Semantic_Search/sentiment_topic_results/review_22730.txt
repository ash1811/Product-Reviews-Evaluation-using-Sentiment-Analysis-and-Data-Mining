{"text": "I love, love, love this hat. We went to hawaii with out 15 month old son and needed a good sun hat that would give him the most coverage from the strong hawaii sun.  After a ton of research, I picked this hat. And I am so glad I did. It was perfect! It has a neck flap that covers the back of the neck, but does show a bit of the side of the neck to the sun. the brimb of the hat is large and covers most of the face. You will still need lotion on their face and neck to cover when they move around and the reflection from the water and the sand. It also has a really easy to use neck strap with a clip together bracket and an adjustable strap. The strap really works to keep it on as it stayed on even in the wind. My son left the hat on except when it was really really hot, then it makes his head too hot, but if it is too hot for him to wear his hat then I figure it is too hot for him to be outside anyway.  We literally use this hat every day when he goes outside to play as we live in So. Cal. where the sun is always hot.  I also really liked the tan color, it goes with everything. And the material never gets dirty. This is a must have for babies or toddlers who play outsside, or for the beach & park!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.095190644", "1": "0.07286304", "2": "0.1325803", "3": "0.27357575", "4": "0.128253", "5": "0.12104175", "6": "0.17649548"}}
