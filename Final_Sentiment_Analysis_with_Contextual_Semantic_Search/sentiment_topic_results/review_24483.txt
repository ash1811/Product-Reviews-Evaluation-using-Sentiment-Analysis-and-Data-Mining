{"text": "I wanted to like these, given the cost but they just don't do it for me.  They are certainly substantial in feel with what looks like solid construction.  They were properly sized, requiring only some minor trimming to fit my 13.5 shoes.  I purchased these as replacement inserts for a pair of Dansko work shoes, as Dansko does not offer replacement inserts for their shoes (suggesting Dr. Scholl's inserts, oddly enough).  Not sure why, other than the obvious bottom line, as I am sure there is a need for them.  One of my feet was starting to have significant pain (not plantar fasciitis, but on the top and interior of my foot), so my physician said to get new shoes.  Being a cheapskate I thought these pricey inserts would help for less than a new pair of good shoes.  No such luck.  My feet actually hurt worse with the Superfeet inserts and I gave them a good week to break in.  The arch supports are good, however.  My suggestion is to save some coin and try the Dr. Scholl's brand and switch to sneakers at work, if you can (I checked Runner's World website for shoes with good padding).  Or, as I begrudgingly may have to do, go to a running store for a proper fit, as was also suggested.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10285624", "1": "0.092684254", "2": "0.29361993", "3": "0.07196278", "4": "0.17085257", "5": "0.15895325", "6": "0.109071024"}}
