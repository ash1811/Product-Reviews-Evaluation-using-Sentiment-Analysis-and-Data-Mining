{"text": "I've had my Ironman watch for close to 10 years. So why am I posting a review now?Because I received a superior service from Timex that warrants a write-up.After years of faithful service the wrist band on the Ironman watch came off on one side. I looked up where I can find a replacement and found that Timex will replace the band on its watches for free.I called the 800 number and sure enough, they told me to package it up, write a note that it is for band replacement only, told me to enclose a check for a very modest shipping cost to send it back to me. Four weeks later  and my watch arrived back: new band and the back looks shinier. Looks like they cleaned its exterior as well.This has been one of my favorite watches1) I like the nice clear large display. Easy to see even with my now presbyopic eyes.2) Setting the watch is easy without a manual3) There is enough useful features, but not so many that the it makes it too complex to do simple things4) Even though it is a men's watch I a female who wear is and I don't find it heavy or bulky5) I like the plastic watch band. My previous Timex had a Velcro band and eventually it picked up a lot of lint it did not close well. And now that I found that Timex will replace it for a cost of shipping it back, I am even more pleased with it.6) The battery lasts a reasonable time, I have to replace it every 2-3 years. Not often enough to be annoying. The battery in my \"dressed-up\" watch lasts only a year.I am very pleased with the watch, and now extremely pleased with the service as well.Ali Julia review", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.27949464", "1": "0.07590881", "2": "0.20502363", "3": "0.10991897", "4": "0.16214737", "5": "0.08864505", "6": "0.07886154"}}
