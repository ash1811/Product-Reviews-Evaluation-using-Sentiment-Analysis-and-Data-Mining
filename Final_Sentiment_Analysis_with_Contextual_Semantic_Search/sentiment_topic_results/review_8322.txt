{"text": "Ok.. I gotta say something about this hat that hasn't already been said. Here in MN everyone wears baseball caps and I always have too. I'm 38 and decided to get a Real hat. I feel strange wearing it because people look at it where ever I go. I'm not sure if it's because it's so awesome or because it's different. Out west where &#34;cowboy&#34; hats are common, I'd blend right in, but not here. I look like I'm from out of town. But it's such a great hat that I want to wear it. But because it's not a typical looking cowboy hat or a fedora, I think it makes you look confident and interesting. Wish I could wear it everyday everywhere but so far only on special occasions have I put it on. I'm sure I'll wear it more and more as I get use to it. And I'll be keeping this for the rest of my life and I plan on buying at least one more Tilley. Great attention to detail and quality. Glad I bought it!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08370651", "1": "0.23321761", "2": "0.15642329", "3": "0.32746872", "5": "0.12738346", "6": "0.069526866"}}
