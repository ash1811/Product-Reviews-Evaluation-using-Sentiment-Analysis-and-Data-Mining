{"text": "I purchased this screen to replace a smaller acrylic earring holder I'd had for many years.  Other than the shape (the old one was a butterfly, this one's a \"boring\" rectangle :-) this one is superior.  It holds about twice as many earrings, and can hold post-style, french hook and loop earrings.  It's big enough that I use it for my most-used necklaces as well.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.29506588", "2": "0.10537915", "3": "0.12715669", "4": "0.15222105", "5": "0.1415184", "6": "0.17478953"}}
