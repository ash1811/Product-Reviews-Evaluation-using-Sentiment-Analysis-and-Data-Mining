{"text": "Great price on a comfortable strapless bra, I am heavy set,5'4 145 lbs, way too much bust!I and very active, and wear this bra, the lack of straps saves on back strain . I was amazed I could wear a strapless bra, with my broad German shoulders, bras are always uncomfortable, but no straps, no pain. so i really like this bra series a lot!I ordered two, a year ago, and they did not fit, a completely diffeerent bra.sent them back, wearing very old bras, 100's of washings, for another year.so 2012 is here  and ordered one, it fit just like the original bra! ordered another, fits just right! so will order a third, summer is coming. I am the largest size  in this bra, and its the best one, very comfortable. I cannot recommend this bra enough, I am not a clothes person, just need functional and comfortable. feel free to try  several sizes, send back the incorrect ones.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.083811425", "1": "0.39476648", "2": "0.066928715", "3": "0.1454991", "4": "0.050127625", "5": "0.050809734", "6": "0.20805694"}}
