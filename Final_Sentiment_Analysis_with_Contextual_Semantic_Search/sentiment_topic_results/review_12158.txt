{"text": "My goggles fit in the case, but it's a tight fit.  I wish the case were just a bit bigger (longer and deeper) to make it easier when putting the goggles in.  Once you wrestle with the goggles though and get them in, the case does it's job.  I've had these goggles in my gym bag for 6 months and they still look fantastic.  If TYR reads these reviews, it'd be nice if if you would put a second little zippered pocket on them where you could keep a small bottle of anti-fog solution.Speaking of anti-fog solution, don't forget to buy yourself a bottle of JAWS Quick Spit to keep your goggles from fogging up.
