{"text": "I recently discovered this entire shoe category, called hiking sandals or whatever other cutesy name the manufacturers come up with.  Having large feet (women's 11 wide), I could not find any in women's shoes, since all but one stopped at size 10 or smaller.  So I decided to try men's sizes, guessing that size 10 men's might be equivalent to my size 11.  I lucked out, the shoes fit perfectly, and they are comfortable.  They are not quite as &#34;air conditioned&#34; as I like, but you need a true sandal for that.  I have yet to road test them, but I am happy with them for now.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.061186355", "1": "0.2992796", "2": "0.15271324", "3": "0.17496955", "4": "0.17771685", "5": "0.050893635", "6": "0.08324078"}}
