{"text": "As expected, these insoles are soft and luxurious which is why we love Uggs. However, when I took them to the shoe shop to glue them in my worn out slippers, he told me these insoles are for the boots, which I don't have. It would have been only right for that to have been included in the description and/or title of the product and it wasn't. I feel like I wasted $20 as it's not worth it to return them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09647099", "2": "0.16507739", "3": "0.22336371", "4": "0.23201306", "5": "0.084515795", "6": "0.19421658"}}
