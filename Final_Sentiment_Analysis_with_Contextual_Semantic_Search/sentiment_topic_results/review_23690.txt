{"text": "I just got my boots out of the box and LOVE them. I was anxious about sizing after reading other reviews but I got a size 9 and usually take  a 39-40 eu size and it fits perfectly. I find that I have room for tucking in trousers too. The calf sizing seems pretty standard too for Australia... maybe sizing, or legs;) are a bit different in the US hence all the concerns from other reviewers... They look good. My feet are hot in them, so I can't wait for some cold weather to stomp around in.Great value! I'm going to go buy some other Bearpaws now too.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06746534", "1": "0.23043211", "2": "0.06891927", "3": "0.23848234", "4": "0.040209044", "5": "0.2297271", "6": "0.12476481"}}
