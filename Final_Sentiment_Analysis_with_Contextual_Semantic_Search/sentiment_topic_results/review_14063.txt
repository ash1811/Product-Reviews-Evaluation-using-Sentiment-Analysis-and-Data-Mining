{"text": "First of all I am not a diver, so I cannot comment on the diving capabilities of this watch. I got this because I got a Macy's gift card. This was the best looking watch in my price range. That's why I picked it up.It is quite heavy and chunky and looks and feels very durable. I wore it for a day and I definitely notice it being on. Due to the thickness of it I accidentally banged it a couple of times against my kitchen counter. While I had it on at work I got some stares but no compliments or negative remarks. I guess that's a good and bad sign.:)In my humble opinion this watch is not meant as an everyday watch. It is very good looking and looks quite bulletproof but not very practical to wear on a day to day basis. After two days of wearing it I switched back to my other watch. Despite the size and weight I still think it's a great watch I would recommend it to anyone.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14025325", "1": "0.067169495", "2": "0.14553593", "3": "0.21392326", "4": "0.14914718", "5": "0.12459451", "6": "0.15937635"}}
