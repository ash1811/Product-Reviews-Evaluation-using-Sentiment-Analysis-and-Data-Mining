{"text": "I like things that are simple and easy, including my underwear, which is why I love Hanes Her Way Underwear. They fit perfectly &#8211; they are not too long or short and I don't worry about them riding up while I am wearing them. They do tend to run a size small so keep that in mind when ordering them. They are100% cotton and have stood up to repeated washings. I'll definitely buy these again but may purchase a variety of colors instead of plain white.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.058769293", "1": "0.32403797", "2": "0.098843895", "3": "0.30243063", "4": "0.07912694", "5": "0.04935393", "6": "0.087437384"}}
