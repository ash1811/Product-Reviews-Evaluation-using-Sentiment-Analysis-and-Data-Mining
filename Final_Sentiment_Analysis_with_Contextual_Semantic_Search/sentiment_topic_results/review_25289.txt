{"text": "These are hands down the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. I spend a lot of money on expensive shoes by top names and none have compared to these shoes. The first time I put them on it felt like I was walking on clouds (yes, use your imagination here)and I love wearing them. I put the blue Pinnacle Powerstep inserts in them (all shoes I wear actually)and I couldn't be happier. The shoes also look as good as they feel. Merrell definitely has a new customer in me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.1674027", "2": "0.2603743", "3": "0.19169076", "4": "0.12180464", "5": "0.18951808", "6": "0.06634245"}}
