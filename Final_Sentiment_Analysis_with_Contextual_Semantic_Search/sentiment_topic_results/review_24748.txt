{"text": "The fit is awful on these. I typically wear a large in a 100% cotton short, since there's always shrinkage after washing and drying. After two trips through the wash, they're still WAY too big, like extra-large big. I will probably wear these around the house, but there's no way I'd wear these in public. Otherwise, the quality seems fine. I'm going to order a medium and hope that one fits.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.124662064", "1": "0.4040964", "2": "0.08302678", "3": "0.20748219", "4": "0.11072073", "5": "0.0668826"}}
