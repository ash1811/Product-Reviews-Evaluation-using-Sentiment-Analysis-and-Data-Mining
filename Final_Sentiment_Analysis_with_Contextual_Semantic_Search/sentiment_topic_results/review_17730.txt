{"text": "I purchased this watch to use while coaching my kid's football team.  It has everything I need, and it withstands the elements out on the grid iron.  This watch keeps things simple.  It really fits my coach image.  Looks great with gym shorts, t-shirt, and tennis shoes.  I also wear it to formal events with suit and tie.  It is the perfect tool for coaching.  I recommend this watch to any guy that is athletic and requires a watch to keep up with their demanding life style. It achieves perfection through simplicity.  The resin band is extremely comfortable and sporty.  The rigdes in the band allow for air flow around the wrist where I usually sweat.  The display has all of the essential information in the home time keeping mode.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14884877", "1": "0.18998583", "2": "0.18839099", "3": "0.11458099", "4": "0.14629333", "5": "0.12715207", "6": "0.08474806"}}
