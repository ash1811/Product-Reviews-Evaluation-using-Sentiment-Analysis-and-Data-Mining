{"text": "I ordered these jeans in a size up after reading all the reviews.  I normally wear an 8 or 10 in Levi's, depending on the cut.  I ordered these in a 12 and they are a perfect fit.  I think a size larger is required because of the smaller waist and mid-rise.  I always have the gap problem with the waist band in other jeans, but not these.  The thighs are cut a bit fuller than I'd like, which is why I only gave them four stars. I did not find them particularly short as others have written, but I'm only 5'5\" and have shorter legs.  The fabric is great and doesn't have so much stretch that they lose their shape.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.087109335", "1": "0.34019816", "2": "0.12612985", "3": "0.19047435", "4": "0.038259037", "5": "0.10456124", "6": "0.113267995"}}
