{"text": "I was asked to get some fishnets.  Im a lil above average...5'8, 190 pounds with NOT toned legs lol.  Anyhow, I figured plus size would work.  They did.  They tops do not roll down, or squeeze the fat up over them.  I wore them with garters and a garter belt.  The only thing I don't like is that they are the loose knit, not stretchy kind...so I can see them losing shape if you don't tend to them by handwashing periodically.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2099093", "1": "0.1839966", "2": "0.08310216", "3": "0.26232833", "5": "0.12690687", "6": "0.13024384"}}
