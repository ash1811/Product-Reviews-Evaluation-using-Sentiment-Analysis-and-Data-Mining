{"text": "I have been wearing Wrangler jeans for years and figured I would try a pair of Lee's for a change. These are definitely not the Lee's of old. They are made of a much lighter denim than I remember, but living in Florida this will be a nice change. The overall construction of the jeans are ok. The stitching around the pockets could be better and I am not sure how they will hold up in the long run but I am ok withe the purchase. If you want heavier denim, get Wrangler's.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.38261557", "2": "0.10373321", "3": "0.20505933", "4": "0.09172631", "5": "0.06989547", "6": "0.14371587"}}
