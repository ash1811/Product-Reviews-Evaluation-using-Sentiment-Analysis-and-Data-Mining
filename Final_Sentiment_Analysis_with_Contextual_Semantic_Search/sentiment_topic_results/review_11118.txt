{"text": "I love this vest, though my husband teases me about it....says it looks like a police vest!  I think it looks great in black, can wear it during the summer months, too.  It has so many pockets, I forget which pocket contains what!  I wear it around the house daily and when we go out.He doesn't laugh when he asks for a hand wipe and I promptly pull one from one of the pockets.  Carry my iPhone on me, a protein bar, eye glass cleaners, glasses, pens, Stylus pens, Kleenex, mace .....in case a coyote gets too close....and no need to carry a purse.One guy panhandled me when we were traveling.  Told him I was in the same position as he was....no money and opened my vest to prove it to him!  No more fumbling around or having the iPhone fall off my slacks.....always securely placed in the pocket.When laundering, use cold water, no softener and I don't put it in the dryer....no ironing required.  My husband always teased me that I needed a tool belt to wear around the house.....found something that I wear daily inside and away from the house!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17597346", "1": "0.12614357", "2": "0.26445898", "3": "0.031052304", "4": "0.17887518", "5": "0.12762508", "6": "0.095871456"}}
