{"text": "My daughter wanted a toy cell phone, (911 dispatchers probably wouldn't agree its a good toy, but oh well) so I got to looking and I got this set for just a little more than just a phone would have cost.  She loves all of it and carries it around the house, she just turned 4.  Great product for the price, I would recommend it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.53452635", "4": "0.1032337", "5": "0.24316202", "6": "0.10641826"}}
