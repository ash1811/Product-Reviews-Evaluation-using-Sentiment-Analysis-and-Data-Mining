{"text": "I've tried just about all of the mainstream underwear brands out there over the years (and as a middle aged man, that's a lot of years!), both in boxers and briefs, and I keep coming back to Jockey's Classic Brief. I have a long torso relative to my height (think long torso, short legs) and am a little bit overweight, and I find that other men's brands ride too low for my comfort or are \"too tight\" down low.Jockey's Classic Briefs fit well, ride well, the cotten they're made of is good quality, and overall they're very comfortable. And when it comes to underwear, comfort is 90 percent of the game. Add in the fact that they're pretty inexpensive to boot, especially when buying the 6-pack, and it adds up to a recommended buy. Granted, they're not the sexiest things out there, but since I'm not an underwear model, I can live with that. :-)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.029179303", "1": "0.36546543", "2": "0.052306708", "3": "0.27445567", "4": "0.19552532", "6": "0.080960535"}}
