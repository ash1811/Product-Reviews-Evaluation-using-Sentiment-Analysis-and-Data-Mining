{"text": "I know these are popular sellers...I can see how they'd be good with pants (IOW, with most of them covered by material, if you get me). Reasonable heel. Stable. I hear they are comfortable. For me, I found them very tight/narrow. I usually wear a medium. Perhaps these were narrow.....don't know. Sent them back ultimately because, while they are ok, they left me saying \"Meh.\"  There are just too many other options for pumps out there. The way the front comes up so high, just shouts \"PILGRIM!\" to me and I don't know why.... No, wait, it shouts \"1996!\" Yes, that's what it shouts. Or something.... If there is even one soul out there who knows what I mean, they will be helped by this otherwise less than helpful review ;-)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.082686305", "1": "0.28228575", "2": "0.058256343", "3": "0.060217593", "4": "0.18203203", "5": "0.21789247", "6": "0.11662949"}}
