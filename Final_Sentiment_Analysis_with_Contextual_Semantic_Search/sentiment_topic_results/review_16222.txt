{"text": "These are well made and are very comfortable, however just a tad small.  I usually wear a size twelve and have plenty of toe room.  If I do not wear socks they are fine, however a bit snug with socks on.  These are quality slippers and look great and you can buy by size instead of the S, Med., or Lg. like so many other brands.  I probably would order a half size larger next time.  I would recommend this brand for someone looking for a quality product.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07195465", "1": "0.38135216", "2": "0.06289953", "3": "0.20490173", "5": "0.103566565", "6": "0.17244752"}}
