{"text": "It's difficult to find smaller backpacks for everyday use instead of a purse. This one fills the bill.  It's nice and light for the summer, comes in lots of great colors, and is a nice size. I noticed that some reviewers commented that it was too small, but I didn't find that to be the case.  I could definitely fit a wallet in the bag, if I chose.  It has lots of compartments for credit cards, makeup, money and my phone, to keep things organized.  It has two nice outside zippers for extras. I find myself putting my phone in the back compartment so that it's easy to find.  You could put your passport in there, too, if you're traveling.  There is more than enough room for any extras you might have, including your Kindle.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.029343456", "1": "0.34644648", "2": "0.21222445", "3": "0.12088762", "4": "0.08854661", "5": "0.12744613", "6": "0.075105265"}}
