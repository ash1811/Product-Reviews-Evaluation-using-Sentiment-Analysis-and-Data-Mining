{"text": "I am super hard on my sneakers.  I walk my dog for 45 minutes a day, I walk across the parking lot at work, I drive in them, I climb the stairs to my office in them.  And I wore a hole in my last pair of canvas sneakers in only 5 months!  So I decided to try a different brand, and I bought these Vans.I am loving these shoes.  The red is just as vibrant as the photo in Amazon.  A 5.5 men's/7 women's fits me perfectly; they're snug enough to stay on but there's enough room that my toes are comfortable.  They appear to be very well made.  The canvas is a little thicker than my last pair of canvas sneakers so I have hopes that these will last longer.  The shoelaces are perhaps a bit long, but that's my only complaint, and it's minor in the scope of things.Definitely glad I bought these!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12207643", "1": "0.31903902", "2": "0.1795409", "3": "0.11151636", "4": "0.11997688", "5": "0.10578413", "6": "0.04206627"}}
