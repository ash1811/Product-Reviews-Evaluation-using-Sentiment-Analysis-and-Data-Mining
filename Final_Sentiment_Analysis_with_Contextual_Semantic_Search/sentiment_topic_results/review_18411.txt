{"text": "Calvin Klein Microfiber socksThese socks are extremely comfortable to wear, they seem to wick away sweat and feel soft/slippery inside dress shoes. I noticed that in each 3-pack of socks that the patterns differ. I was hoping they'd all be the same pattern making life easier when washing and drying the socks, but now I have to carefully sort them to avoid mismatches. The microfiber material is mainly polyester which I have found can last significantly longer than cotton or other natural fibers.After washing them, I noticed that the microfiber picks up on a lot of debris/dirt/lint and that they tend to \"fuzz\" up very easily. They're not as durable as the cheap department store polyester dress socks I've worn for over a year. The Calvin Klein logo also faded out after 1 wash.Overall: 4/5 stars, comfortable but tends to attract a lot of lint/fuzz.UPDATE: 2013 OCT 15After wearing these socks for just over a year, I have to report they are extremely durable. The elastic is strong, and even though the microfiber attracts a lot of lint/dust/fuzz, the material is holding up. Most of the logos are gone through washing and wearing, but the socks are hole-free and good to go. I upgraded my original rating of 3 stars to 4 stars.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.15587234", "2": "0.16336407", "3": "0.2763916", "4": "0.10863436", "5": "0.1503407", "6": "0.14325435"}}
