{"text": "Great Watch... I am on my 2nd one. My first watch is still working and keeping excellent time on my friends ATV handle bars. lol  I replaced the Band twice and bought a new one simply cause it started to not look so nice. It took the licking and kept on ticking for years with the original battery. Just too banged up to be presentable. So before the 3rd band wore out, and the battery failed... I decided to just buy a new one here. In a nutshell, Great watch... Easy to use... and a great price on Amazon.Mark from CANADA!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13801716", "1": "0.32218537", "2": "0.2204581", "3": "0.0822481", "4": "0.063347206", "5": "0.17122887"}}
