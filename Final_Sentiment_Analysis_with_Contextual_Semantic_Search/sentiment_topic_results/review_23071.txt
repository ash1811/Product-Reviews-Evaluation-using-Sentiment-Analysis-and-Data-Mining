{"text": "Reef makes a men's \"Smoothy Thong Sandal\" that I could never tire of wearing! I've had these for a while now. Moreover, these last a very long time just as others say they do; I don't have to replace them often; a pair lasts over two years and that's great! They fit me every bit as comfortably as they did when I last wore them at the end of last summer.  I also wore these nearly every day on a recent vacation and they fit great with support that made my feet feel comfortable when I was walking on the beach or going for longer walks.  Overall, the design that shapes the sandal to fit my feet, including the way Reef makes the soles, is terrific, too.Of course, these can be worn around the house; they are comfortable when I am just hanging around the house or even when I'm doing errands around town in warm weather.The only cautionary note is that they DO run a little small. If you wear a size nine shoe, order a size ten. Two or three other reviewers have noted this, so when I placed my order I took their advice--it worked! Going up one size is definitely the thing to do when you order these sandals.Overall, I highly recommend these sandals. They are very well constructed and thus you don't have to replace them very often even if you wear them frequently.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.095718466", "1": "0.34919035", "3": "0.1784425", "4": "0.14325434", "5": "0.19421263", "6": "0.036942396"}}
