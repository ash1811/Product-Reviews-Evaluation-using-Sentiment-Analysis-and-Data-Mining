{"text": "I've had these same pants for two years in my nursing program. I decided to replace them because pinning is coming up and the old ones are dingy. These look nice but are much stiffer than my old ones. I thought maybe it was due to being new and washed less, but I compared them to a brand new cherokee workwear top that I also replaced and these just feel cheap compared to that one. Don't know what is different. Overall, decent pants.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.079502285", "1": "0.35923022", "3": "0.25471544", "4": "0.09250979", "5": "0.08926763", "6": "0.12143113"}}
