{"text": "I bought my first pair of these to use for long portages un in the Candadian Quetico lake system.  Excellent grip, width, and already broken in from the box.  Excellent ankle support and toe support.  I can't talk enough about the toe support.  When you're leaping from rock to rock or you're walking up a half mile hill in shin and ankle busting conditions these are the shoes you want.  Usually under what conditions these boots saved my toes countless times in addition to being very solid on the outside, had zero torn leather.  I just bought these as a second to put back in case somebody decides to stop making them!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05142277", "1": "0.32261208", "2": "0.10933559", "3": "0.18273024", "4": "0.15125771", "5": "0.104845725", "6": "0.07779591"}}
