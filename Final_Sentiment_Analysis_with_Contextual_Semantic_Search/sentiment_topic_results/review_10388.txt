{"text": "I treated myself to a pair of &#34;real&#34; UGGs this time around. There's no question the boots are well made, and it's nice to have that recognized brand on the back of the boot, but I'm having trouble justifying the additional $$ for the brand. I ordered a size up to accommodate for the fluffy fit in the boot, and that was a good choice. I'm finding the upper part of the boot fits a little more snug that previous boots I've purchased. It's not too small, just tighter, so be aware of that, especially if you don't have pencil-thin legs. These are very nice boots, definitely far above the bargain options you'll find at your local big box stores, but they are quite pricey compared to some good quality alternatives that are mid-priced. Love the boot, don't love the price.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16342792", "1": "0.33220097", "2": "0.059655793", "3": "0.20384885", "4": "0.1506501", "5": "0.049115803", "6": "0.041100543"}}
