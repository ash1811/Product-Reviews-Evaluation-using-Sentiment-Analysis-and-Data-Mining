{"text": "For the first half of this year I suffered with Plantar Fasciitis and Metatarsal Stress syndrome(a bone fracture).  My foot was improving slowly, until I discovered Birkenstock shoes.  I noticed that the orthotics that the specialist had made just for me, looked like the foot bed in Birkenstocks.  Sure nuff!!!  I bought me my first Birkenstock sandal and within 3 days I could tell a hugh difference in the pain subsiding.  I now wear Birkenstocks everyday.  Bought these so I could wear socks with them.  I love my Birkenstocks.  I now own 4 pair and will be buying more.  My foot pain is gone!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1534379", "1": "0.048068948", "2": "0.07005734", "3": "0.21543255", "4": "0.23293975", "5": "0.23002473", "6": "0.05003882"}}
