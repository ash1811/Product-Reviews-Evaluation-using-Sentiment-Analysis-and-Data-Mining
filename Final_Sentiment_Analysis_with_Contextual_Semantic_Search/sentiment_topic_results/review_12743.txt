{"text": "These boots are pretty much exactly what you'd expect for the price tag.  I do not imply that they're a waste of money or anything of that sort.  In fact, I really like my pair.  But they're best suited for \"cheap, knock-around boots\" when you are looking for rather disposable clothing.  I bought mine for paintball, knowing full well I will destroy them in months, and couldn't be more pleased.  Here's everything I've noticed about them:Overall construction:-The stitching looks a bit light-duty.  Expect some breakage in due time.-Vent holes, eyelets, and canvas seem middle-of-the-line.  Same as above.-The laces that come with these boots aren't actually boot laces.  Think long shoelaces.-Soles seem to be soft rubber that will wear easily.  Conversely, the lugs are thick allowing for plenty of wear.Fit and feel:-These were designed to be worn with boot socks (two pair of socks will also suffice), meaning they will run big.-Because of the above, they are also unlined.  Without proper socks, they can have some hot spots that would no doubt blister, especially when new.  Wearing thick socks or two pair eliminates this completely.-They are extremely lightweight, great for all-day comfort.  I was thoroughly impressed by this.-Even with socks on and out in the heat, they seem to vent incredibly well.  My feet never seem hot.Consensus:Great for occasional wear.  If you just need a set of boots to get dirty, scuffed, torn up, and otherwise mistreated, there is no better deal on the planet.  If you are looking for a genuinely hardcore pair of boots to break-in, take care of, do 30-mile marches in, and that you will miss when you must say goodbye, skip them.UPDATE 11/23/2012:To my surprise, they are still holding up quite well.  I bought a pair of insoles for them -- a must -- but they aren't torn up or ruined.  Still using them for paintball.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11192034", "1": "0.2928329", "2": "0.18773703", "3": "0.12757677", "4": "0.14066154", "5": "0.13727076"}}
