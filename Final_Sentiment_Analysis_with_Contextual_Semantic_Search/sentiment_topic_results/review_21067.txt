{"text": "I love Keen's shoes but these seem a little large. I Will return these and get a 1/2 size smaller.I have to make another comment on Keen shoes. I've got 2 older pair of Keen's and love them! BUT after trying these on and looking at them at Cabelas I believe they're quality is going down hill. I hate it because I love the old ones. I have to admit they look great in the pictures but trying them on is a different story. I won't be buying anymore Keens.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.074019834", "1": "0.150096", "2": "0.083843544", "3": "0.3199072", "4": "0.120627634", "6": "0.24844971"}}
