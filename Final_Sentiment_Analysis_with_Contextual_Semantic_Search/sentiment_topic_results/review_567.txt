{"text": "I ordered a 54 waist and the rear pockets seemed like a direct clone of a 30, I could only get my fingertips in there. No, I don't need to put my whole hands inside, but with these only a thin wallet would fit. I say when they make the pants bigger they should make the pockets proportionally bigger too. It would not only be more practical but would improve the &#34;look&#34;. To my eye, rear jeans pockets should both start from about 2-3 inches from the center seam and be sized big enough to cover most of the butt. At Wrangler they start the small pockets about 2&#34; from the 2 side seams and then that's IT, leaving a big empty butt space.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1314033", "1": "0.284301", "3": "0.19004376", "4": "0.18389688", "6": "0.20587544"}}
