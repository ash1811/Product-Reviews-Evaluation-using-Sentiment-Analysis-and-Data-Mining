{"text": "Like 1/2 of the reviewers, I bought these for my SO for xmas. He is a fairly honest person and said these slippers are pretty good as far as slippers go, but he still like his old pair better. They are a little stiff and although I bought his normal size, they fit him tightly at first but they have stretched a little with daily use over the last month. He doesn't like the stiffness of the sole either. A little more flexibility so they are more like a slipper than a shoe would have made them better. He did keep them though and he does wear them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1136579", "1": "0.2495281", "2": "0.08042642", "3": "0.30160195", "4": "0.10817706", "6": "0.1438491"}}
