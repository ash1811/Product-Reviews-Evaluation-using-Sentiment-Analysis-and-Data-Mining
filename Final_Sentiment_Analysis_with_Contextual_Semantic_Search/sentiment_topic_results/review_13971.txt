{"text": "This is the first new watch I've purchased in many years, and so far, I love it. A handsome, but simple and easy-to-see face with day and date, with accurate timekeeping. I get the impression from other reviews that a lot of guys got this watch for the same reason I did....sick and tired of watches that die after 12 to 24 months and then spending anything from $5 to $10 to install a new battery. The Citizen Eco-Drive is charged by the sun (or indoor light), so it's enviromentally friendly.The one thing that kept the watch from getting 5 stars, and the very gripe others have expressed, is the band. I'm a slender guy, with smaller-than-average wrists, and even on my arm, the band was too small, with no 'happy medium'. At the 2-hole setting, it will stay on my wrist, but moves around. At 3 holes, it cuts off the circulation. There are 7 holes total, and I can't imagine anyone, not even an extremely petite woman or very small child using the 7th hole. Citizen must have designed this using those ultra-slim Asian wrists in mind (Citizen is based in Tokyo). They should really consider giving this otherwise excellent watch a different band.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.10496327", "2": "0.1862143", "3": "0.25258863", "4": "0.16119121", "5": "0.12919012", "6": "0.16371298"}}
