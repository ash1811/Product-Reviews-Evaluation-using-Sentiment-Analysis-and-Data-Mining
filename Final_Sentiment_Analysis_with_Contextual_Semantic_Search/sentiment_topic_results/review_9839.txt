{"text": "I should have read the reviews before ordering, but I've always had such good luck with Bass shoes that I impulsively hit the order button. These sandals I'm just not sure about. They look nice and appear to be well-made, but after reading about broken straps, I'm not so sure. They are comfortable to wear, but the straps seem a bit thin and flimsy and they sort of collapse when not being work. These were also too loose and to make them fit, I have to add and addition hole in the strap. The problem is, when I tighten the strap enough to keep them from flopping around on my feet, the buckle is sitting right on top of my foot and looks weird. It was already too far up. I think Bass needs to rethink the design and up the quality. I won't be buying these again and cancelled my order for a black pair.  I am rather disappointed in Bass and will rethink buying any more shoes from them. At least they weren't terribly expensive and I'll wear them occasionally, but not far from home as I don't want to be stuck somewhere with a broken strap.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13970937", "1": "0.20464812", "2": "0.331438", "3": "0.17339243", "4": "0.10506751", "5": "0.043276295"}}
