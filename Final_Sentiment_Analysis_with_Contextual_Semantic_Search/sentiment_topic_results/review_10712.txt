{"text": "These boots were a replacment for a compititors product of a similiar desgin and price point. These uppers seem like they will hold up longer. Overall I'm happier with these boots the fit and support are great. If everything goes well I'll likely buy another pair in a couple of years. Boots at this price point are light on your feet but they need replacing more often.
