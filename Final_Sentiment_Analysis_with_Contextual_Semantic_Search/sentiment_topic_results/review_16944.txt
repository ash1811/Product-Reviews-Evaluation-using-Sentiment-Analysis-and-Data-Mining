{"text": "I ordered these coveralls in black, 52X34.  When I received them, they were 52X30.  I thought I had made a mistake and had to eat the $17 return postage.  I reordered the same item. I made sure of the size.  When I checked the order it was listed as 52X30 again.  I tried to cancel, but I was too late.  I notified the seller with email.  The seller called me back pretty quickly and told me that there was nothing they could do about it because it was Amazon's fault for not removing the 34 inch length option.  I asked him how that helps me and why would I do business with them again.  He said, and I quote, \"Well, what am I supposed to do about it?\".  Now, in order to get my refund I again have to eat $17 shipping.  The guy that called didn't understand why that was a problem.  NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22371398", "1": "0.084980965", "2": "0.09130496", "3": "0.24390723", "4": "0.15069254", "6": "0.20274656"}}
