{"text": "I'm glad I waited to write this review. I sent back half my order thinking these panties looked too thin (compared to the Hanes I'd learned to love). Well, I was wrong. Washing and drying changes the texture so that the material was just as soft and nice weight as what I was used to. However: a warning. I neglected to look at the picture of the briefs. These are not &#34;your mother's&#34; briefs. Like many jeans designations : they &#34;sit below waist&#34; just as the picture shows.  The panties  took some getting used to. Now I like them very much as they fit my seat better than standard briefs did.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11439845", "1": "0.3321957", "2": "0.21306202", "3": "0.08987566", "4": "0.13664457", "5": "0.03561416", "6": "0.07820944"}}
