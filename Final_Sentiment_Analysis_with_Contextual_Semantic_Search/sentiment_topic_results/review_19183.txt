{"text": "This is my fourth pair of Maui Jim sunglasses, and the second pair with glass lenses. I have become a firm believer in glass lenses because they offer a clearer, crisper, and overall superior lens compared to polycarbonate. It is a fact that MJ lenses are the best in the industry, and MJ is still an independent company which makes its own frames and lenses. Many other brands are owned by Luxottica, and it's not so clear cut where frames, lenses, or final assembly originate from. With Maui Jim, it is either Japan or Italy. The fit and finish on these glasses is typical of Maui Jim, which is to say excellent. The temples of these Stingrays are rather wide which help to block more sun light from getting into your eyes, but they also block peripheral vision so be aware of that especially when driving. They are very lightweight which makes them really comfortable to wear all day. These glasses come with a semi hard \"sport\" case, I would prefer a hard clam shell case. Overall, this is yet another home run for Maui Jim, and thanks to their superior products and designs, another dent in my wallet. An absolutely top notch product. Made in Italy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.44320896", "1": "0.13630679", "2": "0.09569128", "3": "0.16352427", "4": "0.044287853", "5": "0.114725955"}}
