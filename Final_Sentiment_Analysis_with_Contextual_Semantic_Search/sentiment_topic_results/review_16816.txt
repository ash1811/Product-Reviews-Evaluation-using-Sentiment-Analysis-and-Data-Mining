{"text": "CROCS \"BEACH CLOG\" model is just as awesome as the \"SPECIALIST\" model which I love so much. This model averages $23 and may be the model so many people think about when they say Crocs are ugly. I have news for you, but you should believe your own eyes: CROCS ARE NOT UGLY.No matter how ugly you may think they are, once you try on a pair, you will never want to take them off - guaranteed. This model as you see is riddled with Swiss-cheese-style holes. It's good ventilation for summer, but I think you'll be pretty hot under the collar if it rains. That cold rain gets into these holes faster than spinach into Popeye!Yet Crocs, made of a unique material known as Croclite, are in my opinion the finest and most brilliant shoes ever manufactured. Sturdy design, functionality, practicality, a comfortable fit that will make at least your feet think they've died and gone to Foot Heaven ... it's all here. And anyone who says they are ugly is an insulting, insensitive and tasteless snot.Let me just say these shoes will take a beating and then some. You'll barely notice any wear on the soles. They love all feet and all styles of socks - or no socks. Got them stained or dirty? Wash them off in the bath or shower, it's that simple. Comfort, go-almost-anywhere (I know a guy who wears his black Crocs to funerals but I would not do it), toss-them-anyplace, last forever, and NO THEY ARE NOT UGLY.These spectacular shoes lured me away from my decades of wearing Okabashi sandals ... they are that comfortable. Not too worried about cold feet, then wear these in winter. Perfect year-round and you won't believe how cool they are in the summer heat.These will be the last mules, clogs, driving moccasins or loafers you'll ever really want to buy. You may buy more, you may buy other types of shoes too - but these things will make you fall in eternal love.CROCS: YOU ONLY THINK THEY'RE UGLY. WAIT TIL YOU WEAR THEM.Otherwise, you can't pass up the chance to own a couple of pairs of this style. It is comfort, good support, ease of maintenance, hard-wearing, and you will find your color and size, just read the options carefully.CROCS: THEY AIN'T UGLY, THEY'S SNAPPY!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.054761823", "1": "0.24306461", "2": "0.103346296", "3": "0.26899612", "4": "0.08003184", "5": "0.0904406", "6": "0.15935871"}}
