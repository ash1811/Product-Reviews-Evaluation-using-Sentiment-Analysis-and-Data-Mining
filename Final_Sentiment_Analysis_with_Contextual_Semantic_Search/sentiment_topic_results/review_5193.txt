{"text": "I bought these thinking that I was getting the best slippers because of the UGG name brand. I have another pair of UGG boots and love them. These had no give in the sole so it felt like I was walking on snowshoes. Very stiff. The inside was plush and warm without socks on but I tend to wear socks so it was impossible to get my foot into the slipper with any socks on--even thin ones. I have some slippers I got at Target that I would rather keep than waste so much money on these. If you love a very stiff sole with no give and want to wear slippers without socks these may be for you. Not for me.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.27480105", "2": "0.15005393", "3": "0.1298085", "4": "0.079746366", "5": "0.23664661", "6": "0.12651038"}}
