{"text": "The first pair that I ordered were too small. I wear size 13 Mens/USA, and ordered size 13. They were too small, very tight and constricting. This is the second pair of Acorn slippers that I ordered, in 14/15. Now that they actually fit on my feet, I'm very pleased. I've worn many slippers in my lifetime and these, are by far, the most comfortable. I don't have a tremendous amount of faith in the construction/quality but I don't want to be too harsh on the score because I haven't been wearing them for very long and can't really testify to their durability. I can testify to how the quality (materials, stitching, etc. ) looks and feels, and that is a little on the light side. I wear these at work while I sit in a chair in front of a computer screen all day. Occasionally I'll go to the kitchen or restroom or walk to my car but they don't get much mileage on a daily basis. They keep my feet warm and are very soft with adequate cushion. Overall, the price at time of purchase (~$35) is good for the product. Lost one star due to inaccurate sizing and underwhelming construction/materials. But only 1 star. I am happy with this purchase, would buy these again, and would recommend these to others.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08028998", "1": "0.41350836", "2": "0.09443006", "3": "0.09771528", "4": "0.09973649", "5": "0.07089776", "6": "0.14342211"}}
