{"text": "I bought this bag to put most of my misc. camping items in for storage and to take with us to go camping. When it arrived I took the thing out and this thing is HUGE. I did not expect it to be that big. That is a good thing actually. I only filled half the thing up with plates, pumps, propane canisters and other items and still have a ton of room to spare.
