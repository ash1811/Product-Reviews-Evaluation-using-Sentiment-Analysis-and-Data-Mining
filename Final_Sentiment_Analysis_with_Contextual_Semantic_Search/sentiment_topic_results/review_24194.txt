{"text": "This bra runs at least two sizes smaller than my normal size.  The chest band is at least two inches too short, the shoulder straps are too short, and the back shoulder clasp is also impossible to clasp.  The size is marked as 38D, but it is more like a 34 B or C,  Also, there is no cup support.I would not recommend this bra.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.145938", "2": "0.16977617", "3": "0.28317124", "4": "0.23930803", "6": "0.15404452"}}
