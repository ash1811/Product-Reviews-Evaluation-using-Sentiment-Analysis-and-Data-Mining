{"text": "What was I thinking buying Lee?  Maybe it was the price.  The right size.  Must have been out of my mind.These jeans, if they can be called jeans, are cheap and flimsy compared to Levis.  I work in the field and industrial environments and these jeans just didn't hold up.  From the odd pocket designs to the absurd Lee logo which serves as a belt loop to the flimsy quality of the denim (i hope it is denim), these jeans have been epic failures all around.I would have rated them lower but they, technically, still function to protect my legs.Results of wearing these jeans into the field?  Holes, tears, snags, and rips.  They might be ok for casual wear...but if you are looking for a high-quality pair of jeans that will last, look elsewhere.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14170201", "1": "0.13093793", "2": "0.19552608", "3": "0.17850204", "4": "0.14123996", "5": "0.114238836", "6": "0.097853154"}}
