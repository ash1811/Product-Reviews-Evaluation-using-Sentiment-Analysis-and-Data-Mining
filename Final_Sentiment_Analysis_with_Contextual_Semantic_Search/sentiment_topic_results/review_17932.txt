{"text": "This watch is inexpensive, attractive and accurate. The numbers are easy to read and there is a second hand. Straightforward design, no glow-in-the-dark, light, calendar, or special functions.However, the band is a bit short. It measures 8 1/8\" from the hinge of the buckle to the last hole--which you really can't use without losing the watch. The rubbery material doesn't seem to be stretching out, either. If you have large wrists or like to wear a watch loose like a bracelet, then this one may not be ideal.Otherwise, at this price it would make sense to buy a new watch rather than have the battery replaced in another inexpensive one.The movement is made in Japan and the watch is assembled in China.The front says \"Water Resist\" and the metal back says \"Water Resistant\" which means it is okay to wash your hands while wearing it but not to submerge it in water.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12023199", "1": "0.1860837", "2": "0.24236648", "3": "0.18610512", "4": "0.0735504", "5": "0.10487644", "6": "0.08678585"}}
