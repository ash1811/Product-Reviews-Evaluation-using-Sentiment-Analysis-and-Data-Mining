{"text": "I just ordered more! I bought some at Kohls and loved them. I am tired of lacey underwear falling apart. When I found these on amazon, I ordered more and was just as pleased. They have full coverage and a little bit of style.  If you are wondering about sizing, they are slightly more generous than Victoria secret's sizing.  I wouldn't say 1 whole size larger, but maybe 1/2 a size larger.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.068641216", "2": "0.06233526", "3": "0.35579392", "4": "0.11847286", "5": "0.351288", "6": "0.039577417"}}
