{"text": "Overall good quality but the fit is disturbing.  I wear a size 10 EE, so I thought the medium (for size 9-10) would fit nice and snug.  Instead, they can slip off easily while I'm walking if I shuffle my feet at all, or if I'm waling on steps.  That's even with me wearing socks.  For that I've got to take a star off.For the rest of the product it's great.  The soles are rubber and don't slip easily and the top material is soft, comfortable and keeps its shape well.  They look good and are comfortable.-D", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11322485", "1": "0.3761449", "3": "0.15872072", "4": "0.031073818", "5": "0.17614435", "6": "0.14213441"}}
