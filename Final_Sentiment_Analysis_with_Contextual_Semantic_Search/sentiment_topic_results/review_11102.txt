{"text": "I purchased this visor because it looked really nice. But, buyer beware.  Don't be like me and wait until it's too late to return it.  When I got the visor I didn't put it on immediately.  I recommend you do.  When I finally did use it, I couldn't wear it because it was made crooked. The visor was attached wrong to the band and blocked my left eye.  Maybe this was just a one time happening and someone else who purchased it had no problem.  But this was my experience.  I won't buy another.  I'll quit being lazy and go to the store and try it on in person before I buy.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.21313938", "1": "0.24793814", "2": "0.12970442", "3": "0.10722336", "4": "0.09127507", "6": "0.20796376"}}
