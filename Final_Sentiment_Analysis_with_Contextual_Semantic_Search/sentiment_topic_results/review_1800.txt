{"text": "I really like these training pants. While they're not waterproof, they are padded and will catch most &#34;accidents&#34; (that aren't major). What I like best about them is their stretchy waist band. Gerber training underwear don't have that, and it can be difficult for a newly trained little one to pull them up and down. These pants are more forgiving.P.S. They run a little large, but that was ok with me. It allowed my little one to work with them more easily.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.32092983", "2": "0.11195902", "3": "0.2742468", "4": "0.21794324", "6": "0.067742646"}}
