{"text": "This is my second automatic Grand Diver and I love it. I've always wanted one but I wanted a good one; you really have to look at an automatic Grand Diver up close to appreciate their beauty and their craftsmanship. The Grand Divers' do seem to be underpriced for how well they're put together. The glass display on back adds a nice touch of elegance, and the engine inside does appear to wind in both directions!The screw down crown with mechanical wind hack function was found to be an unbelievable surprise. I have a 9 inch wrist which is why I bought a Grand Diver as so many others seem to fall short at the eight inch mark for me. I will have to remove a link or two on this watch but that's nothing; it will fit a person with a wrist larger than 9 inches. The second hand glides nicely across the dial and everything is highly polished.The royal blue color is a true and deep royal blue. The deepness of the blue is similar to the ones seen on many high end luxury watches, meaning it doesn't look purple. Overall, I'm really becoming a huge fan of this line.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11398876", "1": "0.20021819", "2": "0.16839385", "3": "0.123528324", "4": "0.102894776", "5": "0.10950883", "6": "0.18146734"}}
