{"text": "First NO INSTRUCTIONS come with this product.  If you dont know the first thing about tinkering with watches this is not the product for you.  I used this product to size a watch band and it did its job ok, but the pin on the sizing tool was a little bent, I was afraid to try and straighten it for fear of breaking it off it is very thin, but it worked the way it was.  It will help greatly if you use some kind of magnifier (I have a head band magnifier) to line up the pin remover or you will break the pin and or scratch your watch band. All the tools in this kit are made a bit on the cheap side including the cardboard case.  I have decided to keep this kit because, one I will probable only use it to size watch bands and two its just more trouble than its worth to send it back and like I said it did work.  I will be on the look out for a better quality kit in the near future.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07210068", "1": "0.24285518", "2": "0.26824316", "3": "0.13986523", "4": "0.14231062", "5": "0.10029885", "6": "0.034326274"}}
