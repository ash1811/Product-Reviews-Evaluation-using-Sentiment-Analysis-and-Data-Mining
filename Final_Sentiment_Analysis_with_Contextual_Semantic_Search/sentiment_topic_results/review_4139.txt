{"text": "I'm 5'5&#34; and 140 lbs. I really like these pants, but I could have easily fit into a small. The mediums are huge on me-- long and baggy. Being polyester, they don't shrink, so I shouldn't have bought a size up. They can be worn on the waist or hip.These are very soft on the inside and are very warm. They are sweatpants. I probably wouldn't work out in them unless I was outside in very cold weather. I wear them around the house and I don't feel the need to change out of them if I go out for groceries or something because they look okay.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07131353", "1": "0.39214888", "2": "0.048306346", "3": "0.21299616", "5": "0.09877155", "6": "0.17333245"}}
