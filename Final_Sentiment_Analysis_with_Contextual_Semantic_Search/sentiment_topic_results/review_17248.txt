{"text": "I bought this boot for a slightly higher price that it is listed now, but at a much lower price than anywhere online.  I was so pleased that it arrived within 3 days of ordering, and that it matched the first reviewer's description:  Don't second guess!I wore these boots for about 6 hours the first time I wore them, and did some moderate walking downtown.  I did not get any blisters or pain like new shoes normally give.  They are a nice leather, have a nice, skid resistant sole, and are probably the most high quality dress boots I own.  What a deal!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09820043", "1": "0.23004963", "2": "0.12794428", "3": "0.10106785", "4": "0.121813975", "5": "0.237086", "6": "0.08383785"}}
