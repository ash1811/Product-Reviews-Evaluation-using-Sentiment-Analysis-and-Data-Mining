{"text": "I got the Black with White stripes & gray toe.So, the packaging was great. I was really impressed that extra laces were included. They arrived quickly and it didn't feel like \"another cheap box.\"They fit perfectly the first time I put them on. This is really an oddity to me because of my slightly different sized feet (half size difference) and because of previous experiences with many other types of shoes. I wore Adidas Superstars for years (nearly a decade) and wanted to try something else. I have a pair of Vibram FiveFingers Trek LS as well and wanted something more \"normal\" looking.These have already received numerous compliments by people I know.They're great for driving as well. Good pedal feel, roomy toe box, just enough flexibility.I have two complaints:1) Minor - I wish they had a little more to them. Just a thin layer of padding inside and on the tongue. Also, the holes you see that are gray in the picture? Yeah they go straight to your sock/foot, they are open.2) Do not wear them when it's wet outside or if there's a chance of rain. You will slip. They have absolutely no grip on a wet surface. Great grip inside or on a dry surface though.3) Also a little peeved it went on sale within a week after I got them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24050273", "1": "0.23945656", "2": "0.070554055", "3": "0.1640953", "4": "0.1320545", "5": "0.118486", "6": "0.03485087"}}
