{"text": "These comfy PJ,s deserve the 5 stars and there is nothing wrong with them. I just have a personal  preference to mention. Because  this PJ fabric is so soft and silky and has fabric covered buttons,  I like to tack a few stitches between buttons or run a row of machine stitching down the row of buttons and make the top a slipover.  Then I'm  not concerned about being a peek show when I run around in my PJs.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.09926114", "2": "0.3618887", "3": "0.32048568", "5": "0.114636615", "6": "0.09639247"}}
