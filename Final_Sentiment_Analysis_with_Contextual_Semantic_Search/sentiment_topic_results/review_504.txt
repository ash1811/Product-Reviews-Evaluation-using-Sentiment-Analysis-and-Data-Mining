{"text": "I am a Wrangler jean's fan for many years.  I had purchased and worn another pair, but lost weight so was looking for a smaller pair.  Yipee!I went down 2 in. by waist and hips, but allowed the &#34;relaxed&#34; in my newer sizing thinking, &#34;Gosh, sure hope I didn't get over hopeful for smaller size.&#34;  When I tried them on, I was astonished that the waist was 2-3 in.s larger so have to use a belt to cinch it up tight enough so I won't loose them.  I have worn them but becuz of the tight belt to keep them on, I am uncomfortable when sitting or bending over as the belt doesn't &#34;stretch&#34; with use light the jeans do.  Out of the dryer, they are tight for a little bit but they soon &#34;stretch&#34; out with wear.(I HATE the women's &#34;stretch&#34; jeans!!!  When wearing them, I feel they do like the hated pany-hose and gradually the crotch feels like it's trying for my knees which is truly uncomfortable!!  So &#34;X&#34; to those type of jeans!)Plus, I like the thickness of men's jeans cuz they wear for a long time for me.I'm debating whether or not to send them back (gotta look at &#34;returns&#34; to see if even feasible).My husband use to get so aggravated when buying his Wranglers at the size he wanted because no 2 were alike in size...some coming small and some large.  Wrangler needs to make sure the sizes are correct!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09837176", "1": "0.23429291", "2": "0.15303533", "3": "0.09567823", "4": "0.22255594", "5": "0.09692988", "6": "0.09913597"}}
