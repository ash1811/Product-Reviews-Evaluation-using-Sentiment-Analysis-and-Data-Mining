{"text": "Don't buy these expecting much thermal insulation, but they work great in chilly summers. I own probably 6 different types of terramar thermal's, and I love them all as they each have their place. These are really great for my summer hikes, when it may drop 55-65. I usually don't bring a sleeping bag in theses temperatures, instead just a pair of these, the thermasilk shirt, and maybe a lightweight bag liner.To compare these to the Terramar Silkweight (the next closest comparison in temp and weight) :* These are 100% pure silk.. Silkweight is 100% polyester* These are good down to 65 by themselves ( wearing shorts and maybe rain pants ).. Silkweight is good closer to 55 with the same.* These weigh 90g in Medium.. Silkweight weighs 140g in Medium.Other notes:* These are VERY comfortable to wear.* Silk feels great against your skin.* They are rather see through when stretched out over your sikn.* They don't stretch as well as other terramars obviously, because its pure silk.* They seem as durable as any other terramar. I've worn them out sitting on the ground by a fire, minor branch snags here and there, no rips or issues.If I had to come up with any con... I'd like to see a hybrid of the silk with a little polyester or spandex. Something between the weight of these and the Silkweights, that offered a little stretch that fits a bit better (or a bit more like the rest of terramars), and maybe offered a bit more warmth. Although it's not really a con as much as a wish for another product.These are great warm weather thermals though, that I will continue to use for many years.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.039050207", "1": "0.44019243", "2": "0.27977654", "4": "0.086759925", "5": "0.041924734", "6": "0.110118106"}}
