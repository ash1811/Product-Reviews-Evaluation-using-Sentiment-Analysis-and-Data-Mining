{"text": "Finally, I got a pair from Levi's where the inseam was correct. this is a review i just wrote for Lee:I am going to buy more Lee now than Levi's. I had never bought Lees until this holiday season. I now have several pairs and they are consistent (so far) in length and quality. i am 6 ft 3 and usually buy 34 x 34. With Levi's sometimes the inseam is slightly too short and other times it is almost 2 inches too long. I have many pairs of Levi's now that i must get hemmed. Plus their quality varies - maybe depending on where they are made. Some pairs seem more like Spandex than Denim. Nevertheless, sometimes i like the colors that Levi's offer so in the future i may buy them again. But mostly now Lees.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16623737", "1": "0.22769819", "2": "0.12392448", "3": "0.08297085", "4": "0.10376852", "5": "0.08013055", "6": "0.21527006"}}
