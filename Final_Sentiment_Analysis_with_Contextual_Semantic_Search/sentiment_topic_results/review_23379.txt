{"text": "I'd been wearing Thorlos for 30 years when, three or four years ago, every pair I bought would have holes in the ball of the foot after a couple of months - even after switching off. I noticed that the men's store in our \"neighborhood\" carried these Wigwam Hikers (in kind of a grey \"tweed\" only), and I thought I'd try a pair. Oddly, a single pair costs as much there as a two-pack here, so I'll be coming here from now on - though I don't know about shipping etc.Anyway, long story short, they are cushy. They are warm, but not so warm that they can't be worn in summer. They do not seem to run, and I haven't worn a hole in any of the 8 pair I ended up with over the past 6 months.They are extremely comfortable. I have taken to turning them inside out when I wash them, and I made sure to wash all 8 pair at the same time so that I could be certain of getting even wear. If I had a suggestion for any manufacturer it would be to do what Thorlo USED TO DO 25 years ago: they had blue, green, red, grey, or black bands around the tops. It was easy to match them up. That aside, I have a new favorite, and I wear them on hikes in the snow in California's Sierras, and in the foothills or lowlands during the summer. They must breathe since my feet never seem to sweat in them.I must add one point: when new, they take up a half a size in a pair of shoes, so lace loosely for the first few times. Seems to be worse with some Merrell's (shoes). When I'm a multi-millionaire, I'm going to do two things: have my windshield ground to prescription and wear socks once and then put on a new pair. There's no better feeling than a new pair of socks. Well, okay, there are few things that feel almost as good as a new paid of Wigwams. Oh, okay, there are lots of things better...", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08783625", "1": "0.19367364", "2": "0.07093075", "3": "0.27582517", "4": "0.12952845", "5": "0.15206018", "6": "0.09014555"}}
