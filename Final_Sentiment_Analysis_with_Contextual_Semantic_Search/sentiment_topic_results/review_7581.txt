{"text": "This is my third shirt like this and it is so comfortable. I think they run a bit on the large end of sizing, though. So if you are slender especially and usually take a large you may want to get a medium. The forest green is a color that will go well with just about any type of jeans, cargo pants, or tan khakis, that you may wear it with. I'd be a little careful when trying it with other greens though because you'd run into problems there unless it's just right. Really nice quality fabric and a v-neck long sleeve t-shirt or jersey under it is just perfect for a cool day or evening. The pocket is a nice touch as well, and you will see what I mean if you buy one. Definitely worth the price. Of course it arrived on time as usual.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04536137", "1": "0.49758118", "2": "0.07144455", "3": "0.16199286", "4": "0.042497285", "5": "0.14389637", "6": "0.03722636"}}
