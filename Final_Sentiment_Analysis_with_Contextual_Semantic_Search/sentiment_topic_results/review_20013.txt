{"text": "I like the material of the bag but the clasps are really hard to open. The laptop pocket is too large for a computer to fit snug in, it is going to move around alot unless I have a binder or book in the pocket with it. On the plus side, because it is sooo big I will be able to carry my computer and charger, books and many other things! Like the 2 drink holders so I can have my water bottle and a gaterade and the other smaller pockets are nice. Overall a nice bag just wish the laptop pocket was made for a laptop.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16608192", "1": "0.23423517", "2": "0.1948623", "3": "0.05098822", "4": "0.1500189", "5": "0.118433915", "6": "0.085379526"}}
