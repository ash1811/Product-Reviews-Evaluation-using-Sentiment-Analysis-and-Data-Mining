{"text": "I love Eastland shoes!  I am ordering this pair to replace a pair I have had 6 years.  I have foot problems and have to use my own insoles.  I just take out the insole and put mine in and they work perfectly.  I do have a somewhat wide foot, so always order the wider width.  I highly recommend Eastland shoes!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04874881", "1": "0.36833292", "2": "0.22273944", "4": "0.34631693"}}
