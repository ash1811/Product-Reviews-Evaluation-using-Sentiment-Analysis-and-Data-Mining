{"text": "I do not expect a cotton turtleneck to retain its color for many washings but I do expect better than the one washing and faded new turtleneck which is what I got with these Port Authority shirts. With Landsend it takes 20 or more washings to get the fade I saw after one cold water washing of this shirt. Landsend is out of stock until July so I took a chance on this shirt in navy and it turned out to be a mistake.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07276296", "1": "0.15720154", "2": "0.24285746", "3": "0.08213402", "4": "0.13170636", "5": "0.092158765", "6": "0.22117889"}}
