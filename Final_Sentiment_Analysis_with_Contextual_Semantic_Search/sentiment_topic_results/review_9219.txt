{"text": "Having worn my share of expensive, sticky leather slippers -- and squishy cheap foam slippers -- I can appreciate an inexpensive, pleasant-looking, well-made pair of super-casual slip-ons.  Most important: these are solid enough for brief outdoor usage.Dog needs a walk in a hurry?  With these and a robe at the ready, I'm dressed in 30 seconds (at least I'm dressed enough that the neighbors won't call the police): that alone is worth the price of admission.Edit: one year later now, and the slippers are still going strong.  I have worn them on long walks around the neighborhood repeatedly -- they have at least 10 miles of strolling on concrete on them, and the soles are still in fine shape.  These are truly fine slippers for sure.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.1153833", "1": "0.24791728", "2": "0.16887362", "3": "0.067244336", "4": "0.14072166", "5": "0.065835714", "6": "0.19402406"}}
