{"text": "I have many other pairs of 9.5 W shoes and they all fit just fine. These arrived and while the box said 9.5 W, the tag inside the tongue said 9.5. So now I have to wonder if they just dont put the W on the inside tag, or if they shipped the wrong product.I tried them on and WAY TOO TIGHT! Obviously these are not a proper wide size so now I have to wonder if all Merrells are a snug fit and Wide really just means Normal, or if I got the wrong product. Since no store anywhere in 50 miles of me keeps the wide sizes in stock, I will never know.They look nice and seem like they'd be comfortable if they are the right size, and I think they provide good traction on slick surfaces, but since I am returning them I didnt feel like making a trip around the block. Shame, because I think these are exactly what I need for walking around this winter.Be aware if you have wide feet you probably will not be able to find comfortable Jungle Moc's.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06390207", "1": "0.38675308", "2": "0.17687875", "3": "0.092354864", "4": "0.056105886", "5": "0.11963642", "6": "0.104368925"}}
