{"text": "I was looking for a military styled watch and was contemplating buying either this or the Seiko SNK809 automatic watch. In the end I chose the Citizen BM8180-03E because it is essentially a battery operated quartz, which means I won't have to worry about the watch stopping if I have not worn it for a couple of days. Being a quartz, I will not constantly have to adjust the time as quartz watches are generally more accurate than automatics.The solar charging function means that it will require no battery replacements. This is not only environmentally friendly but also saves battery replacement costs. Overall, I am very pleased with this watch. It is more beautiful than shown in the picture.The only minor complaint about this watch is that the second hand of my watch does not line up exactly on the seconds marking on the watch's dial. Still, it is a minor cosmetic imperfection which is common amongst quartz watches which I have owned.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.037513804", "1": "0.120803915", "2": "0.24010918", "3": "0.03253309", "4": "0.1056842", "5": "0.28151086", "6": "0.18184498"}}
