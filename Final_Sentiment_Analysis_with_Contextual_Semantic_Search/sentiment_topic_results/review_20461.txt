{"text": "These have become my favorite slippers.  They are very comfortable to wear, and are warm without overheating my feet.  The foam padding makes walking very comfortable, more so than the usual thin slipper bottom.  The soles provide good traction on hard surfaces.  They are durable as well.  The price is very reasonable for the quality of construction and materials.  I am on my third pair, and will continue to buy them as long as they are made.  For what it is worth, my foot size is 10 1/2 to 11D depending on the shoe, and the size 9 1/2-10 1/2 fit me perfectly.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0852332", "1": "0.4408365", "2": "0.031090897", "3": "0.1574313", "4": "0.087155655", "5": "0.10104687", "6": "0.097205564"}}
