{"text": "I purchased 2 pairs 36-32 for myself and 2 for my adult son.  These purchases from Amazon were a good experience for us.  I am puzzled by my purchases recently from Levies.com which were completely unsatisfactory and a disappointment.  From Levies direct we purchased 10 pairs of 560 in which the material was completely different than pictured and replacements were the same.  We also tried some 550 black and the same was true with big differences in the sizing.  The sales people were very nice but had no idea of what they were shipping.  If someone showed me these jeans without tags I would think they were knock offs because of the poor quality and off sizing!  I think this is why there is so much difference in what buyers are reporting back.  You can not be sure what you are going to receive and neither does the sales dept. of Levies.com.  At least with Amazon or Zappos if you should receive a bad pair of Levies returns are easy.  With Levies.com. this was not the case for us.  In Levies the good are good and the bad are completely unacceptable. The men's Levis 550 medium stone washed jeans we have recently received from Amazon and Zappos have been well constructed with the good old heavy denim, which we expect and demand from Levi's, and the good correct fit which is not too much to ask for from their loyal old customers.  Otherwise Levi's will lose us! Some people may think Levis should pay more attention to their quality control and less attention to their political advertising concerning social engineering.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10681231", "1": "0.35063013", "2": "0.14167863", "3": "0.19562982", "4": "0.14246811", "6": "0.060305484"}}
