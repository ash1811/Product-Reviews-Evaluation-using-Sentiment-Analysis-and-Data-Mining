{"text": "I bought three of these - one for everyone in the house that didn't already have a balaclava.  The price was great & it was an item we needed for cold weather.  The material is fine but they fit REALLY small.  When you put them on, they leave a big bubble on the top of your head, as in, it can't be pulled all the way down over your head because it is small at the top and the materlal does not have enough give to stretch out & fit around the head.  Hubby tried them - didn't fit/too small, I tried them - didn't fit/too small (& I am a small/petite woman).  I assumed it had to do w/my hair, so I had my 8 & 10 year old boys try them on.  The fit them good enough, but stil are small/have the bubble on the tops of their heads.  I opted to keep them for my kids as backups to their other winter gear, however I would not order them again.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.032141667", "1": "0.31775868", "2": "0.063751586", "3": "0.21674708", "5": "0.23539338", "6": "0.13139935"}}
