{"text": "My daughter is 14 months old and I believe that this swim diaper will fit for the rest of the summer but if I had gotten a size 12 months when I first ordered it, it would have been too small. I bought a size 18 months which fits. I wish the snaps on the side weren't plastic because it makes me suspicious of their durability.
