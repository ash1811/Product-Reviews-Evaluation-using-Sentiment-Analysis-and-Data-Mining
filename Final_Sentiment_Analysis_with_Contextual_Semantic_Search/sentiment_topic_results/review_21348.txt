{"text": "This is my 2nd pregnancy (years ago) & for the first one I bought a more expensive pregnancy belt and wore it everyday for my back. It had the velcro, which was irritating. So after reading the reviews, I went with this one & I'm glad I did--it's very comfortable for the price. It does run a bit small, so I sized up (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5). The only issue I have (which is mine & not the belt's) is that though I'm 22 weeks, my kiddo is lying super-low in my belly, and most of the time when I put this on, he starts kicking like crazy (and even more if I'm sitting down with it on). So, I think it will work much better for me as I get bigger.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.039239526", "1": "0.18225007", "2": "0.16111477", "3": "0.22808233", "4": "0.093269", "5": "0.17434688", "6": "0.12169743"}}
