{"text": "First, the shorts are nice, what I expected......But, from the same ad, I ordered two pair of the same shorts, same size, one black and one blue. For some reason this was split into two separate orders.......with different prices on each order, and separate shipping added to both orders, making the sale price very much inflated. Second problem, still haven't received the blue shorts. Was going to return them, but have only received one, and would still be charged two shipping costs plus the return shipping. Have bought a lot of things from Amazon and never encountered this problem before; maybe things are changing. I'll be more careful in the future.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.18314745", "1": "0.19421108", "2": "0.059587803", "3": "0.18134429", "4": "0.2642656", "6": "0.115274936"}}
