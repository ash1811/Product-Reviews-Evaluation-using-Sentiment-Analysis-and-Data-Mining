{"text": "As a 38DDD, finding a sports bra that actually did a good job of 'holding things together', without falling apart within a couple of short weeks, morphing my chest into an unflattering and uncomfortable uniboob or just failing to accomplish anything at all has been a lifelong struggle.  This bra does the trick so well, I have bought several more and made them my everyday bra.  It feels as comfortable as a bathing suit top...well, as comfortable as a bathing suit top would feel if they made decent bathing suit tops in my size, that is.  The underwire holds everything in place and provides excellent lift, yet I have never felt a pinch or a stab from this particular underwire.  It compresses enough to give a nice minimizing effect which is wonderful, and it hoists those puppies up and keeps them there without falling apart after a few hours.  The back never creeps up, and the shoulder straps never fall down, nor do they dig in or act like they are solely responsible for all the load bearing.  True, the bras have enough material in the center that they will show under low-cut tops, but it just looks like you have a tank top or a camisole on underneath so that doesn't bother me.  I still have a couple of regular bras for a few outfits that require them, but for everyday wear, this bra has done wonders for lift, support, minimizing and not losing all its strength after a few weeks of wear.  As for sports, well, I don't jog or anything, but I do intense yoga several times a week and this bra keeps things out of the way so that I can do my poses without having to alter my position to accommodate excess boobage, something that has previously been a problem for me.  I'm almost afraid to write this rave review lest they discontinue this style...that seems to be what happens whenever I declare something a favorite.  PLEASE KEEP MAKING THESE!  I NEED THEM!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12292249", "1": "0.15593317", "2": "0.20418924", "3": "0.26667854", "4": "0.13701986", "5": "0.027955385", "6": "0.08530126"}}
