{"text": "The only kind I ever wear.  Great for everyday.  For walking, too...I've tried all the new kinds of \"gel\" and \"rocker heels,\" and I always come back to these.  The black ones tend to look \"klunky,\" IMO.  (I ordered a pair in black and sent them right back to exchange for the whites I've always worn.)  Good cushioning.  I've never had any problem with sole separating from upper, etc.  You won't be disappointed.  mb", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.26154906", "2": "0.1997578", "3": "0.22013001", "4": "0.05571341", "5": "0.17923991", "6": "0.08056247"}}
