{"text": "Ordered this as a replacement for one that bent.  the original one was part of a kit also purchased here at Amazon.  They are virtually identical.  I adjusted a half dozen watches with the prior one before trying a no-name watch with no arrow markers for the pins.  I knew it was a risk and the pin bent slightly but I was able to straighten it out easily with a pair of needle-nose pliers.  I figured I'd order a second one, just in case, and at this price, it wasn't exactly a budget buster.  This one has already worked fine with one watch and seems built well enough to handle most of my needs.  None of these things are built super-tough, but with patience and care, they do get the job done.  This one comes with several replacement pins, so if one gets bent, just unscrew and replace with another pin.  Even if I were forced to replace it every few months or so, it still saves a ton a money compared to adjustments at the local mall watch shop witch cost a minimum of $20 per adjustment.  Between the first adjuster and now this one, I've already saved enough money to buy forty of these.  Had I gotten all of the adjustments done at the mall, I would have paid over $140.  Three bucks for a tool that has already performed seven $20 adjustments flawlessly on both large and small men's and women's watches is a definite bargain in my book.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.017875997", "1": "0.28407088", "2": "0.2697778", "3": "0.15295555", "4": "0.14260843", "5": "0.10760412", "6": "0.025107209"}}
