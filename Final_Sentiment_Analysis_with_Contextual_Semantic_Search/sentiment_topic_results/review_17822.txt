{"text": "This is the second Casio G-Shock watch that I've owned. I'm retired from scuba diving now, but the first G-Shock was my everyday watch and dive watch, and I regularly took it as deep as 80-90 feet without any problems. After several years, the battery died, and since the watch was getting pretty scratched and beat-up, I ordered a new one, the DW9052-1V model. It's another keeper, with its ruggedness and great accuracy. And it's an impressive-looking watch as well as being so durable.I'm sold on Casio. I've owned four or five Casio watches over the last thirty years or so, and every one of them has been just super. The DW9052-1V G-Shock is no exception.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.026685677", "1": "0.1767928", "2": "0.26536417", "3": "0.08041696", "4": "0.15274282", "5": "0.17242289", "6": "0.12557472"}}
