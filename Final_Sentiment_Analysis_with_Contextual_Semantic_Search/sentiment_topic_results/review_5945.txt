{"text": "ALL OLGA BRAS RUN SMALL...FOR SOME REASON, OLGA BRAS ARE MADE SMALL ON THE SIDES OF THE CUP..I AM A 36 DD, NEVER HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BALI, ETC...I HAVE TRIED MANY OLGA BRAS ON AND HAVE ALSO TRIED ON A NEXT LARGER CUP SIZE, I HAVE TRIED GOING DOWN A BAND SIZE AND UP THE CUP SIZE, OR WHATEVER, STILL USELESS FOR ME ANYWAY..IT'S JUST NOT A GOOD BRAND FOR ME..I WAS TOLD BY 2 FITTERS, IF YOU ARE A 36 DD, YOU ARE A 36 DD, THAT IS THAT.  SOME BRANDS ARE JUST NOT RIGHT FOR YOU, SO DON'T TRY CHANGING THE SIZES...I AGREE......THANK YOU, GOOD LUCK", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15571989", "1": "0.277835", "2": "0.027220033", "3": "0.25071132", "4": "0.09785372", "5": "0.025573902", "6": "0.16508612"}}
