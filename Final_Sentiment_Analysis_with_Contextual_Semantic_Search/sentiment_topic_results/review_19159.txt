{"text": "This chain is beautiful and fit my pendant that I received for my anniversary but this chain grabs my hair. I can't feel any rough areas on it but it will grab and wind pieces of my hair around itself, maybe mine is defective? even though I don't see anything. I ended up using a different chain because I couldn't stand having my hair pulled all the time. My hair seems to wrap around near the clasp. This is OK for an occasional wear but I find it unacceptable for daily wear.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2575178", "1": "0.27732548", "2": "0.17265391", "4": "0.19945177", "6": "0.08704798"}}
