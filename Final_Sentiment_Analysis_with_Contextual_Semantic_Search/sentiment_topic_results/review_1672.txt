{"text": "These fit well I just had a baby 3 months ago and wanted some control when I go out and about. My waist is 33&#34; right now and the waist band is a little tight (almost causes a roll I do not have otherwise) but I suppose it helps keep them from rolling down. I am 5'1 143lbs for size comparison and the mediums where a good fit, they fit good around my legs and butt. I also bought the smalls and got them about to my thighs and took them back off, just to tight. I will use them later after I lose weight. I suppose I could have gotten the large but I don't think they would be as controlling. Colors look as pictured, they look nicer in person.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.45659378", "2": "0.15853909", "4": "0.14096764", "6": "0.23648211"}}
