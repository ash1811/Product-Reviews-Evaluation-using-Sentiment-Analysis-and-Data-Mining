{"text": "My Timex sport watch served me well for years but was not the most attractive timepiece by a long stretch.  At the end of a particularly thorough online search for the blandest, cheapest digital watch I could find, this one came in first place.  There isn't a whole lot to say about it and that is the point; it \"goes\" well with about any combination of clothing, and it has all of the stopwatch and timer functions one expects of a basic digital watch.  The resin band fits my spindly wrists adequately, and the backlight deserves particular praise, as it actually causes the numbers to turn a turquoise color, which is neat.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10852966", "1": "0.14003186", "2": "0.26201317", "3": "0.03175175", "4": "0.22731559", "5": "0.061331898", "6": "0.16902606"}}
