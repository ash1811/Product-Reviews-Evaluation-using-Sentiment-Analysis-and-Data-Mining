{"text": "I have purchased many Skechers in the past, but I must say this is the first pair I have been disappointed with.  They really hurt my feet. I am trying to break them in although I have never had to do this with Skechers before. I CANNOT wear them to work so I guess I will just wear them around the house. I suggest another kind of Skechers for people on their feet throughout the day. I do NOT like them!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06495914", "1": "0.11712258", "3": "0.49912006", "4": "0.13971137", "5": "0.05305685", "6": "0.12214463"}}
