{"text": "I'm really not a \"pink\" person, so I was a little worried about that, but the picture was so cute that I got them.  I'm a size 12 and the large fit me perfectly.  They are made of a very durable fabric and having all the pockets is great - especially for going on walks.  I wore these to work (on a casual Friday in the Legal department of a pharmaceuticals company) and I must have gotten a dozen or more compliments on them from both men and women.  My big joke was to say thank you, but they really shouldn't be able to see me.  ;)  A great buy for the price and made very well.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.4239536", "3": "0.22901455", "4": "0.08467528", "5": "0.11343132", "6": "0.14370152"}}
