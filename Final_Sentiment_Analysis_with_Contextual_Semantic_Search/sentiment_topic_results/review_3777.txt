{"text": "Relatively small person with &#34;narrowish&#34; head. These glasses fit perfectly. I order the Silver Frame/Crystal Gray variant and while they certainly aren't mirror lenses or anything, they do a nice job of concealing the eyes. The UV protection seems to work as expected. I can look at the sky without squinting with them. Overall satisfied as of now.NOTE: These glasses come with one arm locked in place, and requires a small screwdriver to loosen. Pulling will result in the arm breaking.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21629106", "1": "0.2802625", "2": "0.14847925", "4": "0.0873384", "5": "0.0894104", "6": "0.17528106"}}
