{"text": "I bought several bras recently to accommodate my growing body (I'm 5 months pregnant).  I'm usually a strict Victoria's Secret shopper but didn't want to spend a fortune for \"maternity\" periods.  This bra was a disappointment.  It's bigger than the Playtex bras I've bought in the same size.  It's MASSIVE so I have to be careful what I wear over it as you may see some of the massive panel/cup, and it's just plain uncomfortable.  The band at the bottom cuts into my skin and starts to fold over and bend.  Maybe I'm just too used to wearing underwire that I can't handle the method of \"support\" of non-underwire bras.  Either way, I wouldn't recommend this one.  Go with the Playtex Women's Side Smoothing Underwire Bra or the Playtex Women's 18 Hour Active Lifestyle...those are much more comfortable.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.119136676", "2": "0.17488015", "3": "0.2928783", "4": "0.14641865", "5": "0.17231114", "6": "0.09210104"}}
