{"text": "These sandals are comfortable when I'm just standing but I had a hard time adjusting to them when walking.  I recently spent six hours a day, three days in a row wearing them and did a lot of walking so I consider them broken in.  I find the bumps under the area between the toes and rest of the foot somewhat uncomfortable.  They push into my feet while walking.  I have a wide foot so the outer side of my feet go over the edge of the sandal.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0610255", "1": "0.3234508", "2": "0.067792445", "3": "0.072284415", "4": "0.12611759", "5": "0.18969658", "6": "0.15963271"}}
