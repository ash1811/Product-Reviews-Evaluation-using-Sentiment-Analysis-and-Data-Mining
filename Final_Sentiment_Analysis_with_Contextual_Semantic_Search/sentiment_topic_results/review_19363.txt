{"text": "I love the \"Garden Shoe\" that I purchased a couple of years ago but they needed replacing due to the fact that they stretched a bit and the footbed has some holes from wear. I purchased the \"clog\" in the same size but they clearly fit differently than the \"shoe.\" They are wider and longer. I would not get the clog again. I'm sorry that I didn't stick to what I know and like.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.37196115", "2": "0.15201698", "3": "0.11086313", "4": "0.09157911", "5": "0.19534884", "6": "0.074142925"}}
