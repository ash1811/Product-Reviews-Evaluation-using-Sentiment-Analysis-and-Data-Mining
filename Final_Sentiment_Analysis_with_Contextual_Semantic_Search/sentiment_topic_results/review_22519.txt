{"text": "I bought a pair of Jessica Simpson leve ballet flats a couple of years ago on a whim. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised, those were the most comfortable flats, I ever wore. So when I finally broke those, I decided to try another pair of these. Though, these look the same and fit well, they are a little uncomfortable across the instep. I find that I am needing to break these in and I did not have to do that with the last pair. I will keep it up, they do seem to be getting better.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.098925345", "1": "0.36644936", "2": "0.102539055", "3": "0.118715316", "4": "0.15405351", "6": "0.15613288"}}
