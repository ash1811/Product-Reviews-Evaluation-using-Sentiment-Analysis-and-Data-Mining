{"text": "Theses slippers are warm and comfy. Surprisingly, it took a while to break into them. At first they felt a bit awkward. The base is a bit narrow, which caused my feet to roll. I was tempted to send them back, but after a while I stopped noticing the rolling. Now they feel a big fluffy wool sock, which is great.My only qualm is the sizing. I where a size 11 but I found the 10.5M - 11.5M to be very big. My feet have about an inch and half to spare. It's not a big deal though. It's not like I go for long walks in them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15939654", "1": "0.17243887", "2": "0.08171948", "3": "0.31993735", "4": "0.1315035", "5": "0.09261866", "6": "0.042385623"}}
