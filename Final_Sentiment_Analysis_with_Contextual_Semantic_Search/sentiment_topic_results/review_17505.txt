{"text": "My husband has had a similar Casio with the rubberized band for years but the band kept getting caught on things so he asked for a bracelet style.  This watch serves its purpose beautifully. He uses the stopwatch feature all of the time.  The bracelet band is very easy to adjust and he loves that the date and day of the week and date are so prominently displayed.  If you're looking for a digital watch that is comfortable and durable, look no further.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.0551132", "1": "0.2482705", "2": "0.20671661", "3": "0.083102755", "4": "0.28439122", "6": "0.11891414"}}
