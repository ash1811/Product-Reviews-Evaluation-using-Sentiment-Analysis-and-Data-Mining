{"text": "I was quite pleased with these shorts: they are a good length, fit comfortably (I wear 32in waist, and medium is right), and are a decent weight.  They are made in a jersey weave like tshirts, but are slightly heavier, and are soft enough but not super soft.  (Note: the waistband is covered, so there's no prickly elastic band on the skin.)I wear them for casual wear in hot weather, and find them really good for that purpose; I also have no trouble sleeping in them.  I don't know how they'd handle more active use.  If I had to guess, I'd say probably ok for running or light hiking, but nothing rougher.I think the price is within reason; other cotton shorts I've found are about the same.  It will depend on how well they last, but I can't comment on that yet.Why 4 stars rather than 5?  I think that the fabric should have been slightly heavier, and could have been slightly softer, to deliver the perfect cotton shorts.  (I've had some in the past, but they are hard to find.)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08824014", "1": "0.2767678", "3": "0.17251605", "4": "0.1780676", "5": "0.21439", "6": "0.067907155"}}
