{"text": "Excellent, high quality tights made of durable material that doesn't easily snag or rip as you pull them on and off.Truly reversible! Mine are a beautiful chocolate brown on one side and black on the other. It really is like getting two quality pairs for the price of one.If you're looking for comfort, buy them in a size larger.  That's what I did and they pull up really easy and don't bind too much yet they never get saggy around the knees or anything like I've had happen with cheaper tights.I wish I would have bought these tights sooner.  Until now, I'd never bought a pair of SPANX b/c I didn't care about support or smoothing out rolls, I just wanted a comfortable pair of tights.  These give me support, smooth things out AND are insanely comfortable.
