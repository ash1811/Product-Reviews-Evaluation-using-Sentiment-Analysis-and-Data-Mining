{"text": "I'm glad that other reviewers had prepared me for these and given suggestions on how to use them.  I had the same experience that they had---very hard to get the shoe in, and had to secure the tops to my pants to keep them up.  I placed my shoe in first from the top and set it in place.  When I put them on, I slid my legs down into the boot tops and shoes all at once.  As far as securing the tops, I used large safety pins, two on each boot top, under the cuff.  Held them like a charm, and didn't hurt the boot tops or my pants.  They really did look good, and really made my costume (along with the parrot I had affixed to my shoulder with magnets).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04304079", "1": "0.21347015", "2": "0.12740323", "3": "0.33343503", "4": "0.1455695", "5": "0.11106035", "6": "0.026020976"}}
