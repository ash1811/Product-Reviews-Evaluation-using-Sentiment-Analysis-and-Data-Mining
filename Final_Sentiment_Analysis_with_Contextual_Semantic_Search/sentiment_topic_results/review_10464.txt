{"text": "I got 2 of these in the chestnut and espresso colors and they're gorgeous. I'm a true size 8 w/ narrow feet and every ugg that I have (including sandals) I always get my regular 8 and they always fit and the same applied to these. They were snug at first but not to the point of discomfort. When I got them I wore each of them for an hour or two in the house (bought them to wear outdoors) and then I sprayed them w/ the ugg stain repellent/waterproof spray and let them dry. The spray erased the snugness after drying for the recommended 24 hours.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.30246764", "1": "0.21216737", "2": "0.08037472", "3": "0.09331744", "4": "0.16774376", "6": "0.14127134"}}
