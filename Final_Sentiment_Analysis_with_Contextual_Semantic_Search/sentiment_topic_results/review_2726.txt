{"text": "Gave this watch to my husband as a gift and he loves it. Very lightweight and comfortable. He's a watch guy and chooses this one over the other watches he has. The big problem is that about three months after he got the watch, the face cracked. He still wears it because he likes it so much and I think he would want it again, even knowing it would break (he likes it that much). It's a pretty cheap watch, so it's not the end of the world to replace. However, this cracked face is really annoying.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.108775854", "1": "0.23202306", "2": "0.41326576", "3": "0.09663255", "4": "0.14355849"}}
