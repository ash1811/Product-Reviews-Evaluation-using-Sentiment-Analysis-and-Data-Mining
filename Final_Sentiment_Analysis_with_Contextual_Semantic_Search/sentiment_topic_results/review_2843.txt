{"text": "My order for size 8.5W had to be returned for a size 8W. For me, Keds and Skechers, runs large and I have to size down.The shoes are fairly comfortable, but without socks, there is inside stitching from the shoe laces, that rubs on top of my right foot...in the area above the base of the big toe. This improves with a light pair of socks.The shoe is attractive, but lacking in arch support.Overall it's a good looking, neutral shoe for running around town in the Spring Summer and Fall, but not for lengthy walks.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15695712", "1": "0.26522666", "2": "0.103327304", "3": "0.25789872", "5": "0.12639278", "6": "0.08743175"}}
