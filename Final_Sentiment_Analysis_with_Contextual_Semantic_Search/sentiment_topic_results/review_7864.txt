{"text": "Van's was my first job when I was in high school, and slip on skate shoes were pretty much what I wore every day. These fit pretty much true to size, so if you wear a 9, get a 9. These shoes are SKATE shoes, so they are designed for &#34;feel&#34; of what's happening under your feet....important for a skater. If you are planning to walk long distances in these shoes, like ten miles, you might want to consider something else because these shoes don't have lots of cushioning, as they are designed. I don't get people who buy skate shoes then complain about this. Duh. These shoes look great with shorts or jeans, and since I'm too old to ride a skateboard anymore, I bought them primarily to make plane travel easier. No more messing with laces at the security checkpoint, I just slip these off walk through security and slip them back on.
