{"text": "I have about 6 Invicta watches. They are all excellent quality but, in general, they are huge. I am a big, tall woman, so most womens watches are too small for me, but the mens are too large. This watch has the excellent quality I am use to but the size is perfect, the face about the size of a quarter. I love the strap. It is very comfortable and sometimes I don't even realize I'm wearing it. Nothing but praise from me. Also, where most Invictas have the large, bulky, uncomfortable dial that hurts the wrist, this one has a normal dial.Update: I have had this watch for over a year now and it is still my favorite watch. Even after all this time I have absolutely nothing negative to say about it.
