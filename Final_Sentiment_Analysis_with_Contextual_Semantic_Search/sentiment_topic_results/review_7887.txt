{"text": "This is a pretty good product overall. Unfortunately I have to wear this pretty much every day of the week to cover up tattoos while I'm at work. The only reason it didn't get five stars is because it stains really easily. After the first week of wearing it at work it had deodorant/sweat stains in the armpit region. But it fits great, its pretty durable, and it's a much better alternative than having to wear long sleeve shirts made out of cotton to cover up tattoos. I would absolutely buy another one if I needed to.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14595966", "1": "0.4103546", "2": "0.13978653", "3": "0.089673124", "4": "0.04696165", "5": "0.060435005", "6": "0.10682941"}}
