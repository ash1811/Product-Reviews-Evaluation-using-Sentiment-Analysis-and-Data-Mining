{"text": "The great thing about these boots is that they're very soft, and with the natural crepe soles, they feel like covered flip flops. They're also easy to put on, and take off, with only 2 eyelets. The only bad thing about them is the price, which is too expensive and why I only buy them at deep discounts. Oh, and that hipsters now approve of them, which means they're popular, again, and that I may have to quit wearing them until that fad passes.I agree with all the reviewers who say that you should size down one-half size, but I find that all Clarks shoes run a half size too big, so I don't find it unusual.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.028004574", "1": "0.29751047", "2": "0.068487935", "3": "0.15498944", "4": "0.13590388", "5": "0.19858833", "6": "0.116515405"}}
