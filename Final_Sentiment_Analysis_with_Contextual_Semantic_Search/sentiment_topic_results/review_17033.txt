{"text": "WAY too small and just not quite wide enough.  The last pair of Newport sandals I tried on in an 8 fit really nicely.  I have wider feet and a lower arch so I can't always find shoes that fit well.  These, however, were lacking a little in width and my toes hit the end.  Disappointing as otherwise they would have fit nicely. Returned them and was about to order an 8.5 because I think those would have fit perfectly but the prices have become way more expensive for every pair of Newports I look at.  Oh well, guess I will save my money this way!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.071280934", "1": "0.49375755", "2": "0.18366814", "3": "0.09027764", "4": "0.15623024"}}
