{"text": "This is without question the best pair of underwear I've ever worn. I will tell you why, and how I know, but there may be some uncomfortable details about how it feels to wear it (what some might consider TMI). So you are warned.First of all, the underwear is incredibly soft. The modal fabric (apparently it's called &#34;modal;&#34; I didn't know there was such a thing) feels like a nice sunglass or glasses cloth. Light, smooth, soft.Second, the elasticity makes the underwear conform gently to the buttocks and package. No sense of restriction, no borderline wedgie, and no tightness or difficulty adjusting.Third, the fabric never stretches over time. I wore my first pair for a day and a half, including overnight (gross, I know, but it's worth testing these things), and it remained soft, supportive, and in the right place the whole time. Even the heat and sweat of my work environment (a foundry) could not get these things to sag.Fourth, the fabric is quick drying and breathable. When you're hot and sweaty, there is the slightest sensation of clinging, but not anything like the oppressive stickiness of cotton. And you know how cotton briefs remain wet, heavy, and uncomfortable after you soak them? These things dried in less than 10 minutes.Fifth, these keep one's package nicely separate from one's legs. Let me explain. I was a boxer guy for a long time. Then styles changed (pants became less baggy) and I &#34;filled in,&#34; and between the tighter pants and my thicker legs there was less room for excess fabric in my groin area. So I switched to boxer briefs. Much more comfortable, but after a few hours of wear the fabric stretched, leaving a pocket between my legs in which elements of my anatomy would stick together most uncomfortably. So I would hike the waist of the underwear and roll it down (so it didn't hover around my bellybutton. It was irritating. None of that with these.Finally, these are ATTRACTIVE. Fashionably low waist sits comfortably above hips. Short legs give one the comfort of briefs with the looks of a boxer brief and the synthetic fabric should hold it's color. I will never go back to another brief unless Calvin Klein stops making these.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.28763655", "1": "0.07862575", "2": "0.09222048", "3": "0.2678613", "4": "0.07639677", "5": "0.11574057", "6": "0.081518546"}}
