{"text": "Having bought these for work, I was initially very pleased with the look and comfort.  Then, after about 2 months, the gel in the heel started leaking and the sole started peeling off from the shoe.  It was out of amazons return policy window, so I just threw them in the trash.  I would not buy these again and have switched to Ecco shoes.  Although more than double the price, they are worth it and will probably last twice as long compared to the Dockers.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12243942", "1": "0.19899014", "2": "0.19256812", "4": "0.039971806", "5": "0.19298685", "6": "0.24936536"}}
