{"text": "Got these pants for work originally in a size 13, but they were way too large.  I am 5'7 and about 140-145lbs. I ended up trying a size 9 which fits very well.  I really like these pants, especially because they are 4% spandex so they keep their shape and the price is just right.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19775306", "1": "0.36482695", "3": "0.20133738", "6": "0.2201822"}}
