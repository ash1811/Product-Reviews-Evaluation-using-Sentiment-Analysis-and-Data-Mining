{"text": "Good news guys & gals, if you are plus size, or big & tall, and lamenting that you can't wear these panties, they will fit you! I have a 48\" waist and I normally wear a size 9/XL panty, but I wear these in size 7 and they fit quite comfortably and still have some give to them! They don't pinch, bind or ride up. There is plenty of room up front for the male anatomy. I recommend that you hand wash and hang-dry these, they will last longer. If Jockey made these for men, then us men wouldn't have to wear panties!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10974414", "1": "0.22313786", "2": "0.14253609", "3": "0.18334687", "4": "0.046200965", "5": "0.22010559", "6": "0.07492849"}}
