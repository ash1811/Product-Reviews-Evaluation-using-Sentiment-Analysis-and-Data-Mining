{"text": "Let me preface this by saying that I've had my pair of these Keens for ten years. Ten. I bought them in the Navy in 2004 and I've been everywhere with them. Islands in Italy. Germany. Boating. Hiking. Biking. Painting. Kicking. You get the drift.They are still in my closet ready for another summer of abuse. I absolutely LOVE them. If you buy any pair of sandals, you're wasting your money. These are the real deal. I wish I could show you them, but they're shy. :-)Still comfortable. Still durable. Still awesome. Buy and you'll rack up the experiences.Peace and good journeys.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06989348", "1": "0.37768948", "2": "0.09988262", "3": "0.22693464", "4": "0.13636266", "6": "0.086810336"}}
