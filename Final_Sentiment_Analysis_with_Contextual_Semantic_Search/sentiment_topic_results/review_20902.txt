{"text": "Normally I wear a size 8 but I decided to buy these in an 8.5 because the toe box looks short and it is short. I have long toes and they were pressed up against that toe bumper so these sandals would not work for me and I sent them back. To order up to a 9 would probably just make the whole sandal too roomy. This is too bad because the foot bed was very comfortable. If you have short toes this could be a great choice for you.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1722558", "1": "0.68753755", "4": "0.073233806", "6": "0.056479186"}}
