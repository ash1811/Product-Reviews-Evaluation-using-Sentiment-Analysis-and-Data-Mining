{"text": "I bought this slipper on a website 2 years ago when I was looking for a replacement to another mail order company's slippers that fell apart on me.  These have held up well for 2 years and just started to tear around the toes and sole.  Amazon was easy to order from and the slippers are exactly what I wanted (matched old slippers).  They are a bit snug when you first put them on, but that leaves room for a break in, then they are warm and comfortable.  Also, the soles on my original pair have stayed intact - on cheaper slippers they usually wear through in weak spots.  My feet are hard on shoes and these slippers held up well - just tighten the leather straps as they stretch out over the years.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15691851", "1": "0.19533165", "2": "0.12066657", "3": "0.09998735", "4": "0.09130498", "5": "0.14355746", "6": "0.19223347"}}
