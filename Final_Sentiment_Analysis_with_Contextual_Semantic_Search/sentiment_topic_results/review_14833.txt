{"text": "This robe is exactly as it looks in the picture.  Nice and light weight, yet good quality SOFT jersey like material.  I actually love the robe, it is what I was looking for to a &#34;T&#34; so I am thrilled to have found this.  It washes beautifully too!  The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is specifically because of the price.  Way too much money for this robe (I paid $98).  It is a catch 22 because I love it, but the price just seems a bit unreasonable.  I am still glad I bought it, though hard to choke on paying that kind of money.  If you can afford it, it is a worth while purchase.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.28231138", "1": "0.28392667", "2": "0.06860346", "3": "0.14671804", "5": "0.21388909"}}
