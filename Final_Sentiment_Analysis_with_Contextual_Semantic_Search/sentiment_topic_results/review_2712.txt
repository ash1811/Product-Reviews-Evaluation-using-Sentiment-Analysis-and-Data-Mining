{"text": "This is a fairly nice watch. Beautiful blue color, second hand, and has the day of the week on the clock face. Very minimal too, as I was trying to find a nice looking watch that wasn't cluttered around with extra dials or knobs.I have had it for about a month now and it only has one blemish on the watch face (which was my own fault).Although the band has gotten a little warped and on months that do not have a 31st day I need to manually switch the day ahead on the watch.Oh and adjusting the band... oh lord was that unpleasant. Just about impossible to open and adjust, I actually had to go get a metal prong to open it so I could adjust it.If you have a thicker arm like me it probably won't look as nice given its minimal and sleek design, but I do like this watch, it was affordable and I can wear it for casual or formal occasions.Edit: The mesh is starting to unravel at about 5 or so months in tearing at my coat and clothes. This is after wearing it everyday and everywhere, including some physical activity here and there.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05456927", "1": "0.096795306", "2": "0.16260736", "3": "0.29382393", "4": "0.10078946", "5": "0.17503308", "6": "0.11638158"}}
