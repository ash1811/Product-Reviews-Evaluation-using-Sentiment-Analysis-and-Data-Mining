{"text": "The fit is pretty good, maybe a little bit smaller in the waist than expected but still fits pretty well.  Hopefully they don't shrink too much in the wash otherwise it will become too tight.  I ordered the VIP color which looks a lot lighter in the picture than it is received.  This will probably be solved as I wash it but I don't usually buy clothing with the expectation it will change on me over time and washing, as I believe most people do.  All in all I am satisfied and I may order more 514s in the future as long as the size holds up in future washings.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04745665", "1": "0.55884105", "2": "0.09597162", "3": "0.14820385", "4": "0.060259428", "6": "0.086511664"}}
