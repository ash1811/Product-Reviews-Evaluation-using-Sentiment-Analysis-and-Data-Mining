{"text": "I wanted a good calf high pair of sock liners that could be worn under thick wool socks, or primarily (daily) by themselves with dress shoes. Much warmer then any dress socks I have (even the calf high pairs). Terramar is my favorite thermal brand, and I'm never disappointed with their products. They have two lengths, one that goes right under your calf muscle and one that goes about half way up (what these were). I'd definitely recommend them, especially if you can find them on sale somewhere.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.035619076", "2": "0.16352803", "3": "0.33137873", "4": "0.23093079", "5": "0.15779066", "6": "0.07809035"}}
