{"text": "I have a pair of Adidas sweats from 20 years ago.  These are basically the original \"b-boy\" tracksuit sweats.  The fabric is thick and they are so comfortable to wear.  One reason I like them is that the pockets are made of \"thick\" fabric.  What I mean by that is that a lot of Adidas' newer sweats are made of such thin fabric that when you carry stuff in the pockets like keys and wallet, they flop all over the place.When I saw these, I was skeptical of buying them, because I've been looking for a replacement pair for years.  I ordered them on a whim, and when they arrived, I was excited to see they were basically the exact same ones as my old pair.  Even the \"model\" number on the tag was the same.The only difference is that my original pair has zip up pockets.  These do not.  However, these are constructed the same as the original, they are thick and fit the same.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.042013858", "1": "0.19040285", "2": "0.14897212", "3": "0.10509625", "4": "0.18796304", "5": "0.22678941", "6": "0.09876246"}}
