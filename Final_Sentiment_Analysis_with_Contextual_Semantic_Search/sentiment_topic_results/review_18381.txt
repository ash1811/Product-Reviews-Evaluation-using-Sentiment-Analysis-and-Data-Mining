{"text": "Received my Eco-Drive watch today. Shipping took 3 business days from the time the order was placed. Watch appears to be well constructed and no issues were apparent upon arrival. The luminescence is outstanding, very bright. The titanium makes the watch very light for its size.I did my research beforehand and the majority of reviews were positive. Citizen advertises that the watch has no battery, but research and included information indicates that there is a solar reserve battery. Watch does come with a limited 5 year warranty. Would recommend to others who are searching for a dependable watch.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15448497", "1": "0.09975403", "2": "0.1689398", "3": "0.13767722", "4": "0.19453718", "5": "0.17837249", "6": "0.06623431"}}
