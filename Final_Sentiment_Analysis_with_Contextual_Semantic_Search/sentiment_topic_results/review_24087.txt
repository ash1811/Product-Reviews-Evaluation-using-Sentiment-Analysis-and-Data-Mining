{"text": "Good price and looks nice with smooth cups.  I agree with other reviewers that, for a sports bra, one band size larger is necessary.  Using that information when I ordered, I found the bra to fit well and look nice and smooth under workout clothing.  It also did not give the 'uniboob' look like most sports bras do.  The back was nice with stretchable material and felt good against my skin.  However, I found the band at the top and bottom in the front had no stretch or 'give' whatsoever, which made it very uncomfortable to wear as I moved during a workout.  Ultimately, I returned it and exchanged it for a second Glamorise sports bra I'd ordered along with this one.I will review the other one on its own, but I found the Glamorise sports bra with the front/adjustable panel much better to work out in than this one.  I'd ordered the first one in grey/white.  I exchanged this uncomfortable full figure one for another front/adjustable one in white.  Since these bras can also be worn under regular clothing, I think I'll get more use out of them and be more comfortable in one that has stretch and 'give' in the front AND back.Making the exchange was easy, stress-free, and they credited me the shipping charges for the return.  They even shipped my new bra before receiving the returned one back at their warehouse!  Now that's customer service!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.113085605", "1": "0.42083007", "2": "0.08260077", "3": "0.1963", "4": "0.08483242", "5": "0.10024676"}}
