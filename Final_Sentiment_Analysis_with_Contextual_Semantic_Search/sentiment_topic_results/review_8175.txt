{"text": "I've had mine for over a month and have been using it as a yoga bag and a travel bag. This is why I love it:Pockets - lots of these, so much so that sometimes I have nothing left to put in the main compartment. They make me feel organized and also help distribute the weight for better carrying.Shape - unlike a backpack, the bulk of the weight is carried low even when the bag is full. I feel that the most back-friendly way of carrying it is crossbody with the bag on the lower back. However, being female gets in the way, if you know what I mean about crossbody straps and where they go on the chest. So I compromise by wearing the bag crossbody with the bag in front, lying on one hip. This causes less squishing and has the added advantage of keeping your possessions within your sight in crowds.Size - the Small is perfect for when I have yoga classes (a change of clothes, spectacle case and odds-and-ends pouch) and as a carry-on/daily travel bag (passports and documents, wallet, card pouch, keys, point-and-shoot camera, mobile, pens, cosmetics, medication, tissues, mints and water bottle).Material - the microfiber is lustrous, lightweight, sturdy and easy to keep clean, despite the amount of time it has spent on floors.Appearance - it's no Louis Vuitton but it's neater and classier-looking than a normal backpack. I got mine in Eggplant and it looks pretty without screaming \"flashy tourist - easy target\".I look forward to enjoying my bag for years and may get a larger one to travel further with.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08777859", "1": "0.14744522", "2": "0.19008091", "3": "0.078921005", "4": "0.15296821", "5": "0.052605044", "6": "0.29020098"}}
