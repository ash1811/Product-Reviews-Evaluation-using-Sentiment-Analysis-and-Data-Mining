{"text": "I coach my son's little league team and decided to get my own equipment and bag. I bought this hoping it would have room for 5 batting helmets, catchers gear, balls and bats but for the price I wasn't expecting it to last more than the season.What I received is a monster of a bag. The quality is quite good and I see this bag lasting a very long time. It's actually far bigger than I need it to be. I would estimate that it holds around 8 to 10 loads of laundry. It's just enormous.I would definitely recommend it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.25622517", "2": "0.075780265", "3": "0.20399506", "4": "0.104082696", "5": "0.32117045", "6": "0.03609262"}}
