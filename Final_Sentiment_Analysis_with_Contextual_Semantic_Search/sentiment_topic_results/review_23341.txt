{"text": "Fiance got this to go under his tux for our wedding in an attempt not to be nickled and dimed to death any further. Alas, we had to still buy another vest that fit him better throughout his triangular torso and have the seamstress take the buttons from this one and put it on another vest entirely because altering this one would have cost too much or more than the new one which was $60. Tacky metalic belt hinge on the back, not pictured, when pulled (but unable to secure) pleats up the back and wrinkles the look. You want a clean backed vestment, than this is not the vest for you. And the sizes run pretty large. Not as form fitting as it might seem in the picture.Otherwise, the tie is fine (so I have an overpriced tie instead), and it arrived quickly.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.23200233", "1": "0.31777573", "3": "0.14037529", "4": "0.10924298", "5": "0.1054505", "6": "0.09279741"}}
