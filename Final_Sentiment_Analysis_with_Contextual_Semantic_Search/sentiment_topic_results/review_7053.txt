{"text": "update 7/31/13 - it's been a few months and the bag is generally going great!  even got a compliment from a Tumi user.  haha...I didn't dare say how little this one costs!The 'pot metal' snaphook broke after I really started using it heavily on a constant basis.  It's really no big deal.  For the day I used a spare keyring to hold it together...and later went to Lowe's and got a steel snap hook that looks great and costs maybe $4 for the both of them.  (I replaced the other cheap snap hook at same time)Still treat it without care -load it up - swing it over my shoulder - drop it without care on the floors.  All in all a great value for basically no money.  I am still very glad I gave this cheapie version a try.  I can't see it's showing any wear at all.  I am careful with the zippers...but not that much.If it lasts a year...it's gonna be fantastic (but I can't see why it wouldn't last for many years)I am careful with the zippers, and I applied some wax to them when I first got the bag...it's been fine ever since.Needed a new additional bag for work that would work in a dress, corporate enviroment - and this works great.Don't have to be careful with it, nice layout for my stuff, and it looks like every other briefcase when I carry it into a boardroom.I'd buy another immediately if this one was lost or something.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.43677247", "1": "0.037437454", "3": "0.09178506", "4": "0.071354546", "5": "0.27546215", "6": "0.08504656"}}
