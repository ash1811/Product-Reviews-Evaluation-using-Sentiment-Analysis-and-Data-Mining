{"text": "Keeping with the Carhartt name these Bib Overalls are well constructed and worth every penny paid. I bought a size larger then normal and they fit perfectly with or without a pair of jeans beneath them. I also like the moss color so much better then the normal brown. You might spend a little more for these but as I said they are worth every penny and the material is so much better then anything cheaper.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20936972", "1": "0.3349164", "2": "0.18655245", "3": "0.11347786", "4": "0.052589145", "6": "0.099753104"}}
