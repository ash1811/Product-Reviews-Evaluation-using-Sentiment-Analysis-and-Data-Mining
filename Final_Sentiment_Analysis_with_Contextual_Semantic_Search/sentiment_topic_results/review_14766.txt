{"text": "I have no complains about this umbie. It has carried me through Bostonian sleet-storms and Miami downpours. It is small, but remember this is a travel umbie, not a full-sized one. I generally wear a raincoat when it's raining/snowing hard, and use this to provide a little extra protection including my purse. It fits easily into my bag (I don't use a large bag that contains everything I own...) and works wonderfully.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.30611572", "1": "0.16291565", "2": "0.11329062", "4": "0.11242786", "5": "0.17825012", "6": "0.12322122"}}
