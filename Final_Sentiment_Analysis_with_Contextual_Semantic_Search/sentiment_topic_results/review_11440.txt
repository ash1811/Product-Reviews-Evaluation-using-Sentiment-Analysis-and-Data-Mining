{"text": "I bought this for my husband to carry his stuff to work.  It is a good size to hold his lunch, Ipad and newspaper/magazines.  I like that it is not real tall so you don't have to dig down to try to find what you want. If you like a real tall/deep bag this is not for you.  Seems pretty sturdy and was a reasonable price.  He likes it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.23807815", "1": "0.073277", "2": "0.19644967", "3": "0.28237048", "4": "0.1150304", "5": "0.09017085"}}
