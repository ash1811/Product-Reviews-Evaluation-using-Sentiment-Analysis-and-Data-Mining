{"text": "I love love love love these.  I have two pairs and they're almost all I wear all summer.  They do run large.  I'm usually about a 7.5, and I bought a 6.5 (slightly tight) and a 7 (slightly loose).  They are so, so wonderful for casual hikes/walks, especially if there's water involved.  They don't work for me for all day, though, I get horrible foot cramps if I walk in them for over 2hrs straight.  So I always bring an extra pair of shoes to trade out if needed.  The other thing is, if you wear them all day, they start to stink.  Like super-strong, super-nasty foot-sweat disgusting stink.  And heck, keen might have fixed this in the couple models since mine.  So, I don't wear them all day, or make sure that if I do it's for some outdoor and watery activity.  I love how these wash in the washing machine.  And they're almost in the condition I bought them in, so well have they held up.  My husband also got a pair (the men's) and one of the straps is starting to pull up from the leather, but he's really hard on things with his man-ness.  He does absolutely love his, too, though.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08110831", "1": "0.27655005", "2": "0.095916025", "3": "0.07587798", "4": "0.1114948", "5": "0.17004941", "6": "0.1890034"}}
