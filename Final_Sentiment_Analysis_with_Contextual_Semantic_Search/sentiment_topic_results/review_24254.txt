{"text": "I ordered XL because I didnt want the shirt fitting skin tight even though a tight fix maximizes wicking. I prefer a looser fit. the body of the shirt fits fine, 5 stars. but the sleeves are short. not like a short sleeve shirt but when I hold my arms straight out in front of me me ends of the sleeves are up more than half way up my fore arm. if I had ordered L I wonder if the sleeves would be up past my elbows. the fabric feels nice and is warm. a 5 star product with a star taken away for each sleeve that is too short. perhaps they are supposed to be short, but I cant imagine why.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19537537", "1": "0.43005383", "2": "0.12235879", "3": "0.056550767", "4": "0.032501813", "5": "0.040411364", "6": "0.12274804"}}
