{"text": "I have been looking for a wallet with this type of change purse for a long time. My grandmother had one when I was a little girl. This wallet holds all my credit/debit/membership cards and still closes fine with the checkbook out of it. Since I rarely write a check these days, that isn't a problem at all. I love that it has no zippers as the last few wallets that I have replaced only needed to be replaced because of a bad zipper. It seems to be well constructed and is real leather so it should last a long time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06653275", "1": "0.16244401", "2": "0.24535298", "3": "0.18325463", "5": "0.16557966", "6": "0.1736483"}}
