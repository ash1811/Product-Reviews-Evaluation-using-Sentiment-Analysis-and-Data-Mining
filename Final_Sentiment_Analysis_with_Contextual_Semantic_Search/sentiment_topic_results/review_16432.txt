{"text": "I have been ordering these hats for a few 3 years. In the past I have been happy, but this time the product was made super cheap. Not that they were of the highest quality, but I got what I expected before, now it seems like they skimped on fabric. I can see the brim through the fabric on the bill, and the stitches are not even. If all that was not enough, the hat has a permenent crease where it was folded, and is generally flimsy. What a peace of junk, especially since the price has gone up!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09788244", "1": "0.23748302", "3": "0.1089942", "4": "0.17449576", "5": "0.27531457", "6": "0.102326564"}}
