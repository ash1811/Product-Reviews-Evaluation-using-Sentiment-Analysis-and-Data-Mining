{"text": "Its a good value for the tool you get. The handle contains 3 holes in which you put the selected inserts. If your watch ha definitive holes, ridges, notches this tool will work for you. If they are smooth ridges on your watch you will get scratches. The tool is hard to adjust on the back of the watch when it has a closed designed metal bracelet.  Personally I ended up with the watch friction ball to open my first case since it did not have refined ridges to engage the tools edges with. Good luck.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2226843", "1": "0.06880884", "2": "0.30364227", "3": "0.08201346", "4": "0.19638115", "5": "0.06053539", "6": "0.06593463"}}
