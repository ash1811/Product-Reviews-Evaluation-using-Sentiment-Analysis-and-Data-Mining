{"text": "I've been wearing Birkenstock shoes since High School. 20+ years. They are sooo comfortable. I wear them almost every day. They conform to your foot. The padded footbed is really nice. I've worn both the 2 strap and the 3 strap. The 3 strap cracked near the cork after 10+ years, the 2 strap never did. You do not want to get these wet! My sister wore these to the pool, got them wet, and they curled up, the leather got stiff and they smelled bad. They will last a very long time if you take proper care of them, even if you wear them a lot.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.065562546", "1": "0.22823143", "2": "0.2319296", "3": "0.12418871", "4": "0.07488997", "5": "0.17499217", "6": "0.10020559"}}
