{"text": "I must say that I fully agree with the other reviewers relative to the quality, design, styling, and look of this boot. It is a great casual boot that is quite versatile. I was able to break it in quickly and am satisfied with the fitting. I have owned Clarks shoes before and normally go down 1/2 size to get the correct fit. I was able to do the same with this product. Now, the one negative on the boot. There are work days when I spend most of the day on my feet. To be honest, this boot is not that easy on your feet. I wish there was more cushioning in the sole or even inner sole as it is quite hard and almost like standing on a brick. I am going to see if I can fit a thin inner sole in to cushion it. That is the only reason I knocked off one star because everything else about it is great. Wow, if they could introduce some Air Technology into this boot they would not be able to keep it in stock. I will add that I have dealt with Clarks Customer Service before. They are \"top rate\" should you have an issue. I plan on keeping the boot and will adjust but wish it had more cushion in the design.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03990786", "1": "0.113696374", "2": "0.17802179", "3": "0.27491426", "4": "0.1432324", "5": "0.1507281", "6": "0.099499226"}}
