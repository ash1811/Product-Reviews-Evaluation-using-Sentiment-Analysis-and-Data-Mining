{"text": "Bracelet is exactly as pictured, however, the clasp does appear larger than necessary in person.  The clasp is difficult to open and latch.  Also, the bracelet's light weight makes it feel inexpensive and definitely not worth $50.  The finish was more muted than I was hoping.  It wasn't shiny, nor was it brushed.  It looked dull.It is lovely chain pattern, and it arrived in a nice blue suede drawstring bag with the bracelet \"hugging\" a matching blue suede pillow inside the bag.  It would have made a nice gift if the bracelet hadn't felt cheap.  I ended up returning it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.23581335", "2": "0.18423073", "3": "0.21383703", "4": "0.25830692", "6": "0.102855"}}
