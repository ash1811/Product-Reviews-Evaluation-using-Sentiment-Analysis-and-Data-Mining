{"text": "This is a nice shirt and after two weeks I still like it.  I have only washed it a couple times but no sign of loose threads or anything.  I normally wear a XL but read these are running small.  I'm really glad I got the 3XL as it is just large enough.  If I wore thick long underwear under this, it would not be big enough.  I wore a thin tee shirt and it was nice.  Good fit and looks nice.  Buy two sizes too big when ordering", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.037583604", "1": "0.4964409", "2": "0.08742629", "3": "0.16423395", "5": "0.16407764", "6": "0.047371607"}}
