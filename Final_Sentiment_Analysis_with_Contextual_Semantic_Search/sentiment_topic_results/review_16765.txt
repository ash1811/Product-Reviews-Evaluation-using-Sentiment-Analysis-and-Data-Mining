{"text": "This is a favorite timepiece.  The classic roman numbers on the clean white dial and contrasting black hands make this an all the time watch.  I have a Breitling navitimer and a Vacheron, but the Bulova goes everywhere.  The calendar is handy on the job.  The quartz movement is right on the mark when checked with WWV or the internet site. The leather strap is the right choice for the watch and it completes the classic look and style.I would buy it again and the price is a value.  I like the quartz movt. as it is accurate and does not stop during a long rest. The watchcase is nicely styled with the lugs helping the classic look.  The crown is small and causes no skin irratation, the calander is quick set and the gold second hand does not get confused with the minute hand.It is winner!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.047682345", "1": "0.24726672", "2": "0.24833481", "3": "0.12343637", "5": "0.22380991", "6": "0.107075214"}}
