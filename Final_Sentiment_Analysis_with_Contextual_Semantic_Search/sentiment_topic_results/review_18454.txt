{"text": "Needed a pair of super comfy, supportive flip flops for a trip to Arizona and Hawaii.  Never been able to wear flip flops all day due to the discomfort...well no more! These are fantastic. Very supportive arch, pillowy/cloud footbed.  You heat them up in oven for a few mins prior to first wear and then stand in them to mold them to your own foot.  Just wore them for our week long trip to Arizona resort /spa and had comfy feet all week!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03551469", "1": "0.111303456", "2": "0.07689765", "3": "0.22390404", "4": "0.15989989", "5": "0.24324463", "6": "0.14923565"}}
