{"text": "I've been wearing these ridiculous Victoria's Secret bras that were WAY too padded (all their bras are) and am so happy to have found this one.  It's comfy, cheap, looks smooth, and has a thin lining that smooths out the form and hides nipples without looking bulky or magnifying the breasts - which don't need it.  All hail this bra :)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.28700244", "2": "0.1479214", "3": "0.29006183", "4": "0.22431427", "6": "0.042248905"}}
