{"text": "I was a little hesitant to order this after reading some of the reviews, but I figured it was worth a shot for $3.25 instead of paying $40 to have 7 links removed from a $30 Timex watch.The tool is small and cheaply made, but nothing broke while I was using it.  I did have to put a piece of paper under the watch because it was a small women's watch and too short for the tool, but once I did that, everything lined up perfectly and I was able to remove the seven links and put the watch back together quickly and easily.The pin remover was smooth, didn't break, and I received five extras.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.28405106", "1": "0.23528582", "2": "0.2116107", "3": "0.047733385", "4": "0.05609856", "5": "0.13974607", "6": "0.025474416"}}
