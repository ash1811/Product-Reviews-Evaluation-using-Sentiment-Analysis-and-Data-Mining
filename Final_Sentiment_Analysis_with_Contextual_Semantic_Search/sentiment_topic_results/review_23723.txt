{"text": "These are the socks my husband always buys in the store. Less expensive here on Amazon. Washed them as soon as we got them.  No shrinkage or excessive lint.  Seem the same except out of the six pair of socks, one sock was much longer than the others going up the calf.  I figure it's either a fluke or they might be seconds.  In any event my husband said \"no big deal for just one sock....who's going to see it anyway\"....lol.  I will  buy them again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09710849", "1": "0.29808438", "3": "0.17358641", "4": "0.273377", "5": "0.11962701", "6": "0.035100896"}}
