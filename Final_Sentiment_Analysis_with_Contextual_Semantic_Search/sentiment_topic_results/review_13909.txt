{"text": "This is everything I wanted in a watch. The Eco-Drive is an accurate movement which never needs batteries, the Chronograph (stopwatch) feature is the ONLY extra feature I get much use of in a watch, and the stainless steel case/water resistance to 100m means I can wear it every day without worrying that I'll wreck it.Some notes on the watch. The picture of the face is accurate - easy to read numbers and hands. The second hand is NOT the red sweep hand pointing at 12:00; that's the stopwatch hand. The second hand is the small dial at 6:00, which takes about 30 seconds to get used to. The band is more of a true olive green (like military duffel bags) than the deep green pictured. And finally, the 'holes' for the buckle have grommets around them, which means they are farther apart than on a leather band, and while fit is not difficult even with this feature, it's worth noting. Also, the canvas strap has a leather (or pleather) lining, which makes it more comfortable on the skin. The watch is easy to set. The date is a number only, so when months pass that have 30 days or less, you have to advance it manually.As is, it's a great military field style watch. Big and easy to read, with long-lasting luminescence on the hands and the hours. I currently own a metal-band, dressy Citizen watch with lots of (useless) features, and if this keeps time/charge like that one, then it's going to be steady and reliable. I'm very happy with this purchase......especially since I replaced the canvas band with a leather band (http://www.amazon.com/Hadley-Roma-MSM894RB-200-20-mm-Genuine-Leather/dp/B001F0PTXC/ref=sr_1_2?s=watches&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1397935533&sr;=1-2&keywords;=hadley+roma). Now it looks like this watch: http://www.amazon.com/Citizen-BL5250-02L-Eco-Drive-Leather-Titanium/dp/B000EQS0WK/ref=sr_1_1?s=watches&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1397936104&sr;=1-1&keywords;=citizen ; which is amazing. It looks both rugged and dressy. I'm thrilled.For tips on replacing watch bands, this is a great resource - I did mine with a knife in about 5 minutes.
