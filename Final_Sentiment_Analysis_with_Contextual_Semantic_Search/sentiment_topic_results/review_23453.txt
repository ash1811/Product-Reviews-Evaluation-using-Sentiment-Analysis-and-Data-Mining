{"text": "Well, in general term, this watch is a 'replica' however the definition stops where your observations begin. A replica is normally a copy of another item with substantially less quality. This Invicta 8926OB is not a replica.Although the Rolex Submariner has much better attention to detail, quality of parts, quality of movement etc. the core function of the Invicta--telling time--is equal to the 7,000$ counterpartI have owned the Invicta for around 4 months. It loses around 2-3 seconds a day. As I am looking at the time now--it has been a month since I wound is last--it is exactly 1 minute behind government. That is a 2 second a day loss with the NH35A Seiko movement with no professional adjustment. Value is...as good as can be expected in this case.This is not a replica, as stated above and more closely can be described as a tribute to the Rolex Submariner. For this I assume you want this watch because you like the look of the Submariner. If you have never heard of the Submariner and happen to like this particular style, know that you are looking at the Submariner...without the high price tag--the look is identical.The only differences (appearance) between this and the Sub:1. The dial on the Rolex is more 'inky', abyss, black. It looks better.2. The oyster bracelet of the rolex (matted entire band) versus the half matte/half chrome Invicta band. Use fine sand paper to transform the Invicta bracelet if you choose.3. The cyclops on a submariner offers slightly more magnification.4. Submariner has a sapphire crystal. The Invicta has a mineral crystal.The Invicta Pro Diver is not only an almost perfect tribute with appearances, it is a fine watch on its own.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.19213387", "1": "0.31095964", "2": "0.19501244", "4": "0.12723932", "6": "0.17060746"}}
