{"text": "I purchased two pair of these sweatpants and one of them already came apart at the seem in the upper leg and crotch area. This stuff is so cheaply made it's a joke. Never heard of this brand and will never buy them again. I'm just lucky my wife can sew the pants back together. I'm just wondering how long they are going to last. They, like the sweatshirts are very soft and comfortable, but there sizing is off and the sewing leaves a little to be desired.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.060922097", "1": "0.35028872", "2": "0.108633116", "3": "0.1486416", "5": "0.21600156", "6": "0.11239603"}}
