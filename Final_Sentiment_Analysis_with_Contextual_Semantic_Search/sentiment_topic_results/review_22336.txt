{"text": "I remember buying these exact same Chucks for 39.99 not too long ago what happened since then? Other than that, still a great shoe, comfortable and classic. Wear them with anything anywhere. I did buy my normal size and half a size down but I ended up keeping my normal size. The smaller size did fit but I was more comfy in my normal size, I don't feel that they run abnormally large. I am now ready to order in pink and green next. I love the high tops, I never liked how the low tops looked on me, the high tops offer more option and style in my opinion.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18232502", "1": "0.20040022", "2": "0.13177161", "3": "0.30155185", "4": "0.06349384", "6": "0.11802638"}}
