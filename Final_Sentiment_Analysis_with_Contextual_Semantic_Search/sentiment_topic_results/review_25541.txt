{"text": "I am a huge watch hound, yet my modest income does not allow me to purchase Tag Hauer, Omega, Rolex, or any of these other $1000+ brands.  So I wanted a quality Swiss timepiece that is stylish and classy.  This watch is simply amazing.  Solid construction, gorgeous black face with white and a touch of yellow accents.  It goes with jeans or a suit.  It keeps superbly accurate time and has dials for several other timekeeping functions.  I wear this one more than any other watch.  My only beef is that I cannot get it sized perfectly so I have to leave it a touch loose.  If you seem to have the same problem, Dolce and Gabbana make watches that when adjusted fit my wrist size perfectly.  Other than that, I am pleased with the brand.  My next purchase may be a Tissot with a different style of band.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.06790349", "1": "0.18231478", "2": "0.17282046", "3": "0.22303951", "4": "0.18313925", "5": "0.08885803", "6": "0.081924476"}}
