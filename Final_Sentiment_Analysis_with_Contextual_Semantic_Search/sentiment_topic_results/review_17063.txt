{"text": "I love this bra. I've bought like four of them so far. I'm a size 30G and have a hard time finding my size unless I go to Nordstrom, but I'm not always ready and willing to spend upward of $100 for a bra, so this is a nice alternative for the price. It gives decent support and padding provides good coverage, and my former one that I just got rid of lasted a couple years and I even put it in washer.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17458679", "1": "0.39742345", "3": "0.35739058", "5": "0.061236277"}}
