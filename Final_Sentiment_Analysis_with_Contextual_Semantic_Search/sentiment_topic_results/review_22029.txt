{"text": "I have a few pairs of decent sunglasses, but I wanted a really nice pair for work/pleasure. I first saw these on the movie End of Watch (Jake Gyllenhaal's character wears them) and looked them up online. They got great reviews so I purchased the matte black frame with polarized lenses. They look awesome and feel even better. They feel much more sturdy than any other pair I have, and they are nice and light. They are pretty expensive, but worth it so far.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19210003", "1": "0.3360348", "2": "0.09880847", "3": "0.21274844", "4": "0.052724943", "5": "0.104469545"}}
