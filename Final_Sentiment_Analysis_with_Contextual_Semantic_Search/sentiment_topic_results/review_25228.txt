{"text": "I have high arches that must be supported at all times. I bought these because the insoles included in my everyday casual sneakers did not have enough support and I hoped to replace them with these. They have been recommended to me for high arches.When I put these in my shoes and stood, I could feel a significant space between the arch of my foot and the arch of the insert. I tried walking around in them, and my ankles pronated more than is acceptable. I wasn't impressed with the shock absorption of the forefoot area, either.If you have low to medium arches, and a shoe which has a lot of padding at the forefoot already, you might like these arch supports. In my case they were not helpful.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.062028006", "1": "0.07223736", "2": "0.16409181", "3": "0.24575454", "4": "0.25332645", "5": "0.15616648", "6": "0.046395376"}}
