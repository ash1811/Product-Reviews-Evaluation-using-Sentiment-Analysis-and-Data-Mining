{"text": "Apparently, Jockey makes different styles of underwear for sale in stores and online in packages.  I got what I thought looked identical to ones I got at JCPenney--every detail was the same, the fiber contents were the same--and when I got them, they were not the same.  They do fit pretty well--but not as well as the others I have.  They are not soft and silky and stretchy like the ones I got at the store.  They are really thick, and so a little hot for summer and they don't have a lot of stretch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18753064", "1": "0.30457553", "3": "0.19187339", "4": "0.10070017", "5": "0.10540927", "6": "0.10678849"}}
