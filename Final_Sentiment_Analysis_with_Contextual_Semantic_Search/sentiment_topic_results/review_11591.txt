{"text": "This is  a very cute ring.  Not overwhelming on the finger.  Just the size I was looking for.  I wear it on my middle finger and it fills the knuckle.  Very comfortable also. Lightweight, but seems to be very sturdy.  I have worn it several times and have had no problems with it catching on things.  I think its a great product and the price is right.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.41375747", "4": "0.26418602", "5": "0.16145301", "6": "0.14578398"}}
