{"text": "While not a big fan of underwires in general, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable this bra is.  I was looking for a seamless, soft-cup bra--not pre-formed, foam cups like so many out there today.  This one fits my needs and is very pretty too.  The straps are wide enough to be comfortable, there are 3 sets of clasps in the back, the underwire is covered with soft fabric and helps shape and define--all good!  One thing that might be helpful to other interested shoppers is that my regular size is 40B but 40C fits in this bra.  I guess that may mean that the cup size runs a bit small.  Anyway, I liked it so much that I now own three and will probably buy a fourth.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03685478", "1": "0.33561748", "2": "0.13195081", "3": "0.13644421", "4": "0.14860082", "5": "0.03158033", "6": "0.17895158"}}
