{"text": "I love these shoes! First, they are comfortable. I stand for most of the day, and the souls of these shoes are made perfectly, such that I can stand without leg aches. They are also comfortable when you are walking. The second great thing about these shoes is that they look good. They are in that range between casual and dress shoes. You would not wear them with a suit, but they are great with a pair of pressed slacks and a dress shirt. Finally, they last. The shoes are well made and don't fall apart. The other thing I love about these shoes is that they come in Narrow. I have a narrow foot, and it is very hard to find narrow shoes. This is the best pair of shoes I have been able to find that come in narrow.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.094432674", "1": "0.39642018", "2": "0.21312848", "4": "0.13607794", "5": "0.15441151"}}
