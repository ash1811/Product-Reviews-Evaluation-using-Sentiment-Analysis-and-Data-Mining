{"text": "I purchased these on a whim when I saw them come up as a Lightning Deal.  The reviews were good and I was in need of a new pair of black flats. The only problem I found with the reviews that I read were that they seemed all over the board about what size to order; some said they run small, some said too big and others said just right.  I decided to go with my normal size and hope for the best and I'm glad I did; they fit perfectly! Not too tight, but not to loose and after wearing them a full day I didn't have any blisters or sore spots from uneven wear.  In the future if looking for new shoes, I will definitely give this brand another try.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12934867", "1": "0.33464602", "3": "0.36050653", "5": "0.0981067", "6": "0.07185424"}}
