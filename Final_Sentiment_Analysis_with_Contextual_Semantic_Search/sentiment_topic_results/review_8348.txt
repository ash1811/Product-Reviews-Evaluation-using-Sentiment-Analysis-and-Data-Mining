{"text": "I read a few reviews stating some of the shoes are not leather.  This is one of them.  The Copper Rose color is NOT leather, but a \"all man made material\" with glued on sparkles.  The fit is great and it's fairly comfy, I just need them to slip on and run errands.  But if you're looking for a leather shoe, this isn't it.So far the quality is pretty good, the shoe is holding together and the stitching is solid.  I would probably buy another pair but I would want them to actually be leather. I wear these everywhere and they are not breathable at all (man made material) but they look cute and are versatile with a lot of outfits.  I don't have particularly long toes, but these cover my toes all the way.Update:  May 14, 2013... There is a tear on the outside of the shoe along the edge where it meets the heel.  Not even a month old and I don't wear them every day. Poor quality. Too bad, for as comfortable as they were.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08341639", "1": "0.34574777", "2": "0.27210104", "3": "0.10992744", "4": "0.065888554", "6": "0.12044632"}}
