{"text": "This walking exercise shoe from Skechers is a nice looking dark sneaker.  Good for walking where you may encounter dirt and dusts that would discolor a lighter shoe.  I liked the price of $52.95 and the fit is good for my use of the shoe and it was comfortable from my first wearing.  I like it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.43128374", "2": "0.2574701", "3": "0.1005427", "5": "0.19683479"}}
