{"text": "I bought a smaller Rothco bag for carrying around my Kindle Fire 7 HD. It worked fantastic. So, when I saw this larger bag  for a super cheap price, I bought it. I am happy with the purchase. My only problem is the bag is so &#34;freeform&#34; nothing really sits well in it. Like a baby duffle bag or something. And the top is not super secure unless the bag is full. So I carry an old t-shirt inside of it which gives it some structure and gives the clasp something to close against.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19192645", "1": "0.31730133", "2": "0.21771944", "3": "0.12061473", "4": "0.037192825", "5": "0.039826553", "6": "0.07541868"}}
