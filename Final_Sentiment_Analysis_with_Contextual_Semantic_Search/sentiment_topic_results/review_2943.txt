{"text": "I have a large chest and decided to shop for a few comfort bras recently, instead of worrying so much about what they look like. Playtex is the way to go for that, but I must say, this thing is kinda the worst of both worlds. It's really unpleasant to look at and makes my boobs look unnaturally pointy. That might be okay, if it was actually comfortable, which it isn't. I thought it looked like it had an excess of fabric when I decided to buy it, and it definitely does. I'd rather have an underwire than over an inch of structured fabric that is basically acting as a wire. I was going to return it, but it's semi-functional as a sports bra. I've been wearing it to the gym with one of those flimsy cloth sports bras over it, to cover up its scariness. Yet another Macgyver bra moment...", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.18953831", "2": "0.06319852", "3": "0.33791405", "4": "0.122150324", "5": "0.07624894", "6": "0.2085186"}}
