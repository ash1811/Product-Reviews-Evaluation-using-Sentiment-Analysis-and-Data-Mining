{"text": "I wanted a pair of leather flip flops for pool and beach side use. These definitely fit the bill. They are well-made, good looking and comfortable. The only thing I don't like about them is lack of stability. If you step on an uneven surface, e.g., carpet edge, they slip around on your feet, and it's easy to lose your balance or stumble a bit. I attribute this to the thinness of the sole, and to the very smooth (slippery) leather on the foot bed. No flip flops are particularly stable, but the pair I had before had a thicker sole and a more contoured foot bed, and I had much less of a stability issue with those.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11357465", "1": "0.1896669", "2": "0.13128029", "3": "0.21894985", "4": "0.16979295", "5": "0.07386732", "6": "0.102868065"}}
