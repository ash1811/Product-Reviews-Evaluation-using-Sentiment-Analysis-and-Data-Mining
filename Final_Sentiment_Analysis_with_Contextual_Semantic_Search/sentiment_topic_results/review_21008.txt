{"text": "I love Hanes Silk Reflections and have been wearing the thigh highs, stockings, and pantyhose for over 15 years.  These lace top thigh highs are very sheer and look sexy with the lace accent.  They fit perfectly and will stay in place all day long with no sagging or bagging at the knees and ankles.  They feel great under anything that I wear and I feel so good wearing them knowing how good they make my legs feel.  They are also very durable, I usually get 10 wearings out of these stockings and the nice thing about thigh highs when one gets a run I can save the good one to match up with another pair.As an Amazon Prime member I got free 2 day shipping and my package arrived on time and in good shape.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09254469", "1": "0.37041485", "2": "0.029643372", "3": "0.14150475", "4": "0.14933123", "6": "0.21439074"}}
