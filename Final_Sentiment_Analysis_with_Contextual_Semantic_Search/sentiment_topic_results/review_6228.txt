I LOVE pockets, so when I say too many pockets, it's a big deal. There are TOO many pockets that become rather useless.Not the right shape size - the flatness was a pro when I purchased but when I tried it out, it was less impressive. I struggled to fit everything I needed to in this bag. There is not much wiggle room, or room for oddly-shaped items.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.3896396", "2": "0.02588321", "3": "0.17745842", "4": "0.11603665", "5": "0.0326941", "6": "0.2553065"}}
