{"text": "Having a 40DD chest, it's hard to fine a wireless bra that is comfortable enough to wear all day. This bra is great! Beautiful lace, great supportive straps that don't slip, and it's true to size. It does minimize your chest a little (as most great fitting bras do), which is  just fine with me. I have been wearing it about 18 hours now and it's still really comfortable. Great bra! I suggest buying it!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.2871056", "1": "0.2341173", "2": "0.09130752", "3": "0.30154595", "6": "0.079101175"}}
