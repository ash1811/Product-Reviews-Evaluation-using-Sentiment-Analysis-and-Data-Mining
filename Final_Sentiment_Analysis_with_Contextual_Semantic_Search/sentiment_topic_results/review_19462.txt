{"text": "This is my second wallet purchase of this type - the first one lasted 4 years.  I use it as a wallet inside my purse and have found it to be top notch and holds the things that I need.  The double latch is great as I store checkbook and other in that area, then cards and money in the other..  I will by this product again and again as it really fits the most basic wallet need for me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05133364", "1": "0.22377501", "2": "0.1977334", "3": "0.19008157", "4": "0.058918815", "5": "0.13103002", "6": "0.14712754"}}
