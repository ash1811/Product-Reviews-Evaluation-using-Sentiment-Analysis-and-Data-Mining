{"text": "This bra fit really well around the cup area. Perfectly in fact, because there is no padding to distort the shape of your breast. It's like a lacy, stretchy sort of material that conforms to your shape. Since there is no padding, you might want to put something over the nipple area to prevent them from showing in cold temperatures. For me personally, I have small nipples so mine don't show much even without a pasty. I ordered my correct size, I know this. However my side fat was bulging out of the sides of the bra under my armpit. Maybe the elastic strip was too tight?...I've never had a problem with previous bras of the same size. Maybe after I break it in the elastic will loosen a bit and not make me bulge. Overall I'm satisfied with this purchase.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13046199", "1": "0.22240302", "2": "0.1636405", "3": "0.28429914", "4": "0.09048315", "5": "0.058103155", "6": "0.050609075"}}
