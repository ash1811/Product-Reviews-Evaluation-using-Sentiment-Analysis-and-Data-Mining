{"text": "I was worried about the size of these trousers but it turned out they fit my waist rather well. I'm 158 cm, 56 kg or 5'2'', 123 lb, waist 28'', and ordered a 7 as it's a juniour size, otherwsie I wear the US size 4. Of course, they are too long for me if I wore flats but that's hardly a surprise. And as some other reviews mentioned they really are a bit loose in the hips if perfect on your waist,  Apart from that they aren't anything special, just an ordinary pair of balck trousers, which is what I wanted really.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07485021", "1": "0.28591877", "2": "0.14348893", "3": "0.0558554", "4": "0.10319325", "5": "0.16180167", "6": "0.1748918"}}
