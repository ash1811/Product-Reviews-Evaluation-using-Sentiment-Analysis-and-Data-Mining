{"text": "This is a nice value, and well made. It is easy to read and the luminosity is good. Others have complained about the rubber band, but it is not any worse than any other rubber band I have had. Rubber band is not my first choice, but at this price point, I could not find as good a watch with a steel clasp. The watch is standard thickness, and thinner than an automatic as this uses a battery. The size is right where I like, at 39-40 mm and this watch is on the larger end of that scale, and compared to other watches, seems bigger for my small wrists (7.25 inches). It has been very hard for me to get the perfect watch since an old wenger I had died. I had that watch for 14 years. The biggest negative I have is that this watch has a starburst affect when in bright light and the sculpture of the face causes distortion. There is an indent in the face that is not clear in the pictures so was a little surprised. My search for the perfect replacement Water resistant watch continues. If this watch HAD a screw down crown, metal band, day and date, and 200 m resistance, it would be 5 stars. As it does not meet any of that criteria, I only feel it is 3 stars. There are other watches for a little more money I guess I will have to buy.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.26364732", "1": "0.20069776", "2": "0.17259477", "3": "0.06567046", "4": "0.1417443", "5": "0.050720364", "6": "0.104925044"}}
