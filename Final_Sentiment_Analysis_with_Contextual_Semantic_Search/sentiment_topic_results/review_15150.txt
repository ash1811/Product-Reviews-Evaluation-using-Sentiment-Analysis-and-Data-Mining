{"text": "This bag is very well made and (I think) beautiful.  I love these bags and own two of the distressed nylon versions.  This one has a separate zipped and padded pocket that runs the length of the bag for tablet computers.  Although my ipad mini's case adds just enough bulk that it won't fit in the designated pocket, it fits with room to spare in the main compartment.  Thanks to another reviewer's idea, I hung a carabiner in the key ring located at the top of the bag so no more digging for keys!  All of my stuff is super organized and well protected.  I have fit absolutely everything in this bag for commuting and travel and wear it cross body style to keep my hands free.  And I love not having an aching back anymore from the shoulder bags that never stayed on my shoulders.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.021581506", "1": "0.44358727", "2": "0.19532163", "3": "0.124807894", "4": "0.13461362", "6": "0.07784915"}}
