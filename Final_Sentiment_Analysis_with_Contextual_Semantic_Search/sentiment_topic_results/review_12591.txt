{"text": "years ago, i worked in a dark room at a newspaper. the floor was hard and my mother bought me a pair of Clarks. I remember how great they were and my feet were always comfortable. Clarke has a reputation for making good comfortable shoes. I wanted a pair of  Clarks because I had fond memories of the pair that I owned back in 1986. These are a different style than i owned back in 1986, but of the very same quality and comfort. I recommend these shoes without hesitation.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16566055", "1": "0.41578257", "2": "0.06603973", "4": "0.23043574", "6": "0.11556869"}}
