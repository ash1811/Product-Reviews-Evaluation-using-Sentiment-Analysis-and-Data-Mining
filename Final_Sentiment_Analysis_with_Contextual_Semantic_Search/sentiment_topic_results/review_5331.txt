{"text": "I have a pair of these that I got at an outlet, in a pink/purple floral pattern.  I wanted more because they are so comfy for warm weather, but the stores only have leopard print etc. and I am SOOO not interested in animal prints.  So I went on Amazon and found a seller with a whole lot of choices...mostly black, white, and animal prints...but there they were in pretty pink...so I bought them.  The only thing I could mention for other buyers is that I thought they looked better when I swapped the left and right shoes.  They seemed a teeny bit misshapen but swapping left for right pretty much took care of the problem.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12015198", "1": "0.17605038", "2": "0.28631425", "3": "0.052042715", "4": "0.110172495", "5": "0.14556862", "6": "0.10969953"}}
