{"text": "LOVE IT!!!  Price is great and it's a really nice watch with the night glow feature. Easy to read dial helps these old eyes too.I have a tiny wrist so the band is long but it's great that it would also fit people with larger wrists. My hubby just got the same watch and it fits his large wrist which most bands do not.Really a great little watch!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06474018", "1": "0.24312043", "2": "0.10015444", "3": "0.058843665", "4": "0.2449247", "5": "0.19533983", "6": "0.09287672"}}
