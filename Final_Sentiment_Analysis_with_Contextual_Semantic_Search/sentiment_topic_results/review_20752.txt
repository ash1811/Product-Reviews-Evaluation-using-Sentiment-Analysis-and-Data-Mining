{"text": "These T-Shirts are fantastic.  I originally liked the crew neck, but thought I would try something different since I've seen a lot of people with this style.  They are much much more comfortable than the crew necks.  They don't wrap your neck even close as tight as those do.  I really enjoy them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15134373", "1": "0.48436114", "2": "0.099907994", "3": "0.1998039", "4": "0.055631395"}}
