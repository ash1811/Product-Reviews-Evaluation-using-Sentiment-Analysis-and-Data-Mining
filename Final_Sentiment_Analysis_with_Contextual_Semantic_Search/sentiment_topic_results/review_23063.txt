{"text": "Nice and soft right out of the box. Strap is a bit tight. I wear about a size 12 shoe but was glad I ordered a size 13 sandal, I wouldn't want these any smaller. I wonder if a size 14 would be too big?I'm hoping these last forever. I seem to recall buying \"thongs\" as we called them at the market when I was a kid -- they cost a dollar and lasted until we outgrew them. Now I find myself spending twenty bucks on a pair.---Six months later: well, the strap finally loosened up a bit. In fact, it went from too tight to too loose in about a week. These are on the way out, I can't see how to tighten the strap, which had been too tight since I got them. For the money, I'm not real impressed. I was just going to recollect the old sandals we'd buy at the market when I was a kid but I see I'd already mentioned that in my initial review.Shoes like this that cost this much ought to last longer than six months, you know what I mean?", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10448664", "1": "0.16693623", "2": "0.16006514", "3": "0.32551807", "4": "0.07785638", "5": "0.043937713", "6": "0.12119985"}}
