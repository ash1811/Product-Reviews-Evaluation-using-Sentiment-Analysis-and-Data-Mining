{"text": "I recently purchased a Bella Band hoping it would double for support now, and tummy coverage for nursing later, but it offered no support at all. So I purchased the mini cradle, and I really like it. I'm in my 7th month but I have big babies so I not only need the support under the belly  because of lower abdominal and back pain, but I also need it for a herniated belly button, which is really painful. I am 5'5\" and 185lbs, at the lower end of the Medium, and was really worried that it wouldn't give me enough support, but I read the other reviews about it running a little small and decided to order the med anyway. It fits perfect on the 2nd/middle closure for under the belly support, and on the 3rd/last closure for around the belly button. It is a little tricky to secure, but if you secure it at your hip, then adjust it after, it's pretty easy. There's not a lot you can do about the stiff fabric though, unless you wear it over your clothes. I have really sensitive skin so I just have to wear it around the house, which is where I spend most of my time anyway, however, if you work, that might not be an option...if I have to I just wear it over my maternity pants and under my shirt which usually works just fine since I don't tuck any of my maternity shirts in anyway.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.116266556", "1": "0.19179736", "2": "0.16622634", "3": "0.24953018", "4": "0.065346226", "5": "0.094093055", "6": "0.11674028"}}
