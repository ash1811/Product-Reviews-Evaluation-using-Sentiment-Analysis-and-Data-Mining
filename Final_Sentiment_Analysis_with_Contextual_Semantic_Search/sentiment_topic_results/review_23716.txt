{"text": "Huh?  Yes.  Dog toy.  You put an empty pint water bottle (sans lid) inside the sock, slip it down toward the toe, and knot about 4\" above bottle.  Bottle crackles and bounces.  Great pull toy, too.  Recycle bottle when it's flat and no longer crackles. Note:  as bottle flattens, some sharpish points/sides can develop, so check every so often to make sure there's nothing there that could damage gums. So, now, how does the sock pertain?  Well, it's nice and long so it's easy to knot.  And when there's a hole in the toe or somewhere near the toe of the sock, there's still plenty of room to knot the other end.  Heavy-weight fabric. In all, a most excellent purchase!  Reckon it would be great for feet, too!  mb", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17255908", "1": "0.26228574", "2": "0.2319943", "5": "0.274543", "6": "0.054783624"}}
