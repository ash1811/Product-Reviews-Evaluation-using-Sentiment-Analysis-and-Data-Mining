{"text": "They didn't turn me off, either, and I was kind of wrong.Don't misunderstand:  this bra is great.  It's an awesome T-shirt bra, it's comfortable, it's well made, and if you don't mind the coning, definitely go for it.However, if you're thinking it'll give you the same kind of coning retro lingerie will give you, you'll be disappointed.  The retro coning has an almost pyramid shape to it; your breasts come to a point.  A dull one, sure, but there's an implied sharpness underneath it.  This coning is somewhere *between* that coning and no coning at all.  Too pointed to be modern, too dull to be vintage.  If you're over a D cup (as I am), it's just gonna look a little weird in a T-shirt.  But if you've got anything up to and including a D cup, you probably wouldn't notice it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17533082", "1": "0.17363384", "2": "0.21420203", "3": "0.33389413", "4": "0.03490341", "5": "0.018206026", "6": "0.04982973"}}
