{"text": "OK ... this item cost me $2.88 with free shipping. Does it work? YES! Is it well made? Well ... it was shipped from China ...This item is made of plastic, and it will work, BUT .. do not buy this if you are going to use it a lot. I needed something quickly while I was visiting relatives for the holidays. I received a watch as a gift and figured, for this low price, I would order it and shorten the band before we left for home in January. I did NOT know it was coming from China. However, it did arrive quickly and it did work, but I can say that the plastic is cheap and the assortment of pins are NOT high quality metal. I gave it 4 stars because it did work and for under three dollars it was definitely worth it. I got what I paid for and I am very satisfied with the purchase value.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13510457", "1": "0.24758151", "2": "0.15786722", "3": "0.0643221", "4": "0.13198334", "5": "0.14418256", "6": "0.118958704"}}
