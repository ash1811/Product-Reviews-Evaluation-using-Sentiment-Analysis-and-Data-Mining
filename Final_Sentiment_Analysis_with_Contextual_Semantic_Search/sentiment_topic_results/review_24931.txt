{"text": "I've been using these for quite a while now and now that fall is here and I've moved them into my boots it's time to review. These are the first insoles I've had that just fit all of my shoes right out of the box without having to be cut. They offer great support and are a huge improvment over Dr. Scholls or other brands I've tried. They are also holding up very very well. Aside from the usual shoe and sock fuzzy they look brand new. Other brands would look destroyed by now.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.107913725", "1": "0.2577185", "2": "0.081015535", "3": "0.30085158", "4": "0.16669466", "5": "0.055999056", "6": "0.029806947"}}
