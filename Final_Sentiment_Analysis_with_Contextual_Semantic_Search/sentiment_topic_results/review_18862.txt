{"text": "I know these jeans are for men but, I took a chance and I am glad I did! These jeans are mid rise and straight-leg and come in talls so the fit is perfect for me since I am straight up-n-down built. I have a little curve but, not much. I got a size bigger in the waist as I did not want them to fit too snug. These jeans look good on a woman if you are tall with some curve and like to size the length yourself for heels or flats...what a great concept being able to pick my own length!!! I like the choice and jeans are not just for dress-down now, in other colors are used for dress-up casual. Thanks again, I ordered many!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.2577176", "3": "0.08687432", "4": "0.04225791", "5": "0.30789933", "6": "0.30003688"}}
