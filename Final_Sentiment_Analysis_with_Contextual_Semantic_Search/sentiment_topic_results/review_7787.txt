{"text": "These boots are the kind of quality that I wish more products were.  They took a while to break in, and they're a little difficult to get into, but these minor issues are a small price to pay for the warmth and dryness that they provide.  Several reviews claim that the \"drawstring\" is uncomfortable, but I haven't had any such problem.  Other reviews suggest buying a larger pair to accommodate thick socks, and I would probably agree.  Mine are a bit tight, but I feel that because I'll only be in moderately cold conditions (5 or 10 degrees fahrenheit at the coldest), it's unlikely that I'll ever need very thick socks... so my boots are fine.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.052121785", "1": "0.1954947", "2": "0.13997892", "3": "0.2108918", "4": "0.10861856", "5": "0.20024052", "6": "0.09265375"}}
