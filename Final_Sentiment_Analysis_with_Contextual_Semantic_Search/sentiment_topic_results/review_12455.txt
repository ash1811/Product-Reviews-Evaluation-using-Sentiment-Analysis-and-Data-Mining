{"text": "I normally wear a size 9 1/2 shoe so I ordered a size 10 and they fit perfectly.  There are two reasons that I didn't give the flip flop 5 stars.  1)  I would have liked the foot bed to be a little wider, my feet are right at the edge on both sides.  2)  I would have liked a little more support in the arch and heel.  They are very comfortable and do feel like slippers but I'm not sure that I would order another pair because of the two items I mentioned above.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.062397208", "1": "0.34238783", "2": "0.09613684", "3": "0.1690308", "4": "0.1188093", "5": "0.055490002", "6": "0.15574802"}}
