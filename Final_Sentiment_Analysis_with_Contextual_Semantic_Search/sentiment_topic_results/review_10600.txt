{"text": "These shirts are exactly what I expected.  They are well made and the piping on the edges of the sleeves and the collar make them a little more distinctive than the average polo shirt.  I take a large and the large shirts I ordered fit perfectly.  After several washings they have only shrunk a tiny bit.  They don't need ironing if you take them directly out of the dryer and hang them up.  The price is great and I will likely order some more in the near future.  They arrived quickly and in great shape.  Definitely recommend.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14250039", "1": "0.40573457", "2": "0.0803048", "3": "0.071490966", "4": "0.14819242", "6": "0.14873074"}}
