{"text": "I debated forever on whether to size up in these or not. Some reviews said they were fine, others said they sized up. I even asked a friend of mine who has these in the men's version, and he went against what everyone else said, insisting I should size down. I sit somewhere between 7.5 and 8 and after reading a ton of reviews, I noticed that on the Keen website, they suggest sizing up one half size, so I did. Turns out to have been a good decision. The size 8 was a perfect fit, and I'm pretty sure the size 7.5 would have been too snug.I bought these to wear on vacation, and had never worn them before going, other than to see if I ordered the right size. So the first time I put them on, I wore them all day walking around Busch Gardens in Tampa Bay, Florida. No breaking in time. Just put them on and wore them walking all day long. I was quite pleased to find that my feel took to them well and other than the heels feeling a little tender, after 8 hours of walking and standing lines, my feet didn't hurt the next day.I also wore these out into the ocean several days while on vacation. We stayed at a hotel right on the gulf, and walked along the beach every morning. I wore these when we were out for our morning walks, and then wore them several times when I was swimming and walking out chest deep in the ocean, looking for seashells. After being completely submerged in water, I found they took about a day to fully dry out again. These are great multi-purpose shoes. Water or walking, they work great for both. I bought them in the Bluestone/Neutral Grey color and they are perfect when you wear jeans all the time, like myself. They have a denim look and color to them, so they match perfectly for anything you wear with jeans. I like these so much, I'm hoping to pick up another pair in one of the other fun bright colors as well.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.094123855", "1": "0.18613042", "2": "0.16278201", "3": "0.21626401", "4": "0.092797235", "5": "0.08189126", "6": "0.1660112"}}
