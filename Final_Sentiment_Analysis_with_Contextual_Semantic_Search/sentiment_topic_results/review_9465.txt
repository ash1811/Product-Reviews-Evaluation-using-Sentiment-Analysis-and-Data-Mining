{"text": "This is the first bra I've ever bought that I can actually wear for the whole day and forget about. I'm usually pulling and tugging because I have a small frame and a big cup size and I'm also short so the straps are usually too long. This one fit perfectly, provides great lift and is so comfortable I can actually lie down in it without having it moving up my chest. I would definitely buy it again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.043545995", "1": "0.32684672", "2": "0.091040246", "3": "0.21721603", "4": "0.11092524", "5": "0.20709431"}}
