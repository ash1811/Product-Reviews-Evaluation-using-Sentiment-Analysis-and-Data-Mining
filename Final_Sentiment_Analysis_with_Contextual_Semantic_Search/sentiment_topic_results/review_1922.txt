{"text": "i completely love these mocs. they are beautiful rich in color, great looking material, fit like a charm. i have 7 1/2 - 8 foot sort of chubby (wide) and the 7 fit nicely. they have stretched and ft perfectly now since i wear them almost daily. i love them. at first the bow part was twisted and i was supper sad thinking theyd be uncomfortable for a 4 day music festival but after twisting it around a bit it was fine, and in fact they were awesome that week and even better now. you will love them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.21859936", "1": "0.26023978", "2": "0.11815937", "3": "0.14875753", "4": "0.085160054", "5": "0.16656163"}}
