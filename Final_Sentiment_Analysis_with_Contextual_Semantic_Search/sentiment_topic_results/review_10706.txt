{"text": "I just took this pair of boots, straight out of the box, for an 11 mile hike across muddy and rocky terrain, as well as several stream crossings. Only one word to describe them: amazing! They were incredibly comfortable and my feet only started to hurt around in the last three miles (although that could very well have been just the tiredness). They were completely waterproof when I accidentally submerged them about halfway into the stream. I felt that my ankles were well supported, and generally felt pretty like I could take on whatever the terrain could throw at me. Infinite improvement over the sneakers I normally wear.Some other notes:- I noticed that one of the boots seemed a bit scratched up. There were two deeper lines and a few shallow scratches on the leather. However, I figured that I would be taking them through rough areas anyway, so I decided to keep them.- I also followed the advice from &#34;A Kid's Review&#34; and rubbed mink oil on the boots before taking them out. I also got a pair of merino wool socks (Terramer) to wear with them.- I was hiking in 80F weather and while I did find them warm, I didn't find them too hot or stuffy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13118656", "1": "0.24185647", "2": "0.15171422", "3": "0.10687777", "4": "0.15222861", "5": "0.09020521", "6": "0.12593117"}}
