{"text": "I purchased this bra, and a Glamorise MagicLift Active Support Bra. The latter is softer and more comfortable, but this one is prettier. (It is comfortable, just not as.) It is lacey, which makes it a little 'stiffer'.  The sides of this bra are quite wide, so it really goes up into your armpits. If this would bother you I would look at another style.  I have worn only Glamorise for many years and have never found anything better as far as quality, durability, comfort and looks.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07181675", "1": "0.22039023", "2": "0.12765874", "3": "0.22835101", "4": "0.19903739", "6": "0.14963475"}}
