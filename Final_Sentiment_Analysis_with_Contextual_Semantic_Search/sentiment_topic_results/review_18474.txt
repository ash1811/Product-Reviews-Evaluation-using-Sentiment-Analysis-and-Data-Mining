{"text": "I have a few pairs of Saucony Jazz sneakers. These are the low pro model. They are well made and comfortable, just not as comfortable as their original  model....The heel being thicker on those. If you are looking for a  VERY cushy shoe go with the originals. These look great with jeans and are quite uncommon.The colors are bright and the shoe light weight.I got a great price so if your not in a hurry keep checking AMAZON to see if the price lowers !", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15777624", "1": "0.37483534", "2": "0.15952842", "3": "0.10150763", "4": "0.12847938", "6": "0.07445823"}}
