{"text": "I am 5'2&#34;, 132 lb, generally fit and muscular but the extra weight I do have I carry in my middle, and my pelvis is narrow, so I'm the same width all the way down. When wearing these briefs I have a waist. It compresses and doesn't just shove all the fat down lower, so my whole stomach is noticeably flatter with it on. The leg holes do not bind or pinch, it never rolls down, and in general it is as comfortable as could be expected for something that visibly changes the shape of my body. I do notice the waistband digging into me, especially after wearing it for a few hours, but wearing it all day is not really a problem even though I have a fairly low tolerance for clothing-related discomfort. It doesn't create rolls of fat above itself, but there is a visible indentation where the waistband is, which disappeared when I wore it with/under the body-shaping tank by the same brand.If you are a pear shape, rather than an apple like me, you might or might not like the results for your hips and/or butt; I couldn't say.Ladies: when reviewing clothes, PLEASE give information on your body type!
