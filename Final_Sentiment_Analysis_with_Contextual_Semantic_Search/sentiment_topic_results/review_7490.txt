{"text": "Can't seem to find these denim jackets in brick and mortar stores anymore. I purchased both this jacket by Wrangler and one made by Levi's on Amazon. The Levi's jacket cost nearly twice as much as the Wrangler jacket. After having worn both, I would pick Wrangler over Levi's and pocket the cost difference.Wrangler is made in Bangladesh while Levi's is made in China. While Wrangler was pre-washed with slight fade, Levi's was artificially distressed with unusual scratch marks around the collar. The denim material is slightly thicker and marginally better quality on Wrangler. Both have chest and side pockets as well as reinforced stitchings where necessary. Overall, both are well built and should last you a while.My chest size is 42&#34;, waist 36&#34;, and sleeve 32&#34;. I ordered both in XL. With denims, I order slightly bigger, wash it in hot water and dry in high heat to pre-shrink before wearing. In general, Levi's fit tighter all around and will fit slimmer profile better. I have to roll the sleeve once to get proper sleeve length and upper arms fit tight. With a hoodie underneath, it's a tight fit. With Wranglers, the overall fit is more relaxed and comfortable and I can still wear a hoodie underneath no problem. Sleeves on Wranglers are tad shorter than the Levi's but it's definitely tailored more towards average Joe. If you are tall and lanky, Levi's might fit better.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.057109695", "1": "0.35286227", "2": "0.11908057", "3": "0.1488974", "4": "0.08491077", "5": "0.06551438", "6": "0.17162487"}}
