{"text": "This costume worked great as our pirate captain prop on our haunted pirate ship. Just added skeleton gloves and pirate scarf with dread and mask and voila really cool pirate prop.  After making huge gator and octopus props I wanted something easy to make.  These costumes were perfect. They held up to strong winds and rain too.  And they are still in great shape to use next year.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10607287", "1": "0.27731103", "2": "0.06635482", "3": "0.22297625", "4": "0.18199077", "5": "0.044487573", "6": "0.10080666"}}
