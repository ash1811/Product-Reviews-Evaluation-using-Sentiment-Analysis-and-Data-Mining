{"text": "This is my second pair of Acorn slippers.  They are very comfortable and durable.  I wear a size 81/2 C and the 8-9 size of Acorns fit well.  These are particularly warm slippers but they are pretty easy to slip on and off.  My only complaint is that I can feel the seams on the inside of the slipper.  They are not as flat as they should be.  I don't find this to be particularly annoying since they are loose enough not to rub against my foot, but it is a flaw that I wanted to report. I would still buy these slippers again at this price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07992974", "1": "0.38721988", "3": "0.18864837", "4": "0.070276625", "5": "0.060922217", "6": "0.20989123"}}
