{"text": "For ~$15 dollars this is a nice watch. It has a nice display (a little small) with the time, date, seconds and day of the week along with a good light. It is pretty basic but a good buy if you are just looking for a simple sports watch. I bought this watch along with the Timex Women's T5K020 Ironman Triathlon 30-Lap Resin Band Watch. That watch is about double the price of this watch but is far superior. It has a larger and easier to read display, more functions, a comfortable band that fits to your wrist, and it much easier to set and more durable.There are a few things I do not like about this watch. This watch was rather difficult to set (I have never had trouble setting a Timex watch before) partly because the buttons are very small and difficult to maneuver and that it was also very confusing. The display is also small compared to other Timex watches. The main thing I do not like about this watch is the band. The band is rather cheap and flimsy and not made out of the most comfortable material. It does not fit/conform very nicely to your wrist making the watch rather uncomfortable. The other watch I mentioned above has a far nicer band.Overall I give this 4/5 stars for the price for a sports watch. I would like to put emphasis on the fact that this watch is very basic. If you plan to use this for intense athletics/triathlons/races etc. I'd highly recommend the other watch I have mentioned here which is an excellent watch.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.19509159", "1": "0.34172812", "2": "0.21705371", "3": "0.052694064", "4": "0.14231978", "6": "0.048761576"}}
