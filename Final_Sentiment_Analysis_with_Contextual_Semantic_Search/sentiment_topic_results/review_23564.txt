{"text": "I live in utah with terrible cold winters and tons of snow. I originally bought these just to wear out on weekends or around town but I ended up rarely taking them off all winter, I have even worn them to work, climbing on ladders and trecking through the snow! They have been the only thing that has kept my feet warm all day! They are very comfortable and have held up exremely well! The only complaint I have is that the linings are not removable! I would love to be able to take the lingings out to wash them, but they are glued in.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20668675", "1": "0.31363732", "2": "0.039301805", "3": "0.091968045", "4": "0.076804794", "5": "0.19886309", "6": "0.07273818"}}
