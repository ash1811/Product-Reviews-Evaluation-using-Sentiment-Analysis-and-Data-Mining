{"text": "I bought these for something to slip on easily for around the house and lighter weight than my usual wool clogs for the winter. They fit the bill. The only thing that could have been a little better is the fit, but not a deal breaker.. The slipper is to fit 7.5 to 8. I am an 8 and found it to feel a little short because of the slight lip around the heel. After I wore them awhile, however, the little lip flattens down and feels fine. They are comfy.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07221413", "1": "0.35768652", "2": "0.04134802", "3": "0.15604712", "4": "0.07340967", "5": "0.17950626", "6": "0.11978828"}}
