{"text": "Love them; Love them; Love them!!!! This my second pair. The first pair I used last year to wear in the evening (after taking off my hiking boots) whilst walking the 800km of the Camino Trail in Spain. It was wonderful to have my toes free at the end of the day. Until that time I had never worn &#34;flip-flops&#34; and had always thought that I didn't want to have rubbing between my toes. This never happened! There is wonderful arch support and they look really smart. Also so light in my pack. I have recommended these sandals to many people......even bought a pair for my husband!Jenn", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.086884186", "1": "0.24961077", "2": "0.063079886", "3": "0.23013249", "4": "0.2988904", "6": "0.06892969"}}
