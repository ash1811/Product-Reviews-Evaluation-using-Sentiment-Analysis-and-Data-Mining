{"text": "Well-designed, sturdy shoe for strenuous dance activity -- especially Zumba and Zumba-type moves. The arch support is superb, and the shoe really cradles the foot. Shoelaces allow for perfect fit, so the shoe conforms to the foot and supports it in the many directions it moves while dancing. The circular ridges/design in the sole, at the ball of the foot, promote easy, fluid turning, which is vital to Zumba dancing and a real plus with this shoe. (This design feature may not be obvious in the illustration of the shoe, unless you can see the sole, or bottom, of the shoe.) In all, this Bloch shoe does what it's supposed to do for a strenuous workout, and that makes dance activity especially rewarding.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09305468", "1": "0.07340676", "2": "0.21034351", "3": "0.23933014", "4": "0.18260129", "5": "0.10456264", "6": "0.09670093"}}
