{"text": "Great for riding a motorcycle, nice tough leather, very thick.  Zipper means you don't have to unlace your boot, and I am lazy so this was a must have for me.  It is a tight fit for my thick feet to do without unlacing, but doable so that is all that matters too me.  I haven't tested water resistance.Boot is comfortable and not overly hot after broken in, but definitely hotter than a standard tennis shoe.  Laces are too short, I could barely get them double knotted.  Build quality is good, but slightly messy looking, some strings hanging out slightly at the ends of the stitches, etc.  So I think they could definitely have better build quality, but zipper strength seems fine and stitching is good overall.Great traction on many surfaces, including slick tile, and sizing seems right on.  I wear a 10.5 extra wide, and the size fit perfectly.  The toe is a bit longer than it needs to be, but the arch is right where it should be and so is the width.  I will buy these again.  My older pair without the zipper lasted many years, but the finish didn't hold up well.  You can polish these if you want so it doesn't really matter.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10254292", "1": "0.27161312", "2": "0.23824507", "3": "0.099925466", "4": "0.058682553", "5": "0.12328257", "6": "0.10570831"}}
