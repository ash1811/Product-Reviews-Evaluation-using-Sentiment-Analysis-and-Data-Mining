{"text": "I'm noticing more and more garment makers are guilty of inconsistency in sizing. It's like jean makers assume we're all gut and no butt or waists. Same with bra designers. If I'm a 36C or a 38B it should be 36 inches or 38 inches along with the appropriate cup. But I'm convinced there is no standardization at all when it comes to something that has been treated and portrayed as being standard. I ordered mine (like this) on the Jockey site itself. It came made for a tween with A cups, when I ordered something more on the C end. Unless I used duct tape there was NO WAY I was going to fit a C into their so called 36C. It flattened me entirely and wouldn't even hook latch. They were no where NEAR one another to latch. The tag said 36C, I wear a 36C, so logic would argue it would fit. Alas, it didn't. This isn't the first negative bra encounter I've had with Jockey - they usually run smaller than they should which makes it very hard to order. The only good bras Jockey makes are sports bras. But if you normally wear a medium in them, go for a large. They run small too, but have great support. I would avoid purchasing any of their other bra-like products as they run especially smaller than they are supposed to.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20869677", "1": "0.3100395", "2": "0.12753977", "3": "0.093106166", "4": "0.18118358", "5": "0.07698976"}}
