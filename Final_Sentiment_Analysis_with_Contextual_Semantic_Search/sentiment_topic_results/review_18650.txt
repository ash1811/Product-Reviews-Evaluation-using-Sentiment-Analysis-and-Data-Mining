{"text": "When I go shooting outdoors all my gear is getting beat down by the sun and can get very hot, I use multiple items to cover up my gear from those camo burlap nets you get in wally world when hunting stuff goes on sale to sniper veils to Shemaghs.I use the Shemagh when I am shooting outdoors and it is super hot and the sun is beating down.  I will drape it over the my head and part of the rifle to help shield the sun.  This also helps with dust on very windy days so I am not eating a bunch of sand.I have not washed this particular one, but I have washed and dried a green version by a different company and be careful and just let it air dry do not use dryer or it will shrink and lose its shape.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.117598765", "1": "0.14665128", "2": "0.13768488", "3": "0.05430535", "4": "0.22529283", "5": "0.15983732", "6": "0.15862958"}}
