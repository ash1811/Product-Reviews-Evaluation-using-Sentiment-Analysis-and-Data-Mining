{"text": "I'm very happy with my Key Largo sunglasses.  I find them very comfortable.  Along with the Key Largos, I ordered a pair of Flying Fisherman Kingston sunglasses, and for some crazy reason, they made the ends of the temple arms on that model very pointy, so they actually cause discomfort when they're put on.  The Key Largos don't have that issue at all, and they are thin behind the ear.  I can't stand sunglasses that I can feel pushing my ears out the whole time I'm wearing them.I was hesitant to order amber lenses, but the lenses on these sunglasses aren't so yellow that it takes any getting used to.  Color vision isn't significantly altered when wearing them.With every other pair of sunglasses I've owned recently, I had to remove them to view LCD screens (gas pumps, ATMs, etcetera).  With the Key Largos, I've found that I can keep them on more often under such circumstances.The lenses are not on par with premium optics, but they're quite good for the price range.The rubber on the temples really helps keep them in place.  I put a tiny amount of silicone/Teflon lubricant on the hinges to make the temple arms move more easily.  I'm nuts like that.)I don't understand the extent to which people are complaining about the size of these sunglasses. I do not have a small head (I just measured my head and it's 23.0\" around at my forehead--which is a men's large hat size), and I have no problem with the Key Largo sunglasses. Sure they could be a bit bigger, but I never even had that thought before seeing the complaints here.As I write this I've been using them daily for seven months, and they've held up fine. I think they're great.  The price is just icing on the cake.  I ordered a second pair.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.28732118", "1": "0.25548923", "2": "0.14996259", "4": "0.12551224", "5": "0.05384828", "6": "0.12572418"}}
