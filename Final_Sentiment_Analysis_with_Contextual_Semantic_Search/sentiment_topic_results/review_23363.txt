{"text": "I was surprised when I received the shoes as I had thought that I had ordered Keen Sandals (somehow these were on the Keen page!).  I tried on and the size 7 fit a little large but doable.  The sole does not have the support that I might have wanted and is thinner than I am used to.  I am going to put an orthodic and think that will work as I really like the style.I would recommend the sandal to anyone but do NOT expect it to fit like Keen Shoes/sandals if that is what you are used to.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3593497", "2": "0.08291628", "3": "0.10931297", "4": "0.037932914", "5": "0.18312179", "6": "0.22410394"}}
