{"text": "I loved the Kenneth Cole watch I received for my birthday in April and the wallet is no different. It has a great style, easy to remove ID (so great for clubs and restaurants) and a removable photograph insert. The pockets have been a little stiff, so I haven't been able to utilize a couple inserts, but that is just a result of the quality leather. I am sure that after a couple months of use it will loosen up. I would buy another wallet from them in the future.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.25635687", "2": "0.31028032", "3": "0.09260725", "4": "0.038701482", "5": "0.11004325", "6": "0.18867703"}}
