{"text": "Having read the reviews, I had high hope for this shoe.  The fit is true to size and the shoe is lightweight.  However, it does not provide comfort for long term wear.  I tested it standing doing house chores for half an hour and my feet is tired.  So I bought insoles for the heel and bought an arch support which makes it more comfortable.  I think it is OK for short term wear but I like my Klogs better (but of course, you cannot exercise with Klogs shoes!).", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.0632816", "1": "0.117083944", "2": "0.12797008", "3": "0.2944565", "4": "0.11854828", "5": "0.1725852", "6": "0.10607433"}}
