{"text": "Great glasses that provide good visual acuity.  No distortion from the plastic lenses. I wish these had crystal clear glass lenses, but for plastic, I'm happy.  These stay on your head even when you sweat because the temples wrap-around the back of the ear. I'd like to see small nose pads on the to further assist the frames from remaining on a sweaty face, however.I got the real deal on Amazon; not a fake that others report in reviews.  Compared them to the same model in Sunglass Hut.The frame bottom being slightly rounded lets in a little light so if you are sensitive to the sun, this style may not be for you.  Interestingly, these look like Costco's Kirkland Signature glasses that cost under $30.  I wouldn't be surprised if Luxotica (Ray Ban Manufacturer) made the Kirkland Signatures.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13221131", "1": "0.09546113", "2": "0.14801426", "3": "0.19166858", "4": "0.2091174", "5": "0.1187077", "6": "0.10481964"}}
