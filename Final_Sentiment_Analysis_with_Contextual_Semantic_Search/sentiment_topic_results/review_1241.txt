{"text": "I used to buy Adissage sandals every two years because that's about as long as they lasted for me, just wearing them in the summer.  I'm a size 7 but in this style I could really use a 6.5, except they don't make half sizes.  So my feet would always look a little lost in them, but I'd tighten the strap to keep them on my feet and wear them at home and walking the dogs on fairly tough, hilly high desert terrain.  I liked the feel of the nubs, but inevitably they'd break off in big patches and the strap would start tearing off and I'd have to tape it closed.  And of course, the sole would be worn down and I'd be sliding down slopes.  Which meant it was time to buy another pair for the next year.But it looks like I won't be buying these sandals this year.  I've been pricing them on Amazon and other places online, and I think they're expensive for what you get and how long they last, and there's really not much of a selection.  I suspect there's a lot of snob appeal to these sandals and the company deliberately makes them a little hard to find.  So I'm going to break out of the pack and try a lesser known, more reasonably priced brand of massage sandals this year. I'm giving them 3 stars for sentimental reasons.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1622233", "1": "0.2082676", "2": "0.07052783", "3": "0.31065953", "4": "0.041430485", "5": "0.1307512", "6": "0.0761401"}}
