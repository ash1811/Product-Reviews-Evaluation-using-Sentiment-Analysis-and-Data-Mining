{"text": "Not pathetic \"criminal\" is the sizing of these. I returned a so-called LargeSize they were skin tight. It was pathetic how small they were. And even worse these are called rain pants, implying to be worn over something. Also you don't want this material next to skin. Absolutely few features and PEG legs? One very deep pocket in back that goes to your knees. SNAPS? Velcro has been around for over 30 years. I'm going to try one more in XL only because they are rip-stop and gtex-like water-proof? Maybe, that remains to be seen.UPDATE: Got the XL size. They barely fit and the GROSSLY SHORT TINY BUNGEE in the waistband cuts into you. I replace it with an oval shoe string. Probably one of those \"job creators\" importing these from China to give themself a job and too lazy to even check out the products they sell. I might add that if you expected to ride a bike with these, buy the time you get a pair that fits they are going to be way to long.This seller should at least provide a DECENT DESCRIPTION. These are emergency rain pants at best. I only kept them because I need just that, something to wear if I need to use my electric scooter in rain.THEY LOOK NOTHING LIKE TO PICTURE. THEY COME CRINKLED UP IN A WAD THAT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING YOU WOULD THROW IN THE TRASH. THE CRINKLES DON'T COME OUT.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09713255", "1": "0.1897067", "2": "0.15488617", "3": "0.1711641", "4": "0.09617133", "5": "0.08081184", "6": "0.21012735"}}
