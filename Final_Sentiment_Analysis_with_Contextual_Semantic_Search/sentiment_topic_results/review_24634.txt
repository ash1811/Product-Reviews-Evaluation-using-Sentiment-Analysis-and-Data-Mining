{"text": "I bought some leotard at a local department store a few days before my daughter started her first dance class. I got the right size and figured that was all there was to it. A few months ago I talked with someone who had a daughter in my daughter's dance class. Her daughter loved the leotards that she had. I bought these and my daughter loves them. They don't itch like the other leotards that I had first bought her. And they fit better. It took me sometime but now I know what to look for when I need to buy dance class leotards!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08142244", "1": "0.18558538", "2": "0.08815679", "3": "0.2621429", "5": "0.15000008", "6": "0.22982904"}}
