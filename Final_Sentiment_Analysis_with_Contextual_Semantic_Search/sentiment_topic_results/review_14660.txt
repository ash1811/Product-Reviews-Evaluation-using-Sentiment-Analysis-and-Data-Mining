{"text": "I am a Panache fan, apparently the Brits know how to make a quality bra that lasts more than 6 months. UK and US sizes are different, go to barenecessities.com to check a size chart. US I wear a 36G, in UK a 36F. (H is FF) The band doesn't seem like the fabric will hold you up but it does, and comfortably. 3 row, 2 hooks. Hools on first for first wear, after a day of rest, go to the second row. The way the bra looks on the model is how it should fit on you. You are not wearing a large enough cup size if the center of the bra doesn't rest on your breast bone.Other Panache Porcelain bras I have are now hitting the one year mark and am  still using the last two rows of hooks. I top load machine wash cold on gentle cycle with the bras stacked in a loungerie bag, hang to dry, NEVER put your bras in the dryer, the heat breaks down the fabric. At $50 a pop the dryer isn't worth having a bra last you only 6 months. Hand wash or hand wash cycle in a front loader without the bag is okay too.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22668822", "1": "0.10500961", "2": "0.07497839", "3": "0.21939866", "4": "0.029301848", "5": "0.18630861", "6": "0.15831466"}}
