{"text": "This is advertised as cotton, but it's actually half cotton and half polyester.  It feels more like polyester to me, not like a natural fabric.  I usually wear an XS/S and purchased a L due to review AND my own experience with Bella.  In the past for the Bella Vintage Helena Tank a L was the correct size.  In the Raglan Tee Shirt it was huge.  I'd go with a S or M if the polyester didn't bother me.  The fit is kind of unflattering and boxy&#8212;like a boy's top.  Not impressed.
