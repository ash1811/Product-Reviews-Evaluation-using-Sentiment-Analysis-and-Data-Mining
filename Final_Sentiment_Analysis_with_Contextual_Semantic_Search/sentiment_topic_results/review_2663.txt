{"text": "I love purple and thought this dress would be nice to wear around the house and not be embarrassed to open the door to the mailman, neighbors, etc.  The color and fabric were pretty but it hung like a sack on me in certain places and tight in others.  Nothing flattering about it for my size and shape (overweight with belly).  I returned the dress and quickly received a refund.  No hassles, which was appreciated.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08821605", "1": "0.40418965", "2": "0.0684569", "3": "0.27916464", "5": "0.09416799", "6": "0.062129576"}}
