{"text": "I was so glad when these finally arrived, but I couldn't keep them.  :(  I don't know how folks do it, but these were  impossible for me to get closed right.  I bought them to go in my top piercing (cartilage) and they were the perfect size and so cute and dainty.  I was so determined to get them in, but it just wasn't happening.  The rod kept going just to the outside of the earring hole, never straight into it.  Near miss each and every time and it was so hard to see the back of my ear. lol. I even tried what one reviewer suggested, putting them in from the back first, nope.  I got so frustrated and my ear was so sore by then, I had had enough.  If you can get these in and closed on the first try, I highly commend you! :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20812392", "1": "0.1937951", "2": "0.072603166", "3": "0.10736318", "4": "0.084275894", "5": "0.15239419", "6": "0.18144457"}}
