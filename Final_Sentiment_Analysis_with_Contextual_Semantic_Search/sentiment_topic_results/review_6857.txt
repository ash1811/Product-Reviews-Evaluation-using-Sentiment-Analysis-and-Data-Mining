{"text": "This is a quality made shoe horn.  The golf-style grip allows for a secure grip, and the handle and horn are made of quality metal.  The horn is spring loaded, and can be a little tricky to use at first, but works well once you get comfortable with it.  I think this tool would be better, however, with a longer handle.  Another 3-4 inches would make it less awkward to use, as you wouldn't have to depend as much on your flexibility and balance to reach your shoe.  Still, a decent product.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03924516", "1": "0.34147218", "2": "0.15277989", "3": "0.15953225", "4": "0.1434822", "5": "0.08356651", "6": "0.079921834"}}
