{"text": "I ordered a 3 based on reviews that the shoe ran big. I ordered these when the weather was still hot, so by the time I tried them on him and realized they were too small it was too late to return them. I'm so disappointed! I don't know that I will risk ordering these again online, but if I could find them in a store I would buy them. They are REALLY nice and good quality. I would recommend them, just be sure you know the right size.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.5045118", "2": "0.1513337", "3": "0.24264976", "4": "0.06599645", "6": "0.028683938"}}
