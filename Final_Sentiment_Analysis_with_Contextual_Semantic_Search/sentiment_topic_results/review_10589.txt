{"text": "June 15, 2012 UPDATE:With almost 2 years behind me with these pants they still look and wear as well as the first time.  A whole gang of us went to a local watering hole last night for dinner and stuff.  After sitting for over two hours another guest commented how my pants did NOT have any wrinkles and looked as if I just arrived instead of just leaving.  Now, it is time to look for more of the same.For many years Haggar have been among my favorite casual slacks just because they fit well and lasted a sufficient amount of time.  Then the markets appeared to change and I did not need slacks much more anymore.  I saw these and made one of those purchases we all are told not to do.  If it were for a few dead myleum cells I could remember the name of what it is that I should not do but alas...  Regardless they fit perfectly, look good by hiding a lot of damage brought about by old age and do not wrinkle at all.  When they arrived in the Amazon plastic inside the box I planned to take them to the cleaners for a press and wash but no they unfolded and with a few hours on a hangar they were ready to wear.  Now that's the way it should be.  Because they are not blue jeans they fit and feel better than jeans.  Just the old man in me.Bottom Line:  Great casual slacks for those less than formal times and well worth the consideration.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.22579446", "1": "0.3118131", "2": "0.16925007", "3": "0.06852677", "4": "0.06315231", "5": "0.058707856", "6": "0.102755465"}}
