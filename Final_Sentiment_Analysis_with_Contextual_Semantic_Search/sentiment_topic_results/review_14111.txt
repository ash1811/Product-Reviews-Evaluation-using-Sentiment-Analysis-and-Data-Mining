{"text": "I put this on the day it came and haven't taken it off yet!  I like the look...simple and sparkles just a little due to the twist in the chain.  It was just what I wanted.  It looks good with an additional bracelet if wanted as it fits snug to the ankle but not too tight for me.  I have trouble with sizes and this one \"just fits\".  I'm not sure how long it will last wearing it non-stop but so far so good!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13628273", "1": "0.25358433", "2": "0.2385", "4": "0.112069145", "5": "0.16790259", "6": "0.08777848"}}
