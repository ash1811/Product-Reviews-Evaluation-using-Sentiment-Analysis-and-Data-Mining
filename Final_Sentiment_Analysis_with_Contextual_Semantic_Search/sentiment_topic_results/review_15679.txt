{"text": "In my quest for perfect underwear: (thong, trunks, boxers, briefs, whatever) these are better than good but not spectacular.The fabric is super soft and comfortable.

There is something of a front pouch but it is not that well defined and does not proved nearly the support I was hoping for.
