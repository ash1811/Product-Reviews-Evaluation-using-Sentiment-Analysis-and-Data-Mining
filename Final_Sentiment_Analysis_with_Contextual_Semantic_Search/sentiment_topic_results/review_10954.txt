{"text": "I've worn this bra at least 20 times so far and the adhesive is still as good as new with careful cleaning.  I just use liquid dish soap and lukewarm water.  The next one I order will be a cup size larger than my normal size though.  The cup size that corresponds to my own is just small enough to give a slight \"bullet\" looking effect.  A larger cup will look more naturally rounded I think.  Overall I am very pleased however, the quality is great.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13751039", "1": "0.1567304", "2": "0.20107557", "3": "0.2642956", "4": "0.12634324", "6": "0.111169435"}}
