{"text": "I bought these slippers for a family member with flat feet. Finding slippers that are wide enough is always a problem...especially well made ones. These are very handsome slippers and seem to be well made. The heel is a little loose for him, but that is an ongoing problem with any slip on that is wide enough at the head of the shoe. I would definitely recommend these slippers.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10805098", "1": "0.42589134", "2": "0.20374273", "4": "0.050232723", "6": "0.20409757"}}
