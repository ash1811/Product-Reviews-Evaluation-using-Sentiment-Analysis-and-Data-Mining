{"text": "This is an absolutely fantastic looking watch.  Just look at the pictures.  What you can't see from the pictures is how cool the hands move as you stop and reset the stopwatch(this is my first chronograph).  The way the hour and minute hands glow slightly in the dark also is attractive.  My one little annoyance is the 'T' logo on the bracket clasp.  It is much more obvious in real life than in the sample picture and I think it is too much branding like a logo on a polo shirt.  But I don't have to look at it while checking the time - then I just notice how amazing my watch looks.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09355828", "1": "0.34627965", "2": "0.15798752", "4": "0.19686845", "5": "0.08178154", "6": "0.12087077"}}
