{"text": "I had been buying mostly Nike's for years with an occasional other brand. I switched to these Skechers Sport sneakers about 5-6 years ago on the advice of my daughter, and I'm sold on them. The thing I like about them most is that as comfortable and supportive as they are when they are new, the comfort and support seems to continue until the shoe finally wears out or to the point of just looking old and wanting to replace them. I have yet to completely wear out a pair of these, and I'm tough on sneakers. I just bought my third pair in a row, and as long as they continue making these Sports - I'll be buying them.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11743497", "1": "0.26332387", "2": "0.101742566", "3": "0.2967629", "5": "0.07998936", "6": "0.13817777"}}
