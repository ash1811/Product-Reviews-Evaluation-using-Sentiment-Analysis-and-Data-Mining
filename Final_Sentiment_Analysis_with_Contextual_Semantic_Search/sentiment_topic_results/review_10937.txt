{"text": "RETURNING WITH GREAT JOY ABOUT GETTING MY MONEY BACK!Note my reviews: I do not normally pan a product and try to look for the good, but...Ordered with high hopes -- in \"D\" cup size. If this is a \"D\", I would hate to see the smaller sizes. These barely covered a portion of a breast; ladies, you'll be better off with petals just to take care of \"headlights\". There is no lift whatsoever and no way to make any \"lift\" for your twins. Removing them is PAINFUL (yes, I know how to follow directions).To be fair: if you need cleavage, and are VERY small, these would likely work quite well if you could get them positioned correctly prior to snapping the two separate cups together.SUMMARY: pointless for larger than a \"B\" cup. Actually, they're horrible and a waste of time/money.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11020572", "1": "0.21201807", "2": "0.044053484", "3": "0.21732822", "4": "0.15924093", "5": "0.19000639", "6": "0.0671472"}}
