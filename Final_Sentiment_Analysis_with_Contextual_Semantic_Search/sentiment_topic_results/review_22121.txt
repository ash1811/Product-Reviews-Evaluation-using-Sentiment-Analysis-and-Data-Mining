{"text": "A great set of liners!The good:Add a lot of warmth. Helpful by themselves for people with Raynaud's or other profusion problems.Elastic cuffs, so they don't come off inadvertently.Comfortable.Some stretch (easy to get on and off).Work on touch pads and screens.Slick.The bad:Silk shows stains and is difficult to clean.  The natural is worse than the black.Snag relatively easily.The ugly:Limited stretch (you need to hit the size).My hands fall between a small and a medium--yours may also.Silk liners tend to wear rapidly compared to other materials.  I'll post information on durability when I've used them for awhile.Slick may not be suitable by themselves for some things (driving).If you only ever use these with outer gloves then I'd give then 5 stars;If you frequently use them by them selves than 4 stars.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05183084", "1": "0.3723181", "2": "0.082695656", "3": "0.15409707", "4": "0.14179382", "5": "0.14630568", "6": "0.050958868"}}
