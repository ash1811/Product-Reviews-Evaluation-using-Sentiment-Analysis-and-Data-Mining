{"text": "I have very mixed feelings about these shoes. I adore the fact that the toe section of the trainers are large and roomy, the first for me! I like that i have plenty of room in the front. It's really the back of the shoe that has knocked off a star on this review. As much as i love these shoes, the heel is just horrendous. It took me approximately a month to really break in the heels. Everything else was comfortable from the get go and oddly enough the left shoe took longer to break in than the right shoe, it didn't rub as badly on the Achilles heel. But all in all, now that it's broken in, it's brilliant.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.083037466", "1": "0.24375553", "2": "0.2160932", "3": "0.21920662", "4": "0.08877824", "5": "0.12374736", "6": "0.025381608"}}
