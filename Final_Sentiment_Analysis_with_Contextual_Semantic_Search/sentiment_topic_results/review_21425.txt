{"text": "This is the first time I've brought this brand of slipper and I wasn't sure what to expect. In the past, I would go to me local discount store and get a pair. These were fairly in-expensive cloth type with very thin rubber soles but they were comfortable and worked for me. I had been wanting to try this slipper since I noticed it on Amazon. It looked just like what I might need for my next pair. When I noted my latest pair was wearing out I decided to get these to see. I have been very pleasantly surprised! These slippers have a much thicker sole and are so confortable to wear that I might have to stick with them. They feel much more comfortable than the ones I have been getting, and they are really easier on my feet. I have trouble finding slippers to fit as I have a sort of wide left foot and if you don't buy for it, you find the slippers are to tight. (I have to get 13s to fit the left foot and it seems the right foot sometimes can be to big.) In this case, I shouldn't have worried. These fit great! One word about them. They have a form type feel to them as you walk and that could cause some trouble. Overall, great slippers!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.2804936", "2": "0.05089303", "3": "0.27025035", "4": "0.10838823", "5": "0.06920951", "6": "0.21819678"}}
