{"text": "I bought this pouch to carry my PSK (personal survival kit) for when I'm out hiking, etc. My PSK is 7\" x 4\" x 1-1/2\" in a plastic pouch and easily slips inside the main compartment of this pouch with room leftover for even more gear. The belt loop on the back will accommodate a 2\" belt. The material seems durable. My only concern is the latching system- on the old true military ammo pouches the latches were metal but on the pouch I purchased the latches are plastic. They do seem heavy duty and I've had no problems so far.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.25440094", "1": "0.201039", "2": "0.16311489", "3": "0.12023287", "4": "0.18997107", "6": "0.0687729"}}
