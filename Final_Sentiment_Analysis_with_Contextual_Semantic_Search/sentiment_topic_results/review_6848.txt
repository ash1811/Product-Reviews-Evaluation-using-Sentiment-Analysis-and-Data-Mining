{"text": "I just purchased these very well made jeans for my son after his latest pair of Levi's tore...again.  He is very picky about his jeans so I was quite worried when ordering but since I ordered from Amazon I figured returns were so easy that it was worth the try.  Well, needless to say, they aren't going to be returned.  He loves them and I just ordered more!  Great product.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04676839", "1": "0.29579833", "2": "0.054901835", "3": "0.16344656", "4": "0.072163", "5": "0.17630313", "6": "0.19061875"}}
