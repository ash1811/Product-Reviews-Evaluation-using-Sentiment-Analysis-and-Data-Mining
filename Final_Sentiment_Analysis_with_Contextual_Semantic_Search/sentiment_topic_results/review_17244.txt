{"text": "My original pair of Camp Mocs was a size 9 medium and they were a bit too tight but wearable. I needed slightly longer and wider shoes. So, when I decided to get another pair I ordered a size 9.5  medium. When they arrived I was shocked to find that they were now much TOO BIG !  A half size change and my feet are now swimming in these mocs.I sent them back and didn't request another size because, frankly, I'm not sure what size to order.These are wonderful moccasins but, unfortunately, I can't seem to get past the sizing issues.  So, I've deducted one star because it seems I'm not the only one who experienced size discrepancies.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.062196404", "1": "0.28046376", "2": "0.13273071", "3": "0.3209331", "4": "0.08654472", "5": "0.039321452", "6": "0.07780986"}}
