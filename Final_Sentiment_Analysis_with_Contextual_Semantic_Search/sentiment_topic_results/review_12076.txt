{"text": "I've actually bought 6 pair of these and for the first time I could buy jeans in close to my actual size that fit.  I usually have to go up 2 sizes to accommodate my thighs without having to go super baggy.  The jeans pictured are actually the relaxed fit though, these jeans are actually baggier than the jeans pictured.  If you don't like a baggier fit I recommend the relaxed fit. They fit and feel great and the price is excellent, previous jeans I bought were $50 + and I still had to have them tailored. I will continue to buy these and highly recommend them", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.089115895", "1": "0.32208705", "2": "0.028802417", "3": "0.10298871", "4": "0.099889204", "5": "0.27788195", "6": "0.07923476"}}
