{"text": "This is a stylish watch; it looks very delicate, and at the same time it's very easy to read (it has the numbers)  The big plus for me:  it has a second hand.  Most of the nice watches I saw were missing the second hand, until I found this one.  The bracelet has two colors which goes with all the outfits.  The bracelet comes long, but it's very easy to adjust (my husband did it).  I used to have a Bulova Caravelle (same size, with second hand), and this new Bulova it's a perfect replacement!  Highly recommend it.  And Amazon delivered it very fast!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.046769515", "1": "0.35307422", "2": "0.27923128", "3": "0.125531", "4": "0.14707893", "6": "0.04561178"}}
