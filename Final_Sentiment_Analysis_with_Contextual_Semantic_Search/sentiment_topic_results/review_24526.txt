{"text": "Hush Puppies are not sold as \"diabetic\" shoes but thes are one of three pairs of shoes I have currently that I can wear all day long. The other two pairs are far more expensive Orthofeet brand shoes.  And I have a completely worn out pair of New Balance walking shoes that are comfortable.The HP's are lightweight and they don't sweat my feet.  For anyone not aware of diabetic problems, your feet often feel either hot or cold but may feel the opposite when you touch them. It's a very odd sensation and good shoes and keep on moving helps...but, as an office bound worker I am often \"stuck\" at a desk for hours at a time. This is when I appreciate the Hush Puppies.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06685211", "1": "0.10566201", "2": "0.21333602", "3": "0.32570156", "4": "0.16978472", "5": "0.06758753", "6": "0.05107609"}}
