{"text": "I originally ordered this in an XL because that's what I normally wear but it was HUGE, like a tent. So I sent it back and got a Large. It fits better but it is still a tad too big. However I wouldn't order a medium because that would likely be too small. Never had that problem with a shirt before, I don't think there would be a size that fits just right.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.122360274", "1": "0.39981952", "3": "0.21251324", "4": "0.04135959", "6": "0.21551494"}}
