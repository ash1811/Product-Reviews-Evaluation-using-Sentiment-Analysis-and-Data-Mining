{"text": "I've had this Ironman watch for approximately 10 years. So why am I compelled to write a review now?Because I just received a superior service from Timex that warrants a write-up.After 10 years of faithful service the wrist band on this watch came off on one side.I looked up where I can find a replacement and found that Timex will replace the band on its watches for free.I called the 800 number and sure enough, they told me to package it up, write a note that it is for band replacementonly, told me to enclose a check for a very modest shipping cost to send it back to me.This was four weeks ago, and my watch just arrived back in superio shape.  New band, and the back looks shinier. Lookslike they cleaned its exterior as well.I owned several Timex watches in the past, but this one has been my favorite.1) I like the nice clear large display.  Easy to see even with  my now presbyopic eyes.2) Setting the watch is easy without a manual3) There is enough useful features, but not so many that the it makes it too complex to do simple things4) Even though it is a men's watch I a female who wear is and I don't find it heavy or bulky5) I like the plastic watch band. My previous Timex had a Velcro band and eventually it picked up a lot of lint it did notclose well. And now that I found that Timex will replace it for a cost of shipping it back, I am even more pleased with it.6) The battery lasts a reasonable time, I have to replace it every 2-3 years. Not often enough to be annoying.  Thebattery in my \"dressed-up\" watch lasts only a year.I am very pleased with the watch, and now extremely pleased with the service as well.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.20324431", "1": "0.069562726", "2": "0.18152156", "3": "0.105720356", "4": "0.23940983", "5": "0.08912892", "6": "0.111412264"}}
