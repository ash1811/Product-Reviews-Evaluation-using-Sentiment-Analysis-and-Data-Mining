{"text": "This watch is very good except for the strap which could have been better. It has a good big dial and the back light is really good. The big dial is best suited for Men.It has dual time mode for checking two different timezones however that take about 3 presses of the buttons before you can see the other timezone. It is easy to change date values. The only qualm I have with this watch is that it's strap is a little poky on the edges. A little better strap could make is a really good watch.Comparison with A158 series watch -I like the A158 series watch a little better than this, I own both. The A158 series watch strap is a lot of comfortable and has a brushed finish to it. However the A158 watch dial is smaller and may look unisex.If you don't want the unisex look for A158 watch and wouldn't mind replacing this strap with a more comfortable one. This is the best vintage digital looking watch out there. It is worth the money.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11445537", "1": "0.29651675", "2": "0.36227143", "3": "0.11400744", "6": "0.10846715"}}
