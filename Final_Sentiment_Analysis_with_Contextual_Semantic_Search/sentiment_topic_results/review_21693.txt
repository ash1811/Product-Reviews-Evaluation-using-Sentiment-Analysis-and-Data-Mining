{"text": "I purchased these for my sis-in-law for Christmas this year, and she LOVED them.It's a little hard to tell from the picture, but the overall length from top of curve of the wire to the bottom of the drop is 1\".  The filigree oval dangle part is just under 1/2\" long, and just over 1/3\" wide.  They're delicate, but not so delicate that they can't be seen.The presentation is nice, too: they come in a little velvet drawstring bag inside a nice cardboard jewelry box, both in navy blue.  The quality of the workmanship is excellent -- these look more expensive than they are.I may purchase a pair for myself, I liked them that much.  Very nice, indeed.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09362539", "1": "0.4313301", "2": "0.09373952", "3": "0.13387452", "4": "0.0713348", "5": "0.069886334", "6": "0.10620934"}}
