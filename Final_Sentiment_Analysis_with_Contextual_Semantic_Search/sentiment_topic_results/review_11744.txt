{"text": "First and foremost, these shoes are cute.  They come in a variety of colors with black as the base.  I bought the purple.  Although I bought the larger size, they are snug around the ankle and stay on well.  They also rinse out well and dry faster than my previous water shoes.  All and all I like them very much and would buy them again just a smaller size.  I do Aqua Bootcamp so my water shoes get a work out.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08219936", "1": "0.2730995", "2": "0.21035358", "3": "0.20439474", "4": "0.14085878", "6": "0.085682355"}}
