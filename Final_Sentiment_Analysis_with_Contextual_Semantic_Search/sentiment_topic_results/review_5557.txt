{"text": "My 3yr old loved this tutu skirt in pink! Was hoping to order more in different colors.She had hardly used this,the stitching came apart in 2weeks.now it's lying in her closet..Altogether she wore it like 4-5 times for 20 mins or so.wish the stitching was of better quality to hold up while little ones wear it. Can't recommend.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.23604102", "2": "0.2826401", "3": "0.037013236", "5": "0.28725898", "6": "0.14928477"}}
