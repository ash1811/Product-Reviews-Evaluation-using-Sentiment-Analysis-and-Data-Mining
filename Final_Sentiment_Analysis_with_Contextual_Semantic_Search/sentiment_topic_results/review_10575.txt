{"text": "I have a brown pair I bought last year and loved them so much I decided to order a black pair to wear when I ride my motorcycle.  They come in wide sizes so a great fit is easy.  They are high enough to give you super ankle support and yet not so high that they are uncomfortable or restrict ankle movement.  They are waterproof as proven in my recent all day ride in the rain. I plan to replace  the laces with heavier duty ones as the original  wear out easily due to the quick lace grommets have somewhat  abrasive edges.  These are probably the most comfortable footwear I have and I own  Merrell, New Balance, Borns and other high comfort shoes.  I do recommend adding heavy duty laces and a pair of Sof Sole Men's Airr Lightweight Insole Shoe insoles to make the fit even PERFECT!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07811094", "1": "0.2956676", "2": "0.14845783", "3": "0.2552386", "4": "0.059175253", "5": "0.1394914", "6": "0.023858408"}}
