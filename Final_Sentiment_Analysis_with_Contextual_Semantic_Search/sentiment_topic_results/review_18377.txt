{"text": "THE WATCH -- Bless titanium's little heart. I have several Eco-Drive watches and they're a little on the heavy side in steel. Titanium brings them back into the range of lightweight comfort. Not in the thin-dress-watch range, but manageable. And the watch is thin enough to allow shirt cuffs to slide over. I rarely nitpick relatively inexpensive watches over this issue, but I'm delighted that my example has a second hand that hits the seconds dial right on the money. I usually can find something else about which to complain, but this is a pretty slick little unit. It arrived fully charged, displayed the correct date, and was a few seconds ahead of PST. I set it to EST and I was in business immediately.THE BAND -- As others have noted, the band is not only light weight but seems inexpensively constructed. After I removed several links the watch fits perfectly and is very comfortable. Please keep in mind that this is a \"beater\" for an office environment and not a \"beater\" for a construction site. For my purposes it seems quite satisfactory.A PERSPECTIVE -- If I had paid the $250 retail for this watch (and that never would have happened), I might have been disappointed with the band and perhaps even with the watch. However, if one will shop this watch he will find a 50%+ discount as I did. With its tasteful, attractive appearance, I believe that this is a wonderful value for the discounted price.I'm looking forward to many years of service from this watch. Good luck with your purchase. --RonUPDATE 01-22-2011: This is undoubtedly the best combination of comfort to wear and value that I have ever purchased in an everyday-wear timepiece. --Ron", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.070025206", "1": "0.22044897", "2": "0.14507535", "3": "0.11801044", "4": "0.09752951", "5": "0.17219178", "6": "0.17671879"}}
