{"text": "For what you pay for this bra, you'd think the straps would be adjustable or the size would at least run true. Or maybe, just maybe, the cups wouldn't roll outwards, making it impossible to wear this item even under a sweater without your cup outlines showing.Sadly, none of these are true. I ordered my same bra size. Not only is the chest too big, the cups are very thick and, as noted, tend to roll outwards--which means less coverage and support.Even the shoulder straps are NONadjustable, and they are HUGE. See the photo? They're easily pulled up that high. A stretchy bra is an ineffective bra. You will be nouncing all over the place in this doozy of an item as you move, ever closer, towards having what Sharon Osbourne calls \"National Geographic boobs.\" All this, just to make slightly less apparent the back of your bra showing through your shirt? No way.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.1869916", "2": "0.13663633", "3": "0.30151972", "4": "0.06775481", "5": "0.07879338", "6": "0.22598934"}}
