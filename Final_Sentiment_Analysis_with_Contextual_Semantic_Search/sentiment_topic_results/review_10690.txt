{"text": "This boot is exactly what I was looking for in both style and substance. Quality made, good materials, and the waterproofing seems to be working just fine. Comfortable with good support. They are a great boot to wear indoors and out. The only reason I wouldn't give these a five star rating is because they take a while to break in....maybe a little too long. But I will say they were worth the wait....and worth the price, which I thought was pretty reasonable when compared to similar boots.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11089142", "1": "0.46262762", "2": "0.022646664", "3": "0.055594105", "4": "0.25735322", "6": "0.08755631"}}
