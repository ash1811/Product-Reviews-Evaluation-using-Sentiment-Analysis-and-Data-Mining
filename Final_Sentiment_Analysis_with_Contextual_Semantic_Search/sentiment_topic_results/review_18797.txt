{"text": "I got the mirror gradient. Gotta agree with one review that called them fragile. Im not too active in them at all but feel I need to be extra careful or they'll snap in two. Taking care of them isn't very difficult though so that isn't much of an issue anyway.Very nice, expensive feeling shades that would look great on almost anybody. They seem a little dark when I wear them say inside the grocery store, but you're not supposed to wear them indoors anyway are you? I'm sure they're real Ray-Bans, they're priced well, and a nice change from the Oakley space pilot looking shades that I used to wear. Im very happy with my purchase.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04604003", "1": "0.20321201", "2": "0.10121394", "3": "0.25750828", "4": "0.25860482", "5": "0.04729995", "6": "0.086120956"}}
