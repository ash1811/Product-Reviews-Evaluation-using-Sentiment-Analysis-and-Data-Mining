{"text": "my husband loves this thermal crew neck so soft and warm on these cold days. It came the package just like the photo shows. it was soft and kinda thin for a thermal but other than that it was just the right size. it fits nicely under his shirt. It keeps him very warm. If you live in were it gets really cold i would buy this. We live in the south (Arkansas) and it has gotten pretty cold here(12 degrees) and  my husband weres this outside under his long sleeve shirt and a jacket and he is always warm.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.23842534", "1": "0.30938923", "2": "0.09207136", "3": "0.2117305", "4": "0.14264731"}}
