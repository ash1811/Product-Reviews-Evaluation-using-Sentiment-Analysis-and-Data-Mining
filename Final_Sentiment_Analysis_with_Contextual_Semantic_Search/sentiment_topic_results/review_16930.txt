{"text": "I'm a big guy and i am tall and no matter how long I get my shirts I still get that damn Plumber's Butt!! So I decided to go with a pair of these overalls and I will say I am glad I did!!! They are very comfy and look great!! They fit a little long in the inseam so if you wear a 32 get a 30. I purchased a 32 and have to roll up the bottoms a litte so they won't drag. No more Plumber's butt for me!! And they are made in the USA!!
