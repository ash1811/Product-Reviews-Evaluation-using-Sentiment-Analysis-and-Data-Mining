{"text": "Bought this for my husband.  It's a fantastic looking watch.  I work with a lot of men who have very high-end versions of this watch (Rolex, Omega) - I knew I wanted the look without the huge price tag and this watch delivered.  My husband loves it.  Gave it 4 stars since it's new so I can't speak to how well it holds up yet.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0708587", "1": "0.27363402", "2": "0.24329716", "3": "0.16927011", "4": "0.23494226"}}
