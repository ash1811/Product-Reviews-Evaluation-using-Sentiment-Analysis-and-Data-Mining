{"text": "My 15 month old daughter measures at about a 5.5.  I bought her the size 7 instead of 6.  I wondered if she'd fall over herself because they were too big, but she walks very nicely in the size 7.  I'm not saying they run small - there's still plenty of room.  But if I'm going to spend $100 on a boot for a baby, it better last the whole season.  So I went up a size and it's still stable enough where she doesn't seem bothered.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14101939", "1": "0.35695302", "2": "0.058449265", "3": "0.2810582", "4": "0.15614858"}}
