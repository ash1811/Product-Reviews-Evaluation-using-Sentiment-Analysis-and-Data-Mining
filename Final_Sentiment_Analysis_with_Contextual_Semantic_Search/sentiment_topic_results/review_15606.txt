{"text": "My son just turned four and LOVES superman.  He was so excited when we got this costume!  Overall, it's pretty cute.  He says he feels super strong with the built-in muslces, and has been running all over the house saving the day.Pros:  It seems fairly well made.  My son has been wearing it around the house for a few days now, and I see no seem issues.Cons:  The sizing is a little off in our case.  My son is tall for his age, and though this costume says small is for four to six year olds, there are a couple of inches hanging off of the boots - seems way too big for a four year old.  The cape is also a little uncomfortable, as the weight drags it back against my son's neck.  While running around the house I see him pulling at it frequently, but he doesn't want to take off his superhero cape!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.28722546", "1": "0.16630448", "3": "0.15076786", "4": "0.107409514", "5": "0.1023797", "6": "0.18351574"}}
