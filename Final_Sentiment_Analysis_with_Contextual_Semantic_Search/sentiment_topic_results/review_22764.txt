{"text": "First, you've got a REAL thing, CORAL, not plastic.  I love the certain sound all three of these bracelets makes around my wrist;  a solid sound. Also, being real, they have a tad weight to them.  I dared order all three bracelets upfront, keeping my fingers crossed.  I'm very happy i dared!  They are truly beautiful, deep red in color, goes with anyting I wear (I wear these bracelets along with my 18k narrow bangles; they are perfect altogether :). Perfect fit for my 6 & 1/2 wrist size.  Also, quality is excellent in strong stretch elastic (been wearing these since Christmas 2010; and I'm an active lady and these have not snapped; I wait not :)). I'm also a fan of Silverspeck.  They are prompt in delivery (arrived before Christmas 2010; inspite of my ordering late, 12/19th!  Also, I love that these 3 bracelets came in separate velvet pouches (ideal to gift separately, if you choose).  Thank you Silverspeck, and thanks Amazon for screening your vendors :)  Happy 2011 to everyone.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.094062", "1": "0.24469984", "2": "0.09552272", "3": "0.14945127", "4": "0.29760164", "5": "0.02980721", "6": "0.0888553"}}
