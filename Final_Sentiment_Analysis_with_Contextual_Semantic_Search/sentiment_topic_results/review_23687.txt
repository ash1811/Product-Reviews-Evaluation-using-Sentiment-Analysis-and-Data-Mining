{"text": "First of all, I am an avid Amazon shopper, but I'm pretty sure that this is the first review I was compelled to write.  I got these boots a couple of weeks ago and I absolutely LOVE them!! If ONLY Bearpaw was able to keep up with the demand and had enough of these in size 9 rust or chestnut!!  I'd gladly get another pair...  Alas!Regarding the feathers -- they look very cute, but do shed a little.  I don't find this to be so terrible, since there are enough on the boots to last a long time.  Two [small] downsides: 1) the opening IS a bit narrow.  I don't have wide calves, but it IS a bit of a tight squeeze.  I personally don't mind this because I'd rather have a tight-fitting boot than boots full of snow, come winter.  I'd suggest you get either narrow jeans or wear these with thick stockings, or something.  2) Do not wear these without socks; at least not the black ones.  There will be some dye residue on your soles, if you do that. (Speaking from experience here.These boots look and feel VERY durable.  I am not sure how they will do with all the salt/deicing chemicals that are sprinkled on the sidewalks during winter, but the soles are thick, strong, and WELL-ATTACHED, which is very, very important.Finally, I thought it funny that someone wrote that their dog was afraid of the boots... :-) :-) :-)  Until my own dog freaked out looking at my pair standing by the door.  I had to \"introduce\" them by pulling my medium-sized, beagle/hound mix coward out from under the dining room table and holding her by her collar while sloooowly bringing the boots up to her nose.All in all, I recommend these highly.  They're a great buy, especially for this very modest price.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12321091", "1": "0.18190387", "2": "0.05604086", "3": "0.33120966", "4": "0.17212328", "6": "0.13307147"}}
