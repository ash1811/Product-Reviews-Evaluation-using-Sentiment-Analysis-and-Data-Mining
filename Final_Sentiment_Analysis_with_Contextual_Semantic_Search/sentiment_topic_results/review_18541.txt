{"text": "I ordered the 9Medium in black. they are beautifully made, very classy looking without seeming overly pointy or so shiny that you can see your reflection in them or light up a room. but they do have a nice satin sheen to them so they do look really nice.  They can easily go from suit to slacks or even some nice higher end jeans and still look great if dressed accordingly so they can get a lot of use.  i bought these to go along with a kenneth cole reaction suit separates in black and cannot wait to see them all together on my friend who i bought them for :  the fit him perfectly so these shoes run true to size. he loves them, and will definitely be getting plenty of use.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2195264", "1": "0.25690794", "2": "0.16307917", "3": "0.14842856", "4": "0.1036631", "5": "0.03504198", "6": "0.07335284"}}
