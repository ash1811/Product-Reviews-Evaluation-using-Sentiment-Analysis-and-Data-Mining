{"text": "The Moab Ventilator is a great shoe.  I've had a half a dozen over the past several years.  They last 2-3 years of good use then they are due for replacement. It's not that they break or fall apart but they get \"soft\". It's like when your razor gets a little duller each day.  You don't realize how dull it was until you replace it. You'll feel like you are walking on air with your new Moabs.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09983273", "1": "0.09370641", "2": "0.22780704", "3": "0.27145007", "5": "0.26505595", "6": "0.038477965"}}
