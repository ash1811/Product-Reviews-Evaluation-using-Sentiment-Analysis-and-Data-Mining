{"text": "This is a great jacket if you are looking for something that is truly waterproof. I have had a lot of weather resistant jackets that soak through after 10-60 minutes of being outside. This jacket is in the style of an outer shell so if you need to stay warm you should wear another layer underneath. This will keep you dry whether you are walking the dog, working outside all day or just live in Seattle.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09943357", "1": "0.2932158", "2": "0.17328894", "4": "0.13003534", "5": "0.18613562", "6": "0.11389085"}}
