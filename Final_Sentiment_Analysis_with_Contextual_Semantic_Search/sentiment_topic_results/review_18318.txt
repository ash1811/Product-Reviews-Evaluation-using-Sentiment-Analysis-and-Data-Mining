{"text": "These Hardtail \"mud\" yoga pants are great.  They are thick enough to smooth over my lumps and bumps, and the fold over waist keeps the muffin-top at bay.  The brown color is a nice warm medium brown. A perfect T3 if you are into Dressing Your Truth.  They are long, which is a great feature if you are tall.  I am 5'8.5\" and I can wear a heel with these.  I do wish there was a little less cotton and a little more lycra or added nylon, just so that the cotton percentage was a little less. In my experience, yoga pants and leggings that are a high percentage of cotton, eventually pill and look old faster.  So far, that hasn't happened.  I haven't had them long enough to say they last forever. You might be able to size down.  I wear a 12 pant normally. I chose the large.  I would say that I could probably wear the medium.  As they are worn, they stretch to be looser.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.4421428", "2": "0.09807063", "3": "0.17460683", "4": "0.17932735", "5": "0.02969474", "6": "0.0737283"}}
