{"text": "After the anklet was not available in the size I needed, I decided to go ahead and order 1/2 inch shorter.  When the anklet FINALLY arrived, the chain already looked TARNISHED !  There was NO shine and it had the yellow/gold tarnished look.  I will try to clean when I get time and hopefully clean the anklet up.  Will have to wait and see how well it'll clean up with the silver cleaner.  Will keep my fingers crossed.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08813871", "1": "0.20808132", "2": "0.12409658", "3": "0.10175649", "4": "0.16380252", "5": "0.095328175", "6": "0.21879622"}}
