{"text": "These are comfortable.  I've been wearing cheap flip flops for years and you can definitely tell a difference between these and the ones from Wal-Mart or Old Navy.  They are cute and well made.  They have a cloth inside and a leather outside for the strap.  Very comfortable foot bed as well.  My only issue is they run a bit small for my feet.  I usually wear a 10 1/2 and ordered an 11, never had a flip flop run small in an 11, and these just barely fit my feet.  I'm not sure I'd buy another pair even if I do like the shoes because of the size issue.  It could just be my feet so I'm still giving them 5 stars.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07066815", "1": "0.3047651", "2": "0.1915872", "3": "0.19609429", "4": "0.17592572", "5": "0.034625564", "6": "0.026333991"}}
