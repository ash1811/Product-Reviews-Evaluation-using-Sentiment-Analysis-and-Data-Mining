{"text": "my wife bought me this ring almost a year ago.  i have worn it since the day she gave it to me.  we decided to go with a non traditional metal for my ring since i tend to be a bit destructive with things.  so far it has held up wonderfully.  still looks like the day i got it.  and i have tried my hardest to scratch it just to prove her wrong. (open bottles, knives, even a brick wall) nothing has phased it.  my only complaint is that it is darker than the picture shows. also i have fairly slender fingers so i ended up ordering a half size smaller, but should have ordered a whole size smaller instead.  the ring also has a nice bit of heft to it for the size that it is.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.197876", "1": "0.22202809", "2": "0.12145778", "3": "0.2750981", "4": "0.048972327", "6": "0.13232957"}}
