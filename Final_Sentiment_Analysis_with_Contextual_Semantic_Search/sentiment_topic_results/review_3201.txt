{"text": "typically ordering fitted clothing from any online store can be tricky. Honestly, I was very hesitant to order measured clothing because I am a tall big guy. However, I knew what size i typically wear. I feared that the size ordered would differ in actual size once arrived. This was not the case. The Levis I ordered were just like the ones in the store and even lower in cost than my preferred department store. I was so pleased with the fitting, quality and savings (free shipping via Amazon Prime members) that I ordered another identical pair a week later. Saved me a trip to the shopping mall and perhaps a few bucks on gas. If you know your size, order that size is my suggestion. HHopefully, I will be motivated to continue to lose weight and move down another size in future. When I do, I will be ordering again from Amazon!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15617347", "1": "0.2332923", "2": "0.067063", "3": "0.161453", "4": "0.076022014", "5": "0.1053522", "6": "0.2006441"}}
