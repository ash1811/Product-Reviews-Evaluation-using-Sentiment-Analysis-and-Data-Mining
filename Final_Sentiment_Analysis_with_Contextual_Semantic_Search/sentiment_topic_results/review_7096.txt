{"text": "2/12/13After reading all of these 'amaaaazing' reviews, I was sure this was going to be the bra for me.  I'm a 38D, and I have an issue with most bras, usually with my boobs falling out of the cup, but mostly with \"uni-boobage\".  Every bra I wear makes my boobs gravitate toward each other after just a few minutes.  Not cool.  I constantly find myself with my hands in my shirt adjusting myself.  Plus, I HATE underwire.  So I thought I would give this bra a try based on all the awesome reviews.Upon receiving, I couldn't wait to try it on.  But after not even 10 minutes of wearing it, I can't wait to rip it off.  It is on me as we speak.  It is the ITCHIEST bra I have EVER worn.  I don't know why either.  I have never worn a bra that made me itch SO much.  It itches EVERYWHERE... in the cups, in the front, but mostly in the back.  I also feel the material in the sides of the back of the bra stabbing me.  I'm not allergic to ANY fabric either, so that isn't it.  This really sucks, because it's doing a great job of keeping my boobs separated, like all bras SHOULD do, but don't.  The straps are NOT uncomfortable at all (for me anyway) like some of the other reviewers stated.  But damn, it is ITCHYYYYY!!  Also, you can see your nips through your t-shirt if the wind picks up, lol.  Very thin cup lining.I don't know yet if I will return it or get used to the itching because it does exactly what I have been searching for for YEARS, which is keep my boobs where they are supposed to be.  I can do backflips and cartwheels and they stay in the cups.  I just wish it was made of cotton or something softer to the skin.2/13/13******** Update!  The bra is NOT AS itchy after the 2nd day of wearing it.  I don't know if I got used to the itch or what.  It's still itchy, but not AS BAD as day 1.  Gives me great support and my chest fills the cups perfectly.2/14/13******** Update!  The bra doesn't itch me at all today, after the 3rd day.  So weird, I just can't understand it.  I just ordered 2 more because it's the most cmfortable and most supportive non-underwire bra I have ever owned.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.037401747", "1": "0.323256", "2": "0.05194301", "3": "0.26720813", "4": "0.09116706", "5": "0.095100656", "6": "0.1339234"}}
