{"text": "I recieved these boots after a little snafu from a previous order, I reodered these and Amazon promptly sent another pair even before I returned the orignal order in which I was super happy about that, anyway, Ive used these boots everyday since ive I got the reorder, EVERYDAY, I work at night and have been in the snow, sleet, rain and blizzard and these rascals have worked great, almost no break in needed, if, and I say, if, you are going to use these with two (2) pairs of socks or winter socks to avaoid blisters then by all means order a size up, if not, youre probably best to order you right ize and wait for a break in. In the grand scheme of things 100.00 is not alot of money to pay for some decent work boots that also look good dressed up or with jeans as well. These are not Luccheses' , Tony Lamas, or Myers, but tey are very good for what they do, besides,the burnt cherry color looks even better after its been work, sort of like a cross between black and a dark red. I would recommend these and will probably get another pair for my regular wear.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17293201", "1": "0.117502645", "2": "0.06775603", "3": "0.15819249", "4": "0.26306874", "5": "0.097877815", "6": "0.12267027"}}
