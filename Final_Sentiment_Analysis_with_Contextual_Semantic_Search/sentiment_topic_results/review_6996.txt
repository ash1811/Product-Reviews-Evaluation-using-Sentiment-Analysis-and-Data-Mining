{"text": "I love this mule.  The tan color is gorgeous and has a distressed leather look which adds even more appeal to me.  I will be wearing these with a thick sock as they are a little loose.  They look great with jeans and have the look of a boot without all the hassle of taking off the boots quickly with ease.  I can just slide these off and on and they look great.  They are also very comfortable which is essential for me.  The pointed toe does make the shoe & your foot a little larger than some shoes, but that does not bother me at all.  I would highly recommend these mules!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12617227", "1": "0.38177463", "2": "0.18061337", "3": "0.039587416", "4": "0.20146322", "6": "0.06751464"}}
