{"text": "ordered this ring because the 4mm was too thin and the 6mm was too wide and because of all the reveiws i read raving over this ring and sabrina as a company. i was amazed when i opened the package. the ring is beautiful and i love the weight. there is no doubt that its tungsten cabride as it is engraved in the inside. the 4 mm i bought had something else engraved inside, leading me to doubt that it was authentic tungsten. the package was received in record time. i would do business with this company again. also this company is only one of a few that offer the 5mm in a 6.5. the few others that do offer 5mm, don't offer them in a size this small. i checked the internet for other places that sell this ring and they are at least $100 elsewhere. on amazon, to be able to get this ring for under $20 including shipping, was a real steal.UPDATE: after only a couple of weeks of wearing this ring, i started to notices slight blotches of dullness. i bought some tungsten polish, but while it restored some areas to a mirror polish, the areas of dullness remained unchanged. this is still a good value, but if you are buying a wedding ring that you want to  stand the test of time, be aware that the mirror finish will not last.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.36173832", "1": "0.1776817", "2": "0.055000883", "3": "0.13118045", "4": "0.17416452", "5": "0.08243831", "6": "0.017795814"}}
