{"text": "I've had a pair of Ray Ban Aviator's before, but these ones seem to have a little bit more of a delicate frame.  After only a week of having these I somehow managed to slightly bend the frame so now they don't sit exactly level on my face.  Which no one notices but me, but bothers me.The lens color is awesome.  Way better than the online photos.  Light blue with a hint of pink.  Fit is very comfortable & snug, don't slide around or fall forward on your face when you tilt your head (which my last ones did)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09115111", "1": "0.27347437", "2": "0.09118043", "3": "0.25026003", "4": "0.12517022", "5": "0.08823767", "6": "0.08052624"}}
