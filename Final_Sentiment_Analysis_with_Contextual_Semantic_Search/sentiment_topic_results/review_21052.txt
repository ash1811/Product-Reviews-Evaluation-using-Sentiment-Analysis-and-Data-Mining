{"text": "I'm giving this shoe a 4 out of 5 rating based on what I believe to be discrepancies with the toe formation along the shoes I received.  In the photo, the toe of this shoe is slim but the shoe I received was slightly raised higher, taking away from a slimmer profile.  I have worn Kenneth Cole shoes for many years and can testify to the quality of their product.  This Reaction shoe is still a handsome shoe, I was just expecting a shoe with lower relief along the toe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.15600589", "1": "0.16581441", "2": "0.34197697", "3": "0.059366886", "4": "0.106430195", "5": "0.08337315", "6": "0.087032475"}}
