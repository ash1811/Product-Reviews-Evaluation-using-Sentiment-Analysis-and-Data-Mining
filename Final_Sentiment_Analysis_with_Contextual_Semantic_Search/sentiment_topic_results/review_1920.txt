{"text": "I was excited to try out these cute moccasins, as I loved the other styles of Minnetonka's I have owned.  However, after just 3 days of light wear, the lining of the soles are coming apart.  The glue has become gummy and lost its adhesiveness, so I am unable to put the liners back in place.  I am very disappointed in this product and I will think twice about buying another pair of Minnetonka's.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04905669", "1": "0.45954397", "3": "0.22649649", "5": "0.1477295", "6": "0.10920294"}}
