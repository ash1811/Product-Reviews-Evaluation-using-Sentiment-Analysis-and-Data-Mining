If you have more than two college courses = your items will not fit. I like it for it's simplicity but I honestly thought it was going to be bigger than it actually is. It's like a small beach bag and the strap comes loose quite easily - so you have to put on a button and make a fasten hole or use a safety pin in order to secure the strap length you require, especially if you have a short torso and you don't want it to hit your toosh as you walk.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11332736", "1": "0.3459115", "2": "0.17018081", "3": "0.078522585", "4": "0.08658688", "5": "0.07935598", "6": "0.12611485"}}
