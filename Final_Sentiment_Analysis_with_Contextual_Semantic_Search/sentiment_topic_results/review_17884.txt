{"text": "I can't believe some of the lukewarm reviews this watch has gotten, what do you mean \"Ok for a $10 watch?\"  This is a terrific watch for under $10.The band which is black plastic is pliable and has so many closely placed holes on it that I had no worries about the arm sweat that some other plastic bands can create.  Very comfortable.The face of the watch is large, not too large to look too masculine, clear and SO easy to read.Why anyone would want to spend $50 to $100 for some designer watch is beyond me.  This is a real ladies watch for real ladies, at home, at work, on the go, this is an unbeatable value for a everyday watch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10234859", "1": "0.1337233", "2": "0.3863559", "4": "0.26957884", "5": "0.054474108", "6": "0.051045805"}}
