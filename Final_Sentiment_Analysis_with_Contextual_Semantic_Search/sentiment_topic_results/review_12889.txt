{"text": "These are listed as Australian boots.  But as any American knows from geography class, Australia is on the other side (bottom) of the world.  So everything is clearly upside down there.  Since up in America points `up' here, then up in Australia must point down at the ground to point the same way.  So reasonably, Australians must walk on their hands.  So boots, or any footwear really, acts as a type of hat for them.  QED.  I can see paying $200 for a good pair of comfortable shoes, cause I need those, but not for a hat!  That is outlandish.  Still they look pretty rugged and probably are really comfortable, but still they are the equivalent of a hat.
