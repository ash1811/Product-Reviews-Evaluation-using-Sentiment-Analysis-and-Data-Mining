{"text": "I was not expecting this shoe to be as heavy as it is, and it exceeds my personal taste and preference for weight of a shoe as I've gotten used to \"barefoot\" models and building up my foot and ankle strength in those. I got these hoping for a walker/light hiker/cycling shoe for colder, wetter days where I might want more protection from the elements than what I get in barefoot models, and I also loved the rugged oxford look. The sole is incredibly thick like a hiking shoe but without quite the same traction, although the traction on these is great for a walking/travel shoe, and might even prove to be great in snow and ice around the city. Light hiking could be done in these but I imagine the heavy sole with the low ankles might make for an unwanted hazard.I feel these shoes also run a bit big. I'm usually a 9.5 to 10, and I ordered these in a 10 thinking I'd wear them mostly with heavier socks. With medium thick wool socks, I still feel like I'm floating in these, and they appear to have a bit of a clunky clown shoe look from the outside. I'm struggling to find pants I like to pair with these without feeling like I'm lugging around a pair of flippers. Unfortunately, I ordered these in August and didn't have the chance to start wearing them in the conditions I'd hoped they'd be good for until AFTER my returns window had closed. If I could, I'd try exchanging them for a 9.5, as they are lightly worn and I still have a need for their intended purpose. I'm totally bummed, as I had high hopes for these shoes.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07170418", "1": "0.10335334", "2": "0.22839868", "3": "0.20260306", "4": "0.11701039", "5": "0.15175363", "6": "0.12517673"}}
