{"text": "I am really pleased with this purchase, especially since the watch was basically free. I'm not sure how they can design, construct and ship this watch for $13.99. It's an excellent value. But it's not just a really low-end option, the watch actually performs well and looks nice. Is it some exotic Swiss chronometer that will turn heads on the red carpet? No. But it does have the necessities that most \"work watches\" need, including: time with day and date, second time zone, 1/100 chrono and multi alarm. And these basic features are housed in a durable stainless case with a comfortable stainless band. Again, I'm impressed with the overall quality given the super low price. My only complaint, or wish, is that it also had a countdown timer. But that's not a huge deal. Overall, I highly recommend this watch. I wear it daily, even though I have several multi-thousand dollar watches. This simple Casio is my go-to timepiece.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11516613", "1": "0.28001484", "2": "0.20664366", "3": "0.15384418", "4": "0.13105126", "5": "0.039029", "6": "0.07425094"}}
