{"text": "I purchased this for my 2 year old niece who always wants to wear our watches.  It's a very cute watch, the lizards move across the face like a second hand.  The band is elastic, so once it's fitted for a small wrist you can just pull it off without re-sizing.  Another pro, Timex kids watches come with a ''warranty'' that if the child loses the watch within 12 months of the purchase date, you can buy another for $10.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1716103", "1": "0.24286774", "2": "0.17993654", "3": "0.13436636", "4": "0.105289504", "5": "0.10075998", "6": "0.06516959"}}
