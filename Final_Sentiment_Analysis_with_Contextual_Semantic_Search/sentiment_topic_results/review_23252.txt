{"text": "I like the idea of a nursing bra for night time, to keep you and your nightie dry. However maneuvering it in order to quickly accommodate a sleepy, hungry, fussy baby at 3AM is no easy task. So, while good in theory, it isn't so great in practice. It is fairly comfortable as far as bras go, though. It's much better for day-time use if you're wearing a shirt (T-shirt, sweater, button-down) you can properly conceal it under.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08151282", "1": "0.21204135", "2": "0.12674539", "3": "0.18754159", "4": "0.1650309", "6": "0.22394773"}}
