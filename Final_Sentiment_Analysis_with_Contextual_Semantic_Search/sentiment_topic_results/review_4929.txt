{"text": "I do not believe Timex understands the term \"IronMan\".My wife did have this for 5 years. She did use it about 4 months before 1 marathon a year for 5 years. One year was 2 marathons. My wife is a small petite thing.Changing the battery was a humongous pain in the butt! Had to install and take out ~5 times due to challenges with screen and such after battery inserted and tightened up. Don't believe it ever really tightened up as it should. Not used in water, shower, etc.Great size and ability for the price.Just not an IronMan type quality. Maybe 'PrettyGoodMan\" quality?Would not buy again.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21915738", "1": "0.32953873", "2": "0.037455205", "4": "0.123736896", "5": "0.13108066", "6": "0.15663296"}}
