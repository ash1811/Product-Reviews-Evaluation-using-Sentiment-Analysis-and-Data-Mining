{"text": "This backpack can hold 30-50lbs of stuff without stressing.  It is perfect for large textbooks, laptop cases, etc.  There are quite a few zipper pockets to utilize, each a diferent size.  The straps are wide and cushioned and strong.  They are easily adjustable from a 5 ft woman's shoulders to a 6 ft man's shoulders in seconds.  The material is lightweight yet strong.  It takes quite a bit of stress and weight, as I often pack it tight with various things before I toss it onto my back.  Mine is still looking brand new.  I am very happy with this purchase.  If you need a reliable pack that will hold a ton of stuff comfortably on your back, this is the one to buy.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.35670468", "2": "0.17735739", "3": "0.25336087", "4": "0.118657485", "5": "0.053273756", "6": "0.038474865"}}
