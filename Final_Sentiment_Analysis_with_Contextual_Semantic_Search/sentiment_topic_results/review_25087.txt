{"text": "I received this ring a week ago and I LOVE IT!!!!! The band is cut in a beautiful way and the stone is not too big to look unreal. I also bought 2 Sterling 2 mm wedding bands and if you do that you will have a beautiful wedding set that is durable and you still feel like a million bucks. Thanks gem avenue for great quality made jewelry.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.3355223", "1": "0.28844032", "2": "0.06279648", "3": "0.052872412", "4": "0.08433732", "5": "0.10394123", "6": "0.07208997"}}
