{"text": "I have owned these shoes in tan for around five months and they have quickly become my go-to shoes.  I was concerned about spending the money on a pair of driving shoes (because of the beating they typically take) but they have been well worth the money and I when the time comes I will replace with another pair.When I purchased these I also purchased a pair of Polo Ralph Lauren Men's Telly Driving Shoe.  There is no comparison between the two.  The quality of the leather and the fit are the two most obvious differences.  I ordered both in my standard size, 11D.  The Cole Haan's slide on and off with little effort and both the width and length fit correctly.  I noticed some of the other reviews mentioned that they thought they were very narrow.  I don't have narrow feet and have had no complaints about the width.  As I have worn the Cole Haan's they have broken in very well and now feel almost like a slipper on my feet.  The RL's on the other hand were very difficult to get on and off.  I am sure if they were broken in more they would have become easier, but who wants to deal with that if you don't have to?The shoes work well with or without socks.  I typically wear them with jeans and an Allen Edmonds Manistee belt in tan.  The colors match perfectly and they look great together.Leave the sneakers at home and give these a try.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11927786", "1": "0.21574804", "2": "0.23675254", "3": "0.10160038", "4": "0.15254217", "6": "0.17163944"}}
