{"text": "I received the package like a week later so the timing wasnt all that bad.Although when I opened the box, the blouse was not really what i expected.In the picture, the blouse looks cute, retro and looks like it accents the body.Well first, i know for sure the white color in the picture is a shirt under - take that into condiseration.The top is basically like a fishnet!I ordered a large which seems like I made a good choice because the medium seems like it would be too tight because this isnt a stretchy material. ( i havent tried the shirt on yet though)But I paid like $25 total with shipping and handling and this top isnt even worth half!I mean, I'll wear it and try to rock it with some leggings or something but My point is the top looks nothing Like the picure and its nothing worth what I paid.After  I try it on, ill post another review.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.32375818", "1": "0.24074733", "2": "0.067479745", "3": "0.11464643", "5": "0.15638082", "6": "0.09484994"}}
