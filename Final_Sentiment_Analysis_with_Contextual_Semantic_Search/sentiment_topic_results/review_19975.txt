{"text": "I have been using various high sierra bags and I have one of these. Very rugged and I use it daily, multiple airport trips. Packed in overhead compartment bins, throwing it in car trunks, and pretty much lot of rough uses. No single tear! These and LL Beans brands have proved to be very rugged and dependable. Zippers are also very strong, lot of compartments for me.
