{"text": "I purchased these after they were recommended by a salesclerk at the running store. i put them in my Mizuno Wave Prophecy's for better heel support because of the deep heel cup they have. i was using the Spenco Q Factor Cushioning insoles but they changed their design. i find the superfeet green to have much better heel cup support. i am so glad i have found these and only wish i had found them when i started running years ago.  They are also great for my UGG boots which up until now i couldn't wear because they had ABSOLUTELY NO ARCH SUPPORT. All of the ugg boots that have replaceable insoles, i can now just add the superfeet insoles in, and they are now comfortable to wear for the whole day. Before, they were only tolerable for a few hours. Thank you superfeet!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.03553834", "1": "0.17567997", "2": "0.12834711", "3": "0.21301946", "4": "0.2696212", "5": "0.1507875", "6": "0.027006444"}}
