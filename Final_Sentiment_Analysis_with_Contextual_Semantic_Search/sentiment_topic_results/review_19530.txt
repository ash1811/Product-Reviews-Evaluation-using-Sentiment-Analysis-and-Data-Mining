{"text": "I have very wide feet and wasn't sure about the length and width of these shoes.  I ordered my size and a size bigger and to my surprise my size was roomy enough.  My heels cover the trim a little but the trim crushes down and it isn't a bother to walk on.  After wearing them twice I've noticed they have given already so that's even better.  I chose chestnut because I thought they would be more practical and the color is beautiful.  I gave it three stars because I think the fur trim is too fluffy and the weight of the shoe makes them a little difficult to keep on while walking.  I don't hate the trim but I'm glad that most of my pants cover that part and I think thicker socks could solve the sliding problem.  Overall, they're nice looking, warm and will help me get through the rest of my pregnancy without having to put big boots on my swollen feet this winter.UPDATE: I wore these shoes for one winter season and ended up getting rid of them. They gave so much in width that the only way they would stay on my feet was if I walked like a snail.  My ankle turned a few times, once resulting in a pretty bad fall.  Wearing them without socks helped to prevent the shoe from sliding off a little but not much.  If you size down, they'll be too short so I think that either way, these shoes just stretch out way too much.  They were cute and I received many compliments but very heavy and clunky.  I believe the sole is just too much.  I had to get rid of them because they were hazardous to my health.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.1699449", "2": "0.196913", "3": "0.29596224", "4": "0.21848035", "6": "0.113647886"}}
