{"text": "I bought this to replace my husband's old watch. He loves it and has told me repeatedly that he thinks it's the best watch he's ever owned (including the really expensive one his ex bought him). The illumination is good, the size is good, he likes the color and the contrast. We are very pleased with this product.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.35028273", "2": "0.1655635", "3": "0.06814055", "4": "0.19659503", "5": "0.14513786", "6": "0.06966147"}}
