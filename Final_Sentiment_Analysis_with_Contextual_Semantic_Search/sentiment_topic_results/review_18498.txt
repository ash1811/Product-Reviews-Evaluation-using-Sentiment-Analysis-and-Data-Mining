{"text": "This past summer was a horrible summer for any sunglasses I touched. I went through about a dozen cheap pairs that I picked up from local brick and mortar stores. Sitting here I realize that, if I were to add up the cost of all these cheap sunglasses, I could of bought a couple of very nice pairs. I have only owned cheap sunglasses and I wondered if paying a premium on sunglasses is worth it.Enter the Oakley Mens Whisker sunglasses.I picked these up because they came to my attention being apart of a sale. I was hesitant due to even the sale price but, as I mentioned beforehand, just a few cheap pairs would cover the cost of these glasses.They arrived in the mail and come pre-packaged in a simple cardboard box. Within the cardboard box the glasses are protected in a soft cloth bag and also contain a cleaning rag and small info brochure.I immediately pulled out the glasses and spent the next few hours walking around trying them on and, have to say, I am pretty impressed.Many of my cheap glasses broke due to poor construction of the frames. These frames feel durable and like they will last. I have a large head that does put tension on glasses. These glasses were able to take the tension yet retain their original shape.The glasses are not polarized but do a good job on their own protecting my vision from the suns glare. The lenses are the perfect tint and did not block out my vision of the outside world.I received compliments from my wife and neighbors about how stylish the glasses look. It reminds me of the hoopla during the 80's when Tom Cruise sported \"Aviator\" glasses from the movie Top Gun and the craze he created.PRO:++ Durable construction++ Compliments on how stylish they lookCON:++ For price, only receiving a cloth bag for protection is cheapCONCLUSION:These glasses are well worth the premium paid over regular sunglasses you find sitting on a carousel rack at the local brick and mortar stores. Just watch for the sales when they go on to pick up then.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14341336", "1": "0.090839416", "2": "0.24793972", "3": "0.07074588", "4": "0.16592012", "5": "0.23397632", "6": "0.04716518"}}
