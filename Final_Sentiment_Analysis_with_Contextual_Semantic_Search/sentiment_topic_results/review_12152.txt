{"text": "Wigwams were the first merino/silk blend socks I ever had, and no others have come close. I got a few pairs as cheap online factory seconds. I wore them constantly for several years, including a long hot summer in the mountainous back-country of Idaho and then a four-month trip to South America, from the Amazon to the Andes. The socks lasted a few years longer once I got home, got a job, and continued to wear them hiking and also to work during the week. During my travels I swear I didn't have to wash my socks for over a week and they didn't get funky. I just wore a different pair every other day. YMMV but I think not washing them so much helped them last longer. Once I got back to civilization they wore out after a couple years of constant  use including regular laundry (hang dry! keeps em softer).  Amazing socks. No stink, no dirty sweaty feeling. They are cool enough on a hot day, and warm when it's cold. Very cushy, springy, supportive, smooth no-itch comfort... simply amazing 100% natural futuristic Star Trek sock technology.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13594869", "1": "0.1351475", "2": "0.048972044", "3": "0.28457436", "4": "0.11590175", "5": "0.19534431", "6": "0.08411136"}}
