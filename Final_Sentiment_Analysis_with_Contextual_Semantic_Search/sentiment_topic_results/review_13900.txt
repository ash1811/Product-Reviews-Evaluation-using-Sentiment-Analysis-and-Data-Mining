{"text": "Large face, large numbers, looks great, feels great but the strap is a total joke. Your wrist would have to be the size of a garden hose to actually work !! How could such a large watch have such a small strap. I was on the last hole of the strap and the remainder of the strap wasn't long enough to pass through the strap loop, so it just stood out. Plus it was so tight it impeded the blood flow to my hand. In less than a minute I had the strap off and replaced it with an extra black rubber dive watch strap I had. Now it fits and looks great too.3/3/08  I over reacted to the strap and need to give more information about the watch! I am totally pleased with the watch itself which is what people are really buying. Two things you should know: 1. The chronograph is only capable of timing 59 minutes/59 seconds unlike a casio G-shock that can give elapsed time to 24 hours. 2. The owners manual states that the silver oxide battery that stores power from the solar cell collector will have to be eventually replaced. When the description says you will never need a battery, they mean a conventional watch battery! Yes, its a geat watch with easy to read full face simplicity. But be warned that if your wrist is even \"average size\" plan on replacing the strap.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10409015", "1": "0.15901364", "2": "0.3004924", "3": "0.07990156", "4": "0.058550376", "5": "0.18857962", "6": "0.10937221"}}
