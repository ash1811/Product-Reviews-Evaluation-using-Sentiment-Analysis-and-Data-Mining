{"text": "I was looking for a nice comfortable dress shoe that can be worn as casual wear also and this is the shoe.  The flex material near the shoe laces is a nice touch.  It allows the shoe to flex while walking therefore keeping it from digging into the top part of the foot.  Nice looking shoe and goes great with khakis.  I really have nothing bad to say about these shoes, I am think about getting them in black.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.4513492", "2": "0.24940886", "3": "0.044886027", "4": "0.058786806", "5": "0.07597183", "6": "0.11619016"}}
