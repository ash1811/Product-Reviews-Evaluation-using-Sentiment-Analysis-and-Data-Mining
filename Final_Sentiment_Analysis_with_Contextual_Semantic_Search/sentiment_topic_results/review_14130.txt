{"text": "I've worn this chain for THREE YEARS, nonstop (I only took it off one time for an x-ray!), and it's still in great shape! So it lasts a long time too! I really wish I could give it 4.5 stars instead of 4!****************************This is a beautiful chain for a pendant (or like me, a Saint's medal!).  It has a lovely intricate design that I haven't seen before and is quite stunning. The chain is a tad bit shiny, so keep that in mind. I've worn mine solidly for a month now, take showers & sleep in it, and it's still holding up, as is my 6 year old daughter's chain, who also wears it sleeping, playing, and all that rough stuff that kids do.  Neither one has shown any signs of weakness and for the price, I highly recommend it.The only flaw I saw was that one or two tiny links were \"bunched\" up with each other, I was able to fix all but one by simply pulling them and trying to wiggle it.  I still haven't fixed the last one but I am afraid to break the chain, and since it is minor it's staying. I would recommend the chain more for women than men, although if your man isn't particularly picky.... it seems more feminine to me with the fancy design.I plan on buying more for my other children when I get around to it!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.031469643", "1": "0.13850552", "2": "0.11343879", "3": "0.29315862", "4": "0.24583538", "5": "0.06459706", "6": "0.11299504"}}
