{"text": "My husband was very pleased when I gave these to him for his birthday. The fit was true to size and they are a very comfortable nice casual weekend shoe. These shoes are a bit nostalgic for us, because the style was very popular when we were kids. They were called Chukka Boots or Wallabees, but we now call them Walter White Shoes (Breaking Bad reference). The color taupe is a very nice neutral that goes great with jeans, or even a nicer khaki pant. He especially likes the cushiony gummy sole.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.33703393", "2": "0.1787265", "3": "0.09061722", "4": "0.09831824", "5": "0.28920794"}}
