{"text": "Bought a package of these and they are nothing like the old Hanes socks I used to wear.  They claim to be cushioned and have a comfort blend....no way.  They felt soft in my hands.  When I put them on, they were pinchy and felt like nylon fibers under my feet.  Very uncomfortable.  I tried to break them in and wear them a while.  The pinchy feeling went away, but they were so tight around my ankles that they left indentations in my skin.  I've given them a few tries.  I also gave a pair to my mother to try, and she hates them too.  I don't know if they are made wrong...too small in size....or if it's the blend of polyester, nylon, latex, & spandex, with not enough cotton in them.  Actually, I think it's both of those reasons.  I've been wearing some old Hanes socks I have that are in good condition, and they feel more cottony.These socks are going in the garbage.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11418212", "1": "0.33871302", "2": "0.091346696", "3": "0.19783944", "4": "0.06363493", "5": "0.059801977", "6": "0.1344818"}}
