{"text": "I really like these slippers ,They are soft and comfortable. I bought them from Amazon about 4 weeks ago. They were a little tight when I first got them, but that is fine because I know they stretch out a little and I want slippers that won't fall off my feet. I cant wait to take off my shoes at night and put on my comfy slippers, and I loved the dark color, I don't get stains on them. I would recommend them to everyone.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.059616867", "1": "0.31730866", "2": "0.10814778", "3": "0.13056664", "4": "0.09519624", "5": "0.05348352", "6": "0.23568033"}}
