{"text": "This was ordered for my Husband but is unisex. I can't see many woman wearing it in this color at least or in the style. It is well made with thick sturdy material. The small logo on the side of it has a butterfly in it as if it was a girls hat. But it is small and not very noticable. It says one size fits most on the tag but inside it says large. It is a little tight on my husband so I am not sure if it is actually a large in Womans or if there is ever a size difference in womans and mens hats. But he likes it. I feel the price was worth it. The color was pretty spot on as the one in the pic. It has vent holes which is a plus for my husband with strong SPF rating. I didn't know hats had SPF ratings. Can UV rays actually go through hats without SPF? It sounds nice but not sure it matters.It's a great hat all around and I feel it will last for quite a while.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.4374735", "2": "0.11950623", "3": "0.10290028", "4": "0.16874479", "6": "0.16584936"}}
