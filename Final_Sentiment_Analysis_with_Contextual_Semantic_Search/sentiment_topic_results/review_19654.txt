{"text": "I was so very glad to find these shoes! I was a bit worried at first-it had been so long since I had a brand new pair of slip on shoes! The reason for that is because Eastlands are so good, I can wear a pair for 10+ years! I have a pair of brown similar ones that I've worn for about that long-maybe longer. But they last forever and are the only brand I will buy. I'm still wearing the brown ones, but wanted a pair of black ones to match my purse and coat for winter. They felt a bit tight at first, but it's been so long since I've had to break in a pair of shoes since Eastlands last so long! Wore them a couple of nights at home, broke in perfectly, now they're my new favorites! I've tried others, but Eastlands are still the best:)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.027745698", "1": "0.24877293", "2": "0.11614681", "3": "0.34444308", "4": "0.16748859", "5": "0.034486223", "6": "0.060916703"}}
