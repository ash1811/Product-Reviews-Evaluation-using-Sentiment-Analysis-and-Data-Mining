{"text": "I've been an Image Stylist for 10 years. This is my favorite comfy bra to recommend to my clients. It lasts and lasts. I don't believe in buying tight bras anymore. They just need to stay in place, so just buy one size up from tight and make sure your cup size is big enough. For more reviews, you can head to my website AStore to see more comments there!I don't wear a bra unless I'm going out in public. Free the girls. This is a great bra without too much padding for when you really need to wear one!(I'm wearing a 36 D instead of my usual 34 C ~I've gained a little weight but it's better not to have it fit too tightly!)AurethaSoul Stylist", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.115651146", "1": "0.22315973", "2": "0.04182781", "3": "0.30245903", "4": "0.11584321", "5": "0.13603239", "6": "0.065026686"}}
