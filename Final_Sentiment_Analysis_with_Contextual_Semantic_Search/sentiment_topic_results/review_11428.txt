{"text": "Bag is well-made, with well-finished seams and a strong join of handles to bag. Downside: the straps don't encircle the bag, and they aren't long enough (at least when bag-carrier is plumped up by winter coat) to carry as a shoulder bag. Not sure they'd be long enough to carry on shoulder in summer without getting pit juice all over the bag.Beyond that: quite strong, roomy. The interior pocket is divided in half, which makes it less helpful than it might be. Still, a fine, useful bag.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0724913", "1": "0.31068605", "2": "0.2690242", "3": "0.07631765", "4": "0.12544757", "5": "0.11562664", "6": "0.030406585"}}
