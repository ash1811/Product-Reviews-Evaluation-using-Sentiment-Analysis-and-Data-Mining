{"text": "HOBO, you really don't have to say more than that, but I will!  HOBO is top quality, the leather is beautiful, it comes packed in tissue with stuffing and foam, etc.  The hardware is really nice and the leather is sewn in perfect so it should last a very long time.  The zipper in the center is a compartment almost the size of the wallet when you lay it open.  You wouldn't want to put anything too bulky in there but you could slip in extra cash or credit card, passport, even your phone.My phone (EVO 4G) fits nicely in one side, if I want to use this as a clutch, I still have room for lipstick or pen, etc.  One side is all pocket and has a zipper pocket on the inside, this side would be good for the accessories you usually carry in your purse.  The other side has 6 credit card slots and two long slots like for cash.  There are also a few slots in the center lay out for frequently used cards or gift cards, etc.  i don't think you'd have to worry about any cards falling out of the slots in this area.There are magnets that hold the two sides together and they are pretty strong--again top quality.  The ends are open but not gaping, so you may want to judge how valuable the cards you choose to put in this center section until you see how it works for you.  I bought the black leather for about $60.  The colors range widely in price, but I will probably check back periodically to see if some other colors I like get to a better price, because if you had few of these, they would probably last you the rest of your life!  This wallet is big enough that once you have it filled with your items, you can just change purses and drop this wallet in and be ready to go.Very lovely, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this wallet.  And if you are not, I suggest you return it -- HOBO deserves a chance to make it right and doesn't deserve a bad wrap.  Enjoy!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14721143", "1": "0.2721538", "2": "0.22004384", "3": "0.07494407", "4": "0.052201733", "5": "0.12057638", "6": "0.112868756"}}
