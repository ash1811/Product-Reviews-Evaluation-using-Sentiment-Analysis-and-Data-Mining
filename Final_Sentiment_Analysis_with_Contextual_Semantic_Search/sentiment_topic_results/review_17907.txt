{"text": "I originally bought one of these many years ago for work and it performed very well considering the type of work I do. Paid about $10 or $11.00 for it and after about 3 years the band broke. Since it's not cost effective to replace the band on a $10. watch, I simply bought another one for around $13.00 a couple of years ago. The 2nd watch and band are still going strong. Since I like the watch so much, I just ordered a 3rd one on Amazon to be sure I have it if/when the 2nd watch or band fails.Pros:Keeps good timeStopwatch functionWater resistantLong battery life (I still have the original watch with the broken band and it's still running)Cons:Cheap band (but hey, it's a $15.00 watch)Alarm is too quietAll-in-all, this watch offers great 'bang for the buck'! I recommend it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09918002", "1": "0.24593258", "2": "0.24712105", "3": "0.07113312", "4": "0.24148662", "5": "0.028811306", "6": "0.06633531"}}
