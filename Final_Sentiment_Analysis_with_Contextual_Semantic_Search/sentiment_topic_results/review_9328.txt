{"text": "These slippers are great!  The fit is exactly what I expected at the size I ordered.The construction on them is very good.  For instance, at the split on top of the shoe, there's a triangle patch sewn for reinforcement: just as there's a reinforcing strip at the back of the shoe.  The sole is thick and sturdy.  Small pieces of the faux-fur are going to come loose over time, but that happens to ALL faux-fur in any kind of wearable garment: it's not excessive though.A special feature I like personally is the way you can roll up the upper cuff to make them into, effectively, a high-top slipper.  That's going to come in handy when it snows and I have to walk outside.  Overall, I'm VERY pleased with the purchase and product.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.048861377", "1": "0.24969304", "2": "0.17665686", "3": "0.1742446", "4": "0.056460477", "5": "0.21017338", "6": "0.08391026"}}
