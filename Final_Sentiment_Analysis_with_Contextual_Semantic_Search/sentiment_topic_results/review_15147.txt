{"text": "I have been wearing Levi's 501 jeans for literally half a century and the quality of the fabric has gone downhill to the point where a pair now lasts me less than a year before tears appear. I know that the stone wash type are actually tumbled with rocks and are not going to wear very long but I do expect the standard jeans to last a lot longer than a matter of weeks before having holes in the jeans from the fabric having worn thin. Dislike paying 10x as much and getting 1/10 the wear of the Levi's of the past.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.04448816", "1": "0.24128252", "2": "0.046157546", "3": "0.15593864", "4": "0.062058028", "5": "0.2536582", "6": "0.1964169"}}
