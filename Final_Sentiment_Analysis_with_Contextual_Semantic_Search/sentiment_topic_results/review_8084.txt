{"text": "I'm into shoes. I hurt my foot several years ago and since then, I'm buying shoes like crazy looking for a nice looking shoe that is easy on my feet. These shoes fit the bill. The shoe itself is a little larger then most, but most previous Dockers I've own were hard to get on and off. These slip on with ease. The 2 newest additions to Dockers shoes from my experience are the new gel insert for the heal which is very cool. I'm only 150 pounds so I've never had the problem with one busting. I've also noticed that the padding on the back heal is somewhat less then previously own Docker shoes. It was just one of those things that made it harder to put on and take off, not to mention that it was a slight irritation. The black is a very beautiful shoe, with blue liner. I also got the tan from Shoebuy during one of their sales and it has accents on the threaded areas which makes it look antique. I just love the way it looks. It also has a few other nice additions that make it special. The sole is not as soft as most Docker shoes, but is a little softer then your average leather sole dress shoes. As with any rubber sole shoe - it will not last forever, but I alternate shoe on a daily basis and have shoes over 10 years old that are still in great condition. But these are by far the nicest Docker shoes I've purchased to date. I recommend these shoes to anyone wanting a comfortable, great looking shoe at a fair price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.097162314", "1": "0.117234945", "2": "0.2666514", "3": "0.14495353", "4": "0.13018236", "5": "0.13007234", "6": "0.1137432"}}
