{"text": "Let's face it, there is something a smart phone cannot do: be there on your wrist for the quick glance of time. I found this nostalgic watch in black with gold trim/ buttons and it looked awesome so I snatched it right up!I like it because there's a nice, classic, minimalist look to it that says \"Who cares if your watch is $1000+... I'm just as accurate as well as disposable!\" It does everything a watch should do and the best part is it's very comfortable, doesn't rip out arm hair, and I forget it's even on because it's so seriously light in weight. The battery will last 7 years and replacements are cheap. The back is also removed by 4 small phillips head screws to change the battery.At first I felt like the face was kind of small but after a few days of not snagging on anything I realize that I like it this way. My wrist is a little small so I can't say it will fit everyone, and it's light bulb on the side is very old school design but it least it has a light and won't leave you hanging in the dark. This watch isn't designed to be immersed in water, but some people say it does fine as long as you don't push the buttons. I prefer to not find out..I haven't tried to go through the airport yet with it so I will keep you posted if I get blamed to be a terrorist or something. But hey, if this watch is the official watch of Al-qaeda, then that must say something about it's reliability being preferred for anything requiring a timer...UPDATE: A week after I bought this watch I have noticed that when gently moved next to my ear something is rattling inside of it. Although it still works fine, it's a little disappointing since I have not banged it against anything or have done anything slightly abusive for the matter. I took it back and upgraded to a 5600e G Shock.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.29185972", "2": "0.22116573", "3": "0.12033279", "4": "0.09286394", "5": "0.114142865", "6": "0.15732087"}}
