{"text": "I am so pleased with the Foamtreads Jewel slippers. I have a hard time finding slippers in my size that are also adjustable. Foamtread Jewel style slippers are available in my actual shoe size, the velcro trap provides great adjustablility, and my slkippers do not slip off my heel.  The sole is sturdy and with a tread-style bottom I can step outside and not skip. I bought two pair, one in pink and one in black. I highly recommend these to anyone with problems finding well-fitting slippers!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.072881825", "1": "0.12277086", "2": "0.23114948", "4": "0.10621263", "5": "0.18713017", "6": "0.27692416"}}
