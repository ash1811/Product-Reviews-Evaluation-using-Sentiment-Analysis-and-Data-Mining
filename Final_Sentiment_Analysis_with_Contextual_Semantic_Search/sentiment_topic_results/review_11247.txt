{"text": ".Yes, I've had this boot for several years and it's ooh sooo warm on those frigid winter hunts.  I keep a pair in my car throughout the winter in case of a break-down.  That provides some peace-of-mind of long trips on compact snow and ice here in the Inland Northwest.The boots run a little large, but I expect that is to accommodate heavy wool socks or two pair of socks.  The insert is easily extracted for drying or cleaning, and the leather strap on the upper back portion of the boot helps to get the boot on.  These are an absolute necessity in cold climates.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.15794581", "2": "0.16297111", "3": "0.22116353", "4": "0.1421002", "5": "0.20876159", "6": "0.10463415"}}
