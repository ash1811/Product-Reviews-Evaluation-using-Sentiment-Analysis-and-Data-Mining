{"text": "I bought these for a Colorado river trip. On the raft, they were comfortable and secure. The materials and stitching are good quality. Water drains out quickly. Your feet do get a bit sweaty, but not too bad. With socks, these can be good walking and hiking footwear. The fast-lace system works well, and the straps are comfy and secure around your ankle.Now here's the problem -- and it may be a FATAL FLAW. When you walk on any kind of sand (dry or wet), the shoe fills with sand immediately. This clogs up in the front toe section and under your foot. On a river, little pebbles also get stuck in the shoe. Likewise, on muddy ground the Keens clog up immediately (within a few steps). I noticed that not a single one of the 8 guides on our 3-boat Colorado River trip had shoes like this. They all wore open-toed sandles or regular full-coverage trail-runner shoes. The gaps let the sand in but the toe prevents the sand/mud/pebbles from escaping. I do like these shoes -- for dry land use and yachting. They are comfortable for mountain biking and great for sailing. But the sand issue is a very big problem that makes these a BAD CHOICE for a beach adventure or a river trip where the banks are sandy or have small pebbles.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1782985", "1": "0.24077047", "2": "0.15818383", "3": "0.13049324", "4": "0.10329574", "5": "0.14808886", "6": "0.040869385"}}
