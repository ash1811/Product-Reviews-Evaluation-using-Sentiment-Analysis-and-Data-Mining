{"text": "This watch is everything all the other post mention. Yes, it's true that the circle buttons on the right side are hard to press but the square ones on the left are a bit easier. Auto EL is nice for me since I work at night and I can quickly look over at the Mudman and the light turns on for me. Love the 4 alarm features you can set them by daily, monthly or just one day. Very light some times I forget I'm wearing it but was kind of hoping it was bigger. Other than the buttons which I think will cushion up in time. This is my first G-Shock since I've been shopping for one and was told that this was a good starter for the series. I'm happy with this purchase. ***Update 12/17/2012*** As I said before the buttons are much easier to press now. The only one that doesn't get much use is the actual button to turn the light on in the front since I use auto-EL. I use most of the functions now on a daily basis.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14711738", "2": "0.3021243", "3": "0.17917737", "4": "0.08428863", "5": "0.18908216", "6": "0.09568944"}}
