{"text": "I love this ring because it is believable that i could actually afford a diamond ring like this one and no one would think twice. The ring shines and sparkle beautifully. I've received more compliments than i anticipated. This ring is believable for the average working couple who's on a budget. Let's be real most of us on Amazon looking for a nice deal for our buck well this ring you can't go wrong for the price and on Amazon an upgrade is ssoooo easy to do when we're ready. Just think at these prices an upgrade can be done yearly. If you like change like i do this is an ideal way to purchase wedding rings. Spending 800-1000 on rings you stuck with the same look for years the average working Joe I'm speaking of. That same money i can change up at anytime and not feel guilty about money. The rings are beautiful and came so fast.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.041457567", "1": "0.34512678", "2": "0.17935248", "3": "0.054544304", "4": "0.15369512", "5": "0.1209438", "6": "0.10487993"}}
