{"text": "I really like this brand of wireless bras and have a couple of different style I wear regularly.  I was excited to see that they made a sports bra and really liked that it closed in back like a bra and not slip-on like most sports bras.  However, the whole bra is quite stiff and the fabric a bit rough. I need a bit more comfortableness while working out.  Did seem to give pretty good support while speed walking.  Did not do any aerobics to judge the support in that aspect.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14559537", "1": "0.316309", "2": "0.1512267", "3": "0.3366244", "6": "0.044483233"}}
