{"text": "When Keen's first came on the market in the late 90's early 2000, I bought a pair that lasted me 11 years of hiking, gardening and regular use. The pair I purchased here are a much lower quality, non leather/leather product. Very disappointed in the product. They have done what other companies have done, and cheapened the product to save a nickle. Consumers do notice!!!! Will not buy Keen's again unless they improve their quality and quit trying to sell us crap.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.05960756", "1": "0.15363131", "2": "0.14746127", "3": "0.19593479", "4": "0.13316767", "5": "0.15430962", "6": "0.15588783"}}
