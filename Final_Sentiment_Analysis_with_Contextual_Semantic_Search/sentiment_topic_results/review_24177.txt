{"text": "This bra does what it's suppose to.  Keeps you from moving during exercise.  My husband said, &#34;That's the largest bra I've ever seen!&#34; but you know ... I don't care!  I'm covering it up with a shirt and it's helping keep my breats healthy while I'm movin&#34;!  Reminds me of the 50's-60's bras but it really is comfortable.  4 hooks behind, FYI (normally a 36DD but ordeed a 38DD for fit).  Never did that before but I'm happy with the support!
