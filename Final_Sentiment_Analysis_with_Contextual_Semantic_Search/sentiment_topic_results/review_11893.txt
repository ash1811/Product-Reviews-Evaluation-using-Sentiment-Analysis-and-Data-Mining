{"text": "I love the fit of this shoe and it was very comfortable.  However, the heel is just a fraction too short to wear with most of my dress pants.  :(  I wish they made this exact shoe with a 2 or 2 1/2&#34; heel!  Otherwise a great shoe and if you just want a little lift, the 1&#34; heel is probably an excellent alternative to flats.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16001411", "1": "0.4602396", "2": "0.30729097", "3": "0.05901029"}}
