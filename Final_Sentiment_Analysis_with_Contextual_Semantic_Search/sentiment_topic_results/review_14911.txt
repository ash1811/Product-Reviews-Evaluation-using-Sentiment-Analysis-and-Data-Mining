{"text": "I was looking for a lightweight tote.I could see why people would love this bag for traveling.Purpose for my purchase when I go to sporting events with kids - I could put their jackets in a bag, zip the bag and put it under the seat. The best part is if something spills on the bag I could wipe it off.It looks very very nice better than on the picture.I got it on sale, I think it's worth it even if you have to pay full price for it.I got in red!For me it's a perfect size not too big and not too small and has a zipper.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20178674", "1": "0.31004265", "2": "0.054066405", "3": "0.10150994", "4": "0.16911332", "5": "0.08092149", "6": "0.08255946"}}
