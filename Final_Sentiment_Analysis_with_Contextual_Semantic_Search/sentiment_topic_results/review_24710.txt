{"text": "I have a wide variety of rain gear for multiple usages. I have the heaviest Grundens down to the more medium and all are very durable and made to work in and last. I bought these for light duty and strolls, walking our dog in the rain. They fit fine over my pants (I have a 38 waist) and the length is sufficient for my 34 inseam to keep the moisture out of my waterproof shoes. I will give an update for the durability at a later date. So far I like them very much.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.24410774", "2": "0.2878087", "3": "0.052177943", "4": "0.123985864", "5": "0.2189241", "6": "0.06966245"}}
