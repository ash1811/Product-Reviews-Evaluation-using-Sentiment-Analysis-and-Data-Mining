{"text": "I love Clarks, but do not like to pay mall prices.When these arrived I was impressed. I slipped them on and noticed how snug they felt. However, give them a few days of wear. The leather will conform to a better fit (and loosen up a bit).The arch support is lacking because there is none. Not a great shoe for long periods of standing. Overall, a good quality and simple shoe.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.18742132", "2": "0.16649505", "3": "0.05844164", "4": "0.06106056", "5": "0.35795286", "6": "0.16483875"}}
