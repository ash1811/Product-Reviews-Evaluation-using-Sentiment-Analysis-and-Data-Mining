{"text": "What more can I say? These things are great and you can't complain about the price. They hold up well in the wash and I really appreciate that the neck line does not get all wrinkled while wearing. I have purchased several of these now and plan to keep doing so. The only \"wish\" I have for the product is that I would like to wear my white UA Tech under my dress shirt's but the black UA logo's do what they are supposed to and are very noticeable. I wish they had an option to get the logo's in white. Not a big enough grip to knock any stars off though. Great product!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11326654", "1": "0.29455093", "2": "0.14523505", "3": "0.063923866", "4": "0.10765382", "5": "0.27247548"}}
