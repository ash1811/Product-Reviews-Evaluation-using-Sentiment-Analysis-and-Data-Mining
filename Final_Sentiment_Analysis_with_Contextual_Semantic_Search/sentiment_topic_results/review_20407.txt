{"text": "I bought a very high heal shoes for my wedding, simply because they were gorgeous!  However perhaps because the shoes were brand new they were slipping off the back of my foot even thought I bought just the right size.  Buying the smaller shoe wasn't possible because they would just be too small. Buying different shoes was out of the question only because I loved these so much.  Hence the only choice was to get these heel grips. And I'm very happy I did.  They worked like a charm.  Not only my shoes stopped slipping off, I believe these petals protected the backs of me heel the whole night.  Even after 6 hours of non stop dancing there were no sign of blisters. Great product! And I'm ordering 6 more for my other shoes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.122699454", "1": "0.14431961", "2": "0.1439953", "3": "0.1873932", "4": "0.05939042", "5": "0.18338932", "6": "0.15881273"}}
