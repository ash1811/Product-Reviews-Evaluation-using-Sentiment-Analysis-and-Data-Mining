{"text": "First, in response to all the reviews that state these run larger than normal, the Chinchilla version does not run larger than normal. They are a little wider than normal but NOT longer than normal. I wear 8 1/2 med width and my big toe bumps the end of the shoe in a size 8-9. Which is a bummer for me as I wanted to wear my warm wool socks with these and now I will have to buy the size 9.5-10.5 for my size 8.5 foot if I want to wear socks. Also, I have diabetes so it's not a good thing for my toes to bump the end of the shoe. They are sloppy wide unless I put on socks. The foam insole might be slightly thicker than most but I can tell it's not that good of a quality foam and will compress over a few months. Why can't I find a good quality house shoe that has a good thick dense memory foam type bottom that fits properly size wise? I've tried several ones over the past 2 years. I am wearing these with my wool socks anyway for now and they are keeping my feet warm which is more than others have done, even the expensive sheep wool variety as those don't have enough cushion on the bottoms to keep your feet off the cold floors. These would probably feel good for younger people who haven't lost the fat pads on the bottom of their feet yet. I think for a younger person who doesn't weigh a great amount, these would be good for a christmas present as they would probably last til the next christmas but I'm not sure the style would be to their liking. I am planning on buying these in the next size up as the whole point of this type of house shoe is warmth and comfort and I think wearing these with socks will do the trick. I hope I'm wrong about the foam quality as I want them to last at least a year. From reading reviews, I was expecting a little more foam padding but I do believe these have more than dearfoams. Finally, this review is for the Chinchilla version as the others might be different.UPDATE: I've worn the shoes for 2 weeks now and the foam is compressing already. I would say these shoes are like the dearfoams you can pick up at walmart or on sale at xmas time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.19254898", "1": "0.33317536", "2": "0.09222739", "3": "0.17840327", "4": "0.064874634", "5": "0.053062674", "6": "0.08570774"}}
