{"text": "The standard 8926 is listed in Invicta's 2008 catalog as having a 43mm diameter and this 3044 is listed as having a 47mm diameter crown, which doesn't seem like much difference, just 4mm.  Well, the 4mm makes a huge difference. The images in Invicta's catalog don't come close to showing how big the face of this watch is, compared to the standard 8926. Also with the bigger face, the luminous hour markers are bigger than those on the 8926, making the face brighter and easier to read in the dark. The bracelet is scaled bigger too, compared to the bracelet on the 8926, 22mm vs 20mm. The hinge on the bracelet is a precision made hinge instead of the stamped sheet hinge of the 8926.  The exhibition case back, as on the 8926, is a nice touch for us automatic watch fans. The watch has a diving helmet on the face and band. The Invicta name is prominent on the face, side of the case and clasp. The scalloped edge bezel similar to an Omega. It is a pretty watch on it's own, styled much like classic Swiss diving watches.  The automatic movement, especially with the viewing window on the back of the case, is for us old school automatic watch enthusiasts.  Being an automatic it will not keep time as precise as a quartz watch.  I have found mine to be one minute per week fast, which is acceptable for an automatic for me.  I was looking for an automatic diver with a big easy to read face, classic styling, reasonably priced, this works for me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.074964434", "1": "0.13030118", "2": "0.13491778", "3": "0.17289814", "4": "0.20328836", "5": "0.07102694", "6": "0.21260321"}}
