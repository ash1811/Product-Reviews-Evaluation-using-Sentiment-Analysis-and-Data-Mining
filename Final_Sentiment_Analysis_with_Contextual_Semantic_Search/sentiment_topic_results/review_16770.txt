{"text": "Bought 6 of these for groomsman gift. Something I new they wouldn't have but every gentleman should have. A dress watch. The only thing I didn't like about the watch was the small cheap wrist-band. My wife bought me a silver Bulove same style as wedding gift and the band was top notch on mine. The band that comes with these will need to be replaced but the price is great!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.2589968", "1": "0.22860014", "2": "0.116663046", "3": "0.1441245", "5": "0.15345353", "6": "0.09406761"}}
