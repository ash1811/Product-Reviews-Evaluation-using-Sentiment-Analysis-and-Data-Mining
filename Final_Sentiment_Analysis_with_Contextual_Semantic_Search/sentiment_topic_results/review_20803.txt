{"text": "I did some research and the reviews were spot on!  Good quality and very real looking.  Shirt opens/closes with Velcro, pants are elastic waist.  My son has been in and out of it 10 times a day since he got it.  Quality is what you would expect for the price - belt is pretty flimsy and will most likely break soon.  Trim on the hat needed a little reinforcement.  Love the POLICE on the back.  Great for the price!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.39420664", "2": "0.10371834", "3": "0.13392375", "4": "0.15028782", "5": "0.123831965", "6": "0.090618506"}}
