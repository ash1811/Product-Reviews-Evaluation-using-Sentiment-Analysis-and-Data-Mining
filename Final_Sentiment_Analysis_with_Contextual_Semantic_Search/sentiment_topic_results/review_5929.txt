{"text": "I bought these for my wife to spice things up a bit. As a bonus I thought that maybe she'd like them and find them comfortable. I was hoping for kind of an old school, traditional / conservative look. They do look great on her, as everything does. However, they're made of a rather thin material, and simply weren't quite as sexy as I had imagined. Additionally she doesn't really care for them because they wear so high that they hang out of her jeans / pants. However, these issues may not be a problem for you, and I can see how some women would find these to be perfect.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.10509234", "1": "0.34351128", "2": "0.16895683", "3": "0.17625803", "4": "0.14199753", "5": "0.061472725"}}
