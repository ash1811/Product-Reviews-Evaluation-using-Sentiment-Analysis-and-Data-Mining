{"text": "I purchased two sets of these midweight thermals in August of 2012 and after two winters' use decided to purchase two more. They have served me well and I am very satisfied with the fit and durability over that time period. The only hiccup I have had was a month or so ago, I nicked my overalls and thermals while cutting firewood with a chainsaw. Iron-on patches took care of both and I will get at least another winter or more out of them (leg was not touched). This past winter was rather severe and the only time that I had to put on another layer (insulated Carhartt overalls) while plowing snow with my ATV during single digit days .", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.27761722", "2": "0.091104575", "3": "0.1348342", "4": "0.08182112", "5": "0.20410734", "6": "0.20504422"}}
