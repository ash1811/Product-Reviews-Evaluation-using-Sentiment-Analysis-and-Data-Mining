{"text": "These are the best boots ever! Most comfortable, warmest, durable! I started my search for boots after playing in the Wisconsin snow with my daughter and my feet were frozen.  I probably had not played in the snow since I was a kid.  I researched these ordered them and now have 2 pair that have lasted 2 years no problems.  Be aware order a size smaller!  I am usually a 6.5 I ordered a 6 and they work great but my friend order a 9 (she is usually a 8.5 and hers are too big!) I read in the description to order smaller she didn't read that. The cost is worth it the quality is superior to anything out there!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13776389", "1": "0.19542487", "2": "0.092406824", "3": "0.15767068", "4": "0.18595332", "5": "0.18854663", "6": "0.042233776"}}
