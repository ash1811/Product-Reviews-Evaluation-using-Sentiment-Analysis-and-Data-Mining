It would be fine if you could wear the gloves on either hand, or if the label was removable, but neither of these are possible. The labels are itchy and annoying. Other than that the gloves are nice as liners, and I use them frequently (I've actually come to not even notice the labels being there).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07739724", "1": "0.27883506", "2": "0.2834529", "3": "0.059593074", "4": "0.15507245", "5": "0.14143963"}}
