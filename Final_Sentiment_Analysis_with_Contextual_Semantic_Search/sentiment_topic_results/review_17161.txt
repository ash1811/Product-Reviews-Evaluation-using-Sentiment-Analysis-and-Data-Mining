{"text": "Been using this style for awhile now and I must say this bag has never let me down yet. Tons of storage in it, pretty much holds everything I need. The main compartment I can always stuff to bursting and and it's  still comfy to haul around cross-body like I do. Not surprised this style endures. This brand is Extremely well made and seems to last forever. When I retire this bag, I still have to find another worthy Kipling replacement for this.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"2": "0.36802384", "3": "0.26541534", "4": "0.16818573", "5": "0.05709108", "6": "0.13541643"}}
