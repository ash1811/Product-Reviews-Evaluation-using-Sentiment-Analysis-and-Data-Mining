{"text": "I recently received this watch as a replacement to one I had about ten years ago.  I love it.  It isn't the strongest watch.  the plastic scratches and the band breaks fairly easy but for the price and the elegant look I like how it feels and the watch keeps perfect time.  It is also light as a feather.CSL", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.17694657", "1": "0.14067121", "2": "0.18688221", "3": "0.1391728", "4": "0.24192472", "6": "0.109786294"}}
