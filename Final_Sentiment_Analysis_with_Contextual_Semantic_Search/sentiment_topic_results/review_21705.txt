{"text": "I bought this pendant to match sterling earrings I purchased at Amazon.  The pendant is very nice.  Some of the reviewers were not satisfied with the chain, but I found it very satisfactory.  The sterling oval on the pendant is larger than that found on the earrings.  Just the right size as far as I'm concerned.  You can't go wrong by purchasing this pendant and the matching earrings.  They are perfect together.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.3538241", "1": "0.13088", "4": "0.11324635", "5": "0.2777759", "6": "0.116035"}}
