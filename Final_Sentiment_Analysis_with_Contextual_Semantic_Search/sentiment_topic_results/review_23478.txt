{"text": "I bought 2 of these watches from Amazon and bought different colored bezel inserts from eBay.  They are great watches and look and feel like a Rolex.  The automatic movement is accurate to within a few seconds per day and they keep great time as long as you wind them or wear them.I visited the local Rolex dealer and handled many watches.  The look and feel of the invicta closely matches the Rolex.  The weight of this watch is only a few grams different.  The bracelet is about the same weight and feel as the Rolex. People who say this watch is cheap wont like a Rolex.Invicta has QC issues in my opinion.  If you receive a watch that does not meet your expectations send it back to Amazon right away and order another.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1813869", "1": "0.2156067", "2": "0.1548604", "4": "0.18473633", "5": "0.12801565", "6": "0.13315082"}}
