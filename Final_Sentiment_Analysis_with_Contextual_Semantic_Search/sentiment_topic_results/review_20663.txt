{"text": "I ordered two of these belts for general casual wear.  They are well made for their price and seem to work quite well. The webbing is somewhat lighter that another similar belt I purchased, but the buckle has a lot better finished on these belts. The buckle is highly polished and comes with a protective plastic over the face of it for shipping protection.  They are infinitely adjustable, and the length can be shortened simply by cutting the end that attaches to the buckle.  Both belts were delivered promptly and in good condition.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13550344", "1": "0.23366155", "2": "0.23603356", "4": "0.09814308", "5": "0.1292906", "6": "0.16444151"}}
