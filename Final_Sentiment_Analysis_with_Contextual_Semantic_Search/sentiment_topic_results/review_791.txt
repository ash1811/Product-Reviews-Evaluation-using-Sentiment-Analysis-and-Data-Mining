{"text": "Wacoal Halo is the best-fitting bra I've ever worn, even as I've lost or gained weight and moved up/down in band size. I purchased my first one over 10 years ago and although I've owned (and still do) many others, Halo is my go-to bra for everyday wear. They're very well made, holding up well through laundering, the fit never varies and the lace pattern even works under T-shirts. What more could I want? The strapless Halo fits just the same, which is another plus.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.063099116", "1": "0.20311296", "3": "0.26046255", "4": "0.20069022", "5": "0.1330292", "6": "0.1371334"}}
