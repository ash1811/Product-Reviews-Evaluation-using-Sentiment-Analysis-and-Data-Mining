{"text": "I have had a few swim diapers now and I would not recommend this particular one.PROS:Snaps on the right side make this SO much easier to put on, and more importantly, take off once it's wet and clings to baby's skin.It is made of a waterproof outer shell and a breathable inner shell that wicks moisture away from baby's skin (great for just hanging out pool/beach-side; obviously doesn't wick away moisture once baby's submerged in the water, but I can't imagine any product that would be able to do so.)CONS:The outer and inner materials I just mentioned above are extremely thin - not intended to hold or absorb any pee or poo. For that, there is an absorbent liner in between these two layers - but it doesn't come up to the top of of the diaper in the front or the back - it just covers a small portion in the middle of the diaper. So, even the tiniest of bowel movements seem destined to immediately turn into blow-outs/accidents in this diaper due to this poor coverage.NOTE: This is very different from other iPlay swim diapers I've had, where the entire product functions as a diaper with absorbent material throughout. I'm not sure why this one is so shoddily made, but it doesn't seem to be a one-off mistake, either - the first one of these I received actually had two little poo stains on it (gross, of course - but Amazon's fantastic customer service replaced it immediately). So, I've now received two of these diapers and both of them are made in this shoddy way.Another possible con is that these seem to run very small: my 4 mo wears the 12 mo size. But if you're careful about ordering, this is not necessarily a big deal - check the iPlay size chart and purchase based on their weight recommendations, not the age recommendations.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.066566974", "1": "0.2498559", "2": "0.134688", "3": "0.15830366", "4": "0.086328454", "5": "0.23828599", "6": "0.065971"}}
