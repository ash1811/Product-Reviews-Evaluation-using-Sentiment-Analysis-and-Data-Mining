{"text": "I will admit I have only had it one day but so far I love it.  The color is great.  It wasn't difficult to program ONCE you read the directions.  I like the 2nd time zone and the fact that it has a timer AND a stopwatch.  Date and day of week show but with a quick push of the top right button one can see the month as well.  I like the beep at the hour.  Helps keep me on track.  I plan to wear every day except for dressier functions.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.21651587", "2": "0.19910674", "3": "0.14433534", "4": "0.2207145", "6": "0.21309027"}}
