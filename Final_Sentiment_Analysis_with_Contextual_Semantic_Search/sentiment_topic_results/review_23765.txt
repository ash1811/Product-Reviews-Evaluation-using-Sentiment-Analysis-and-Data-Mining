{"text": "Let me just say that I can often wear an 8.5 Medium in most shoes... but I often look for a wide and usually find them even more comfortable.  Depends on the shoe.I have a BROWN pair of these Eastland shoes in 8.5 Medium that I bought some years ago.  I don't wear them often so they are still new-looking... and they fit me perfect. I could stand or walk all day in them.  The problem is I don't wear brown shoes very much and tend to prefer black.So I wanted a pair in black and it's easier to find wide shoes online these days so I ordered the black in wide.  Not only were they smaller than the brown 8.5 Medium I already own... I could barely get them on!!  This sizing is so off it's ridiculous.  Many of the more recent reviewers have the same complaints.  I guess they are sizing them differently of late... and not for the better.I will also say that I ordered some other \"wide\" styles from the Eastland site and had to send them ALL back... they were impossibly narrow.  And it was costly to send them back!  I decided I was done with Eastland for online ordering since their sizing is no longer trustworthy.If you have a SUPER NARROW foot... MAYBE they will fit you.  Maybe not.  But I will say this is a high quality street shoe that is excellent for standing long periods or walking... but until they correct the sizing issue... I am taking my business elsewhere.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.102558866", "1": "0.4612436", "2": "0.13022625", "3": "0.1345968", "4": "0.12888229", "6": "0.040060185"}}
