{"text": "Due to hereditary foot conditions I cannot wear dainty pretty little sandals on the beach or in spas. :/  I have to wear a shoe that will support my foot and can accommodate custom orthopedics.These are great for exploring rocky beaches or while snorkeling in shallow waters.  I also wear these in spa settings to prevent potential athlete's foot bacteria that is often present in those warm humid environments.I particularly love the bright turquoise color and quality durability expected from the Speedo brand.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16978778", "1": "0.21750462", "2": "0.14230265", "3": "0.15589662", "4": "0.164585", "5": "0.04153387", "6": "0.10838946"}}
