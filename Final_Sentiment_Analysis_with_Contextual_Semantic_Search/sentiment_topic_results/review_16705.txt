{"text": "I love these boots.  I have large calfs, (15 inch).  After loosening the laces on the size 8 boots they fit fine.  Snug but feels good even with skinny jeans underneath. The buckle is on the loosest band.  They are beautiful and good quality with nice laces.  I liked them so much I bought a second pair for my friend and she loves them as we'll (she also has large calfs).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14549157", "1": "0.35027257", "3": "0.16376427", "4": "0.23958962", "5": "0.05556641", "6": "0.04179312"}}
