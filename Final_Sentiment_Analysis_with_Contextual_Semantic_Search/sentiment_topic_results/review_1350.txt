{"text": "These shoes are the best. I bought a red pair eight years ago and although they are beginning to show some wear, they are still going strong. So I decided to get the next pair, and they are exactly like the first pair but I got a new fabulous color. Bougainvillea aka periwinkle:) Awesome. Fit perfect! I am very impressed Keen is controlling quality so well for all these years.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.089929424", "1": "0.3747727", "2": "0.07022825", "3": "0.19669366", "5": "0.15153293", "6": "0.11325228"}}
