{"text": "I purchased these shorts as a gift for my husband for Christmas. They fit as expected/described. My husband works out 5-7 days per week and wears these shorts all the time. It has been a year now and they are still in perfect condition. I have bought more :) Note these are not the long basketball type shorts, they are above the knee type (which my husband prefers).", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.25891015", "1": "0.31543764", "3": "0.26423442", "4": "0.14798807"}}
