{"text": "I normally wear a 10.5 or 11, but based on reviews, bought these a little smaller in size 10. They are snug, but feel great, especially on bare feet. I do a lot of ballroom dancing and often have sore feet. After long dance practice sessions, these boots cradle my sore soles in luxuriously soft sheepskin. Sometimes, I even wear them in the house like slippers because they are so comfortable. You can look at the knock offs and imitations, but real Uggs are worth every penny. My recommendation is not to compromise.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.118048884", "1": "0.17845435", "2": "0.17231548", "3": "0.18988448", "4": "0.24440391", "6": "0.09418828"}}
