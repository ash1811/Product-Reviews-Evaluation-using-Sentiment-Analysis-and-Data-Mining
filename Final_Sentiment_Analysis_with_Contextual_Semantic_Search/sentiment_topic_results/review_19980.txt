{"text": "Simply put, this is an awesome backpack. I carry it to work every day, loaded with all my downtime gear...smartphone, Kindle, iPod. I even put some work related things in it from time to time. Fully packed it still has a fairly slim profile; not bulging out of its regular, striking shape. I've gotten many compliments on mine and a few people have even asked where I got it. A well made, good looking bag at a very good price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.18377532", "1": "0.16121425", "2": "0.14533071", "3": "0.20379506", "4": "0.20325595", "5": "0.09964711"}}
