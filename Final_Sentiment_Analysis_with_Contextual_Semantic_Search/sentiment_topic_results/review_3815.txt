{"text": "I'm a minimalist wallet kind of guy. I was looking for something to hold about ten cards (credit/ID/medical) and a few bills. And I wanted them all to be easy to access. The wallets I've found so far are either too bulky or require bills to be carefully folded. Once I placed a couple of cards in this wallet, getting bills in and out of the center fold was nearly impossible.I designed and made my own duct-tape wallet which works perfectly and which will have to suffice until I can find a more durable (and classy...) leather equivalent.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.11807492", "2": "0.35987452", "3": "0.12242095", "4": "0.1933761", "5": "0.101685315", "6": "0.10163916"}}
