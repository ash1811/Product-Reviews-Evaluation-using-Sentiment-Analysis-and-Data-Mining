{"text": "My girls wanted to be Doc McStuffins for Halloween however I thought the costume was cheesy so we bought this lab coat put some patches and a name tag on it and it is Perfect!  It is well made and holds up great.  I even bought an extra one for my daughter to take to school and use as an art shirt, It fits better than &#34;an old shirt&#34;...Long so it protects clothing and much easier for her to move her arms in.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08397508", "1": "0.1843565", "2": "0.25520253", "3": "0.11953856", "4": "0.10517782", "5": "0.24849485"}}
