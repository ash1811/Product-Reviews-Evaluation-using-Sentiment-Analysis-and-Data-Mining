{"text": "The Good:  I haven't worn jeans in a long time and thought these would be great to get back into the world of denim.  I picked my traditional waist and leg lenght and they fit perfect.  The material is good quality and they feel somewhat broken in already, not stiff or scratchy.  I love them and will buy another pair soon.The Bad:  The material, while good quality, might seem a little thin and prone to wearing out.  Time will tell but I think I will be happy with these jeans for a long time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.052408904", "1": "0.52410895", "2": "0.05137668", "4": "0.15452057", "5": "0.118456624", "6": "0.096362844"}}
