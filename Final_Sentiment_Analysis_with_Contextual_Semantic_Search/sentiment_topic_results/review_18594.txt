{"text": "*Update: The hat is too small - water dripped into my eyes.  The length is just too short, the part of the pants that cover my thigh is drenched.------------------------------------------------------------------------I got this raincoat as a gift.  The yellow raincoat is just what I've been looking for.  It is the kind of raincoat you see sailors wear it all the time at the sea.  I love the design and the color - with wellington rubber boots, the combo makes anyone looks snappy.I can never wear this raincoat during summer though, it is totally unbreathable.  It made from very tough material and is heavy (it weighs 3.25 pounds) for even size XS.The raincoat is also super huge - must order a size down.Another issue of this coat is the length - I guess they can't make it anymore longer because of the weight of the material, but it really does not cover it all. Parts of my thigh are not covered by the raincoat and the rain soaks right into the fabric of my jeans and it is a horrible feeling to wait for it to dry up.Overall, it is an excellent raincoat and will last you for a lifetime.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.30306482", "1": "0.0855623", "2": "0.05885617", "3": "0.15240024", "4": "0.24441409", "5": "0.07182089", "6": "0.0838815"}}
