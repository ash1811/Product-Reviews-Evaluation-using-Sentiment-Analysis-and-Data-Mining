{"text": "These shirts not only breathe - even on unbearably hot days - but they FIT! And I don't mean tight. There's plenty of room in them. My guy has very very broad shoulders, he's tall with a long torso, and he's got a bit of a belly. We weren't expecting much, but these are just wonderful. The bottom of the shirt falls about 4&#34; or more below the bottom of his belt. Perfect for the big, the tall, and the big and tall.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.43408385", "2": "0.17124693", "4": "0.11092089", "5": "0.19546789", "6": "0.080925405"}}
