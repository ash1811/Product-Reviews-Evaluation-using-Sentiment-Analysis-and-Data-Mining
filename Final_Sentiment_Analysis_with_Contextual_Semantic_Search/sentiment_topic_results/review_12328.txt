{"text": "Overall, I am pretty happy with this unit because it works reliably.  I tried one other brand of watch winder and it did not work as it was supposed to.  This Tech Swiss unit will wind your watch and not overwind it.There are two things I do not like about this unit.  First, it is big.  I would have liked it if they managed to make it a bit smaller.  Secondly, the insert that you attach the watch band around has a very powerful spring.  I managed to actually damage the band on my Seiko watch while fiddling with it.  I now know how to do it without causing this damage, but a kinder, gentler insert spring would have prevented my klutziness from allowing this to happen.  (The watch was easily and cheaply repaired.)Overall, this is a good unit, especially for the money, but be careful when you work that spring.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22049086", "1": "0.20973225", "2": "0.10737682", "3": "0.13991813", "4": "0.026820455", "5": "0.21688989", "6": "0.078771554"}}
