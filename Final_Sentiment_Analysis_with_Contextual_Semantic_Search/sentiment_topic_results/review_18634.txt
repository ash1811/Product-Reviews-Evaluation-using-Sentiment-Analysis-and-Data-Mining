{"text": "This scarf is cheap and that is its best attribute.  It is absolutely useless for any form of protection. In fact, it is so thin that is practically thread bare. You can actually see through it. The Sellers markup on this product must be tremendous. I would have returned it but in addition to the return postage they have the nerve to charge you a 15% restocking fee (as if to throw this piece rubbish back on the shelf is worth a couple of bucks). Like most foreign products this scarf is not only a waste of money but also a piece of trash - you get what you pay for. BUY U.S.A. - you may pay a bit more but you get a reliable & substantial product.
