{"text": "Wonder why other brands like adidas, fila, and Wilson, come larger in waist although being L (large). This XL short has a smaller waist than all other L shorts I've bought. The problem is that, other than the waist, they are certainly XL. So I can't advice to get a larger or a smaller size than your actual size. I just don't recomend this product. It's not well proportioned.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13788098", "2": "0.16841182", "3": "0.29835808", "4": "0.041272894", "5": "0.26173773", "6": "0.08856375"}}
