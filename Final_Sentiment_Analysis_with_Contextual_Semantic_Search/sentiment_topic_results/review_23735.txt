{"text": "I purchased this 3pack in the midst of a mini aviator shopping spree on Amazon, at the end of the day purchasing about 7 pairs for a bit under $30 (3 pairs were with this product, for about $13).When I received them, I expected them to be cheap, flimsy aviators with possible lens issues (too dark, for example), which is exactly what I paid for.  Instead I was pleasantly surprised to find these pairs felt a bit more durable than the average &lt;$5 pair of glasses, and the lenses were great.  I obviously haven't worn them too extensively since I've only had them for about a week, but so far no apparent wear and tear after about 4 wears each.I got this 3 pack to experiment with some color combos, and while I personally don't think the black frames look as good on me as the silver or gold frames, that's certainly no fault of the product, just a personal preference.  The other two pairs instantly become the top two of the 7 I ordered (from various manufacturers), and I'd definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for low-price but medium-quality (and I say that in a good way) chrome aviators.***EDIT: Now that I've had these glasses for several months, I'm still really enjoying them.  They haven't shown any sign of wear or tear.  The chrome on the lens is still as vibrant as when I first got them, despite having a few trials with sweat and (salt) water.For general glare reduction from the front, they work well with some moderate reduction.  I don't think there is any UV protection. With glare from behind, the inner lenses can catch some of that and cause some distraction, but I don't really mind it too much.I still think they look like premium aviators.  When I need new ones I will definitely purchase these again, and I'm even considering buying some more colors to fill out my repertoire.I hope this review has been helpful :)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.2787606", "1": "0.148537", "3": "0.23933937", "4": "0.05721913", "5": "0.1783692", "6": "0.095457606"}}
