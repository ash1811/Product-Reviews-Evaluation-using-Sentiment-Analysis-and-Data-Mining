{"text": "This is the 3rd pair of these that I have gotten, and each has been a positive experience. They last over a year, when worn daily. I never needed to polish them. The shine on these stays, and when scuffed, simple rubbing with a cloth or paper towel gets the shine back. These are waterproof as well, for everyday use, even those that doesn't seem to be advertised anywhere. Great value for $50 or less.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.121208034", "1": "0.22157316", "2": "0.12297976", "3": "0.060941175", "4": "0.124888495", "5": "0.16984941", "6": "0.17856"}}
