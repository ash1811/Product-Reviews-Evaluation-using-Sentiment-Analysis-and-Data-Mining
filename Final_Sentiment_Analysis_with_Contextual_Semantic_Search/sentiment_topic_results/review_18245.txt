{"text": "2009 - I love it, its better than I expected, light and shiny... I still cant believe how cheap it was... go for it!!!2012 - UPDATE: I bought this watch 3 years ago... and wow, it was a long run... today it stopped working, i dont know if its the battery or may be it just broke 'cause i used to drop it alot... the point is, it really handled lots of things for a 30 dollar watch. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT !!! Unfortunately, wont be repairing it anytime soon so Im switching to INVICTA.Loved this watch and will miss it a lot :'(", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.226803", "1": "0.25233242", "2": "0.25458035", "4": "0.08380433", "5": "0.043343343", "6": "0.13666126"}}
