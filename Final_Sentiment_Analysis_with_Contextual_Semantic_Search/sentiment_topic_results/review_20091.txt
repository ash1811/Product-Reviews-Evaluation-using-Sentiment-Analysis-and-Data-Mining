{"text": "All Carhartts are sized differently no matter where you buy them and always have.  Be careful that you know what size you wear for each different style before ordering.  We knew ahead of time which style size we wanted, and amazon saved us the 60 mile drive to the nearest CalRanch to purchase these.  This particular style is the closest to the hub's actual size.  They are PLENTY long.  That being said. Carhartts are the only pants I buy my husband.  They are as tough as they say. You can walk through a field of burrs and not feel them, and they are great in the snow.  Highly recommended as long as you know your size, because EVERY STYLE IS DIFFERENT.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.02946768", "1": "0.23570634", "2": "0.07461813", "3": "0.21520083", "4": "0.18486832", "5": "0.11412162", "6": "0.14601704"}}
