{"text": "We have been using this hat on our toddler boy for a year with a great results. He was a bit over one year old when we ordered him a 6-24 sand black color play hat for the hot northern Virginia summer. It was a little bit big on him, but it did the job well, and provided a great shade on his face and neck.Now on our second summer, he is wearing the same hat practically every day -- especially at a recent weeklong outing to an island with lots of beaches. Despite going strong for two summers, this hat still looks new, and our son loves it. He can put up a fuss about wearing things he doesn't like, but this hat has his seal of approval. He wore it in the water a lot as well, not to mention playing in the sand on the beach for days in a row. He also wears when playing in the yard.The sand/black color was a great decision, since it is not too sensitive to dirt or schmutz. He can get it dirty and it's barely noticeable. It is easy to wash by hand and dries easily overnight. We had a lot of comments and questions from other parents on the beach, wanting to know where they could get one. So next year we will definitely order the next size up and keep this one for a future little brother or sister.The only trouble is that they are only in kids' sizes. I really need sun protection for my head and neck, being susceptible to cancers and whatnot. One of these in an adult XXXL size would be just what the doctor ordered.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.12479708", "1": "0.42053476", "2": "0.08844048", "3": "0.20751098", "4": "0.06839498", "5": "0.08808754"}}
