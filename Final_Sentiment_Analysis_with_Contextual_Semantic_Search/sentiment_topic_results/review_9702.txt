{"text": "Problem is I put it on the ground and it moves when you put your shoe through it.  It has screws to mount it but I can not use that application.

It is truly a \"Boot Brush\" with the high sides which would be fine for a work boot or sneaker but I would do better with a straight across brush since we use flip flops and sandles much of the time and the sides are too high for those type of shoes.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.17221192", "2": "0.2976111", "4": "0.19621807", "5": "0.19286244", "6": "0.13511685"}}
