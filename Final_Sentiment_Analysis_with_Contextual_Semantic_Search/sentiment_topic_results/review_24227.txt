{"text": "Disclaimer: You need to size up in this bra and brand! At least, I had to. I normally wear a 42F in other brands, but 44DD in this bra is perfect for me. The standard rule of going up a band size & down a cup size than normal for a sports bra definitely applies here. If you buy your \"normal\" size, the bra will likely be very uncomfortable, especially under the arms.On to my review. This is the only bra I will ever buy again, for both exercise and daily wear. I have had my bras for two years. I bought them in black. They are still like new. No fading. No stretching. No holes. No pulled fabric. No slouchy straps. No joke. My \"girls\" are in the same place they were when I put my bra on in the morning- high and beautiful. Most bras sag and stretch by the end of the day, and have to be tossed after a year or less of wear. Not these. I hand wash these to preserve them even more. But seriously, they give firm support but are incredibly comfortable IF you buy the right size.These wick away moisture like it is nobody's business. I am one of those girls who sweats. It's just a fact. This is the ONLY bra that isn't damp at the end of the day when I take it off. Maybe that's TMI, but most of you ladies really do want this info for yourselves, I just know it. ;)I love the fact that these come in four colors in my size. That is extremely rare.These look fine as a sports bra, but also work beautifully under clothing. Really. There is no little ribbon to poke through your tee shirt (pretty as that ribbon is, it's completely unnecessary). This bra makes the chest area look firm and fit- trust me, you will have no \"bra hangover\" with this, either on the sides or on the girls (nothing makes a woman look worse than \"spilling over\" and having underarm flab hanging out). It is as firm on the sides as it is on the girls. That said, it doesn't give you the uni-bo*b look.The support in this bra is amazing, and aids in relieving back pain from a heavier chest, if you have that issue.Hope this review helps!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.09312465", "1": "0.14802298", "2": "0.09354128", "3": "0.43887025", "4": "0.076859616", "5": "0.09077355", "6": "0.058807634"}}
