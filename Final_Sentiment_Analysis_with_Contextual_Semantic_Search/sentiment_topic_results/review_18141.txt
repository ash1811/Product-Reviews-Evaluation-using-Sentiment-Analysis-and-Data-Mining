{"text": "I purchased this watch simply based upon the reviews and price. It is not what I was expecting based upon the other reviews.First off, this watch will not be mistaken for a \"valuable\" timepiece. I paid $10 and that is exactly what it is, a $10 watch.Second, the resin band is absolutely terrible. It is uncomfortable and makes my wrist extremely sweaty. It does not, however, pinch hair like my metal bracelet watches. I am going to replace this band with a black Timex Expedition band, which is a cloth fastwrap style and has proven to be the ultimate in watch comfort (I prefer the lack of shape and structure the cloth band allows for, or the rigidity of a bracelet.)The fit and finish of the watch are on par for Casio. Resin case, standard white face, black hands, black numerals. Easy to read even in low light (no backlighting or glow paint.)Pros:LightEasy to readCHEAPCons:Plastic-y feel (Think \"Made in China\" and although most products are, this has that particularly light and chintzy feel to it)Resin band/case (The lugs for the band on this can break off)Overall:A decent buy for $10 with free shipping. If you like resin bands you will find this watch decent. Otherwise, another $10 on a decent band and this watch will be acceptable for daily wear, although it will probably end up in the drawer while a $50 Fossil Chronograph rides upon my wrist (which is a better investment for my needs.)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.19517602", "1": "0.106863365", "2": "0.16217214", "3": "0.13245104", "4": "0.18428698", "5": "0.13641211", "6": "0.08263836"}}
