{"text": "My daughter is happy to finally get a pair.  UGG's have been around a long time with a somewhat weird staying power.  I am older and personally not in but no doubt these boots are the best brand you can buy concerning this style.  The seller shipped fast and I am very pleased.  One thing to note, my daughter is a average width size 9.  I ordered a 8 because of other reviews suggesting sizing down and they fit perfectly because the kids wear them barefoot.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21162772", "1": "0.30883843", "2": "0.12930769", "3": "0.12643841", "5": "0.18585244", "6": "0.034726527"}}
