{"text": "This is a very well made shirt.  The design is very well thought out and the fit is as expected.  I am between a large and a medium and the large is just too big in the body.  This medium fits great In the body but a little snug in the chest and shoulders.  It is a lighter weight than the other denim shirts I have, but, it is still a great shirt to own.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.6038477", "2": "0.046024036", "3": "0.083915964", "4": "0.08454315", "6": "0.17270954"}}
