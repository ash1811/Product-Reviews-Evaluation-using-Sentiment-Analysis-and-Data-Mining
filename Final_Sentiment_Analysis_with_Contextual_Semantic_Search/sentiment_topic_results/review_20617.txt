{"text": "Used this to dye some Coach leather goods that I own and I just wanted to make a couple of meaningful points.A little goes a long way, andf this small bottle will dye a ton of leather things.  So, if you are on the fence about getting one or two bottles, get one.It runs a tad darker than you'd think.  So, medium brown, like I got, is very brown.  Hard to explain, but I'm just letting you know if you are on the fence about going lighter or darker, go lighter.Like the other reviewer said, this stuff is very hard to get out.  Once it dries on the leather, it dries firmly and does not rub off.  You could buy the leather cleaner tp prep the leather befor applying this product, but I did what many online sites mention and used baby wipes, pre-moistened and unscented.  They work wonders on all leather and it's a good tip to use them.  Then, once dry, apply this dye.The dobber they give you with this small bottle is very excellent for small areas (less than  a few inches across) or for piping.edging.  For larger surfaces, you;ll want to buy a few cheap disposable foam paint brushes.Don't for a second get this on your hands (it takes a week to come off totally), on the floor, or even in your sink  My stainless steel sink got some from my washing up, and it;s still there a month later.  No amount of ammonia and scrubbing seems to take it off, but some Soft Scrub and elbow grease has it improved.  And it stains instantly, so best to do this outdoors.I also use Leather Honey for general mosturizing and care, and I've written a review of that product, it;s colorless, odorless, and is slightly oily, it is like clear honey when you put it on, and I like it, too, very much.
