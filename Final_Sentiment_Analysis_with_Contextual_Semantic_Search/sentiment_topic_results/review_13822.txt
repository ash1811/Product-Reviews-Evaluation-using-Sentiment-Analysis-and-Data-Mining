{"text": "....  it isn't the most accurate.Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love this watch, it is my favourite in my collectionit's built like a tank and after one year of workday wear isn't showing any wearor scratches at all. Put this watch on your right wrist and another watch on yourleft, and you will feel the weight of it alright.If I only had one watch, this would be the one, but I get bored and need variety inmy life so I have 9 and rotate them all. My most accurate is a cheap Casio digital.I haven't got a watch winder so when I'm not using the Orange Monster during the day,I wear it to bed at night and in the morning when I shower and shave and then useanother watch. This way it gets a wind up.I recommend this watch if you are looking for one that can take a beating, and like meyou do physical work and are always knocking your watch around. I've broken quite a fewin my lifetime. If you don't like a heavy lump on your wrist that builds up your muscles, thatglows in the dark like a coven of fireflies, that causes grown manly men to sigh in envy andin the wearing of it makes you feel like you mean business, then don't even consider thiswatch, it's not for you,I was hesitant before buying this watch, thinking it was too garish and bulky, but it grows onyou to the point where you never want to take it off, and indeed I have worn it for weeks onend. It's an 'Orange Monster'!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04316065", "1": "0.038887527", "2": "0.43670726", "3": "0.066910796", "5": "0.21169707", "6": "0.20015559"}}
