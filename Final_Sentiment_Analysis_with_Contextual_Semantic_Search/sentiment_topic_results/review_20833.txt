{"text": "I was hoping 10M would fit me, I'm 150-lbs and 5'6\" in need of pants that don't gap in the lower back. Unfortunately these were too snug in the thigh for me to determine if the waist would or would not be an issue. They were also 2 inches too long even in my highest heel boots. So I returned them. I need to be thinner and taller for these, I'm sure they are otherwise awesome.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11779855", "1": "0.16471301", "2": "0.09284002", "3": "0.20577702", "4": "0.113439", "5": "0.07952727", "6": "0.22590514"}}
