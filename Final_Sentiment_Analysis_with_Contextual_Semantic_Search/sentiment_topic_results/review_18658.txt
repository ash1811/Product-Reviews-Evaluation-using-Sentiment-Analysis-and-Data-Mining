{"text": "Alright, I have no basis with which to really judge a shemagh.  I ordered one to create  costume and it worked perfectly for that.  However, as an avid traveler I could easily see how one of these would come in handy for a backpacking trip (hostel backpacking or legit backpacking).  It works great to keep sun and other elements out.  Also, could easily be used to sit on picnic style or use as a very light blanket.  It is very light material as well.All in all this worked out to be perfect for me.  If you wear these as part of your religion or ethnicity I imagine you will have much more experience with shemaghs than I do, but this seems to be a well made shemagh.It gets my stamp of approval.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.12437509", "1": "0.26107532", "2": "0.12516837", "3": "0.14027567", "4": "0.20092675", "5": "0.08717283", "6": "0.061005954"}}
