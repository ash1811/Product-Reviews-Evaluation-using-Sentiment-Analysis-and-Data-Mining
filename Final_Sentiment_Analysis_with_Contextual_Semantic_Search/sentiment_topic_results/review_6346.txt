{"text": "I got this for my husky son as he can't really wear most costumes that are jumpsuits or have long pants (if they fit his waist, they are way too long).  This is a great costume for the price.  It's comfortable for him to wear trick or treating, and he also likes to wear it just to play.  Durability is okay (he ripped a seam on the first one, but I exchanged it, and the second one has lasted two years).  Definitely worth it at this price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08569457", "1": "0.35015222", "2": "0.09496942", "3": "0.15690571", "4": "0.1657244", "5": "0.14329587"}}
