{"text": "Be advised that you can probably get the beefy tees for less directly from Hanes, as I did.Also (a big bummer) over the last few years, I have received a tee shirt that is notas thick a material as it used to be.  I have worn beefy tees ever since I had asign company that also did silk screening on just about anything, and we used to order only the beefy tees as they were a better T shirt than any other, but this wasthirty years ago, and the product has definitely changed no matter what Hanes or anybody else says. I don't have a problem with the sizing as others do, and at $9.00 each with pocket directly from Hanes, it is still a good deal.Addendum:Contacted Hanes and gave them all the sorted details they ask for in hopes youwill not E-mail them back (Color, where they were made, price, etc. etc.).All a bunch of bunk when they have my order number.This is nothing more than Corporate greed, just like Levi, Maytag and so many others.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.26418236", "1": "0.15976153", "2": "0.09687808", "3": "0.14265741", "4": "0.15640715", "5": "0.03966862", "6": "0.14044482"}}
