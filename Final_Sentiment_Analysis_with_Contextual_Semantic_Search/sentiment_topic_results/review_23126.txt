{"text": "I chose this bra based on its description of laying \"flat in front\", but it turned out to be the same one as I had already: #4696.  This bra does not lie as flat as I'd like.  I also searched for it in the stores.  There is no number in the ad, and so too easy to buy this by mistake.  Unfortunately return is not so easy as it is not directly Amazon.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08220266", "1": "0.1696784", "2": "0.09816798", "3": "0.15036051", "4": "0.29192296", "6": "0.20289223"}}
