{"text": "My son is extremely picky about the shoes that are on his feet.  OCD is an understatement for his pickiness.  He wears a 10-10.5 size shoe (depending on shoe) and I ordered him a 10 and they feet perfectly.  Not too tight, not to big.  They are padded slightly around the back of the ankle and the sides so they don't fit like a tight stiff dress shoe fit that is typical of a guy's dress shoe (for this price).  He was spinning and dancing and jumping and said they were so comfortable (and no laces MOM!) ... Mommy approved.  5 year old son approved.  I highly recommend this shoe!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.05326482", "1": "0.32965633", "2": "0.17319117", "3": "0.15928066", "4": "0.17889255", "5": "0.033637956", "6": "0.07207651"}}
