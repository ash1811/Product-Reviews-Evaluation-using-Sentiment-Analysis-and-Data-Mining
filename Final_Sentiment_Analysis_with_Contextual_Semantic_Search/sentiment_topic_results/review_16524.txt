{"text": "These are neat looking suspenders.  I bought them for my husband, and he had not worn them very much.  Today, the snaps came apart, and they are no good any more.  Hope you have better luck with yours.  First pair of suspenders I've ever seen do that.Update:  I wrote the above because I was unhappy when they broke.  However, they replaced them immediately and the new pair seem to be fine.  I love the design!!!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.18794459", "2": "0.1287978", "3": "0.2669242", "4": "0.15360418", "5": "0.134262", "6": "0.12459151"}}
