{"text": "I bought this watch primarily for the look of it.I was not upset when it arrived.  The watch is absolutely stunning.  I get tons of compliments on it and it easily became my favorite watch in my collection.  The manuals are confusing and setting the watch is also confusing but from reading the reviews I knew this going into it. You can find instructions on YouTube that are more intuitive than the directions.  Once set and on my arm I can't say enough about the watch.  It feels quality, its that great in between of not too expensive and not too cheap yet fits any occassion.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09544554", "1": "0.3325807", "2": "0.24817033", "3": "0.028412018", "4": "0.20710327", "6": "0.085362524"}}
