{"text": "It's surprising that there really is a difference between the various well-known brands of men's briefs.  I've been looking around to replace my aging drawer-full, and wrote a review of my recent experience with Hanes (in brief, they're inexpensive and show it).I've never liked Jockeys, for one reason:  they advertise their \"Exclusive Y-front fly design,\" and I've consistently had difficulty getting Mr. Johnson through the fly and into use.  Sure, we can giggle about it, but it's no fun having to stand there, reach through the fly, grab Ol' Willie, and pull him through an awkwardly-designed fly every time you've got business to do.  It's more of a hassle than it might sound, and underwear shouldn't be something you have to deal with. And putting the trouser snake back in is even more difficult--it takes two hands!Let me be clear here:  The fly opening is REALLY tight, and no matter what you do, it's REALLY difficult to go through it. You may say, \"But they must sell a million of them every year, year after year.  Everybody's heard of Jockey shorts.  This guy must be exaggerating.\"  Yes, yes, I know.  And you'll see that what I say is true.  You have been warned.I just bought some more to find out whether they still make them this way, and they do. I have no idea why Jockey not only makes them this way, but brags about it.  I guess there are some guys that worry that the fly is too loose, and if you're one of them, you don't have to worry about it with Jockeys--everything is safe and secure--too secure for my liking. They're reasonably priced, and otherwise well made--definitely better constructed than Hanes, for example. But I won't buy them again--too much trouble.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.24400543", "1": "0.16025482", "2": "0.1512587", "3": "0.16682662", "4": "0.06940552", "5": "0.08953403", "6": "0.118714854"}}
