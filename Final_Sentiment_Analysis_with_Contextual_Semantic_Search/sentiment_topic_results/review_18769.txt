{"text": "I love these shirts from &#34;The Mountain.&#34; And when I selected &#34;Fit as expected&#34; from the drop-down box for this review, to me, it fits like what I expect a 2XL to fit like. I like shirts with some &#34;room to spare&#34; in their sizing, as I am not a &#34;form-fitting&#34; guy. If you like your shirts to fit snug like they were tailored to your body, then these are not for you. If you like a comfortable loose fit, then these are for you. if there was any down side to these shirts, it would be they are a little long for my taste. I am 6' and the 2XL goes more than half way down my thigh. However, if you are a &#34;roomy loose fit&#34; guy like me, then you will appreciate every other aspect of the shirt and just have your wife, girlfriend, sister, or neighbor just shorten the length for you with the ol' sewing machine if you think it's a little long for your taste. A simple minor fix for an otherwise awesome shirt.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.34049696", "2": "0.03588034", "3": "0.040621795", "4": "0.1603332", "5": "0.05796336", "6": "0.3618976"}}
