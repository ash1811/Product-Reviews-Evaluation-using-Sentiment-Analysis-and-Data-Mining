{"text": "Just a wee bit long- but what a rugged pair of jeans- the double front was just what I need as beign a photographer, I often have to kneel to get hte shot when the subjects are clsoe to hte ground, and that takes a toll on other jeans- the material is tough too- yet soft enough that they don't feel like wearing steel mesh- Pockets are good and deep and made of good strong material- Rivets everywhere on these jeans- triple stichind down hte sides, double stictch on non stress areas- The back pockets have a kevlar-like material that will really hold up well for thsoe who carry things in their back pockets regularly- Will definately buy again if these ever wear out", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0994479", "1": "0.28490698", "2": "0.12630972", "3": "0.113464795", "4": "0.042695634", "5": "0.12581994", "6": "0.20735505"}}
