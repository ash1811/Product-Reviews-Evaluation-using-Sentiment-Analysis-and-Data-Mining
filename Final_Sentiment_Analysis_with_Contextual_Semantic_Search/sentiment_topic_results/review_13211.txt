{"text": "This swim nappy is easy to get on and off, and easy to take care of - I put it on a cold rinse through the machine each time we go in the pool.On the downside, it's far too big.  I went by weight and while my daughter met the minimum weight recommendation at 2 1/2 months, it would be useless for containing any mess.  We use it as an under layer with a 'Happy Nappy' from Splash About and that works great.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.20526406", "1": "0.063258395", "2": "0.066636", "3": "0.17181219", "4": "0.07640312", "5": "0.28458598", "6": "0.13204022"}}
