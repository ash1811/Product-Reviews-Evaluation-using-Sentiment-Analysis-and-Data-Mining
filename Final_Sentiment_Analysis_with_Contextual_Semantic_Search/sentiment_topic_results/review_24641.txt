{"text": "I bought this leotard for my granddaughter.  She is three but small for her age.  She wears size 2T in clothes.  The description says that the leotard fits sizes 2-4 but my daughter-in-law says that her daughter will be lucky to get a few months wear from it.  The leotard is rather tight.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.23379199", "3": "0.46040997", "4": "0.1391081", "6": "0.1512986"}}
