{"text": "I want to thank the previous reviewers for noting to size up. Yes, do size up. I was pant size 4-6 in Gap pre-pregnancy, currently at 20 weeks with twins, having gained 15 pounds so far and the medium (on the smallest setting) is just the right fit. I can't imagine squeezing into Small.It is comfortable, especially when standing and moving around, and pretty much invisible under clothes.The biggest issue that I have with it is that it has only 3 sets of hooks (=3 adjustments). I feel that the velcro style would be way more flexible in that respect and I may get a second velcro band or investigate sewing more rows of hooks onto this one. For example, right now I feel that I'd rather have it somewhere between 1 and 2nd sets of hooks, because if feels a little tight on the 1st set and a little loose on the 2nd. I'm still going to keep it and wear it as long as I can throughout this pregnancy.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.025645385", "1": "0.22033778", "2": "0.10062615", "3": "0.13799037", "4": "0.10501276", "5": "0.2514281", "6": "0.15895948"}}
