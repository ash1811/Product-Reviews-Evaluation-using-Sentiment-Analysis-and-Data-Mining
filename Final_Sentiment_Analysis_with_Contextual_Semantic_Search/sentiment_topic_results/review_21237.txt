{"text": "I bought these for my husband who is on his feet all day.  He was having a lot of heel pain and after reading the reviews, figured I would get these and see if they helped him.  I did also buy the Superfeet insoles to go in them though.  He noticed a difference the first day he wore them!  I would recommend these to anyone that stands or walks for long periods of time.  They are true to size even using the insoles.  He likes them too because they are very lightweight and support his foot very well.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.23138283", "1": "0.27926782", "3": "0.0962896", "4": "0.24626502", "5": "0.14055744"}}
