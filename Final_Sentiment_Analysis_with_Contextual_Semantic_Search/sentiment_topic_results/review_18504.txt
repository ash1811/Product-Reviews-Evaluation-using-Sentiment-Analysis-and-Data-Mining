{"text": "After returning the watch that I bought I confirmed with Victorinox by email that this watch has been discontinued.  I may know the reason.  There are two manufacturing contact points at the base of the buckle.  They cause irritation on the wrist with the slightest pressure such as placing the hand on a table.  This used to be a wonderful watch.  I owned one for many years and gave it to a friend who was in need.  Now, a few years later, I bought another one and promptly returned it when I saw that it was turning my wrist red from irritation.  The one I bought online from a major retailer arrived running with the time and date set.  I presume it was a return.  This is sad.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11810506", "1": "0.23707594", "2": "0.18343541", "3": "0.09122253", "5": "0.25107044", "6": "0.1166497"}}
