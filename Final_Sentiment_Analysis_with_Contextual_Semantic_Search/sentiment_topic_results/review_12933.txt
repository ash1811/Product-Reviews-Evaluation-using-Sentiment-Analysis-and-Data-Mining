{"text": "I really like these shoes. They are comfortable and are a nice looking casual shoe, but like just about everyone who reviewed these shoes I found them to run small in size. I normally where a size 11 and after reading the reviews I ordered a size 12. The shoe was kind of tight the first time that I wore it, but with each wearing since then it has loosened a bit each time. I think they fit so tightly due to the material they are made of and will break in over time (Like a good leather shoe would).So other than the slight annoyance of the shoes fitting so snugly at first I am very happy with them. They feel great on and I have spent a few hours walking around in them and my feet were not aching or anything like that. So if you are thinking about these shoes I would order at least one size larger than normal and then give them a chance to \"break-in\" and I think you will like them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.31998938", "2": "0.2257134", "3": "0.17696092", "4": "0.06411898", "5": "0.10391961", "6": "0.10682696"}}
