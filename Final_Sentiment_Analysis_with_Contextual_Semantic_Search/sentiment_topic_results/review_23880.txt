{"text": "I read a lot of reviews, I wanted a front hook and something relaxed to wear around the house instead of a sports bra or nothing. Even a little support is nice, without as much constraint. This is comfy, thin and I have slept in it without it digging into me. If you wear a low cut shirt it will show the bra a little, sometimes unhooking the top couple hooks hide it but generally it will show. As a casual bra, I highly recommend.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1684889", "1": "0.26020253", "2": "0.19347829", "3": "0.28345636", "5": "0.08840143"}}
