{"text": "I bought these as a gift for my husband. I'd just purchased some Acorn polar mocs for myself, and they are very comfortable. I noticed that my husband's slippers were nasty and falling apart, time for some new ones. So I surprised him by ordering these for him. He seemed so puzzled when I handed them to him, but the minute he put them on he said they were so cushy - he walked kind of funny at first because he's not used to such luxury. Now I notice he wears them all the time, even out to the end of the driveway to get the paper. Also, he tends to have sweaty feet, so it's nice to know we can throw these in the washing machine when they need it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.115030386", "1": "0.1474799", "2": "0.052062932", "3": "0.14502844", "4": "0.1494425", "5": "0.28638628", "6": "0.1045696"}}
