{"text": "I have been very pleased with these trouser socks - which are actually knee high length trouser socks. Black, Navy and Brown were the colors I ordered. They are soft and light weight (but a bit heavier than nylon hose) - and do not run easily. And they wash beautifully. Mine have been washed over a dozen times each by now. (Note: I do not put them in the dryer; I remove them from the washer and hang them to dry. Don't know if that is necessary or not.) I have large calves and cannot comfortably wear regular knee highs. These socks - in Queen Size - are very comfortable; soft and giving in the area just below my knee where the socks top off. And even though they are not 'tight', they never fall down.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0597531", "1": "0.26423147", "2": "0.11331235", "3": "0.18556882", "5": "0.25432214", "6": "0.12034305"}}
