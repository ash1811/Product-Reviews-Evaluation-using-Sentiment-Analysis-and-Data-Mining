{"text": "I bought a pair of these in February. This season they're too big. They've stretched out. I'm a size 8.5, I bought a size 8, and now they fit like a size 9. I'd have to wear several pairs of socks for them to fit like they did those first 2 months. I've pretty much stopped wearing them because it's uncomfortable to have my foot rattle around in them all day, and impossible to walk quickly.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.087959886", "1": "0.42583123", "2": "0.03484082", "3": "0.15055309", "4": "0.13872801", "6": "0.1587419"}}
