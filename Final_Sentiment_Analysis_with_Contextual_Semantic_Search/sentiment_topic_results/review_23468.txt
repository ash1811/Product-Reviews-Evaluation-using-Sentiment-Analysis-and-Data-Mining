{"text": "i purchased this watch for $80 and you can not beat it for the price. Solid watch. Time keeping is good cant complain. I have several watches so i wear about 1 time a week. You need to understand the reserve on this watch is not good, lasts 24 hours, so if you dont wear it be prepared to change the date and time ( I dont mind). I love it and only gave it a 4star due to the band feeling a little light and not as solid, but i was able to get used to it quickly. AND THE PRICE WOW, 100 times cheaper than what it aspires to be.
