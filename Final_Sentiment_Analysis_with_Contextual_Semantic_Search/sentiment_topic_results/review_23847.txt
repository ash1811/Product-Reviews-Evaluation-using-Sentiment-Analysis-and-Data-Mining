{"text": "I'm always looking for a comfortable bra to wear during endless hours working from home at my computer.  This bra seemed like a great idea to avoid back hooks that get very uncomfortable.  Unfortunately this was not my answer.I gave this bra 2 stars because of sizing and design flaws.Sizing:  This bra runs exceptionally small in every dimension.  I ordered a size larger than I ever wear on both band size and cup size and it was still too small.  The C/DDD cup would fit someone with a full B or average C cup but never anyone in the D range.  The 40 band width might fit a 36 person.  The straps do not adjust and they were also too short (I'm 5' 8&#34; tall and have a long torso so the straps might work on an average build).Design:  The darts which are longer than they should be ending above where they should (look closely at model in photo), and the seam they create would rub in sensitive places.The material is soft which is nice, but you need extra patience in order to try to get this many hooks fastened.The quest for this type bra that actually might fit continues....", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.22043177", "1": "0.25639457", "2": "0.11420926", "3": "0.22854279", "4": "0.032507464", "5": "0.1193458", "6": "0.028568415"}}
