{"text": "Ok, folks...both guys and gals who garden do barn chores or are just in and out of town on errands(well, maybe not YOUR town, but ours here in Maine are pretty informal)these are the most comfy garden clogs ever.  This is my second pair and we just received a pair for my husband as well.  My old ones I literally wore to \"smooth bottoms\".One thing, though, they do run small, so order up a half size at least.(My husband ordered a men's size 12 which fits his 11 shoe size foot perfectly.  I ordered women's 9 and wear size 8 or 8.5 shoes)They're made in the USA....what more could you ask for?", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.032666158", "1": "0.32065043", "2": "0.08174934", "3": "0.0898781", "4": "0.20673378", "5": "0.09477461", "6": "0.17354758"}}
