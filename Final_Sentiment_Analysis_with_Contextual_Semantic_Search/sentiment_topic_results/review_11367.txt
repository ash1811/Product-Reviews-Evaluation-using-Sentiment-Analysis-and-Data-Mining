{"text": "Got these in the dark green color about a year ago on Amazon.  They were comfortable from the beginning and are even easier to wear now that I've had them for a while.  The deep green color is amazing and looks great with black and brown.  The leather is very soft.  You can wear them scrunched down or pulled up.  I like to wear them scrunched with my boot cut jeans.  When I first got them, the heels were VERY slippery....almost bit the dust a couple times, especially on tile or laminate floors.  With wear, the are not slippery anymore.  I typically wear a size 10 and bought these in a 10; they fit perfectly with a pair of light socks; very true to size.  Would buy again in a heart beat.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.043161526", "1": "0.35365233", "2": "0.09582863", "3": "0.1502738", "4": "0.14154312", "5": "0.119972385", "6": "0.09556822"}}
