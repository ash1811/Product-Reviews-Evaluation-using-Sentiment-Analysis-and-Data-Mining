{"text": "I ordered this backpack in the Bogart Grey Stripe and it looks just like the picture. I love the design. It is huge, which is what I need while taking all of my lit classes in college. (I'm taking 5 this semester...) Even with all of my textbooks, notebooks, supplies, MP3 player, wallet, and waterbottle, I still have enough room for more. I just wish it had a laptop pocket, but it does have the large front pocket that could be used for that.Also, I'm hoping that the straps soften up with use because they are a little stiff and just a tad uncomfortable (nothing major though).I do remember having a Jansport in high school and the material used to be like a denim or heavy canvas. Now it feels like a thinner canvas. However, it has the lifetime guarantee so I shouldn't be worried.Overall, very happy with this backpack!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.034048744", "1": "0.25763148", "2": "0.25891396", "3": "0.20547706", "4": "0.05047847", "5": "0.11869831", "6": "0.074751996"}}
