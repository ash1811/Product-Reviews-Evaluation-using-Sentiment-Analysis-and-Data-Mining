{"text": "Pros:Solid bracelet, not folded links.Heavy and substantial.Exhibition (transparent) caseback is cool.Accurate (+6 seconds a day).Long power reserve (40ish hours).Excellent excellent value.Screw down crown.Can be hand wound.Citizen-made Miyota movement.Cons:Not hackable but back-hackable (exert a little backwards pressure on the minute hand while setting time and the second hand will stop).Magnifier's not the best (1.5x instead of 3x).Polished parts of the bracelet get dinged up more easily than brushed metal.Magnifier gets dinged up in constant use.Bracelet end links are folded, so they get a little loose with time.Other:If you'd like to attach a Maratac \"Zulu\" nylon strap, the lug spacing is 20mm.I finally smashed the crystal on mine, and rather than send it back to Invicta and wait six weeks, my local jeweler replaced it cheaply.  I rather like it without the magnifier.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14065094", "1": "0.22547396", "2": "0.10332343", "3": "0.06398358", "4": "0.15184966", "5": "0.13674691", "6": "0.17797154"}}
