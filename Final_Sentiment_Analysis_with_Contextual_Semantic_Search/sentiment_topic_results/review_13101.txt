{"text": "The bag is as described, not very large at all. It's really more of an atypical purse. If it weren't so common for men to tote purses here, I'd feel slightly awkward about this one. But only slightly ;) Check the sizes if you're going to buy it.It looks good, the color is nice and the canvas has a nice matte look.The bag has a flap on either side that are in the way of the flap, meant to tuck inside for protection, but don't work simply. The two pockets on the front are too narrow for more than a couple fingers and are deep enough to horde my keys out of reach. These pockets have Velcro flaps, which work fine and are no problem. The main flap is secured curiously with a buckle type clasp - to close it, you have to slide the belt through the metal buckle and pull it to. This works well enough, but isn't as handy as a button, zipper, Velcro, or just leaving it. Also the bag doesn't hold it's own shape that well and slouches down on itself easily, providing no protection.It's lightweight and depending on the purpose it could be a serviceable bag. To carry some things to work, it's too small and inconvenient.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.058431517", "1": "0.4287459", "2": "0.13552019", "4": "0.07006435", "5": "0.1558012", "6": "0.14899452"}}
