{"text": "I finally broke down and purchased this wallet after months of waffling... not because of the wallet itself but the fact that I had to decide to give up my old wallet which had fallen apart. When I received this one from Amazon I was so pleased with its concept and design. It holds everything I need to take with me at moment's notice, contains slots and pockets for change, checks, receipts, credit cards, you name it! It's a little larger than the one I used to carry but it's functionality makes it worthwhile.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.029651541", "1": "0.15816292", "2": "0.30561727", "3": "0.15525751", "4": "0.1204111", "5": "0.15614107", "6": "0.07475857"}}
