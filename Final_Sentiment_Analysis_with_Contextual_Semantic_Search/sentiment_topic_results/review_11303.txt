{"text": "for $10 these were too good to pass up.  First noticed that the gold balls are glued or welded into the stem.. the earring is not all one piece.  First time I wore them, lost one because the back slipped off though they weren't tugged or snagged to cause the earring to pop out.This is the second pair I bought... first set was fine.  Seems like the quality of construction may be slipping  (or a different supplier?)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.08582786", "1": "0.21080297", "2": "0.06895602", "3": "0.20764723", "4": "0.15893023", "5": "0.098099336", "6": "0.16973639"}}
