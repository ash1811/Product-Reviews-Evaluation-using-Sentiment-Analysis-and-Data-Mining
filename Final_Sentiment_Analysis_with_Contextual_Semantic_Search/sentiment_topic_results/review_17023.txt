{"text": "I normally take a size 9 in Keen shoes, and this size always gives me a bit of room allowing for different Keen styles. I would say though that these sandals feel alot smaller, not sure if its the style/cut of the sandal. They are comfortable, yes a bit bulky but my foot is secure and does not slip around when walking. I would suggest to anyone buying these that if you take a size 9 normally and its usually a proper fit with not much extra room to order at least 1/2 a size up. I like the colour of these sandals and the fact that the straps are leather, they will be perfect for walking the dog in the summer. They provide good arch support", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10641298", "1": "0.14998937", "2": "0.1684113", "3": "0.23292233", "5": "0.13520367", "6": "0.2047828"}}
