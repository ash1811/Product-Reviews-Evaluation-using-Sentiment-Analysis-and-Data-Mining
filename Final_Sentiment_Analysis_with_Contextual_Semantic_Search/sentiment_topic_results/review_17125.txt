{"text": "These Smartwool trekking socks are great for everyday winter wear in the cold weather.  I wear them around the house and they keep my feet warm and if I need to throw on some boots and take my dog for a walk or run out, they keep my feet warm in the outdoor weather.  They are cushioned but not so much that you can't wear them with regular sneakers.  Smartwool socks are the best I have found for winter socks to keep my feet warm.  My only recommendation is to make sure you get the right sized socks because if they are too tight, even a little too tight, it will reduce circulation which creates cold feet.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for a warm winter sock.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.056664202", "1": "0.28445372", "2": "0.03942914", "3": "0.17263201", "4": "0.12440917", "5": "0.2590169", "6": "0.06339486"}}
