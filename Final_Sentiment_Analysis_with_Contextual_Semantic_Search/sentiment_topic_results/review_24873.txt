{"text": "My husband always got a pair of Isotoners for Christmas, then we realized he was getting a new pair of slippers every year.  They were fine, but ended up stretching and coming off his feet.  The Old Friends slipper was the answer.  It is sturdy and with the  adjustable velcro strap, it made these a winner.  You will pay more upfront, but less over time because of the construction.  These are well worth the money since you wear slippers everyday.  I highly recommend them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.24799332", "2": "0.17086817", "3": "0.07313197", "4": "0.120413356", "5": "0.17257266", "6": "0.21175359"}}
