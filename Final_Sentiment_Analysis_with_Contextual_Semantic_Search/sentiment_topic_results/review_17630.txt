{"text": "As an oldtimer, I grew up with analog watches powered by mainsprings. They weren't very accurate, and you had to remember to wind them every day. In later years, I switched to battery-powered digital watches, but I always missed the old-style watches. This watch is an ideal compromise - an analog watch with an accurate quartz movement. It's extremely accurate and looks great for either casual or business settings. If you want a very affordable analog watch, and you don't mind giving up the day/date function, this is a great watch.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.22911675", "1": "0.086625695", "2": "0.2099879", "3": "0.20068781", "4": "0.024509063", "5": "0.08423153", "6": "0.16484123"}}
