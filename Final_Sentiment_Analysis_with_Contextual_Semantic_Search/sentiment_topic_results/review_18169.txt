{"text": "I'm 31 now.  These are awesome!  They fit my feet great and they're made just like the pair I had when I was in 7th grade--albeit with different materials but they feel great!  I love Saucony Jazz!!!  I haven't been able to find a pair of these shoes anywhere.  So glad it occurred to me to check here.  If you've ever worn this style shoe in the past and LOVED them, buy this shoe!!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.05684368", "1": "0.35653612", "2": "0.15015405", "3": "0.14049523", "4": "0.19146201", "5": "0.050025284", "6": "0.054483593"}}
