{"text": "Skechers Sport Men's Energy 3-Punisher Sneaker are comfortable, stylish, and provide good traction whether hiking or wearing them for casual purposes. I have had mine for about one month and have gone on three 5 mile hikes with a 16 pound backpack. After these hikes my feet felt fine and did not feel fatigued. I did not develop any blisters or hot spots. These sneakers are great for hiking on trails or casual use. I have used these Skechers with thick wool socks for hikes and thin cotton socks for general use and the shoe felt great with both types of socks. If you don't like untying and tying shoes you can easily slip these on and off with no problem. The tongue stays in place and does not shift to the side requiring constant repositioning to the center.Pros:+ Comfortable (probably the most important factor)+ Good traction on trails+ Lightweight+ Stylish+ Did not need a break-in period before hiking+ Shoe tongue stays in place+ Sneakers did not cause blisters, hot spots, or foot fatigue+ Easy to slip on and off+ Reasonably priced in a market where you can easily pay double the price for trail shoe by other brandsThis is my second experience with Skecher shoes and I expect these sneakers to be a well made, comfortable product that will last a long time. My first pair was a casual work shoe that lasted eight years.I highly recommend these sneakers. They are comfortable with a color and look that I really like in a trail sneaker.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.19773835", "1": "0.11546302", "2": "0.18857864", "3": "0.28051722", "5": "0.11386113", "6": "0.101671"}}
