{"text": "This is my 4th Invicta Watch. it is a very nice time piece; however, when I called Invicta to inquire about the size they noted that it was the same as the 8926 Automatic. It actually is not, so there web site (Invicta) was incorrect.  It's pretty sad when the manufacturer does not have the accurate information. The watch has more of a purple versus blue background; however, it is a nice look. Invicta also notes that this is a Mako Swiss. The watch is made in Japan and does not have any notes or Swiss markings. The case back requires a special tool to remove it and change the battery. Overall it is a nice time piece; however, I only gave it a 4 primarily because of the Invicta inaccuracies and lack of customer service that they are known for. 10-8-09 UPDATE;  I had to change the battery in this watch. I opened the back and was shocked when I saw that the inner ring that holds the movement in place was made of cheap white plastic. I COULD NOT BELIEVE how cheap the interior of this watch was. If I could return it I would in a heart beat. The watch should be on a shelf at Wal-Mart for under $10.00. Very disappointed.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.07520544", "1": "0.18893372", "2": "0.22456078", "3": "0.06240221", "4": "0.098627664", "5": "0.2533781", "6": "0.09689208"}}
