{"text": "I ordered these black frames for my son to save him money. Perfect fit at 52.  In the optometrist's office the same frames were $180, I paid $79 through Amazon.  They came in perfect condition, in a nice box with cloth, case, and booklet.  They had all the right markings so I knew they were real Ray Bans.  I did order prescription lenses (polycarbonate/crizal) from the optometrist and the glasses look great.  I haven't tried ordering prescription lenses online yet.  He is very happy with them.  Another great experience with Amazon.  I would highly recommend these New Wayfarer frames by Ray Ban.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09472244", "1": "0.29488418", "2": "0.0760833", "3": "0.2221231", "4": "0.25076157", "5": "0.058998313"}}
