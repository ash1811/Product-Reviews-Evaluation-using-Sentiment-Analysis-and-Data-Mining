{"text": "This was the weirdest purchase I had ever made with Amazon.  When my bag came, it had been USED.  Used as in it still had old, sugar free candies and receipts scrunched up in the bottom of the bag, and it was filthy, stains everywhere.  It was disgusting.  I called Amazon, and because it was from a different seller, they couldn't do much besides let me return it.  I will order another one in the hopes that this was just a rare, one-off gaffe, and I will update this review upon receipt.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17963581", "1": "0.17535959", "2": "0.03825638", "3": "0.074161515", "4": "0.14675778", "5": "0.18478692", "6": "0.201042"}}
