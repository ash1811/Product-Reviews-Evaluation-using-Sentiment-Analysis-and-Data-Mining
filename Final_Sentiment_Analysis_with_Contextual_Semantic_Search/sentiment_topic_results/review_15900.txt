{"text": "Functionally this watch is great, a young girl (say, 7) can understand its functions and the timer and alarm all work fine. The reason this is getting 3 stars (and that's being kind) is that the strap when done up around that same girl has its end sticking up. This is because her wrist is small (even though above average dimensions for age)and so only half of the velcro attaches, with the rest stuck up at the top. There is also a huge TIMEX logo in the way of where more velcro could go. As a result the strap comes easily undone.This is frustrating because it's such a stupid oversight on Timex's part. If not for that logo in the way they could have had more velcro and then no problem. I have had the same girl try an adult female timex with a rubber strap and lots of holes and it actually fits just fine, so that's the one this will be replaced with.Timex, fix the strap and actually allow young KIDS to wear it and then you get five stars.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1579733", "1": "0.09462636", "2": "0.19312194", "3": "0.10184478", "4": "0.17870958", "5": "0.13411841", "6": "0.13960561"}}
