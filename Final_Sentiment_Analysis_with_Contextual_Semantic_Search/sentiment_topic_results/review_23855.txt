{"text": "Having a narrow foot and finding shoes is not easy these days as even narrow seems wider than ever.  These shoes are actually narrow and fit true to size.  They lasted me a season or two which is another reason I'm back to buy them again.  Sometimes my shoes fall apart but so far so good.  The support in these is ok too - even with a high arch I seem to do ok with these.  Also the outside material is really easy to wash off and they look great at all times.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.4342976", "2": "0.16766684", "3": "0.18520766", "4": "0.084943675", "5": "0.122146346"}}
