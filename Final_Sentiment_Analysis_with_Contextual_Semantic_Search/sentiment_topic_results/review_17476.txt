{"text": "I have a much more high end pair of boots, but this pair can't be beat for comfort.  This is a good pair to bring when you travel -- they even hold up well through long airport walks.  Fits my legs perfectly -- they have BIG expansion gussets to accommodate most women's legs and stay comfortable on long airplane rides.  Your legs will sigh with releief when you put these on.Also, they are very attractive and husbands like them, if my husband is any guide.  :)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.42212898", "2": "0.115987025", "3": "0.16261683", "4": "0.17510015", "6": "0.11780184"}}
