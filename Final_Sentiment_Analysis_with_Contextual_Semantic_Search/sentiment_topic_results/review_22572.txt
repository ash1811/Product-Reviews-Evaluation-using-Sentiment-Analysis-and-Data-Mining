{"text": "Our daughter was born in Dallas and, though my company has moved us around a bit, she has remained a die-hard Cowboys fan all her 20 year of life.  Each Christmas we pick a couple 'Boys trinkets as stocking stuffers for her, and these just arrived today for that purpose.These earrings are very nice looking and they are just the right size for her; she is about 5'3\" and 110 lbs, and these earrings are about 3/4 inch across (from farthest star points) and hang about 1 1/2 inch from the bottom of the loop (or whatever you call the part that goes through your ear). Would have been very disappointed if they were big plastic earrings and am glad they are not.As for the reviewer concerned about the California Prop 65 warning label... well... it seems that California finds it pertinent to let us all know that eating these earrings might not be beneficial to ones health --- so I recommend not doing so.Back on a serious note; these earrings look nice, feel nicely constructed, and are tagged as official NFL gear. I like 'em and she will to.Recommended if you or yours is an earring-wearing Cowboys fan too.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.14296259", "1": "0.25050038", "2": "0.1290045", "3": "0.12721394", "4": "0.15540057", "5": "0.06667276", "6": "0.12824531"}}
