{"text": "Buying bras online is risky but this turned out fine. The bra is dead sexy. I have the white and pink one which reminds me of a decadent Little Bo Peep. It fits my abundant breasts without too much unwanted coverage. Another reviewer mentioned it not being comfortable, to me this is the kind of bra one wears when it is going to be seen rather then a 'wear all day to work' sort of garment. This is a bra that will make your husband smile.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.10834922", "3": "0.2464175", "4": "0.34893936", "5": "0.19883122", "6": "0.09107061"}}
