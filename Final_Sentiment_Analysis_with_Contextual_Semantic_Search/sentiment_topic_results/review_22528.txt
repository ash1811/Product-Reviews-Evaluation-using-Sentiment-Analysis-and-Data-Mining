{"text": "I wear mostly sterling silver jewelry, and I have tried a lot of silver cleaners: liquids, sonics, cloths, creams, and chemical plates/water baths. Most are so-so. They can handle light silver tarnish and dirty stones but not heavy tarnish, especially on chains. This one cleans it all. Oh yeah, it rocks. It only takes a minute or so in the solution, a light scrub with a very soft toothbrush on chains or intricate work, and a thorough rinse in running water. My jeweler sells this product, but it is cheaper on Amazon.A word of warning - if your piece is intentionally oxidized, this will start working on that oxidation too. Seriously, this is a strong cleaner. So if you want to keep that oxidation, watch your jewelry close. Once the applied oxidation is gone, your piece will not be shiny. Also, if you forget and leave your jewelry in for a long time, it may actually remove any protective coating that was applied over the silver, like a rhodium finish or clear coat. I'm telling you, this is serious stuff. Don't leave your silver overnight! It works though when nothing else does. I am so glad Amazon has this product.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.054895062", "1": "0.22776757", "2": "0.23173998", "3": "0.09996807", "4": "0.09357", "5": "0.08198472", "6": "0.21007463"}}
