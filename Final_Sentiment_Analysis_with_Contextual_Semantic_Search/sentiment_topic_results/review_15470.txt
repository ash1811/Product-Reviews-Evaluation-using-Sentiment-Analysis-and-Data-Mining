{"text": "I Really Wanted to Like These, but... you should try them on in the store first unless you've worn them before. I bought the large and they were still too small for my face. The ear pieces do not flex much -- there is no spring in the hinge area. And if you've been wearing aviator styles with thin frames around the lenses these will be a shock. The thick lens frames will feel like you are trying to look around the center post that separates the windows in your car. They create a blind spot of sorts. If you can live with that -- no worries. They are a great traditional style. Just be sure the size fits you as to width across the face.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1272688", "1": "0.1490172", "2": "0.13557336", "3": "0.13426536", "4": "0.074641034", "5": "0.17350662", "6": "0.2057276"}}
