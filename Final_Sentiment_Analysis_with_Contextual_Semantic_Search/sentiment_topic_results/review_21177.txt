{"text": "I ordered this set for my great grandson's third birthday.  Much to everyone's delight the Fedex truck rolled up to the curb just as the party was beginning and gave the birthday boy his package.  Everyone thought GGMa had special powers to make the delivery happen at just the right time when I live in Texas and they live in Florida.  It couldn't have happened if it had been planned!  The kids dressed in the costumes as soon as they could and sent me a picture.  Thanks AMazon!  You are AMazing!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17968276", "1": "0.21595727", "2": "0.05676023", "3": "0.17170498", "4": "0.1480631", "5": "0.083889864", "6": "0.14394177"}}
