{"text": "I only have 501s and 514s in jeans and tend to be a Levi's only guy when it comes to my denim. (I do have a pair of Wranglers with the cordura lowers for field wear.)It's been a little while since i bought my last pair and have only washed these once, but I can't help but feel like these have thinner denim. I've tried to do a feel test to the others, but with these being new the &#34;touch&#34; is too different to be certain. They are definitely a lighter weight than both of my 501s.I deducted one-star because I don't remember putting on a pair of Levi's jeans and wondering if they felt light weight. After a couple of washes if I can tell that something isn't right, I will update the review, but for now I'm happy enough.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.24545382", "3": "0.33362392", "4": "0.15205924", "5": "0.11247338", "6": "0.15107748"}}
