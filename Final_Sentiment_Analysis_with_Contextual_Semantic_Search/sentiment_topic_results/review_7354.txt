{"text": "These are very nice pants, they look and feel great. BUT they are very large in the leg, running straight down from the thigh with no taper - \"elephant leg\". I am 6'1\" tall, just under 200lbs and reasonably HWP. I could probably almost fit both legs in one pant. I don't think washing and drying would have made much difference. These are perfect for people who do a lot of bending, kneeling and squating. Amazon took them back graciously but I regretted having to return them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16561949", "1": "0.39256096", "2": "0.06662844", "3": "0.11203833", "4": "0.07496832", "5": "0.05874399", "6": "0.1294405"}}
