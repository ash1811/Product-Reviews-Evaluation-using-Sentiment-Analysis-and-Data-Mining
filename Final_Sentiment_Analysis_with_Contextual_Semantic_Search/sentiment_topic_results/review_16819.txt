{"text": "I love my Crocs.  I have two colors and want more.  I wear them as slippers, sandals, shoes...allll the time!  I think they look great with almost all casual wear. They are so comfy and don't make your feet smell like you might think.  They can be tossed in the wash if they get dirty and they come out like new.  I find myself not wanting to wear any other shoe.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.33768886", "2": "0.18420258", "3": "0.28355068", "5": "0.121147804", "6": "0.065439686"}}
