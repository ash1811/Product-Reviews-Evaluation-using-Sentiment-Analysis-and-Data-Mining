{"text": "These trouser socks are a very light nude color, so if you want them for summer you may want to purchase a shade darker to match your tan. That said, I found them to be constructed very well, very strong, not flimsy at all; in fact they are sheer yet feel like the materials in 'tights'.  The top band is not tight, not binding on the leg. Needing Queen size, I ordered as such; and they are wide enough for heavier legs or swelling; the only con was the fact that they did not come up completely to the knee, so they will start to slip slightly as the day progresses. I have worn other rands that went all the way up to the knee, and stay there, but they always snagged or ran, and never lasted long. So it is a personal choice. I would like to see these made a bit longer, but that is the only con, otherwise, they are very nice for the price, and I will probably purchase these again for the texture and strength.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.18518901", "1": "0.13975166", "2": "0.052482646", "3": "0.19310346", "4": "0.0824927", "5": "0.20455745", "6": "0.1424231"}}
