{"text": "This bra would have been a perfect fit and a welcome addition were it not for the complete pointy-shaped cups.  This left about 1/4\" of a wrinkle in the bra for me that was just a no-go, so I had to return it.  The features on the bra are great and I could see how it could really provide support without an underwire.The shape of the cups were just a little too strange for me and didn't work.  Was really hoping this one would have worked.  I guess I will stick with my Moving Comfort brand which seem to provide a more solid fit.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.068743825", "1": "0.25734448", "2": "0.09634259", "3": "0.2896727", "4": "0.18021506", "6": "0.10463219"}}
