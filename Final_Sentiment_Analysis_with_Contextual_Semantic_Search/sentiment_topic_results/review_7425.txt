{"text": "I wasn't expecting much as it was not expensive, but it's truly gorgeous. It came well packaged with a beautiful satin padded hanger. Everything was well put together. Love this and will be buying another color! True to size, I am 5ft 7, 130lbs and I purchased a small which fit well. It is a little short so don't wear it around your grandpa, unless of course you're into that sort of thing.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16794813", "1": "0.31152835", "2": "0.19697136", "4": "0.14303224", "5": "0.038632732", "6": "0.13821174"}}
