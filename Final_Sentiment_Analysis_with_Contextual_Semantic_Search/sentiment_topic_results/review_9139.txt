{"text": "At first these slippers seemed to be very nice.  My husband wears a 10.5 shoe so I went with the 11s.  They were still pretty tight across the top of his foot.  After just a few days of wear the lining inside at the heal started separating.  Definitely not the quality I expected from a slipper at this price range.  Thanks Amazon for your great return policy :-)", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16242474", "1": "0.2226699", "2": "0.06951016", "3": "0.096365914", "4": "0.13613778", "5": "0.18327491", "6": "0.12961662"}}
