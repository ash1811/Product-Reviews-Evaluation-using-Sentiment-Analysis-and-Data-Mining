{"text": "I bought this bag based on the Amazon reviews and I completely disagree with most of them. This bag is bulky, and the lining is so thin between compartments that the bag has no structure. If you put something in the middle compartment, it sticks out in to the outer compartments and everything feels like a big mess. The bag isn't deep enough and feels bulky on my shoulder when filled (not over-stuffed).Not a good bag.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14402737", "1": "0.2547275", "2": "0.23136806", "4": "0.14740403", "5": "0.14188881", "6": "0.07691453"}}
