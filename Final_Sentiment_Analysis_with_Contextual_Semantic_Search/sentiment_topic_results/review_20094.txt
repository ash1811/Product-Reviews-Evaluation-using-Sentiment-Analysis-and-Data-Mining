{"text": "I needed a replacement for a 25 year old backpack, and after much back & forth, 2 selections which I returned I settled on the High Sierra Loop Backpack.  Love it!  I'm not a hiker.  I use the backpack whenever I travel as my carry-on and as my main luggage when we go away for short trips.  Nice, full compartments.  I'm super happy with the water bottle holders on both side of the pack.  Top rate construction.  Definitely recommend this brand based on this single great experience.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.154267", "1": "0.14669655", "2": "0.26348966", "3": "0.2029196", "4": "0.08690292", "6": "0.14306733"}}
