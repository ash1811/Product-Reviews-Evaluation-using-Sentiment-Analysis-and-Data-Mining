{"text": "my granddaughter loves these crocs. she said \" i am going to wear my pink shoes every day' and she has done just that. and i was so very happy they ran large. if they hadn't they would have been just a little small for her. now she has room to grow. clean up is so easy and simple. just to the sink and rinse off. very, very pleased with this product. love crocs for myself and my plantar fsciitis is helped enormously with wearing them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09464794", "1": "0.065258145", "2": "0.15827861", "3": "0.20802112", "4": "0.118687436", "5": "0.2854076", "6": "0.06969911"}}
