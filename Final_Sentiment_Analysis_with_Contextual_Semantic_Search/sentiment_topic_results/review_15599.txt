{"text": "I have a Pacsafe purse I use most of the time once I am at my destination, but in transit and when I am engaged in more hands-on activities, I want to leave the purse behind, but have essentials with me. This bag is great for that purpose. The neck cord extends long enough to allow me to wear this cross body if I wish, but the shortened length is perfect to keep the pouch - and my valuables - securely out of sight. In either case, the cord rests comfortable on my neck.The zip compartment holds my passport easily (mine was renewed in 2013 and is considerably thicker than the one that was issued 10 years earlier), but is not RFID, nor is large enough to hold an extra RFID sleeve - which is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Another compartment is shallow - but very nicely sized for credit cards and hotel key-cards. The third compartment is fully large enough for currency, cell phone, or even my Nikon Cool Pix - but would be rather bulky holding all that. I plan to keep passport, boarding passes and credit cards/currency in the pouch during my overseas flight. Judging by some of the activities my tour has planned, I will most likely use it cross-body for a good bit of our excursions. Another great Pacsafe item.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.114262946", "1": "0.23822081", "2": "0.13353573", "3": "0.24536107", "4": "0.09984091", "5": "0.10420103", "6": "0.06457748"}}
