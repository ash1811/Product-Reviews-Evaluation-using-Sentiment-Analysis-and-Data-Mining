{"text": "My previous hanging bag was roomy but temperamental and more expensive than this one.  This fits all that I need to pack, but cannot take most full-size cosmetics, which is fine.  I'd rather not take the &#34;economy size&#34; on trips.  However, it can fit just about anything ou need and fold up neatly.  My last, highly touted hanging bag and a myriad of zippers, two of which broke and were aproblem.  This just folds and ties, so that isn't a problem for stowing away--the zippers are on the inside, not along the sides of the bag.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.30673778", "2": "0.1949557", "3": "0.08850937", "4": "0.17328422", "5": "0.09294901", "6": "0.14063"}}
