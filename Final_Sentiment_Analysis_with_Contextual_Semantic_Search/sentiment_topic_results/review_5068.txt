{"text": "Haven't had a chance to wear them around very much. They appear to have good quality control. Sizing was a surprise; I ordinarily get a U.S. size 11 or 11.5 shoe in Wide. Based on past sandal sizing experience, I ordered these in Men's 42. That was two size increments below what I would take in a shoe size. Thank goodness I did, as the forward parts of my feet are quite loose. Good thing there's a back ankle strap. At some future point I may wind up punching another hole in the most-forward sandal strap.Update: There is a greatly raised rim around the edge, and this bothered my toes as I walked. Problem wasn't apparent from pictures or upon initial inspection. They drove me nuts and I gave them away.
