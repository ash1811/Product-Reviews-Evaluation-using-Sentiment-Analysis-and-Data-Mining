{"text": "I have been searching for a backpack for several months, shopping every possible website that sells them. I bought this particular Loop Backpack for my dad last year, and he loved it. Yet I thought I could find a better one, and cheaper. Well, I ended up buying this one for myself as well, and it is perfect. So happy with the size and durability, plus I can use it as a carry-on.Amazon is the BEST place to shop ; )Thanks a bunch...Update from original post 5/30Took this pack to Thailand for 3 weeks. WONDERFUL pack. holds tons, but doesn't hurt your back because of the great padding. The compartments are excellent and ample room to store lots of items. I kept personal items in the front, then kindle and phone, in the largest, kept a big dslr and two lenses. I then topped it off with other misc items. I have bought two, one me and dad, and I intend to buy another as a gift.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.36578035", "2": "0.21722515", "3": "0.101302065", "4": "0.0565219", "5": "0.16181868", "6": "0.0951682"}}
