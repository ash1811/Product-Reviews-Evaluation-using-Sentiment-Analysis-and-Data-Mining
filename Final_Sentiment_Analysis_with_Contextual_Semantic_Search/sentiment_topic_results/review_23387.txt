{"text": "For the same price as REI's light and medium hiker socks, I get twice the sock with this product. The 2 pack deal is fantastic. I've worn these in 65 degree weather with sneakers and had my feet be totally comfortable without any overheating. I've also worn these without any kind of liner in a pair of snowboots in 30 degree weather walking through a few inches of snow and also had my feet be totally comfortable. Great quality wool socks, excellent price!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10670529", "1": "0.2588665", "2": "0.06765761", "3": "0.1269746", "4": "0.14906979", "5": "0.20100397", "6": "0.089722246"}}
