{"text": "Classic G with the rectangular face. Very retro. This watch tells time and it's tough. Good first watch for a kid or to use as a disposable travel watch.  Wear it to the beach, to the pool or out on a tough-mudder run.  If it lasts, you'll know what time it is.  If it breaks (and it probably won't) get a new one.  Can't go wrong.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.075205795", "2": "0.34555244", "3": "0.19259463", "4": "0.100463696", "5": "0.16649687", "6": "0.115800545"}}
