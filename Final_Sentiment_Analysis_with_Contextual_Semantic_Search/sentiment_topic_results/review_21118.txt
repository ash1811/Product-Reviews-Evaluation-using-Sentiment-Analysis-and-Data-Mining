{"text": "I bought these in size 3.  They fit true to size and are very comfortable.  The fabric isn't great, but again, for the price, they are completely adequate and wear well.  I was also pleased that they were not too long, but I'm 5'2&#34;, so I'd say if you're 5'5&#34; or taller, they might be ankle pants.I'd buy again and recommend these.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.5173281", "2": "0.030482447", "4": "0.17326584", "5": "0.12282387", "6": "0.14683746"}}
