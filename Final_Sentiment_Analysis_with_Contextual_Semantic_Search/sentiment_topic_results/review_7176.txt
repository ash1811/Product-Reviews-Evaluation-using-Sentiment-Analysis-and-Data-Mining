{"text": "I have extra holes in one ear and for my professional job, I don't want to put anything flashy in those holes. These simple knots fit the bill! They are the size of a small pea and they decorate my ear in a dainty, feminine way, showing a bit of style and personality. Much better than the tiny 3mm balls I have been wearing. I've worn them 24/7 for the past week and I have had no issues. I can still change my bottom holes on a daily basis depending on what I am wearing. I orsered a total of four and I may get another pair for backup. Exactly as pictured, exadtly as needed.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.11184274", "1": "0.09426438", "2": "0.24151759", "3": "0.14004822", "4": "0.13526964", "5": "0.14633821", "6": "0.13071923"}}
