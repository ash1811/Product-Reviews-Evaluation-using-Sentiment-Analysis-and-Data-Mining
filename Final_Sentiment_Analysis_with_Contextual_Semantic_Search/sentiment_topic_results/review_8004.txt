{"text": "As stated elsewhere, the shoe does need to be sized up a whole size from street shoes- I am a 7 and the 7.5 was too snug.  I would have exchanged for an 8 if it weren't for the fact that there is NO LINING.  On the inside of the shoe you can see the seams and two synthetic foam pads (one for heel one for midfoot glued in there.  It not only looks atrocious but it feels uncomfortable as well.So I ordered the Bloch Pump canvas shoes from Amazon instead (which ironically have to be sized DOWN by 2 sizes).", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.07193793", "1": "0.1003682", "2": "0.21626437", "3": "0.2471576", "4": "0.12089417", "5": "0.06797271", "6": "0.175405"}}
