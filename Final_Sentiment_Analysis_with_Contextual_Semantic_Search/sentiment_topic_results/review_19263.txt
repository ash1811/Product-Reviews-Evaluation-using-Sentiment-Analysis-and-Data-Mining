{"text": "I've had a &#34;My Big Fat Wallet&#34;, in brown for over 10yrs! It is tired, finally with the zipper broken, snap broken, and yet was holding onto using it because I just figured it wasn't made anymore. Was very happy to of course find it on Amazon. It is not a trendy little thing with a handle like what is so popular for running around, etc. It is a big wallet with lots of places for cards, change, bills, check book, pics, whatever you want to put in it. I haven't changed mine out yet, but just today a young trendy woman said she loved my wallet! So of course I told her about them and showed it to her. She said &#34;how perfect, if it just had a handle!&#34;...maybe that is in the future...hello Mundi???? Very happy with my new red one, and must find time to switch and clean out my trusty old one. Highly recommend this great quality leather wallet!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13683333", "1": "0.23978356", "2": "0.054116443", "3": "0.10544133", "4": "0.15761705", "5": "0.22415142", "6": "0.082056895"}}
