{"text": "I scoured the internet for the beloved Zurich. I love having my instep covered and appreciate the adjustable straps, because my instep is so high. This model, for me, represents the best of both worlds - a shoe that envelops your foot, yet keeps your toes free. Perfect! I'll never buy Arizonas again. Looks good with (the right) socks or barefoot. And of course, the arch and toe support present in every pair of Birkenstocks keeps me coming back, 32 years after my first pair. Highly recommended.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.19214311", "2": "0.10878602", "3": "0.19938625", "4": "0.21568574", "5": "0.17454547", "6": "0.10680386"}}
