{"text": "I needed a watch for quite a while. It had been many years since I'd worn one and it was about time that I got back into it. I've seen the commercials during football season and read many reviews before making this purchase. I wanted something durable, flexible for all occasions and attractive. This fits the bill.When the watch arrived, the band was large by 4 links. Easy enough to remove them and resize the band, and I had never even done it before. Read the instruction to learn how to set the date and time functions. One of the great things about this watch is that it never needs winding or a battery change. The face acts as a solar cell and onced charged fully should last a few months without needing to be replenished with direct lamp or sunlight. If you wear it regularly and it is exposed to light sources during wear, you'll never have to concern yourself with needing to intentionally recharge it. Amazing.I've gotten a few nice compliments on this watch and it seems to go with just about anything. That makes it very versatile, and along with the low maintenance and great feel on my wrist is why I give it a full 5 stars.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.048888806", "1": "0.29207975", "2": "0.21565655", "3": "0.15749598", "4": "0.15631507", "6": "0.12738663"}}
