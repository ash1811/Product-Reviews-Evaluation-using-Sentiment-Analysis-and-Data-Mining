{"text": "Bought this bra as a gift and have gotten nothing but positive feedback about it.  She loves the softness of the cups and says it's very comfortable--she generally wears a 36B and it's true to fit.  While she typically finds underwire bras rather uncomfortable, she says that this bra's underwire is so soft and flexible she barely even notices it's there.  We bought the Soft Taupe color and it was just as expected--a perfect color to wear under those light colored shirts.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20325822", "1": "0.36287177", "3": "0.12873906", "4": "0.16387919", "6": "0.13487469"}}
