{"text": "As at least one previous reviewer had noted, these shoes come just a little too high at the ankle, which made wearing them, even for a few minutes, too uncomfortable.  They're nicely made and were exactly as advertised (other than a little larger than I expected based on my usual size).  But because of the height issue I couldn't imagine wearing them even through a single day.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.036808386", "1": "0.28048056", "2": "0.2294688", "3": "0.117791876", "4": "0.05477746", "5": "0.21166721", "6": "0.06900567"}}
