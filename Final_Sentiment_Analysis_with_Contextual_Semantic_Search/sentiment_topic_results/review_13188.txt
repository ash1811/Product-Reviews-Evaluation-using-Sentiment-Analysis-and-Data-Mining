{"text": "I wanted to like these so bad, but unfortunately didn't. The legs were too snug on my baby, who is very thin and not chunky at ALL. It left red rings around her poor little thighs every time we used it. I like the idea of a snapped side, but think both sides snapping would be more functional. Don't like that this is not an adjustable sizing product. It will either fit juuuuuust right, or be too big or too small.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16580984", "1": "0.37498105", "2": "0.05508", "5": "0.11947097", "6": "0.2778423"}}
