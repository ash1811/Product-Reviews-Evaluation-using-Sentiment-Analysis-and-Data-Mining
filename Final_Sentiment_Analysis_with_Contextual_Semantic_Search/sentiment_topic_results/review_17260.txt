{"text": "I ordered this shoe in a size 10.  I normally wear a 9.5, but ordered a 1/2 size up to be sure it fit.  When I received the shoe I tried it on and could barely squeeze my foot into it.  I couldn't believe a size 10 didn't fit.  I had to return it so I didn't get to actually wear it.  The shoes appeared to be of quality construction, but unfortunately they did not work for me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10278928", "1": "0.35722303", "2": "0.16910219", "3": "0.23560739", "4": "0.094556384", "6": "0.03684658"}}
