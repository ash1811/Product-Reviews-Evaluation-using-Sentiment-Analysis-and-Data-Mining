{"text": "To be honest, there are several things I dislike about this bag.First, the carrying capacity (length x width) of the main pocket of the bag is inadequate for comfortably carrying many common items you would normally take with you when going out.Secondly, the things I dislike about the bag are the pockets use Velcro, and the front pockets are too small. I would prefer button up pockets compared to the Velcro. The Velcro seal itself seems weak and may accidentally open. The front of the bag has two small pockets, the pockets are too small to really be able to use them resourcefully. The side pocket you could possibly use them to fit a small water bottle, that's about it.To sum up the dislikes, carrying capacity is inadequate, Velcro pockets, and the front pockets are too small.The few things I do like is the strap seems durable, the material is durable, I do like the interior pocket inside the main pocket which is useful.The bag isn't horrible, but it isn't that good either.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09393006", "1": "0.26061347", "2": "0.12340615", "3": "0.24200888", "4": "0.06443252", "6": "0.21352625"}}
