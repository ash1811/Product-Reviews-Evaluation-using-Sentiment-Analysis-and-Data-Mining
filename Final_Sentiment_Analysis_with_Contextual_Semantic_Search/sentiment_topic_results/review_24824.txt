{"text": "These are my second pair or Sanuk's, and they're just as great as my first. The material on these is a little more firm than my first ones. I'm not sure if this is just the material, or if they need to get broken in. But I am liking that they've got a little more substance to the shoe. Make me wish that I live in a climate where I could wear them year round. If you want a light summer shoe that has good ventilation, but isn't a flip flop, then give Sanuk's a try.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0688831", "1": "0.25243914", "2": "0.17321125", "3": "0.30104876", "4": "0.06230199", "5": "0.06471038", "6": "0.07740537"}}
