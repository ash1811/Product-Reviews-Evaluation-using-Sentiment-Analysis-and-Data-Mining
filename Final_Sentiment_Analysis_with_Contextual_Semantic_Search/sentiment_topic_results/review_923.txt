{"text": "I bought these shoes and received them a fews days ago. These are the problems: 1)They have rubber sole. The color of the rubber is brown. The color of the rubber side is black because the shoes are black. The first day that I used them I noticed that appeared line color brown on the rubber side, this happened because while I was normally walking the shoes rub the ground. If the color of rubber would be black this would not happens. The shoes look very cheap quality. 2)They are very unconfortable.I would not buy again them.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.47421587", "2": "0.21807952", "3": "0.12544571", "4": "0.0973999", "6": "0.0792228"}}
