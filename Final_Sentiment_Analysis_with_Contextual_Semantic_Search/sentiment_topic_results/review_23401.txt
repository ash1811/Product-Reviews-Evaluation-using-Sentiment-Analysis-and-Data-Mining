{"text": "This bag is bigger than expected.  It seems to be almost a leather-like material and I think it will hold up well.  We purchased it for a one year old and I think it will be a bit big for him at first - but should hold up back and forth to daycare or on car trips.  The colors are vibrant and my overall first impression was good.  I may consider buying this in another pattern for another gift sometime soon.  Unique and useful.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.123334825", "1": "0.34044245", "2": "0.2264159", "3": "0.12769035", "5": "0.07010659", "6": "0.1086004"}}
