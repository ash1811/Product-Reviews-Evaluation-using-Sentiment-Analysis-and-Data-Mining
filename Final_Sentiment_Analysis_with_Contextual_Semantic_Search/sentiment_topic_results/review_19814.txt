{"text": "This is a great watch. Waterproof from swimming in rivers and showers. Kept it on most of the time. Easy to switch time zones. A good alarm and stopwatch. Easy to use watch. The paint easily chipped off the front- but I was also doing a lot of labor with it on. but it made it around the world and it is still my main watch today about almost 2 years of use.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06912615", "1": "0.19635396", "2": "0.17998128", "3": "0.16538449", "4": "0.34916186", "6": "0.03620783"}}
