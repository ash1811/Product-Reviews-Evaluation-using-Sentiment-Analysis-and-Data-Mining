{"text": "Merrell's WERE great, perhaps when they were made in Canada. These are identical in stated sizing to a wonderful pair of Merrell Jungle Moc's I wore comfortably in and out of the house for years, but my heel slipped a lot in these, there was way too much toe room, and they seemed 1/2 to 1 size too large. I wear a 9.5 US Merrell but these felt like 10-10.5's. I had to return them for properly fitting and comfortable Teva's. I do not recommend these, I would not buy again, and I hope this helps someone.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10602504", "1": "0.2836573", "2": "0.07416132", "3": "0.19531557", "4": "0.056981973", "5": "0.19968933", "6": "0.08416945"}}
