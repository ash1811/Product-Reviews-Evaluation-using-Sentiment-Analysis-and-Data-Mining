{"text": "Ok..so I had my fill of 150.00 plus jeans.  They are great, but for that price its ridiculous.  I came across these Levis 514s and am hooked. They fit like stylish expensive jeans and come in all different styles and colors.  I get constant compliments on them and they fit very well for guys that are in shape (good butt jeans!).  Anyway.....forget those million dollar jeans, these are great and will last you a long time.  514s rocks!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.30695087", "2": "0.12318502", "3": "0.08101872", "4": "0.17643122", "5": "0.20909472", "6": "0.09998457"}}
