{"text": "&#34;Great, light, durable, AWESOME SHOE!  I highly recommend, but size up by a half size.&#34;,Where to begin? I wanted a light and breathable hiking shoe that could also be used for airsoft. THESE MET ALL THOSE NEEDS. They are super light, breathable, ultra comfortable and durable.When using these around while camping or hiking, these are unbelievably comfortable and breathable. I could go for hours in these in and not get one problem, not a blister (even when I am not wearing a sock liner+wool sock, like normally). I love these when I am exploring the outdoors. Although they are not waterproof, so bear that in mind, I have a seperate Military boot for muddy/wet/snowy weather.For Airsoft, these worked great as well, when I am carrying about 90 to 100lbs of gear, I could run around and float on these things, not once was my feet in agony because of the extra weight, even when running around. YES, these are so light you can run in them.I cannot express how much I love this shoe. The traction on these are also GREAT. This is a great all purpose shoe, I would recommend these to anyone I know!Oh, I am writing this review 8 months into having the shoe and they are still like brand new, I beat these shoes to death and still no ripping of any part of the shoe, the stitching is still holding up great and after this amount of time, they are in the &#34;PRIME&#34; comfy stage. I love these SHOES!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.28646186", "1": "0.20185946", "2": "0.15575385", "3": "0.10817181", "4": "0.07510125", "6": "0.17044048"}}
