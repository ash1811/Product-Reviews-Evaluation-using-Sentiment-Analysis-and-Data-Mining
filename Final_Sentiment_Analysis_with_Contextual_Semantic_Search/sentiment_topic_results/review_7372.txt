{"text": "So, these pants came in.  I ordered these (Bark) and they send me the right size, but in the Loden color.  I give the pants a high 5 because they're exactly what I wanted.  I give the screw-up a bit of a discount on that rating.Past that (and Amazon was awesome about helping), the pants are solid.  Sizing is good.  Roomy.  Crouching and moving around is comfortable.  Big fan.  Good stuff.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1892414", "1": "0.425836", "2": "0.051088996", "3": "0.16315092", "4": "0.081869334", "5": "0.085314855"}}
