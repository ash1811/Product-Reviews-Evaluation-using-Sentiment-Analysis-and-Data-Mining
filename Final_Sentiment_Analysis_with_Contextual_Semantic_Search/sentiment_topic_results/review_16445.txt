{"text": "I order from Amazon all the time and make it a point to read the customer reviews. I had never been disappointed till now. I had been looking for larger sized sunglasses, like all the female stars seem to have. But nothing in the stores seemed to fit the bill. So when I saw so many positive reviews for this item and they were described as \"seriously over sized\" and \"my grandson says I look like a movie star\", and \"they look fabulous\" I thought my search was over.These ARE larger than many. But the style is...well, there is no style. I got the tortoise brown with smoke lenses. The lenses ARE dark as many said and that's a good thing but the frames are so dark that the print barely shows. Instead of looking like a movie star, these make me look like a very large fly. They are awful. I would send them back but it's not worth the return postage for a $12 item.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.1358496", "1": "0.16102986", "2": "0.09630452", "3": "0.14997898", "4": "0.1988768", "5": "0.13346757", "6": "0.12449268"}}
