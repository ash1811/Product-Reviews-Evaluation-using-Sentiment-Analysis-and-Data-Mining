{"text": "I bought this ring for an everyday ring I wear to work. Since I work at an animal hospital I did not want my good weeding band to be ruined or bent while handling the animals. My husband also has a tungsten ring he wears to his job at a warehouse. They are very sturdy and scratch resistant. Plus the rings are very pretty and look brand new even on everyday wear. I would recommend this ring.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11759745", "1": "0.42511857", "2": "0.10689634", "3": "0.08980283", "4": "0.19000427", "6": "0.06706468"}}
