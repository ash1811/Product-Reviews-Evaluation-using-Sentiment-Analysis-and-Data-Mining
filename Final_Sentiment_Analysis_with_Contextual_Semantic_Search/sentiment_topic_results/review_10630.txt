{"text": "I ordered these earrings for my mom's birthday this month and they just came in. Only took about 5-6 days to get here.They came in a small silver box with cotton batting. They were inside a small plastic bag. I took them out and inspected them for quality.They shine beautifully when the light hits them. Clear at times and then a kalidescope of colors at other wave lengths. Really neat feature.  Definately a Swarvoski piece. The leverbacks open and close well and are in alignment. The sterling silver finish has a high gloss and looks great. The length of 1.5\" long is just right for anyone.  I feel these earrings are a great buy - price, quality and final appearance. Even my husband felt these looked much more expensive than they are when I was showing them to him. I am looking forward to wrapping these up and giving them with some other goodies for my mom's big day.These are a great pick for young girls, middle age or older. Quietly sophisticated.Do buy - I think you'll like these too.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.37527567", "1": "0.23781645", "2": "0.061921805", "3": "0.088907965", "4": "0.042643942", "5": "0.060863774", "6": "0.13257039"}}
