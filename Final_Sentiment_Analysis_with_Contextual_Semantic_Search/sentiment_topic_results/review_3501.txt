{"text": "I have worn Playtex bras most of my life, but lately their cups seem oddly made.  Or maybe I am?  The cups give good lift, side support, separation and coverage, but there always seems to be a little excess fabric right at the center of the cup, which makes a very small wrinkle in the cup that shows through clothing. Maybe most women are more pointy than I am, but these are just not the right bra for me.  Otherwise, the fit well and look nice too.  They seem well-made also, which makes it a bigger shame.  Just don't understand the cup design.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.034376834", "1": "0.37028196", "2": "0.03132134", "3": "0.3697418", "4": "0.066697024", "5": "0.053221975", "6": "0.07435909"}}
