{"text": "I ordered the black shirt recently in a size \"small,\" and I thought it would either be too tight or too small. It fits my small body frame like a glove and will keep me warm during the fall and winter months. I'm a long-distance runner that runs daily and I needed something to keep me running during the cold and chilly months. I was surprised after putting it on, because I have very small arms and the sleeves fit perfectly without any loose hanging material. I'm very pleased and cannot wait to use this in a few weeks.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.03560353", "1": "0.38381484", "2": "0.06580453", "3": "0.31264502", "5": "0.042356692", "6": "0.15704842"}}
