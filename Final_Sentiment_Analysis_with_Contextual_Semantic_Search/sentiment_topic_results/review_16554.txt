{"text": "I'm happy to have found this wallet. I would purchase it again in another color when this one wears out. So far it is holding up well after a month of use.  Shipping was slow from this seller but it is worth the wait. the only problem I find is the kisslock clasp that closes the coin purse is really a bugger to open. Not recommended for arthritic fingers or I'd consider getting one for my mom who is forever rummaging through her wallet(s) to find that certain card or coupon. Oh & the snap WILL fasten even with the wallet STUFFED to the max. That's a real plus too!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.040616587", "1": "0.09231057", "2": "0.15289956", "3": "0.209018", "4": "0.32211885", "5": "0.09922157", "6": "0.08381488"}}
