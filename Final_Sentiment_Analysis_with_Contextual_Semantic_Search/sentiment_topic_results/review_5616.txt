{"text": "I bought several of these for my grandson for school. These shirts have a velvety feel to them and are not cheaply made! I am impressed. They are easy-care and fit with enough room to be comfortable (he has a husky build). The sleeves come down past his wrist just enough to cover them unlike some &#34;long-sleeved&#34; polos. They are, in my opinion, bright white and look very nice on him. I had searched the internet for other long-sleeve, white polos and did some math and these came out as the best buy for volume. I think it was an excellent buy. The packaging was secure, delivery fast, and price was great for budget-minded purchasing.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.117952995", "1": "0.2445031", "2": "0.16738139", "3": "0.20226349", "4": "0.09712329", "5": "0.10304022", "6": "0.06773549"}}
