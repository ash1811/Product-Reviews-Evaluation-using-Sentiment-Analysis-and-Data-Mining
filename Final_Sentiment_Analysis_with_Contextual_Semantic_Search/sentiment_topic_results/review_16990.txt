{"text": "I love the look of Celtic jewelry so when I saw this, I love it! It arrived on time and it looks cute! The only thing that's a little different from the picture, it that the picture makes the ring look a little thicker than it really is. But it's still a good quality ring, I wear mine everyday and have no problems. I would recommend to anyone looking for a simple but cute ring", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.17004502", "1": "0.51279914", "3": "0.21403927", "5": "0.060333274", "6": "0.035749417"}}
