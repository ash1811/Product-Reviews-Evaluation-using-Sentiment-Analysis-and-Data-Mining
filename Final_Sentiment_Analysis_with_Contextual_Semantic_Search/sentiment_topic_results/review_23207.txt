{"text": "The size is small, which is a good and a bad thing.  It's easy to carry and light, but the size limits what you can put in it.  I have a bit weight I wanted to put it in and use it for a gym bag, sadly the weight didn't fit.It does have alot of pockets though to carry things in and is overall a nice messanger bag and fits snug around your shoulders.I just wish I would have realized how small it was when I purchased it, because I can't use it for what it's bought for, but I do still use it and don't regret getting it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10696313", "1": "0.5437471", "4": "0.21643896", "6": "0.12420921"}}
