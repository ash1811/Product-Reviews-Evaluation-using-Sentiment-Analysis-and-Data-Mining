{"text": "I'm rather picky about the design of my wallet and that usually makes it very hard to find what I want. A folding, fixed ID holder located on the left side is a must for me. This allows me to place all the truly important credit and debit cards that I use daily in the slots covered by the folded over ID holder. This makes it impossible for them to accidentally fall out, but keeps them readily accessible when I need them. The other cards that I carry but never use can be placed in the inner, less easily accessed compartments and the few cards that wouldn't matter if they fell out and became lost (like store \"rewards\" cards) can be placed on the right side of the wallet.This wallet fits all my criteria in design and the construction appears to be top notch. No loose threads, no sloppy stitching, no unevenly cut material and it's made from soft, buttery feeling leather. Some reviewers have mentioned that this wallet is very thick, but I'd call it average in my experience.It's a real winner!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14263609", "1": "0.15531258", "2": "0.26242656", "3": "0.111582264", "4": "0.13549812", "6": "0.19026376"}}
