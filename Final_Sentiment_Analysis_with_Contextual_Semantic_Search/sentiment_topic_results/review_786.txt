{"text": "Everything everyone has said in the reviews is true. I find this bra unbelievably comfortable. I had decided to give myself the gift of paying just a bit more for this bra, and it is worth every penny. Also glad a saleswoman told me that the cups of the Halo style ran a bit small, and though I'm usually a C cup, to try a D. Perfect. I'll be buying more. One other reviewer said to wash and let air dry to prolong life. I intend to begin doing that, and I also have found a lingerie washing bag helpful.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.028349528", "1": "0.25650904", "2": "0.08827911", "3": "0.23545365", "4": "0.18486221", "5": "0.10123298", "6": "0.10531345"}}
