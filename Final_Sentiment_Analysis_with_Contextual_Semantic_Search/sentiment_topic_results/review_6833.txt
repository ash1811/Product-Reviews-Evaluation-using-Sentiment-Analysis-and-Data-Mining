{"text": "I'll start out by saying, yes this is a little costly. I had thought about not making the purchase due to the price, but in the end felt it would be much easier to handle our car seat while traveling. The straps are thick and padded, easing the strain on ones shoulders. It is helpful for transport from vehicle to airport, then back again. Especially when you are dealing with suitcases and children. We checked our car seat with the airline. When I received it back, there was a large hole in the bag. This was disappointing! But, thankfully I'm not buying another car seat instead. I have a Graco Nautilus 3-In-1 car seat, which I find large and bulky. So as far as size, the travel bag should fit most car seats.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08982652", "1": "0.061721027", "2": "0.20961717", "3": "0.09522241", "4": "0.102895245", "5": "0.2289415", "6": "0.21177615"}}
