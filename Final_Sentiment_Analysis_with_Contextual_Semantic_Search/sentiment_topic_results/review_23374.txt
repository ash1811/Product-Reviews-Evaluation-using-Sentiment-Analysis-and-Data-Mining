{"text": "We've bought a couple of these for skiing and we haven't been disappointed so far. Feet stay significantly warmer, drier and more comfortable with these than they do with cotton socks and they appear to be reasonably durable. We expect them to last for at least two seasons and through many washing cycles. The large (LG) size claims to fit Men's 9-12 and Women's 10-13. They are a little bit on the tight end of fitness but, thanks to the elastic rubber and other synthetic materials in the blend, they can stretch to fit the advertised sizes and still keep their shape.It should be noted that these are not 100% wool socks but they are mostly wool. This is what the manufacturer's official 'contents' statement has:- 67% Merino Woll- 21% Stretch Nylon-- 7% Elastic (rubber)-- 5% AcrylicThe maker, Wigwam Mills, promises to replace any pair of socks within one year of purchase if it's returned with the purchase receipt and a letter explaining why they are returned (no cash refunds).We are happy with the purchase and are likely to buy some more.Oh, and did I mention that these are actually 'Made in the USA'? More exactly, Made in Sheboygan, WI, USA :)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.31961027", "2": "0.14419936", "3": "0.15125418", "4": "0.17027727", "5": "0.16167575", "6": "0.05058041"}}
