{"text": "This was my favorite pair of jeans. Except they got torn.  So I copied the size off the label, an viola!  They were too small. in the waist and thighs..  And not by a little bit either.  I am a 27 length and these appear to measure out correctly.  If I could have sucked it in and lost another inch, I would have kept them.But the material and construction were excellent. Liked the color alot. Liked the style.  Material is heavy, but not as much as the L brand.Return policy was painless, in fact easy.  Not a lot of questions.  Particularly liked the return pick up option by UPS. Worked out the pick up day was the replacement pair delivery dayArrived on time,  Packaged only in oversized plastic bags.  I have already ordered again", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.029295152", "1": "0.17507488", "2": "0.18057166", "3": "0.056491658", "4": "0.32871643", "6": "0.22749937"}}
