{"text": "I have ordered 4 pair of these pants. They work for me very well. There are some variations in them when I order each of them at different times or dates. However the quality has always been good. When I say \"vaiations\" it is in regard to small differences concerning the making of the pants. Two pair of pants have thicker pocket matterial than the other two pair. Two pair have extra pockets that the other two pair did not have. Two pair have realy deep pockets, and the other two pair have \"less\" deep pockets. However, the differences are not in any way a problem for my use of the pants. They also shrink when washing the pants and drying them on a clothes line or in the dryer makes no difference. (The pants shrink) My 42 inch waist pants shrank to around 40 inches around the waist. Even when useing cold water the pants will shrink when they dry. So if you wear 40 inch waist size you should buy 42 size waiste.If 30 inch waist then buy 32 inch waist size or you might be in a tight situation. Great pants over all and good quality.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.10848597", "1": "0.58578753", "3": "0.120260686", "4": "0.041428465", "6": "0.13917448"}}
