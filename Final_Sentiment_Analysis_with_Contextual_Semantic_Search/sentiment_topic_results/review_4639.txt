{"text": "These were my husband's Christmas present and I was really nervous about buying him shoes over the Internet but we live so far away from shopping regions that I had little choice.  Whew!  Not only was the color an accurate depiction, but the size was right.  He hasn't had them long enough yet, though, to comment on how long they will last.  His last pair of deck shoes were made by Bass and they lasted over a decade!  (I looked for some of those and Bass has stopped making this kind...maybe they will resume in the future, but until then these should do.)", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.034302767", "1": "0.15747847", "2": "0.21351168", "3": "0.17985721", "4": "0.16154198", "5": "0.18305652", "6": "0.070251405"}}
