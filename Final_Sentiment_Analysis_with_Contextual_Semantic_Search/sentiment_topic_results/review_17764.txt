{"text": "I already have a G-Shock with atomic timing and solar power, but I really just like number display (I don't like the clock-arm style of my current one), so I gave this one a try. It was disappointing soon after I open the package, since the materials (including the metal knuckle, the plastic band and the metal back) all feel inferior at least one level to my old G-shock.It actually feels more like the $13 Casio watch I bought for my little cousin. I am happy the size and look, but the construction makes me wonder whether it will last.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.29824424", "1": "0.07899583", "2": "0.14977281", "3": "0.12233546", "4": "0.13438515", "5": "0.10775208", "6": "0.108514406"}}
