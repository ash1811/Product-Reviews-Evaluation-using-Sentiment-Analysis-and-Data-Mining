{"text": "Picture posted is of a lace up oxford, this is a Mary Jane pump. The shoe is true to size, wide in the toe area with plenty of wiggle room, good arch support, cushiony interior. It's also good looking, goes with skirts pants and jeans. Note it is not leather, had I known earlier I wouldn't have ordered it since I only wear leather to allow the shoe to conform to my feet. In this case due to all the positives I'm keeping it.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06752149", "1": "0.3286646", "2": "0.17771327", "3": "0.18398784", "4": "0.09858375", "5": "0.113993496", "6": "0.029535515"}}
