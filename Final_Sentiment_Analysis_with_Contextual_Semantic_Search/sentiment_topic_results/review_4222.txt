{"text": "My daughter has lots of super cute bottoms for my eight month old grandson.  They are all gifts, high quality, adorable.  But I felt he would be way more comfortable in something soft and less structured and my daughter agreed.  In my day Buster Brown made the softest baby shorts but I did not see what I wanted on amazon.  As so often happens while searchin I just sort of accidentally stumbled across this set of three pairs on the amazon site. They seemed perfect and the reviews were glowing so I ordered them.  And guess what?  They ARE perfect!!!  I love to see my little buddy in his comfy shorts, he is the cutest!!!  The fabric and the elastic is very soft.  They fit so nicely and there is room to grow.  They do have a tag inside the waistband in  back but my daughter puts a soft cotton onesie on under the shorts so the tag is not an issue, no skin irritation.  Love these little shorts and so wish they came in bigger sizes so we could continue to buy the same as he grows.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.18145458", "1": "0.23506452", "2": "0.03932121", "3": "0.12714933", "4": "0.15986131", "5": "0.17635915", "6": "0.0807899"}}
