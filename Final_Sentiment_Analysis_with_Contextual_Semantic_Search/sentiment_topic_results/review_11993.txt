{"text": "So I realize the description doesn't mention any pockets, but seriously? Not a single one!Other than the lack of a small (and really nice) feature, the bag is great and as described.  A perfect small gym bag to fit my gym clothes, a towel, sneakers, shower flip flops, and basic toiletries.  It isn't overwhelmingly large, but holds everything I need perfectly.Have had it for a few months and use it 5 days a week... no obvious signs of wear so it should hold up well.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.050985813", "1": "0.26042452", "2": "0.20532086", "3": "0.18097639", "4": "0.060188685", "5": "0.09026373", "6": "0.15183996"}}
