{"text": "Flexees -well after my first order to fit me... they came and did not fit.. So i sent back and order the next size.. and I am so happy I did.. These fit perfectly, Exactly as described!!!  Maybe it might be best to order your next larger size..  I really feel that wearing these beautiful[and they really are beautiful] panties, that i go Down ONE size, maybe more--and that is in a straight dress.  NO Tummy or Excess hips..  So pleased  with these Flexees!!!  I know I will be ordering more in the future, and definitely Do recommend them  .ps they do not fit tight, just comfortable..  wish they were less then $12.00 a pair, but they do as they say.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.21261726", "1": "0.3880393", "2": "0.07776736", "3": "0.11636791", "5": "0.05760193", "6": "0.14517234"}}
