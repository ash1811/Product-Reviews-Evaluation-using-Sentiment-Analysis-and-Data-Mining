{"text": "I am very pleased with this made in America waterproof clog.  I am a size 71/2 so I ordered the size 8. They were a little large as I expected; so I just added a cheap insole under the removable footbed in the shoe.  Voila! a good fit with a medium thick sock. I bought these clogs so I could have a shoe to slip on when going out in the backyard with my dog.  We have very heavy dews and a lot of rain.  These work great to keep my feet dry on a &#34;business&#34; tour around the yard.  Very happy with these and I expect to buy  the rain boots as well.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.107663795", "1": "0.29529715", "2": "0.12680277", "3": "0.16799907", "4": "0.1696416", "5": "0.1298707"}}
