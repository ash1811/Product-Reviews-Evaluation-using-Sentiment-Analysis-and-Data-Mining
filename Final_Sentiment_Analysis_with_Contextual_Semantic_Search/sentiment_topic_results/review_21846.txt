{"text": "I was very disappointed the first time I put these on since the cutout is huge!  It is not shown that way in the photo for this product.  Also, as others wrote, they snag and mine got a hole in the toe the 3rd time I wore them so I am back to buy another brand.  Also, after the first washing they shrunk and were then tight in the crotch area, which was odd.  I would suggest buying another brand of crotchless pantyhose.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.15330546", "1": "0.2499368", "3": "0.22089179", "4": "0.19671258", "5": "0.064801276", "6": "0.11091481"}}
