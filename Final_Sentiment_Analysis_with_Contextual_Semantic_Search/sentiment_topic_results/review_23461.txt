{"text": "This is a great watch to add to any collection...the visible Miyota automatic movement is fun to look at, and alot of folks think i'm wearing a Rolex...this is a BEAUTIFUL watch.Nonetheless, as neat as it is to have a mechanical watch, the Miyota 8215 movement requires periodic resetting.  I find that it runs fast, fast enough that I have to reset the time about every other weekend. For that reason, its just a piece for my collection, not a daily wearer.So get the Invicta if you love watches that look great, and tell good enough time.  But, get yourself a Timex or another good quartz watch if you need ACCURATE time.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.36545014", "2": "0.12769628", "4": "0.22224735", "5": "0.14132835", "6": "0.13871937"}}
