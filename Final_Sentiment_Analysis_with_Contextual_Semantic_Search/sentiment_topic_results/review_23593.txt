{"text": "Cozy, warm, big and ideal for those cool days and nights in the house. I used it all winter at my desk and while reading. It's alpaca so it's very soft. I honestly use it every single day at one time or another. It's quite big so provides lots of coverage. This is an excellent product. The color is lovely, too, a deep blue with a sort of soldier blue sheen to it.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.5202905", "2": "0.14181371", "3": "0.056327123", "4": "0.04252678", "5": "0.104431614", "6": "0.13102266"}}
