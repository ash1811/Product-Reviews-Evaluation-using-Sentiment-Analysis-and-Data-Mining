{"text": "I had been searching high & low for a year or two for a comfortable, versatile pair of leather boots under $50. Something to wear with jeans and long skirts. Then I found these on sale for eighteen bucks!After carefully reading reviews, I ordered my regular dress shoe size (8.5M) in the black. It fit perfect for a boot ... Not too tight, not too loose, just right. The heel height is also perfect ... Not too high, not to0 low, just right. The boots are versatile ... Not too casual, not too dressy, just right.Highly recommend these boots. Comfortable shoe, perfect fit, great price.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.39673525", "2": "0.1243993", "3": "0.15397194", "4": "0.16369122", "5": "0.11376326", "6": "0.044971813"}}
