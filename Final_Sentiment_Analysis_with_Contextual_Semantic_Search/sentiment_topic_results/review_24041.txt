{"text": "I own 4 different types of Merrell shoes and sandals and recommend it above any other make for fit and comfort. It is the only make of shoe that I do not have to break in. My sister also owns a few pairs and is just as impressed. The quality is consistently very high and we especially like the custom fit for women.About the Moab: I bought this as a replacement for my Merrell Waterpro Manistees (which sadly have been discontinued). The Moabs are not as airy or cool as the Waterpros and has a higher profile. It is warmer to wear than the Waterpros but gives more protection on top. The Moab is heavier than the Waterpros but still light for what it does. This is important for me as the shoes are mostly used for travel and outdoor. I wear a size 7.5 and the toe box is just right for my wide feet, the lace system is also conducive for high foot bridges. The shoes fit snugly without feeling tight. The Beluga/Lilac colour is versatile enough to fit with most colour pants or shorts without looking too dark but I won a pair in Aluminium/Marlin for lighter colour pants.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.2525365", "1": "0.1916982", "2": "0.10341255", "3": "0.18236293", "4": "0.03408871", "5": "0.12468761", "6": "0.11121352"}}
