{"text": "The shoes I bought were supposed to be the size I wear but, they are to long.  The narrow size is OK but the shoe slides up and down on my heal making them very uncomfortable.  I bought some insoles and heal gaurds and am able to wear them.  The sole of the shoe was thinner than I expected also.  Again with the inserted soles I am able to wear them.Hope others will fair better with theirs, although I think I will buy a cheaper pair next time maybe they will fit better.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.25297773", "2": "0.22129585", "3": "0.18962677", "4": "0.074607044", "5": "0.25538346"}}
