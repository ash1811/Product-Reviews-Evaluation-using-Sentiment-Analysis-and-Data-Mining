{"text": "I bought this for my son to start preschool.  Boy was I bummed when a week later I got a letter saying that only tote bags were allowed at the preschool!  I decided to keep the backpack anyway.  We use it for overnight trips to grandmas house.  It's definitely a preschool sized backpack, but it will fit papers, etc (or jammies and toothbrushes, as the case may be;)  He loves his motorcycle backpack, and though it only gets light use with us, it seems really well made.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.030410564", "1": "0.26342422", "2": "0.2480795", "3": "0.17874494", "4": "0.17810749", "6": "0.09837053"}}
