{"text": "After 2 washing holes have started to appear in the legs.  Very, very thin fabric.  Think it's time to stay away from Levis. Definitly do not order them online.  The unpredictability of the quality and fit makes it imperative to buy in a store where you can try them on and feel the fabric.  I order 3 pair and each one is different in quality and fit.  Levi's has outsourced by buying of their product; won't bother with them in the future.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09320634", "1": "0.2997316", "2": "0.12148683", "4": "0.089152284", "5": "0.25722158", "6": "0.13568445"}}
