{"text": "I absolutely LOVED Kinvara 2. I was disappointed it was discontinued when I was looking for a new pair. After talking to a friend who went from Kinvara 2 to Kinvara 4, I decided to try Kinvara 3 instead of 4. A few months later I needed another pair to leave it at work so I can run after work, and this time I got Kinvara 4 and had a pleasant surprise. They feel much more like Kinvara 2 than 3! The soles feel a bit stiffer than 2 to me, but have the same toe room, and less permeable of cold air.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.31113985", "1": "0.2529006", "2": "0.048224907", "3": "0.21148507", "5": "0.078050256", "6": "0.095642075"}}
