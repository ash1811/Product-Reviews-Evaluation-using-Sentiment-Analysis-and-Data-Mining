{"text": "I have many of these. I use them for scarves in the fall and winter and they are great to take on trips. They are lightweight and smooth which is my preference.  When I saw these items from Sakkas on Amazon I wondered if they would be the same quality as the ones I've bought locally and to my delight they were!  For a very reasonable price, you get a beautiful shawl/scarf.  I love the turquoise/black.  Stunning!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.13186125", "1": "0.36812106", "2": "0.06956844", "3": "0.1342629", "4": "0.17823859", "5": "0.06339704", "6": "0.0545507"}}
