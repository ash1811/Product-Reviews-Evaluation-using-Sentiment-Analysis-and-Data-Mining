{"text": "I am 5ft4, 125 lbs, and I bought a size small. I think it fits true to size. I like these bike shorts, but I don't love them, because the cotton doesn't really wick sweat away like a poly blend or sport fabric would have. I don't think it breathes very well either; I often feel too warm when I am wearing these. I still think these are good given the low price though.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.092779525", "1": "0.36031386", "2": "0.09586051", "3": "0.31594193", "4": "0.0742874", "6": "0.05754932"}}
