{"text": "I really love this swim diaper for my 11 month old. I had some Finis swim diapers for my 2 year old son last year, but they were too narrow in the crotch for my (bigger) baby girl this summer so I ordered these and they are perfect. I would recommend these over the Finis because of the width of the crotch and side snaps. When you have a poopy swim diaper, it is easier to have the snaps to remove rather than pulling it down. The elastic is snug, but not too tight, just perfect to hold in messes.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.06974415", "1": "0.16916874", "2": "0.03528305", "3": "0.059435032", "4": "0.24444935", "5": "0.37016898", "6": "0.051750712"}}
