{"text": "I love, love, love these earrings.  I was looking for something small and round but more unique than just a ball. These are adorable. Size is great, 4.5mm, and works well on the lobe even if you have multiple piercings. My ears can be sensitive but did not have a problem with these. Sterling silver and white gold are usually a safe bet for me. The backs stay on well, I sleep in them all the time. Have never had them fall out. I have received a few compliments on them also. I would recommend these to anyone looking for something small and unique.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.16695186", "1": "0.29485902", "2": "0.057252083", "3": "0.17909594", "4": "0.14821136", "5": "0.10918914", "6": "0.0444406"}}
