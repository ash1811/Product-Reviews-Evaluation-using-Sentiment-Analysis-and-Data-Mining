{"text": "I really love these, I finally have a pair again. They haven't changed at all and that's good, I like that they haven't messed with it. Although they do have more conventional styles of shoes for those who won't go the way of tradition. I had a pair of these when I was a teenager. I used to wear them with shorts, skirts, jeans. They make this wonderful wooden clopping sound when walking, which is fun in itself. Your toes will grip the front to keep them from sliding off. Which brings up a point...if they slip off while you're walking or in a fast stride it's gonna hurt like nobody's business. I've had that happen a few times in my day and it is very painful. But I survived. Ya live and learn.
