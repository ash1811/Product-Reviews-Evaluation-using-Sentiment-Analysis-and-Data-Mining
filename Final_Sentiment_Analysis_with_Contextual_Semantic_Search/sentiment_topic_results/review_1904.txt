{"text": "It took two tries to get the right size in these, but I finally got it right. I normally wear 11C/D, but ended up having to go up to 11E to get these to fit comfortably. I'm SUPER happy with them now.I got the &#34;blue suede&#34; color -- but they're really a smoky gray, which is just fine. It's neutral enough I can wear it with my black trousers or my denim jeans and they look great. The sole has the &#34;nubby&#34; super-grippy stuff, plus a deeply ribbed texture under the heel, which means minimal slippage, important at my more advanced stage of life.And comfortable? Oh my, YES! They're about as close to perfect as I could hope. Cloud soft -- great for weekend running around. They don't provide the kind of support I would want for extensive walking/sight-seeing, but for casual wear doing normal day-to-day errands and relaxing around the house, they're just right. They may stretch a bit, but the tie is adjustable, so I should be able to compensate for that.VERY happy with these, and will probably purchase another pair in a different color.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"1": "0.27927524", "2": "0.064305015", "3": "0.18395762", "4": "0.046350047", "5": "0.14368789", "6": "0.28034356"}}
