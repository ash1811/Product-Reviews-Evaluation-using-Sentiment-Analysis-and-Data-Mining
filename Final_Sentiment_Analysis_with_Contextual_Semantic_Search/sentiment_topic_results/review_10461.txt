{"text": "I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife, who was in desperate need of a new pair of slippers.  I wanted to get her a high-quality pair that were very warm and comfortable, and would hold up to lots of abuse while taking the dog into the backyard.  These UGG Dakotas served those requirements perfectly!  First of all, they look amazing...and my wife immediately liked them.  When she put them on, she absolutely fell in love with them.  They are very warm, lined with lamb's wool.  Most importantly, they are well constructed and sturdy.  I see them lasting a very long time.  While they are not cheap, they are definitely worth the price.  Highly recommended!", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16450125", "1": "0.272069", "2": "0.16067933", "3": "0.14756426", "4": "0.14914705", "6": "0.10364466"}}
