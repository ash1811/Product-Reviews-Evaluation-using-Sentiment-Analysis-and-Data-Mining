{"text": "While this shoe is very comfy, I consider it one of my heaviest shoes. It's quite soft from the inside and hard from the outside but it's really bulky (at least for me) It's more of a boot. I wouldn't say it looks really elegant cause the rubber is too shiny and honestly I've been wearing classier shoes. While I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is looking for a light elegant slip on, I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't really care about the previous 2 points but really cares about comfort and rigidity.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.30939403", "1": "0.20737736", "2": "0.23796076", "3": "0.068060435", "4": "0.045421697", "6": "0.12886333"}}
