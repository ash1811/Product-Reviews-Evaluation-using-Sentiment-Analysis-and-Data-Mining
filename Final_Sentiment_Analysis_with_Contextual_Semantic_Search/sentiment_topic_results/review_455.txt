{"text": "If you normally buy Levi's and say you wear a size 18 or 20 in those, although the equivalent size for a 20 is this 30x30, they just don't fit.  They're REALLY small around the waist (waist measures a 29.5 but these pants are a 30 and they're STILL too small!), and they're big in the seat and thighs.  Most guys have large thighs so for the catcher in this house, thought these would do the trick.  Well, they don't.  Don't have a clue why the waist is so off but he can't get these buttoned.  He wears a size 18 in Levi's.So, that said, these run really small.  However, they looked like he had a sack on in the rear and in his thighs.  Very strange experience.  The jeans themselves are very, very nice, which is one reason I'm sad they don't work.  Would LOVE to keep them but these are just off the mark completely.  I do recommend them since they're the upscale ones compared to the junk Walmart sells, but keep the sizing in mind when ordering.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.052964494", "1": "0.21020935", "2": "0.13264702", "3": "0.20972137", "4": "0.24590987", "6": "0.14616121"}}
