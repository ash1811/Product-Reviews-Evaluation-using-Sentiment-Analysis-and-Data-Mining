{"text": "hello,i must have worn millions of sandals over my lifetime, but these montrail molokai sandals are the most comfortable, ever!  i have wide feet, but this sandal fits like a glove with no restrictions or bindings.  the strap that goes over your arch is so soft and comfortable that it doesn't feel like anything is on your feet.  the sole of the sandal gives good grip, but on a waxed floor, it squeeks a lot.  walking around outside, it does not squeek.  the sandal is very soft and comfortable.  it feels like it is molding to my feet as i walk on it.  i know it is supposed to be heated to mold to your feet, but so far, it doesn't seem necessary.  my feet feel like they are surrounded by soft pillows and it makes walking that much more comfortable. the arch is great. the sandals seem like it is just soft rubber, which is basically correct, but the design that went into making these puts it on the top of my list of comfortable sandals.  i have owned reef sandals, (fanning and leather fanning) several sperry santa cruz,etc, all kinds of rainbows, several cheepies and all of the other ones are either break easily, are too narrow, or bind somewhere.  these montrail's are the best so far.  you can't go wrong... the delivery was great, but the packaging was a little overkill.update:they are still the most comfortable sandals ever.  but, after wearing them for a long period of time during the day, they have developed an interesting squeek from the soles.  the soles are super grippy and on polished tiles, mall marble floors and smooth wooden floors creates an unusual squeek.  on carpeting, no noise is prevalent.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.04120826", "1": "0.28079975", "2": "0.1800219", "3": "0.07765664", "4": "0.1968979", "5": "0.04487804", "6": "0.1785375"}}
