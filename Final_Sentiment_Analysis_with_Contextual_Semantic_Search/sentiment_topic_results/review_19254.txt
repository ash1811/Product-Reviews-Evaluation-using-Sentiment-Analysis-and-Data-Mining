{"text": "I've been using this wallet for a few months, now.  My wallets take a beating and this one only looks nicer and, more supple, with use.  I still have not utilized all the card slots and compartments, because there are so many of them.  Actually, so many of them, that if you filled them all up at once, it might take some time to remember where you put everything.I purchased the tan version and it looks exactly like the picture.  There's space for photos, credit cards, checkbook and register, coins, cash,  and lots of little places to stash receipts, shopping lists, coupons, etc.  It's really all you would need for a quick run to the grocery, or for many other errands when you don't want to lug a purse.I think the price is a steal for the workmanship and organizational ability of this wallet.  That said, I have plans to keep this item on my potential gift list for friends and family.  It arrives ready for gifting, in a nice Mundi box, wrapped in tissue paper. It looks every bit worth the retail price.  Remember to take that little retail tag off of the item before gift giving.The wallet is stamped 'genuine leather' and it definitely has the look and feel of real leather.  I was a little concerned with the strong smell when I first opened the box --- a chemical smell.  I suspect this could be from the leather dye, but I'm not sure.  I left it to air out for a while and it eventually dissipated.  If gifting,  think I would do this first.Also remember that for a wallet to have all these functions, it has to be large, and it is rather heavy.  It will take up a lot of real estate in your handbag.  If you're one who likes to carry small, over the shoulder handbags, this might not work out well for you.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.11335645", "1": "0.19970778", "2": "0.19746919", "3": "0.1834301", "4": "0.10673758", "5": "0.10617609", "6": "0.09312283"}}
