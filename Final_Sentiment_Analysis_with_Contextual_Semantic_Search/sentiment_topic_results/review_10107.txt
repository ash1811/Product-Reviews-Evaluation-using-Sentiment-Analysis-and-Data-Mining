{"text": "I wear these instead of panty hose. I favor the light toast or black shades. Unlike panty hose, if sized properly and laundered per the manufacturers instructions these last a very long time without getting runs or holes. In fact, I have had these for over two years and an still wearing them.While I wear these with all sorts of outfits and they look very nice, it's when you can't see them that they are most appreciated. I wear them under my jeans, trousers, etc. for an extra layer of warmth in winter. These come in handy because I live in a an area that is in a snow belt of Lake Michigan and it gets really cold.My only advice is to go up one size on these. I should wear size B, but I buy these in C. The larger size allows for a little give in the crotch and waist area and isn't as form fitting.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20933597", "1": "0.2785189", "2": "0.13165674", "3": "0.11562071", "4": "0.11798707", "5": "0.14449568"}}
