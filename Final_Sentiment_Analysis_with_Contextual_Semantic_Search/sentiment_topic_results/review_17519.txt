{"text": "A very nice and nice looking watch.The only complaint is that the band is hard to adjust (look at other reviews to learn how) and the LED is hard to read when hands are in front of it. Also, the lighting doesn't work all that well; it is very dim and you can tell the time, but just barely.If you like the look of an analog watch with the functions of a digital, this is a good choice.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.26568797", "1": "0.3863913", "2": "0.11860507", "3": "0.089309424", "4": "0.094082", "6": "0.04183362"}}
