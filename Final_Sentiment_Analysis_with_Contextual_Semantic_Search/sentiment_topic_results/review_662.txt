{"text": "My first pair of sandals was a real vintage pair I snagged from an estate sale. They were too small for my feet but I wore them for years, they never broke, my parents had to throw them away because I guess they were pretty ugly by then.My newest pair was the white. The buckle tarnished quickly and the leather became dirty soon, so I will next purchase a darker shade.The suede on the interior lining (across the top of your foot), is going to blister you. I tried using a suede brush to sand it down a bit. This also helped with the evening out of the shoes, because due to differences in the leather one was hard and stiff, the other was soft.I also used these at the beach quite a bit, and the white color cracked. I tried to use white polish to fix it, but that ended up sticking to the brass screws on the side. Now they look pretty tacky. But they are easy to wear.Wear them enough to get used to them and you will find them to be easy to wear with anything, except maybe a formal dinner (but depending on your dress, u may be able to pull it off).The size is easy to figure out. I can't say I notice if they are slightly too big or too small. Make sure you tighten them up enough so that you don't step out of them, because that can cause some mega hurt, in my experiance. Also they may knock up against your nubs on the sides of your ankle.But all in all, these are the classic sandal that won't go out of style. They spoiled me and now I find it very hard to wear uncomfortable shoes, no matter how cool they look.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.30936503", "1": "0.0684848", "2": "0.1693821", "3": "0.22959712", "4": "0.1211301", "5": "0.053904552", "6": "0.048136342"}}
