{"text": "As other people have said, these are definitely \"rigid\" jeans. For me it is not to the point of being uncomfortable. I've been wearing them for about 2 weeks now and don't notice. Because of the price ($15 a pair) I bought two pair. I am 6'5\", average build, and normally have to pay a lot of money for jeans. I purchased 44x30 and they fit great with the exception that the crotch on these is a little low. Other than that I have no complaints. Because of the dark color and low price I was a little worried about the jeans \"bleeding\" onto my white shoes (has happened with other jeans before), but thankfully I have not had any problem with this. If I had known that these would work out so well, I probably would have bought 4 pairs at $15 each. If you are taller than average and looking for a decent pair of jeans for a good price, these are definitely a great option.Pros:-GREAT price for tall jeans-Durable-2 weeks in and no color bleedingCons:-Very rigid when you first get them-Crotch is a little lower than other jeans of the same size.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.106160946", "1": "0.31683573", "2": "0.09065134", "3": "0.20180066", "4": "0.09049082", "5": "0.14799401", "6": "0.046066497"}}
