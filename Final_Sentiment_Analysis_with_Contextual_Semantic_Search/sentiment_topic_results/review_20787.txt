{"text": "I have enjoyed one of these hoodies for the past two years and I thought I would like to have a second one.  I ordered the exact same size (2XL Regular) and I found that it is slightly smaller than the original one.  Also, it feels slightly lighter in weight.  If you like a loose fit like I do, then you may want to go up one size, as it appears that these hoodies are now being cut slightly smaller all over.  Now, that aside, this is still the best hoodie I have ever worn and it is my favorite and I wear it all day long.  If you purchase this product, you will love it as long as you get the size you need.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.22719482", "2": "0.1337639", "3": "0.17350559", "4": "0.05535173", "5": "0.21086466", "6": "0.19684966"}}
