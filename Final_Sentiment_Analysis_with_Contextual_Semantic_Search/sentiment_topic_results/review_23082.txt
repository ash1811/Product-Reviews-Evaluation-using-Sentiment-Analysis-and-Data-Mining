{"text": "I'm 31, and recently had skin cancer removed from my back. It was time for me to get serious about protecting my skin from the sun, so I started researching some products that would help with that. In researching hats, I wanted a wide enough brim to actually protect my face, something that would stay on if it was windy (beach, kayaking, etc), and something that didn't look too horribly unfashionable. This hat had good reviews, it had a lot of color choices, and it seemed to fit my needs. I got it in the mail and tried it on - fits well and will definitely stay on with the chin strap. Let's be real though - this thing is not fashionable!!! I got it in white which I felt would be one of the least-ugliest colors, and it isn't bad. I tried on some other hats that looked a lot worse/more geeky. But hey, I'm not buying the hat to win a fashion contest, I'm buying it to do a job, and I think it'll do it. Once I actually start using it in the sun (still winter here in the Mid-Atlantic) I'll post an update.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"1": "0.3485388", "2": "0.05306948", "3": "0.08050465", "4": "0.23501742", "5": "0.19394538", "6": "0.086616166"}}
