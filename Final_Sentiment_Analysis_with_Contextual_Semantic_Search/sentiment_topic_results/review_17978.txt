{"text": "This watch is easy to take care of and looks professional.  I like wearing my watch all the time, I don't want to have to take it off at night.  With leather or fabric straps, you have to make sure they don't get wet.  This watch has rubber straps so that isn't an issue.  My husband had this watch first and I loved it so much, I ordered one for myself.  It is larger than traditional women's watches but I like having a large watch face so I can easily read the time.  The price is great and my husband has had his watch for 2 years without issue.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.090060174", "1": "0.33970785", "2": "0.33845696", "3": "0.11640653", "4": "0.07232667", "5": "0.04028506"}}
