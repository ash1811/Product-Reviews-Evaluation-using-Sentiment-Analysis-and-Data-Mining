{"text": "Comfy slippers but not the bee's knees. They do run small; my size 9.5 foot is still searching for some more room in the size 10 slippers I bought.  I'm sure it will stretch in time with wear. Oddly, these are made in that place that starts with the letter \"C\" and ends with an \"A\" (not California).  Had I known, I would have spent a few more $$$ to buy from a US source.  One annoying aspect is an extremely poorly placed tag on the inside of the shoe, at the instep (where the elastic band is on the side) that rubs.  Again, I imagine the discomfort will lessen over time with wear.  I view these as slippers, and would not wear these outside.  Perhaps to fetch the newspaper or the mail in my robe, but not when I leave the house.  Unless I want the absent-minded look...  I am keeping them, but there have to be better and more comfortable choices than these.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.0516723", "1": "0.14751168", "2": "0.15485018", "3": "0.09707502", "4": "0.17968278", "5": "0.14285502", "6": "0.22635299"}}
