{"text": "When I got out of the navy in 1966 I really wanted a different style of Clark's shoes.  Unfortunately, they way the sole was made, they didn't fit my feet.  I didn't even consider the Wallabee at the time; too funky.  Now much older, I wanted a comfortable pair of shoes.  Fashion be damned, these feel great on my feet and when they wear out I'll order another pair!  I'd rather they weren't made in China; but that's a much better choice than India or Viet Nam as other manufacturers have chosen.  These are well made and should last a long time.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.24208868", "1": "0.2961831", "2": "0.06593124", "3": "0.17861423", "4": "0.071188375", "5": "0.097946785", "6": "0.04804759"}}
