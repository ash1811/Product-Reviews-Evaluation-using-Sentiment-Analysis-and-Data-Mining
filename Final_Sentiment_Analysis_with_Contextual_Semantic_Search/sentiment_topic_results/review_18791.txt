{"text": "The watch itself is great. Very simple yet very pretty! It will go with anything (unless you wear gold, I guess). It's comfortable and easy to read. A somewhat bigger face without actually being BIG. Nice and light. Seems durable, too. Indiglo feature looks nice and so far I'm very pleased!My only complaint is that it comes so BIG. If you have the right tools, you can remove links yourself. Or you can buy a link removal kit.. they're cheap but why would I want one? Just more stuff to clutter up my house.. Some people said they got theirs adjusted for free at a jeweler but every place near me said it was only free if you bought it there. I ended up going to a chain jewelry store and they charged me $20. The cost of that plus the cost of this watch is still less than some other watches that I considered buying so I'm okay with it, it's just inconvenient. I would have given this 5 stars if it came a big smaller. I don't have especially small wrists so I just don't get why it came so large!Also, just wanted to add that over time, it has started to bother me that the clasp will sometimes pop open when hit just right. Sometimes, I'll just be getting out of my car and the clasp will somehow hit something just so it opens. Annoying! I think it is just something that will happen with this kind of band but I didn't anticipate it being an issue originally.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.09708322", "1": "0.32482103", "2": "0.20084007", "3": "0.24300492", "4": "0.08594597", "6": "0.046097163"}}
