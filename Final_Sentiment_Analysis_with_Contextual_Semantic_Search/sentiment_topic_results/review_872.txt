{"text": "I was a little skeptical when thinking about spending this kind of money on a pair of flip flops, but the reviews were there and I went for it.  I am very happy that I did.  They are much more comfortable than the average cheap-o flat footed flip flop, higher quality and look nice.  I wear them all the time and would recommend them to anyone.  I am normally a 10.5 and went with an 11.0 on these.  I am happy that I did because they fit perfectly.", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.21919331", "1": "0.4641222", "2": "0.14532585", "5": "0.13031636", "6": "0.033865042"}}
