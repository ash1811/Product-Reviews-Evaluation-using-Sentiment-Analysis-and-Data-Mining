{"text": "I love my levis anytime I need jeans I always grab a pair of these. They last long I can wash them a million times and they're super comfortable.  I should have ordered them one size smaller though since I'm loosing weight and all they are a tad too big lol but I guess it was a smart decision just in case I gain a few. Even though I chose the 5-8 business day shipping meathod they arrived in 3 days, probably because I ordered them before 6pm and it was a Monday. Anyways I'm a big fan of levis and I'm in the process of updating my wardrobe and these jeans will be the only pants in my closet because nothing else compares.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14873831", "1": "0.2512974", "2": "0.10059127", "3": "0.068219885", "4": "0.24719264", "5": "0.056232795", "6": "0.1277277"}}
