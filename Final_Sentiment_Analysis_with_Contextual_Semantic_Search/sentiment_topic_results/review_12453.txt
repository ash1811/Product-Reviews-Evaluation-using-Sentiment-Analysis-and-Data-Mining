{"text": "My original review comes first, then the current review that prompted me to change the rating from five to two stars.I don't do well with thong-type sandals.  Teva makes a style I can wear, but that's about it.  I tried the Sanuks after seeing the rave reviews here, and I'm delighted with my purchase!Most thongs in my experience hurt and cause blisters between my toes.  My foot slides around, and I feel like it wouldn't be hard to twist an ankle from slipping off the footbed.  The Sanuks feel comfortable and secure.  I've worn them on and off since I bought them in August, and there's almost no wear on the soles.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy this brand again.EDIT in August 2012:  I bought another pair of these sandals and I'm very disappointed.  I can wear them for a short period and a little bit of walking, but then they start to irritate my feet.  The straps are stiff compared to the pair I bought last year, so sadly, I'm joining the reviewers that say these sandals are not what they used to be.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.13442953", "1": "0.18243876", "2": "0.14394799", "3": "0.23937927", "5": "0.1658982", "6": "0.13166657"}}
