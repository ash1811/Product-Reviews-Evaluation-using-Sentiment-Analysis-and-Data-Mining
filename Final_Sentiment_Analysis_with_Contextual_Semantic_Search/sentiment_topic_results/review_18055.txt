{"text": "The watch face is great for me: small enough to fit on a small wrist and large enough for me to see the numbers and letters. The date should be on the face rather than having to push one of the buttons and there is no backlight. The watch band, however, is awful, terrible, a disaster!!! This is not a watch that I can grab and put on in a minute; it usually takes me five. I must really like the watch because I am willing to fuss with it. It is not an expansion band even though it looks like it and the locking mechanism is a terrible piece of engineering. I'm keeping the watch even though I didn't give it 5 stars.Addition to my original review: I have had the watch less than six months and the clasp no longer works. DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH! It is trouble and isn't worth the effort to wear it.I should have returned it when I could. A big waste of money.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.107323825", "1": "0.23486978", "2": "0.25925887", "3": "0.1301746", "4": "0.17508112", "6": "0.09081008"}}
