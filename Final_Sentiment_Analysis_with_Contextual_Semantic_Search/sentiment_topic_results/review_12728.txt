{"text": "I ordered this Od vintage and the pink camo. I was so excited that I had selected the 2-day shipping only to be disappointed. I am 5'2\" and 125lbs and I ordered XS and it was still big for me. I got it today and going to ship it back tomorrow. Just to let you know that there's no exchange available for these items from this company. refund only. so I made a new order on XXS size. I hope this size fits better. Oh yeah, one more thing, first time I ordered theses 2 pants, combined 2-day shipping was a $10.97. 2nd time I ordered the same items but different sizes, shipping cost doubled. I decided to only get the Od vintage with 2 -day shipping and it cost me $8.98 on shipping. Feels like I got ripped off :(", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.08195209", "1": "0.33398595", "2": "0.17650168", "3": "0.13712054", "4": "0.09737897", "6": "0.17092358"}}
