{"text": "I have to give these 5 starts because for the price they are great. If I paid more I wouldn't be pleased. These do not look or feel like expensive glasses. However, they work and they're cute and if they get broken then I won't be heartbroken. They are also very light which I like because I tend to get headaches from glasses. The lenses are pretty dark, great for driving, but not so great if you are walking around at an outside venue and needing to look at things. I found myself having to constantly take them off so I could see things. That being said, when these get broken or lost, I'll be back for more.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.14652799", "1": "0.44437894", "2": "0.045360297", "3": "0.055690967", "4": "0.12947653", "5": "0.11087807", "6": "0.06768722"}}
