{"text": "They sounded so pretty and came so highly recommended, I decided to order these and was surprised to discover they are even prettier than I thought they would be!  Love that kind of surprise.  They are dainty without appearing delicate, real eye catchers!  The turquoise has a rich lustre, the crystal elements in clear, solid black and clear turquoise all sparkle, and the little nobbed bead above the turquoise is a perfect compliment.  The lever back silver mounting is good quality as well. These little earrings are just gorgeous and I'm thrilled with them.  Can't beat the price either.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.16480812", "1": "0.221124", "2": "0.10453481", "3": "0.12953661", "4": "0.21708581", "6": "0.16048175"}}
