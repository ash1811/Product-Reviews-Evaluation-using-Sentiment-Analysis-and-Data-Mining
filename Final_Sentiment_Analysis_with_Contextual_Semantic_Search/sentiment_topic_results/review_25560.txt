{"text": "This is a \"REAL DEAL\" item meant for work and harsh weather. I mention this because there are many duster/drover types of coats that are built only for the \"I wanna look like a cowboy\" appearance. This one is really meant to go the distance. If you want it for \"the look\", it has definitely got it. If you want it for workwear it will exceed your expectations! I admit I got it slightly cheaper on an equine supply website. After owning it, I would gladly pay the price on here, if I couldn't find it elsewhere cheaper. It is well worth every penny. It is RAIN/SNOW WEATHER ARMOR without a doubt! I did immediately take it to the carwash and sprayed it down using the gentle setting to help alleviate the smell of the \"waterproofer\". It has a great tried-n-true tested design. The reason dusters/drovers looks haven't changed much is because the design WORKS. The high collar, and double layer front snaps really add to the water protection. The under-arm straps keep the cape from flipping up in high winds. Inside, the snap around leg straps come in handy when riding horseback or doing tasks that require kneeling or squatting, when you don't want the coat to uncover your legs. The arms are roomy and non-restricting, but do have an extra set of snaps on the cuff, in case you want to tighten them up. Elbow sections are reinforced with a double layer. The outside pockets are double sectioned meaning it has hand pockets that enter from the side and item pockets that enter from the top, protected by a flap cover (I do wish the top entry pockets had zipper or snap closure underneath the flaps). It also has 2 large inside pockets with zippers. It is fairly warm with room for more warming clothing underneath. It is a good looking coat for sure. I have received many complements on it! My only question is, when will the company come out with a \"thinsulate\" model? Pair this up with a matching waterproof Outback Trading Kodiak Hat and you have got some great outer wear!", "sentiment": "positive", "topics": {"0": "0.101985104", "1": "0.23181292", "2": "0.17978017", "3": "0.18476321", "4": "0.058906477", "5": "0.09368685", "6": "0.14906526"}}
