{"text": "The watch looks great.  It could take a pounding and keep going.  Price is Okay and it got here in good time.  It has 5 alarms, hourly chime, and other sounds if only you could hear it.  I'm not kidding that Casio has messed up on just about every new watch that is coming out.  You have to have the thing next to your ear to even hear it.  I have an old watch which sits on the table about 20 feet from me.  I lost the instructions, so now every day at 3:20 pm the damn thing goes off. Loud and clear for about 2 1/2 minutes unless I get my lazy butt up and push a button.  Anyway, if you don't need the alarm, then go for it.  The buttons that are hard to push was not a big deal for me.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.23435585", "1": "0.16563734", "2": "0.19001092", "3": "0.07302499", "4": "0.08809633", "5": "0.083855785", "6": "0.16501881"}}
