{"text": "SWMBO (She Who Must Be Obeyed) bought a pair for me over a year ago and they're still going strong!  They were even comfortable yesterday morning when I went up to the street for the paper with the temperature in the teens.  They are well made, have good soles for light outdoor use, and fit well even though I have big (12W) feet.  Definately a repeat purchase if (when) these ever wear out.Also, you can roll the cuffs up if your ankles are a little cool.", "sentiment": "negative", "topics": {"0": "0.20526578", "1": "0.2932522", "2": "0.10133341", "3": "0.19686626", "4": "0.17288478", "6": "0.027410999"}}
