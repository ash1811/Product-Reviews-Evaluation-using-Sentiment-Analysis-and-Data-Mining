## Introduction
Ecommerce website contains massive amount of reviews and feedbacks and because of this manufacturers could analyze these to determine the overall reviews about their goods on different aspects such as prices, effectiveness, etc., in order to assist them with deciding on what could be done to improve the quality of their product. But this is merely impossible to achieve if there’s huge amount of reviews.


## Project Overview
Recent advances in Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence had improved algorithms to analyse textual information. Together with the advancement of the internet and mobility, the amount of feedback of users towards a product had drastically increased. In this project I will devise a mechanism that can make use of these huge amount of data to determine if the user's emotional tone towards a product is either positive or negative and to extract the topic or aspect of the product that is being discussed.
